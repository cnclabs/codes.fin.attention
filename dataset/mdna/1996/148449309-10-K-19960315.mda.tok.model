item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general until august  the company was involved in only one segment of the petroleum industry oil and gas exploration and production  including the administration of related oil and gas partnerships 
at that time the company made a material investment in the refining segment of the petroleum industry by acquiring the indian refinery in august the indian refinery commenced operation in november and  as a result  refining operations first impacted the company in the fiscal year ended september  on december   the company acquired from arco the lone star contract  a mile intrastate gas pipeline located in rusk county  texas and majority working interests in producing oil and gas wells for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million including liabilities assumed and transaction costs 
as a result of this acquisition  the company entered a third segment of the oil and gas business natural gas transmission and marketing 
in june  the company sold its business of administration of oil and gas partnerships to a former officer of the company 
the former officer rejoined the company in november nevertheless  through its ownership of non partnership oil and gas properties  including those acquired from arco  the company remained active in the oil and gas exploration and production segment of the oil and gas business 
as of october   the company acquired powerine  which owned a  b d refinery in santa fe springs  california 
the results of operations of powerine are included in the refining segment commencing october  the acquisition of powerine increased the dominance of refining in the company s consolidated operations 
most of the company s acquisitions were financed by mg  which was also the principal shareholder of the company until september many of the company s transactions were with mg or its subsidiaries see footnote to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
in december  the financial press reported that mg ag and mg had incurred substantial losses related to hedging activities 
thereafter  mg sought to restructure or terminate its relationships with the company and its subsidiaries 
in august  the company entered into the mg settlement 
the mg settlement closed on october  see footnote to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
as a result of the mg settlement  the company realized a million gain and mg returned to the company all of the company s stock that it owned 
the company began to explore its options for dealing with its refining operations before and during the negotiation of the mg settlement 
the company considered a number of alternatives  ranging from continuing refining operations on substantially the same basis as prior to the mg settlement  but obtaining new working capital financing and a new customer base  to selling or closing the refineries 
the company believed  however  that it would need to raise substantial new equity for the payment of its income taxes  in addition to raising the working capital financing for the refineries  if it decided to continue refinery operations 
further  continuing the refinery operations would require the company to add significant marketing personnel  expertise and expense 
on the other hand  closing the refineries would result in substantial shut down costs  including severance obligations to employees and potential environmental clean up costs  although it would allow the company to write off the costs of its refineries to substantially reduce its taxes 
based upon these factors  the company sought to sell its refining operations 
as of december   the company had written down its refining assets to their estimated net realizable values and booked accruals for anticipated closing costs 
the first quarter impairment reserve of  was revised in the third and fourth quarters based on changes in facts and circumstances 
for the year ended september   the company recorded impairment reserves of  during the period october  to september   the company sought to sell both refineries 
an initial attempt to sell both refineries and then additional attempts to sell one refinery to management failed because of the lack of financing and market conditions 
the company believes that the filing of a lawsuit by shell canada limited shell against irlp during financing negotiations contributed to this failure see item to this form k 
liabilities  if any  resulting from the lawsuit were later assumed by american western 
during the spring  summer and fall of  the company sought to sell the refineries separately 
although several agreements were negotiated  the potential purchasers were not able to raise the financing required 
in september an effort to sell the indian refinery to core refining corporation  a company formed by william sudhaus  an executive officer and director of the company core  failed when core s investment banker failed to perform in raising a substantial amount of debt 
as a result of continued failure to sell the refineries  the company caused operations at each refinery to cease 
operations at the powerine refinery ceased in july and operations at the indian refinery ceased in september on september   the company sold the powerine refinery to kenyen 
kenyen has advised the company that it plans to dismantle the refinery and ship it to india 
on january   powerine merged into a subsidiary of emc 
as a result of the transactions with kenyen and emc  the company no longer owns any interest in powerine 
on september   the indian refinery ceased operations and retired its assets 
on december   irlp sold the indian refinery to american western  a wholly owned subsidiary of gadgil for million 
million was paid in cash  the remaining million represented by a note is payable the earlier of a gadgil s raising of financing to restart the refinery b october  the note is secured by the refining plant 
in addition  american western assumed certain liabilities of irlp  including all environmental liabilities 
irlp  however  remained responsible for liabilities not assumed by american western primarily trade payables 
irlp intends to use the million note proceeds to pay the trade payables 
as a result of the sales to kenyen  emc and american western  the company has divested its refining operations 
nevertheless  should kenyen  emc  and or american western fail in their efforts with respect to the refineries they purchased or to pay notes due to the company  it is possible that the company and or its subsidiaries could be included in efforts by vendors to collect trade payables and or by environmental authorities in efforts to pursue environmental claims 
all of the aforementioned entities have limited capital 
see footnote to the consolidated statements for further information concerning the disposition of the refineries 
as a result of the foregoing  the company discontinued its refining operations by september  and such refining operations are accounted for currently and retroactively as discontinued operations 
accordingly  discussion of results of operations has been confined to results of continuing operations exploration and production and natural gas marketing and transmission 
results of operations s omitted fiscal vs fiscal revenues gas sales from natural gas marketing increased  or from fiscal to fiscal under the company s long term gas sale contract with lone star  the price received for gas is essentially fixed through may  the variance in gas sales  therefore  is almost entirely attributable to the volumes of gas delivered 
although the volumes sold to lone star annually are essentially fixed the lone star contract has a take or pay provision  the lone star contract year is from february to january whereas the company s fiscal year is from october to september furthermore  although the volumes to be taken by lone star in a given contract year are fixed  there is no provision requiring fixed monthly or daily volumes and deliveries accordingly vary with lone star s seasonal and peak demands 
such variances have been significant 
as a result  lone star deliveries  although fixed for a contract year  may be skewed and not proportional for the company s fiscal year 
lone star deliveries and sales for approximated those which would have occurred if daily takes under the lone star contract had been fixed and equal 
except for  all fiscal sales by the natural gas marketing and transmission segment were to lone star 
the lone star contract provides for a reduction in annual deliveries commencing february  assuming average monthly deliveries for the contract year ended january   this would result in a decrease in gas sales of approximately  in fiscal for the company  the required gas volume decreases another for the contract year beginning february  and remains constant thereafter 
as a result  the company expects average sales under the lone star contract to be less in each of the two fiscal years ending september  when compared to fiscal exploration and production revenues increased or from fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to increased gas prices 
production for fiscal consisted of  equivalent mcf consisting of  barrels of crude and  mcf of gas versus  equivalent mcf consisting of  barrels of crude and  mcf of gas for fiscal the net increase in equivalent mcf was  equivalent mcf or 
average gas prices increased 
per mcf or from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in production consisted of two factors an increase resulting from the purchase of the production payment from arco in october see footnote to the consolidated financial statements offset by a similar decline in production from the company s other depleting wells 
with the exception of the arco production payment purchase  only was invested in oil and gas properties in fiscal expenses gas purchases increased  or from fiscal in fiscal gas purchases constituted of gas sales versus of gas sales in fiscal the decrease in the gas purchase cost percentage is primarily attributable to the elimination of deferred gas purchase cost 
in fiscal  a deferred gas purchase cost of  was included in gas purchase cost 
this cost represented additional deferred gas purchase costs that the company expected to pay after the gecc loan was repaid 
as a result of the mg settlement on october  the deferred gas purchase obligation was discharged and did not apply to most of fiscal operating costs of the natural gas transmission segment increased or from to this increase consists primarily of wage increases given to pipeline personnel 
general and administrative expenses applicable to natural gas marketing and transmission decreased or from fiscal to fiscal the decrease occurred primarily because of a decrease in insurance and legal costs 
operating oil and gas production expenses in the exploration and production segment decreased or from fiscal to fiscal the decrease results primarily from decreased operating costs applicable to non operated wells and significantly decreased property taxes 
general and administrative costs applicable to exploration and production decreased or from to the decrease results primarily from decreased insurance expense  administrative fees and legal costs 
interest expense decreased  or from fiscal to fiscal the decrease results entirely from the decrease in the gecc loan and the discharge of a million subordinated loan due to mgtfc on october  as part of the mg settlement 
the tax provision allocation applicable to continuing operations has been determined pursuant to financial accounting standards number accounting for income taxes fas 
the management of the company believes that the intraperiod tax provision allocation between continuing and discontinued operations is misleading because the tax rate applicable to continuing operations does not approximate the tax rate expected by the company in future years 
fiscal vs fiscal revenues revenues from natural gas marketing increased by  or for the year ended september   principally as a result of the company s acquisition of the lone star contract from arco on december  the increased sales for the additional two months in fiscal were slightly offset by decreased average daily quantities sold to lone star during the year ended september  the average daily takes of gas under the lone star contract decreased in the decrease in daily takes is attributable to small decreases in the annual contractual volumes under the lone star contract and seasonal requirements of lone star within a contract year 
exploration and production revenues decreased  or for the year ended september  as compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the june  sale of certain exploration and production properties  as well as the general depletion of other company wells 
furthermore  the company drilled no new wells in fiscal and made minimal capital investments to enhance existing production 
this was partially offset by the addition of working oil and gas wells on december  operating income and expenses natural gas marketing earned operating income of approximately million in fiscal versus million in fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to the decreased average daily quantities sold to lone star which was offset by an increase attributable to twelve months of operations in as compared with ten months in operating income for the exploration and production operations was approximately million in as compared with million in fiscal the decrease results from the sale of certain properties in june and the loss of administrative revenues as a result of the sale of the company s partnership management business in june this is partially offset by the addition of working oil and gas wells on december  corporate general and administrative expenses increased million over the corresponding period in this increase is primarily attributable to legal fees associated with defending the stockholder litigation and related matters 
other expenses interest expense increased or from fiscal the net increase is the result of two offsetting factors 
interest expense decreased because the loan principal of the gecc loan and a subordinated loan to mgtfc decreased in interest expense increased in because the loans  which were used to finance the acquisition of the arco assets  were not made until december hence such loans were outstanding for less than a whole year in fiscal income taxes the company allocated the tax provision between continuing and discontinued operations retroactively pursuant to fas the company believes such allocation is misleading for the reason noted above 
fiscal vs fiscal revenues revenues from natural gas marketing to lone star aggregated approximately  for the period from december   the date the natural gas marketing assets were acquired  to september  lone star s gas purchases in the ten month period ending september  approximated of the contract volume required to be taken by lone star for the contract year ended january  exploration and production revenues during fiscal increased approximately  or  because of the production related to the purchase of majority working interests in producing oil and gas wells from arco on december  if the producing wells had not been acquired  exploration and production revenues would have decreased approximately  operating income and expenses natural gas marketing had operating income of approximately  for the fiscal year such operating income was derived from ten months of operations 
operating income of exploration and production was approximately  for the fiscal year ended september  compared to operating income of for fiscal year this increase is due to the addition of majority working interests in wells on december  income taxes the company allocated the provision between continuing and discontinued operations retroactively pursuant to fas the company believes such allocation is misleading for the reason noted above 
liquidity and capital resources as of september  subsequent to september   the company sold the indian refinery to american western  the powerine refinery to kenyen  and merged powerine into a subsidiary of emc 
as a result its financial condition changed significantly 
the discussion of liquidity and capital resources is  accordingly  focused on the company s financial condition as of february  as of february  as noted previously  the company completed the following material transactions between september  and february  a 
irlp sold the indian refinery to american western on december  for  in addition  american western assumed all of irlp s environmental liabilities 
b 
on january   powerine merged into a subsidiary of emc 
as a result of the american western  kenyen and emc transactions  the company had disposed of all of its refining assets 
in the case of the indian refinery the purchaser also assumed all pension and environmental liabilities of irlp 
nevertheless  irlp remains liable for vendor payables  unpaid severance costs and other accrued costs which approximate  million at february  irlp anticipates settling these liabilities with the proceeds of the american western note 
in addition  the company is liable for any shortfall in the liquidation of a revolving credit facility of irlp with a major financial institution bankers trust replacement credit facility by virtue of pledging its exploration and production collateral 
at february   the amount due to bankers trust was  most of the inventory collateral securing the replacement credit facility has been liquidated but approximately of receivables and  from the sale of platinum to american western remain to be collected 
as a result  the company expects the shortfall to approximate in the case of powerine all of powerine s liabilities  including all environmental liabilities  have been assumed as a result of the emc transaction 
powerine s refining assets were previously sold to kenyen 
a description of both transactions is found in footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the foregoing  the company s expected cash obligations and cash resources from march  to september   the company s next fiscal year end  are as follows dedicated to gecc loan not dedicated total cash resources cash on hand   cash flow natural gas marketing   cash flow exploration and production    interest mg note and other   cash obligations repayment of long term debt gecc loan   loan from former stockholder   loan from stockholder repayment of replacement credit facility shortfall   repayment of officer severance and other obligations related to discontinued refining operations   corporate general and administrative expenses   excess cash obligations   the required repayment of the gecc loan is  but all cash flow  including amounts in excess of  are dedicated to repayment 
the gecc loan had been reduced to  by february  and the company expects complete repayment not later than january  although the company has reduced the gecc loan approximately  below the minimum required principal  essentially all cash flow from the oil and gas wells  pipeline and gas contracts purchased from arco are dedicated to the gecc loan and cannot be used for other purposes 
as a result the company faces a  cash flow shortfall 
accordingly  on march   the company entered into a  credit commitment with a financial institution 
funds borrowed will be secured by the company s exploration and production assets 
such financing allows the company to meet the projected deficit of  until the gecc loan is repaid 
such repayment is expected in january at such time  the company would receive the cash flow now dedicated to repayment of the gecc loan approximately  annually 
the company anticipates closing the new credit facility by april  if  for any reason  the company is unable to close the new credit facility  the company believes that it could raise the required capital by obtaining a  credit facility with another financial institution based upon its exploration and production collateral or by selling certain of its exploration and production assets if needed 
the company also believes that it could obtain financing by selling its lone star contract or borrowing from an energy lender based upon the remaining value in such contract 
although the company anticipates that it will be able to obtain financing based upon the fair market value of its gas contracts and exploration and production assets  there can be no assurance that such financing will be obtained or that it will be obtained in a timely manner 
furthermore  although the company has exited the refining business  it is still subject to certain material risks related to the refinery segment as follows a 
kenyen  american western and emc are all small  thinly capitalized companies 
if any or all of them fail in their endeavors to restart or transport either of the refineries  interested parties could seek redress from the company for vendor or environmental liabilities 
in the past government and other plaintiffs have often named the most financially capable parties in such cases regardless of the existence or extent of actual liability 
although the company s management does not believe the company would ultimately be held liable  there can be no assurance such will be the case 
even if the company were to prevail in such litigation  the related legal costs and distraction of the company s management resources from continuing operations could be significant 
b 
in the case of the indian refinery transaction  irlp remains responsible for its liabilities to the extent such liabilities were not assumed by the purchaser  american western 
such liabilities are approximately  at february  if american western does not pay the  note  irlp s only recourse is to foreclose on its collateral  the indian refinery 
it would then have to sell the refinery in order to use the proceeds to pay vendors 
in fiscal  the company was unable to sell the indian refinery 
moreover  claims by environmental authorities could also be made and could supersede those of vendors 
if such were the case  the company could decide to put irlp into a liquidation proceeding 
although the company does not expect any additional significant cash outlays for the indian refinery and believes such outlays would not legally be required  attempts may be made to impose such liabilities on the company 
on march   the company engaged an investment banking firm to explore strategic alternatives to enhance stockholder value and to act as the company s exclusive advisor 
the alternatives that may be recommended include the sale of assets  the sale of the company  a merger with or joint venture with another company or other restructuring measures 
if such is the case  future operations of the company may be different from that herein contemplated 
inflation and changing prices natural gas marketing and transmission the company s gas sales contract with lone star is essentially a fixed price contract 
it continues through may the company s gas supply contract is also a fixed price contract 
the result is that the company s gross margin is essentially locked in and does not increase with inflation 
although there are some operating costs applicable to the natural gas marketing and pipeline transmission segment  which tend to increase with inflation  they are minor and inflation of such costs without concomitant inflation in revenues does not significantly impact operating profits 
exploration and production oil and gas sales are determined by markets locally and worldwide and often move inversely to inflation 
whereas operating expenses related to oil and gas sales may be expected to parallel inflation  such costs have often tended to move more in response to oil and gas sales prices than in response to inflation 
general since the company currently has virtually no variable rate debt  it is not sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates 
new accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board has released several pronouncements that are not effective until future years 
the company believes that such pronouncements  when effective  will not materially affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
risk factors the company desires to take advantage of the new safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of and is including this section of item to this form k to do so 
the company cautions readers that the following important risk factors could affect the company s future results of operations and financial condition and could cause the company s actual future results of operations and financial condition to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
refinery matters although the company has disposed of its two refineries  the company s future results of operations and cash flow could be adversely affected by liabilities related to such refineries if the purchasers are unable to satisfy such liabilities as discussed above 
in addition  one purchaser is obligated to the company for an aggregate of  in notes  which may not be paid if such purchaser is unable to raise financing to restart the refineries 
see liquidity and capital resources  above and item business and properties refining and item legal proceedings 
supply risk mgng supply contract approximately of the gas delivered to lone star pursuant to the lone star contract is provided by mgng 
the lone star contract expires on may  mgng is a wholly owned subsidiary of mg  which  in turn  is indirectly owned by mg ag 
if spot gas prices increase significantly and mgng has not hedged its future commitment to supply gas to the company or if mgng experiences financial problems  mgng may be unable to meet its gas supply commitments to the company 
if mgng does not fulfill its gas supply commitment to the company  the company may not be able to fulfill its gas delivery commitment to lone star which would adversely impact the company s results of operations and cash flow 
under such circumstances the company may not be able to recover lost profits and cash flow from mgng despite provisions providing for such recovery 
credit risk lone star at the current time  virtually all of the company s gas marketing volumes and approximately of the company s own gas production is sold to a single customer  lone star  under a long term gas sales contract which terminates on may  although lone star has paid for all gas purchased when such payments were due  any inability of lone star to continue to pay for gas purchased would adversely affect the company 
drilling risk after obtaining the requisite financing  the company anticipates spending as much as  during the next three years to drill new wells primarily on acreage acquired from arco 
drilling is inherently risky and there can be no assurance that any wells drilled will be economically viable or enable the company to recover the costs of drilling 
if the initial wells drilled by the company do not find the reserves expected  the company may not drill additional wells and the revenues and cash flow expected from such drilling may never materialize 
public market for the company s stock although there presently exists a market for the company s stock  such market is volatile 
in addition  the company s earnings history is sporadic and the company has not paid dividends since although the company believes that its earnings and cash flow will be more predictable in the future  there can be no assurance that such will be the case 
such volatility may adversely effect the market price and liquidity of the company s common stock 
in addition  there are presently  to the company s knowledge  several brokerage firms making a market in the company s common stock 
any cessation of such market making activities by such brokerage firms could adversely affect the market for the company s common stock 
operational consideration the company s operations are subject to the risks inherent in the pipeline and oil and gas industries  including the risks of fire  explosion  pipe failure and environmental accidents such as oil spills  gas leaks and ruptures or discharges of toxic gases  the occurrence of any of which could result in substantial losses to the company due to injury or loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution or other environmental damage  clean up responsibilities  regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations 
the company s operations could be subject to significant interruption in the event any of these or other problems developed 
in accordance with customary industry practice  the company maintains liability  property and business interruption insurance against some  but not all  of the risks described above 
there can be no assurance that such an adverse event will not happen  that the company s insurance will be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities or that it would not have a material adverse affect on the company s financial condition or operations
