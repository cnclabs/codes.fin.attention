item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s operations are primarily driven by the number of oil and gas wells being drilled  the depth and drilling conditions of such wells  the number of well completions and the level of workover activity worldwide 
drilling activity  in turn  is largely dependent on the price of oil and natural gas 
this is especially true in the united states  where the company is expected to generate approximately one half of its revenues during the next twelve months 
due to aging oilfields and lower cost sources of oil internationally  drilling activity in the united states has declined more than from its peak in record low drilling activity levels were experienced in and as a result  pumping service companies have been unable to recapitalize their aging us fleets due to the inability  under current market conditions  to generate adequate returns on new capital investments 
the company believes it is important to operate with a greater critical mass in the key us markets to improve returns in this environment 
this conclusion led to the decision in april  to consolidate its us operations with those of the western company of north america western  which had a larger presence in the united states 
the company s us critical mass was further increased through the acquisition of nowsco well service ltd 
nowsco in june which added operations in the mid continental and northeastern us  the latter being an area in which the company did not have an existing presence 
the rig count in the united states averaged active drilling rigs during the year ended september  while lower than drilling levels  the rig count increased by from due to increased natural gas related drilling 
drilling for natural gas increased by during after declining by during oil related drilling activity declined in both and due to relatively stronger oil and natural gas prices currently being realized  however  management expects us drilling activity levels for fiscal to be above levels 
with the exception of canada  international drilling activity has historically been less volatile than domestic drilling activity 
active international drilling rigs increased by and during and  respectively  on the strength of development work in latin america  especially venezuela  and renewed exploration programs in the uk north sea 
in both the united states and internationally  there has been a continuing trend by oil and gas companies toward alliances with the service companies 
these alliances take various forms including packaged or integrated services  single source suppliers and turnkey agreements 
approximately of the company s revenues were generated under such alliances during fiscal expansions and acquisitions the company s expansion and acquisition efforts over the past several years have been focused on adding critical mass to its us operations and international geographic expansions of its existing product lines 
the company has completed two major acquisitions during this period the acquisition of western in april the western acquisition and the acquisition of nowsco in june the nowsco acquisition 
the western acquisition was completed for a total purchase price of million including transaction costs of million  which was paid approximately half in cash and half in shares of the company s common stock and warrants to purchase common stock 
the western acquisition has provided the company with a greater critical mass with which to compete in domestic and international markets and the realization of significant consolidation benefits 
the western acquisition increased the company s existing total revenue base by approximately and more than doubled the company s domestic revenue base beginning in the june quarter 
in addition  in excess of million of overhead and redundant operating costs have been eliminated annually by combining the two companies 
the nowsco acquisition was completed for a total purchase price of million including transaction costs of million in cash 
the nowsco acquisition accomplished three primary objectives i it gives the company the number one pumping services market position in canada  where the company has not operated since  and adds to the company s existing market positions in several key us and international markets  ii it provides a technological leadership position in the high growth coiled tubing service line  and iii it provides the opportunity for further cost savings through consolidation of redundant overhead and operating bases 
the nowsco acquisition has added approximately to the company s existing revenue base 
the company s other expansion efforts during the past three years have included the expansion of pumping services into several key markets including brazil through acquisition of shares from its joint venture partner  saudi arabia  qatar and vietnam  expanding tubular services and process and pipeline services into geographic regions outside the north sea  and adding additional pumping service capacity in key latin american markets 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected key operating statistics reflecting industry rig count and the company s financial results year ended september  average active rigs u 
s international revenue per rig in thousands revenue per employee in thousands percentage of gross profit to revenue percentage of marketing expense to revenue percentage of general and administrative expense to revenue industry estimate of average active rigs 
gross profit represents revenue less cost of sales and services and research and engineering expenses 
revenue the company s revenue increased for the fourth consecutive year  increasing by and in and  respectively 
such increases were driven primarily by the company s western acquisition in and the nowsco acquisition in  international expansions and increased activity in latin america  the uk north sea and southeast asia 
us revenue increased by and in and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to the addition of the western operations beginning april during the first six months of prior to the acquisition of western  the company s revenues increased over the same period of due primarily to the increased placement of cementing units and the addition of a stimulation vessel in the gulf of mexico 
with the acquisition of western  the company s us revenues more than doubled  accounting for the remainder of the increase for the us revenue increase reflects the continued benefit of the western acquisition  as well as the effects of the nowsco acquisition which has added approximately to the company s us revenues beginning in the fourth fiscal quarter 
the revenue also increased due to stronger natural gas drilling activity in  most significantly in the company s south texas and gulf of mexico operations 
while management believes the company has retained most of the key customers of western and nowsco in the us  some market share loss may be experienced as nowsco s prices were generally below the company s in the us overall pricing for the company s us pumping services has remained relatively stable for the past two years 
however  pricing may improve somewhat during fiscal if the expected increase in drilling activity results in a tightening of capacity in the industry 
the company implemented a price book increase in the us effective july  international revenues increased by and during and  respectively 
the increases were primarily attributable to three factors a the continued geographic expansion of the company s service lines  b a significant increase in latin america  the uk north sea and southeast asia business  and c acquisitions 
pressure pumping international expansions included qatar and vietnam in and saudi arabia and azerbaijan in the tubular services and commissioning and leak detection service lines have now been expanded into over countries  including parts of the middle east  africa  south america  the far east and australia 
most of the revenue growth in latin america up and in and  respectively was a result of increased cementing and stimulation activity with both private and national oil and gas companies in argentina  the addition of a stimulation vessel in and coiled tubing barges in and to service the lake maracaibo  venezuela market and the acquisition of the remaining of the company s joint venture in brazil in november the growth in latin america  however  is expected to slow somewhat during as a result of a recent activity decline in argentina 
the acquisitions which contributed to the company s international revenue growth were acquisitions by the company of the remaining interests in its joint ventures in egypt and brazil in and  respectively  the western acquisition  which added international operations in nigeria  indonesia and hungary  and the nowsco acquisition  which generated approximately two thirds of its revenue outside the us as a result of the nowsco acquisition  the company currently has the largest pressure pumping operation in canada  where the company had not operated since operating income operating income increased by million and million in and  respectively 
such increases were due to the revenue increases described above  partially offset by unusual charges of million in and million in the unusual charges were taken in conjunction with consolidation programs associated with the acquisitions of western and nowsco  respectively 
included in the unusual charges were adjustments to the carrying value of duplicate operating facilities  severance and related benefit costs  benefits due under agreements covering the company s executives that were triggered as a result of the western acquisition  and legal and other costs that would not have been incurred had the acquisitions not occurred 
the unusual charge associated with the nowsco acquisition was significantly lower than that of the western acquisition as the company had fewer overlapping operations with nowsco 
see also note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the cost of sales and services as a percentage of revenue has declined in each of the last two years  from in to and in and  respectively  primarily as a result of cost reduction efforts after the acquisitions of western and nowsco and the economies of scale of having larger operating bases after combining the respective operations 
other operating expenses  excluding the unusual charges  increased in both and primarily as a result of the addition of the western and nowsco operations 
in addition  marketing expenses increased somewhat due to international expansions and higher revenues in operations which require agency commission payments  and in the us as a result of an expansion of a program which places the company s engineers in customer offices 
the acquisitions of western and nowsco resulted in additional annual goodwill amortization of million and million  respectively 
each of these operating expenses is expected to increase in to reflect a full year of adding the nowsco operations 
other interest expense increased by million and million in and  respectively 
both increases were a result of increased borrowing to fund acquisitions  western in and nowsco in the company s effective interest rates on borrowing remained relatively constant during each of the periods presented 
see also financial condition capital resources and liquidity and notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
other income was a net gain in both and due to nonrecurring gains on asset sales and royalty income in both years 
royalty income declined to 
million in from million in due to a reduction in use by the licensee 
primarily as a result of profitability in international jurisdictions where the statutory tax rate is below the us rate  the availability of certain nonrecurring tax benefits and the availability of tax benefits from the company s reorganization pursuant to its initial public offering in  the company s effective tax rate remained below the us statutory rate during through the nonrecurring benefits which have reduced the company s effective tax rate include million in from a change in the valuation reserve for net operating losses  and million in and million in from the favorable settlement of tax audits and tax losses attributable to foreign exchange fluctuations in certain international jurisdictions 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
results in include a million million after tax charge for the cumulative effect of an accounting change for retiree health benefits 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
capital resources and liquidity cash flows from operating activities increased by million in and million in both increases were primarily a result of larger and more profitable operations due to acquisitions 
partially offsetting such increased profitability in were higher receivable balances and the payment of merger related items 
management strives to maintain low cash balances while utilizing available credit facilities to meet the company s capital needs 
any excess cash generated is used to pay down outstanding borrowings 
in june  the company replaced its existing credit facility with a committed  unsecured credit facility new bank credit facility executed to accommodate the acquisition of nowsco

the notes have been amended to conform to terms of the new bank credit facility 
management believes that the new bank credit facility  combined with other discretionary credit facilities and cash flow from operations  provides the company with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to manage its routine operations and fund projected capital expenditures 
excluding acquisitions  capital expenditures during the year ended september  were million  or million and million higher than capital spending in and  respectively 
the current year s spending related primarily to international expansion opportunities primarily in latin america  offshore cementing skids and a normal level of replacement capital 
other investing activities in included the acquisition of the remaining interest in the company s joint venture in brazil for total consideration of million consisting of million of cash and million of debt assumed by the company and the nowsco acquisition for million in cash 
the nowsco acquisition was financed with the proceeds from the sale of million shares of common stock in july  which generated net proceeds of million  with the remainder from borrowings under its new bank credit facility

 accounting for income taxes sfas  the company is required to record a deferred tax asset for the future tax benefit of these tax net operating loss carryforwards  as well as other items  if realization is more likely than not 
the western acquisition provided the company with a greater critical mass with which to compete in the united states as it more than doubled the company s united states revenue base 
in addition  with the combination of nowsco and western  the company has realized significant consolidation benefits 
management estimates that in excess of million of overhead and redundant operating costs have been eliminated annually as a result of the combination of the three companies 
management has concluded that the company s future taxable income will be sufficient over the remaining carryforward periods to realize the tax benefits represented by approximately million of tax net operating loss carryforwards acquired with the acquisitions of nowsco and western and generated by the company s operations prior to such acquisitions 
net tax benefits resulting from the acquisitions approximate million and have been included as a deferred tax asset recognized in the purchase price allocation 
valuation allowances have been established for the benefits of the tax net operating loss carryforwards that are estimated to expire prior to their utilization 
capital expenditures for fiscal are projected to be approximately million  excluding acquisitions  and are expected to include spending for continued geographic expansions of all service lines  construction of an additional coiled tubing vessel  additional capacity in certain high margin locations and normal levels of replacement capital 
in december  the company completed the acquisition of the remaining interest in the company s joint venture in argentina for million 
the actual amount of fiscal capital expenditures will be primarily dependent upon the availability of expansion opportunities and will be funded by cash flows from operating activities and available credit facilities 
management believes cash flow from operating activities and available lines of credit  if necessary  will be sufficient to fund projected capital expenditures
