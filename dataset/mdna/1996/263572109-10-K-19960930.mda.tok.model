capital resources and liquidity prior to the company s initial public offering ipo in february  the company financed its operations and working capital needs through internally generated funds  bank borrowings and loans from certain shareholders

cash balances at june  and were approximately  and  respectively 
the company s operations used approximately  and  of cash during and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities for fiscal was due primarily to an increase in general and administrative expenses and to the additional costs incurred in connection with a joint venture 
further  during and the company acquired capital assets of approximately  and  respectively  substantially all of which represented investment in computer hardware and software 
the company anticipates that the development of existing and new lines of business will require additional investment in capital assets and additional marketing and administrative costs 
the company believes cash on hand and future cash from operations should be sufficient to cover current operations  however  additional working capital may be needed for future expansion 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such capital on terms satisfactory to it 
as of june   the company had no outstanding debt or lines of credit  other than ordinary trade accounts payable 
in august  the company acquired real property located in long island city  ny for the purpose of centralizing and consolidating its subsidiaries operations 
the cost of the real property was approximately  of which  was financed by a mortgage loan 
inflation the company has continued to experience the benefits of a low inflation economy in the new york tri state area 
in general  the company enters into long term fixed price contracts which are largely labor intensive 
accordingly  future wage rate increases may affect the profitability of its long term contracts 
short term contracts are less susceptible to inflationary conditions 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal revenue increased by approximately  or in the increase was due primarily to the revenue generated by the new subsidiaries 
the modest growth in revenue was due primarily to the company either completing or beginning several large  multi million dollar contracts 
since such revenue streams typically peak during the middle of a project  this also temporarily depressed contract revenues in cost of revenues earned increased by approximately  or in in  cost of revenues earned included approximately  of additional costs to finish the electrical portion of a project on behalf of a co venturer of a joint venture 
gross profit decreased by approximately  or in gross profit as a percentage of revenue also decreased from in to in however  excluding the additional costs in connection with the joint venture  gross profit only decreased by  and gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 
the reduction in gross profit as a percentage of revenue was due to increasing competitive pressure on contracts and overruns on lump sum contracts begun in prior years and substantially completed in consolidated backlog at june  was approximately  compared to  at june  the company continues to bid on projects of all sizes and bid volume remains active 
opportunities to obtain large projects exist and therefore backlog could substantially increase 
however  it is very difficult to predict the nature and timing of large projects upon which the company has bid and the outcome of the bidding process 
therefore  the company cannot predict with certainty future contracts and revenue 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or in the increase was due primarily to the formation and initial growth of the new subsidiaries 
a portion was also attributable to increased public reporting requirements following the company s initial public offering 
as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses increased from in to in bad debt in connection with the joint venture amounted to approximately  in centrifugal associates  inc is a co venturer in the joint venture that performed mechanical and electrical services for a general contractor on the lincoln square project 
the general contractor advanced funds directly to the other co venturer and later stated that such advances would be deducted from the payments owed to the joint venture for work that centrifugal associates  inc performed on the project 
management is of the opinion that there is substantial doubt as the collectibility of such accounts and loans receivable and wrote off the receivable and loan as bad debt in fiscal compared to nine months ended june  revenue increased by approximately  or in this change was the result of an increase in the number of contracts started in as compared to and the acceleration of project schedules on a number of large institutional and high rise residential contracts in  along with the three month difference between the two periods 
such three month difference also affected the comparative figures for gross profit  general and administrative expenses and net income 
the company believed that the increase in the number of contracts started in was due to the upturn in the economy in the new york metropolitan area 
gross profit increased by approximately  or in however  gross profit as percentage of revenue decreased from in to in the increase in gross profit was due primarily to an increase in the number of contracts started in as compared to the reduction in gross profit as a percentage of revenue was due to increasing competitive pressure on a number of large contracts and an increase in labor and materials costs associated with the acceleration of certain project schedules in as compared to general and administrative expenses increased by  or in the increase was due primarily to the increase in the number of contracts in as compared to the company also incurred additional administrative expenses associated with being a publicly held company 
however  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from in to in such decrease was due to the increase in the number of contracts commenced  and the acceleration of certain project schedules in as compared to net income in was  after taking into account of the tax effect of the august revocation of subchapter s elections by certain of the company s wholly owned subsidiaries
