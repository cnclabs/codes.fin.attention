the company s international operations are subject to the risk of currency exchange rate fluctuations 
this risk is generally limited to the net income of the operations as the revenues and expenses of the operations are generally denominated in the same currency 
when economically beneficial to do so  the company or its international operations enter into hedging transactions to minimize the risk of adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations on the net income of the operation 
the company s major international markets are the united kingdom  france  germany  the netherlands  spain  italy  and canada 
the company s operations are also subject to the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
as part of managing the company s exposures to currency exchange and market interest rates  the company periodically enters into derivative financial instruments with major well known banks acting as principal counterparty 
in order to minimize counterparty risk  the company only enters into derivative contracts with major well known banks that have credit ratings equal to or better than the company s 
additionally  these contracts contain provisions for net settlement 
as such  the contracts settle based on the spread between the currency rates and interest rates contained in the contracts and the current market rates 
this minimizes the risk of an insolvent counterparty being unable to pay the company and  at the same time  having the creditors of the counterparty demanding the notional principal amount from the company 
the company s derivative activities are limited in volume and confined to risk management activities related to the company s worldwide operations 
a reporting system is in place which evaluates the impact on the company s earnings resulting from changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates and other relevant market risks 
this system is structured to enable senior management to initiate prompt remedial action  if appropriate
