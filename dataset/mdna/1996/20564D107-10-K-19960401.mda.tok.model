item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
analysis of operations consolidated operations consolidated revenues for were a record million  an increase of million over the previous year 
revenues increased in the international communications and entertainment segments  while declining in the mobile communications and technology services segments 
the largest improvement was in the entertainment segment  where on command video continued to have substantial growth in its hotel room base 
within international communications  international ventures revenues almost doubled  in large part because of significant growth in its latin american ventures 
consolidated revenues in increased million over with revenue increases in all business segments 
the largest improvements were in the entertainment and international communications segments 
substantial growth in system installations at on command video and improvements from the denver nuggets were responsible for the favorable increase in entertainment segment revenues 
revenues increased more than threefold in international ventures over operating income in was million  a decline of million from during the corporation took actions to restructure elements of all of its business segments  and recorded a million restructuring provision see note to the financial statements 
exclusive of the restructuring charge and the radiation systems  inc rsi merger and integration costs recorded in  operating income was million  or million below all business segments reported lower operating income in  as compared to  except mobile communications  where operating income was unchanged from the prior year 
operating income for was million lower than in improved performances from the entertainment and technology services segments were offset by non recurring merger and integration costs of million associated with the acquisition of rsi in june the merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
accordingly  the financial statements were restated to include rsi see note to the financial statements 
other income expense decreased in by million from levels 
the corporation  through a subsidiary  issued million of monthly income preferred securities mips in july see note to the financial statements 
dividends on these securities of million were the primary cause of the increased expense in other income expense declined by million in from because of proceeds of corporate owned life insurance policies received in which did not recur in and because of lower equity profits associated with unconsolidated businesses 
interest costs increased by million in as compared to and by million for over as a result of increases in both interest rates and borrowings 
interest capitalized  primarily on satellite construction projects  declined in by million compared to due to the completion of several intelsat satellites  and increased slightly from to as levels of property under construction grew during that period 
the corporation adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
in this standard requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be adjusted to reflect current tax rates 
the cumulative effect of adopting this standard was to increase income by million in in addition  the corporation recorded a charge to income tax expense of million in under the new standard to reflect the impact on the prior year s deferred tax accounts of the change in the federal income tax rate to from 
the initial public offering of common stock of ascent entertainment group  inc ascent was completed in december as a result of the offering  the corporation now owns of ascent s common stock

segment operating results in millions revenues international communications mobile communications technology services entertainment eliminations and other total revenues operating income loss international communications mobile communications technology services entertainment total segment operating income merger and integration costs provision for restructuring other corporate total operating income international communications international communications includes comsat international ventures civ and the fcc regulated and non regulated businesses of comsat world systems cws 
cws provides international voice  data  video and audio communications as the statutory designated us participant in the global intelsat satellite system 
civ invests in and operates telecommunications businesses internationally 
cws s revenues increased from revenues from expanded service offerings such as vsat leases  digital audio and wide band mobile increased by 
these increases were partially offset by reduced revenues from voice circuits  which declined due to rate reductions and the anticipated conversion of analog circuits to more efficient digital service 
the rate reductions relate to agreements with at t  mci and sprint  cws s three largest international carrier customers 
cws s share of revenues from the intelsat system also declined with the reduction in the corporation s ownership share in cws s revenues in increased over  driven by a increase in video services and a doubling of expanded service offerings such as vsat leases  digital audio and wide band mobile 
these increases were partly offset by reduced revenues from voice circuits which declined for the reasons indicated above 
cws s operating income increased from the increase was due to decreased operating expenses within the division and cws s lower share of intelsat s costs 
these savings were partially offset by increased depreciation expense from the launch of three intelsat vii satellites in cws s operating income declined from the decrease was the result of increased operating expenses  primarily depreciation  which increased as a result of the launch of three new satellites that went into service in late and civ has business ventures providing telecommunication services in latin america  asia and europe 
civ owns a controlling interest in of these ventures 
in  revenues grew to million due to growth in latin american ventures and the consolidation of the results of belcom  civ s russian venture  for a full year 
in  civ revenues grew more than threefold over to million 
in  civ experienced an operating loss of million  primarily due to operating problems in belcom 
despite these operational problems  civ s total backlog of revenue under contract grew from roughly million at the end of to over million by the end of in  civ incurred an operating loss of million  which was million better than mobile communications this segment consists of comsat mobile communications cmc  which provides maritime  aeronautical and land mobile communications services as the statutory designated us participant in the inmarsat satellite system 
revenues in declined from the prior year due to rate reductions and the migration of traffic to less expensive  more efficient digital services such as standard m 
however  cmc s telephone traffic minutes increased in as the lower cost digital standard m service dominated new terminal commissionings during the year 
the number of standard m digital terminals in the marketplace doubled  totaling  by the end of the year 
telephone revenues declined from due to lower average rates 
telex revenues also declined from however  this decline was partially offset by revenue growth of almost in standard c services  which operate in smaller and less expensive digital terminals 
revenues from service contracts with idb mobile communications  inc idb and american mobile satellite corporation amsc increased over due principally to additional capacity requirements 
a contract under which cmc provided inmarsat with satellite control services terminated at the end of cmc s operating income for was unchanged from lower revenues were offset by a reduction in operating expenses and an increase in cmc s share of inmarsat s operating results 
the decline in operating expenses was due in part to lower cmc operating costs and the reversal of inmarsat related costs which were over accrued in revenue increases of in over occurred across a broad range of services 
operating expenses increased by  largely attributable to higher depreciation on earth station upgrades 
operating income was flat in compared to technology services the technology services segment includes comsat laboratories and comsat rsi crsi  which designs  manufactures and integrates a range of turnkey systems  subsystems and components for advanced microwave  cellular  personal communication services and networks pcs pcn  wireless local loop communication networks  satellite communication  radar and other services 
in addition  this segment provides operations and maintenance  satellite construction monitoring and applied research services 
revenues for this segment declined in by million from the prior year 
the decrease was caused by the completion in of several large international and us government contracts which were not replaced in offsetting the decline  in part  were increases in revenues from satellite services for classified government customers  earth station component sales and the acquisitions of three companies intelesys  plexsys and jefa that are involved in the manufacture  integration and installation of various wireless components and systems 
in addition  the revenue decline was in part the result of a million insurance settlement recorded in at crsi  as well as downsizing of one of the laboratories divisions 
revenues in increased by million over improvements came primarily from continued work on the vsat rural telephony program in guatemala and the television and radio distribution network in cote d ivoire ivory coast  as well as from new projects to install cellular antennas in argentina and to provide digital upgrades to telephony equipment at a number of earth stations internationally 
revenues were lower at comsat laboratories primarily due to the sale of a microwave electronics group in operating income in declined million from the decline was primarily due to the lower revenues as well as new product development costs associated with vsat and cellular products 
operating profit in improved slightly as compared to the prior year  as a result of higher revenues and insurance income  offset in part by the costs associated with the cancellation of a large infrastructure project in kuwait 
entertainment the entertainment segment is comprised of ascent entertainment group  inc ascent 
as discussed in note to the financial statements  the initial public offering of ascent was completed in december and comsat corporation now owns of ascent 
ascent  through on command video corporation ocv and ascent network services  inc ans  formerly comsat video enterprises  inc  provides video distribution and on demand video entertainment services to the hospitality industry and video distribution services for the national broadcasting company nbc 
this segment also includes the denver nuggets national basketball association nba franchise  the colorado avalanche national hockey league nhl franchise and beacon communications corp 
beacon  a producer of theatrical films and television programming 
in the third quarter of  ans contributed substantially all of its pay per view video systems in hotels and related assets to ocv for ocv common stock 
this transaction raised ascent s ownership of ocv to approximately 
ocv now owns and manages all of ascent s hotel video systems 
certain satellite cinema hotel properties are being converted to services provided by ocv and ascent has terminated or sold satellite cinema operations at the remaining hotel properties 
in july  ascent acquired the quebec nordiques nhl franchise and related player contracts 
after the acquisition  ascent relocated the team to denver  colorado for the season  and the franchise is now known as the colorado avalanche see note to the financial statements 
in december  ans purchased substantially all of the assets of beacon see note to the financial statements 
ascent s revenues increased in by million over the previous year 
this increase in revenues was the result of a significant growth in the ocv installed room base  the inclusion of the colorado avalanche revenues for the last half of and beacon revenues for the full year  and nba expansion revenues 
offsetting these increases were lower revenues from the nbc contract  which entered an option phase in revenues increased in from by million 
the increase was caused by ocv room growth in newly contracted hotels  the conversion of existing ans rooms to the ocv system  and improved results by the denver nuggets following their playoff participation and higher paid attendance and sponsor revenues 
ascent incurred a million operating loss in as compared to operating income of million in the decline was a result of lower revenues from the nbc contract  losses from the colorado avalanche for the last half of and full year costs for beacon 
additionally  the results include one time charges recorded in connection with the ascent public offering 
these losses were partially offset by receipt of nba expansion fees and improvement in ocv operations 
operating income in grew over gains in operating results from the denver nuggets led to the improved performance 
results from video programming and distribution were unchanged from outlook many of the statements that follow are forward looking and relate to anticipated future operating results 
statements which look forward in time are based on management s current expectations and assumptions  which may be affected by subsequent developments and business conditions  and necessarily involve risks and uncertainties 
therefore  there can be no assurance that actual future results will not differ materially from anticipated results 
although the corporation has attempted to identify some of the important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated  those factors should not be viewed as the only factors which may affect future operating results 
the corporation continues to promote efforts to restructure intelsat and inmarsat as privatized commercial enterprises to enhance prospects that services offered on the intelsat and inmarsat systems remain competitive in tomorrow s marketplace 
in the corporation s view  the rapid evolution of telecommunications technology and increased competition have made privatization necessary so that these treaty based organizations can become more cost effective and responsive to customer needs 
the corporation  as a minority shareholder and the us signatory to both organizations  lacks the ability to independently effect a restructuring of either organization 
the success of the corporation s privatization efforts will depend on the corporation s ability to achieve a consensus among other signatories and participating member governments 
the corporation announced in february that it had reached agreement with the us government concerning a joint proposal that would transfer approximately of intelsat s assets  including satellites  to a new commercial affiliate 
the existing intergovernmental organization would continue to provide basic public network services 
the proposal also contemplates that a majority of the affiliate s stock would be sold to external investors 
the corporation s objective is to build a consensus on the proposal that can be considered for adoption at the next intelsat assembly of parties to be held in a vote of two thirds of the governments that are members of the intelsat consortium is necessary for approval 
in early  the corporation retained an investment banker to assess strategic alternatives for enhancing shareholder value and to analyze the capital needs of its businesses for continued expansion 
as part of that effort  the corporation is examining a number of options with a view toward enhancing the ability of its various businesses to continue to accelerate their strategic investment programs  while permitting comsat as a parent organization to reduce debt  strengthen its balance sheet and improve liquidity 
interest costs are expected to significantly increase in due to increased borrowings primarily for capital expenditures  including investments in ico see note to the financial statements 
the corporation anticipates that the amount of interest capitalized will decrease significantly as several intelsat and inmarsat satellites are expected to be placed in service during comsat world systems and intelsat are faced with increased competition for the provision of satellite services from new and existing satellites launched by separate systems such as pan american satellite panamsat and orion network systems  inc in late  the federal communications commission fcc substantially eliminated prior restrictions on access of separate system satellite operators to the public switched telephone network 
this action  along with the fcc s stated goal of eliminating all restrictions on separate satellite systems by  will increase competition 
over the next few years  continuing increases in satellite competition and the expected doubling of fiber optic cable capacity available in the marketplace will put increased pressure on service revenues and operating margins and could result in loss of market share 
in addition  under cws s long term service contracts  carrier customers may cancel certain circuits upon paying a termination charge 
in  the corporation signed a five year agreement with news corporation to provide satellite services beginning in in march  news corporation rescinded this agreement 
the corporation has commenced a lawsuit against news corporation and other parties to recover damages arising out of news corporation s breach of obligation to comsat 
the corporation believes that cws continues to be well positioned with long term agreements with major international carriers to provide cost competitive services for bulk usage beyond the year in addition  cws expects continued growth in several emerging markets  particularly in international television distribution  where new opportunities are being created in the marketplace 
opportunities are also expanding for international vsat services 
in addition to the seven satellites currently on order  intelsat has signed a lease for capacity aboard the insat e satellite in the asia pacific region  planned for launch in intelsat launched three satellites in and plans five launches for in february  there was a launch failure of the intelsat satellite aboard a china long march vehicle 
the corporation s investment in the satellite  including capitalized interest  was fully insured against the loss 
receipt of the insurance proceeds will reduce the corporation s rate base for jurisdictional rate making purposes  resulting in a potential reduction of earnings capacity 
the new intelsat vii and intelsat viii series satellites will offer higher power capabilities 
comsat international ventures plans to continue to make further investments in its current international businesses and may form new ventures in selected markets 
civ plans to target those markets where the telecommunications environment is liberalizing and where civ s core strengths can be used to capture an early position in rapidly growing markets 
in  civ experienced difficulties in the operations of two ventures  belcom russia and philcom philippines 
civ expects improved performance in both of these ventures during it is expected that profits from existing ventures in will likely be offset by civ s expansion in newer ventures  which typically yield losses in their formative stages 
those losses  coupled with civ s overhead and management costs  are expected to result in continued losses for civ as a whole 
comsat mobile communications plans to continue to expand its service offerings and value added products to meet anticipated growth in customers needs 
the increasing number of digital terminals with improved operating efficiency and reduced service charges are expected to continue to provide traffic growth in land mobile  small commercial and pleasure boat  and business traveler markets 
cmc expects to continue to face increasing competition from existing inmarsat service providers  other wireless communications services including c band  and other potential market entrants such as at t  which recently obtained fcc approval to resell ship to shore service 
as a result  expected increases in revenues due to traffic growth would be partially offset by a reduction in service charges caused by competitive pressures and lower priced digital versus analog telephone service charges 
the service contract with amsc expired at the end of as amsc began using its own satellite 
the idb contract was extended during to provide service through september cmc plans to build on its established position of leadership in mobile satellite communications as it evolves toward handheld satellite service 
the first generation of personal satellite communications will be a six pound  laptop computer sized satellite terminal named planet tm 
cmc announced this product in january with expected service commencement in utilizing the inmarsat satellites which are scheduled to begin launching in april this product is expected to address the demand for global personal communications ahead of the availability of handheld satellite systems 
a major part of the corporation s international telecommunications strategy is the investment of approximately million in ico see note to the financial statements 
this newly created company was formed outside the inmarsat organization to allow a more commercial and market driven focus on the development of handheld satellite service 
ico s intermediate circular orbit satellite system will have satellites and is scheduled to become operational by the year ico users are expected to communicate worldwide using handheld units similar to cellular phones 
the units are expected to cost less than  and will operate through both satellite and cellular links 
as with any new product  there are a number of factors that may affect the corporation s ability to offer planet sm and ico services on a profitable basis 
such factors include the ability to meet commercial deployment schedules  the level of consumer acceptance and demand  the quality and pricing of competitive services  and the performance of ground and space systems and customer terminals 
in order to offer planet sm and ico services  the corporation must obtain certain regulatory approvals see notes and to the financial statements 
in addition  ico must receive the funding required to complete its satellite system 
comsat rsi has been successful in winning new contracts in totaling million  including two programs of strategic significance 
the first is the commercial satellite communications initiative csci contract from the u 
s 
department of defense to provide domestic and international satellite capacity and associated equipment and network management services over a year period 
the second is the asia cellular satellite system aces contract from lockheed martin to provide equipment and services for this regional mobile satellite system 
crsi s backlog rose to million at the end of as compared to million at the end of of the december  backlog  approximately million is expected to be recognized as sales in and approximately million is unfunded 
included in this order backlog is approximately million of us government contracts 
as is customary  these contracts include provisions for cancellation at the convenience of the us government or the prime contractor 
if such a provision were exercised  crsi would have a claim for reimbursement of costs incurred and a reasonable allowance for profit thereon 
the corporation believes that crsi s acquisition of three companies in has positioned crsi for future growth in the vsat  cellular and pcs markets 
earnings growth at crsi  however  will continue to depend upon crsi s ability to contain costs and complete projects with favorable margins 
ascent is expected to continue to derive a majority of its revenues from the hospitality industry video distribution business 
revenue and income growth are expected from the continued installation of ocv systems for new customers 
contracted revenues for video distribution services provided to nbc entered an option phase in which resulted in lower revenues and operating income 
it is expected that revenues and operating income will remain at such levels until the end of the contract in the financial performance of the denver nuggets and the colorado avalanche are  to a large extent  dependent on their performance in their respective leagues 
in addition  due to the limitations of the facilities available at mcnichols arena where both teams currently play  ascent believes that projected increases from facilities based revenues will not keep pace with increases in players salaries  which could result in operating losses for as long as they play in mcnichols arena 
ascent plans to construct a new arena and entertainment complex which is expe ted to result in improved operating results for both teams 
it is estimated that the arena will cost approximately million 
in march  ascent entered into an agreement with the anschutz corporation tac  with which ascent had been jointly developing the proposed arena project  to purchase tac s interests and assets related to the project for million 
as part of the agreement  tac agreed to use reasonable efforts to facilitate the development of the proposed arena 
in connection with this agreement  ascent also purchased tac s limited partnership interest in new elitch gardens  ltd 
elitch gardens  which owns an amusement park in downtown denver  for million 
the purchase of tac s interest in elitch gardens increased ascent s interest from to 
additionally  in march  ascent entered into an agreement with southern pacific transportation company to purchase land in downtown denver for million for the proposed arena site 
the land purchase agreement is subject to several conditions including obtaining reasonable financing and the release of the teams from their current lease at mcnichols arena 
beacon is to begin production on two to three feature films during  one of which may be released in the second half of there is a significant degree of unpredictability and risk associated with theatrical films 
analysis of balance sheets consolidated balance sheets assets 
the corporation ended with  million of assets  a increase over international communications assets excluding unconsolidated investments increased million during to end the year at million 
of the total increase  international ventures invested million in new communications property and equipment 
these additions are needed to meet specific customer requirements for technically advanced applications in developing countries 
the corporation expects to expend up to an additional million in to meet anticipated customer demand in existing ventures and may invest additional amounts if warranted by new opportunities 
cws s assets increased slightly during additions to property and equipment of million  which were principally related to cws s share of intelsat s satellite programs for the vii  vii a and viii series of satellites  were offset by a decrease in ownership of intelsat  plus higher accumulated depreciation 
assets in mobile communications decreased slightly during  ending the year at million 
property and equipment additions of million primarily relate to inmarsat s third generation satellites currently under construction and cmc s increased ownership of inmarsat 
offsetting this increase was a decline in accounts receivable because of lower sales and an increase in accumulated depreciation 
the inmarsat satellite launch program is scheduled to begin in early these satellites will provide increased global capacity to meet anticipated growing demand for services  which includes the commencement of planet sm service 
total assets for technology services increased in by million 
this change was the result of an increase in accounts receivable  because of stronger sales in the fourth quarter  and an increase in assets because of crsi s acquisitions of intelesys  plexsys and jefa 
entertainment assets at year end were million  an increase of million over property and equipment additions of million were primarily related to installations of ocv s on demand video entertainment systems for new hotel customers 
at december   ocv had a backlog of  rooms and expects to continue to make additional investments in these systems during additionally  the increase in assets reflects the acquisition of the colorado avalanche see note to the financial statements 
corporate and other assets include cash and cash equivalents  investments in unconsolidated businesses  corporate owned life insurance policies and certain land  property and equipment 
during  such assets increased by million 
the primary reason for this change was an increase in cash and cash equivalents of million 
additionally  the corporation invested million in ico see note to the financial statements 
liabilities 
the corporation s total liabilities increased in by million 
this increase was primarily the result of the issuance of million of preferred securities by a subsidiary see note to the financial statements  the corporation s share of long term debt issued by intelsat of million  four notes totaling million issued under the corporation s medium term note program and ascent s long term borrowings of million 
analysis of cash flows  liquidity and capital resources cash flows cash from operating activities for was million  a increase over the international communications  mobile communications and entertainment segments generated the majority of the corporation s cash from operations 
the corporation made interest payments  net of amounts capitalized  of million and tax payments of million 
during  the corporation used million in investing activities  a increase over last year 
included under purchases of subsidiaries in was ascent s million purchase of the national hockey league franchise now known as the colorado avalanche 
the increase in in property and equipment came primarily from the international communications businesses  as cws continued to make capital investments equal to its share of intelsat s satellite program  and civ purchased communications plant and equipment  predominantly for latin america ventures 
cash invested in unconsolidated businesses in was primarily the result of the corporation s investment in ico 
the corporation expects to make additional investments in property and equipment in increases are expected in both civ and cmc while lower expenditures are planned for cws 
investments in unconsolidated businesses are expected to increase because of anticipated payments related to the corporation s commitment to invest in ico 
the corporation expects to receive insurance proceeds of approximately million in the second quarter of related to the february launch failure of an intelsat satellite 
cash proceeds from financing activities in were million  a million increase from the previous year 
this increase came from the proceeds from the issuance of million of preferred securities by a subsidiary  increase in long term debt of million and the proceeds of the public offering of ascent stock 
this was offset by the repayment of short term borrowings of million 
dividends of million were paid during the year as compared to million in the quarterly dividend was increased in the second half of from per share to per share 
liquidity and capital resources the corporation s working capital improved from a deficit of million at year end to a positive million at year end this improvement was caused by the increase in cash and cash equivalents of million and the reduction in commercial paper borrowings of million 
the change came primarily from the proceeds from the issuance of preferred securities by a subsidiary and the proceeds from the initial public offering of ascent 
the corporation has access to short and long term financing at favorable rates 
the corporation s current long term debt ratings were downgraded one level in early to a by standard and poor s and to a by moody s 
the corporation s million commercial paper program had no borrowings outstanding as of december  a million credit agreement  expiring in  backs up this commercial paper program 
the corporation s current commercial paper ratings were also downgraded one level in early to a by standard and poor s and to p by moody s 
the corporation had million remaining at year end under a million medium term note program 
the medium term note program is part of a million debt securities shelf registration program initiated in the corporation s debt financing activities are regulated by the fcc 
the corporation submits its financing plans to the fcc for review annually 
under existing fcc guidelines  the corporation is subject to a maximum long term debt to total capital ratio of  a limit of million in short term debt and an interest coverage ratio of to at december   the corporation had long term debt to total capital of  no short term debt outstanding  and was in compliance with the interest coverage ratio 
the corporation expects that cash flows from operations and its short term borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund its cash requirements in
