item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s results of operations are affected by its levels of net interest income  provisions for loan losses  non interest income  non interest expense and income taxes 
the company s results are strongly influenced by the southern california economy in which it operates 
net earnings of million or per share were recorded in net losses of million and million were reported in and  respectively 
on a per share basis  the losses during and were and  respectively 
the company s results over the last three years have been impacted by the prolonged economic recession in southern california 
loan charge offs were million  million  and million during  and  respectively 
the company also transferred million and million to valuation allowances for impaired loans during and  respectively 
loan charge offs during include million in losses directly attributable to the january  earthquake in southern california 
charge offs related to the earthquake during were million 
certain key financial ratios for the company are presented below average return on return on equity to average average average assets equity assets core earnings reflect the company s results from basic operations and were million in  million in and million in core earnings are defined as net interest income before provision for loan losses plus other income excluding gain on sale of loans and securities less non interest expense 
non recurring items are excluded from core earnings 
core earnings decreased in compared to primarily as a result of decreased loan servicing fees due to payoffs of loans serviced for others 
core earnings decreased in compared to primarily due to a decline in net interest income 
non performing assets primarily loans days past due or in foreclosure plus foreclosed real estate were million or of total assets at december  this figure compares to million or of total assets at december  and million or of total assets at december  the increase in non performing assets during was due primarily to growth in foreclosed real estate and a small increase in non performing loans 
the decrease during compared to was due to a bulk sale of million in non performing loans and million in foreclosed real estate 
increased delinquencies and foreclosures resulting from unemployment and decreased real estate values in southern california have impacted the level of non performing assets over the last four years 
the company issued million in year notes during the net proceeds were contributed to the bank as capital 
at december   the bank s regulatory risk based capital ratio increased to and the tangible and core capital ratios increased to 
the bank met the regulatory capital standards to be deemed well capitalized at december  the bank s deposits are insured by the saif up to a maximum of  for each insured depositor 
the fdic administers a separate fund  bif  applicable to commercial banks and certain other non saif insured institutions 
legislation is currently under consideration by congress which includes a one time assessment for saif members such as the bank 
should legislation be enacted in its currently contemplated form  the bank s one time assessment would be approximately million  net of tax  based on the bank s insured deposits at march  and an assumed assessment rate of basis points 
additionally  once the saif has been recapitalized through the one time assessment  the bank s deposit insurance premium assessments would be reduced from the current rate 
the currently proposed legislation has evolved significantly over recent months and may continue to change until final legislation is enacted  if ever 
moreover  there can be no assurance that a premium reduction will occur 
assuming the proposed one time special assessment became law in and was immediately charged against the company s results of operations  the one time assessment would have a material adverse effect on the bank s results of operations 
however  the bank has sufficient regulatory capital to continue to be classified as well capitalized by its regulators following such an assessment 
in addition  the bank would not face any liquidity issues as a result of such an assessment 
proposed legislation is currently under consideration by congress which would significantly change the federal income tax law affecting the bad debt reserves of savings institutions 
this proposed legislation would eliminate the reserve method for computing bad debt deductions beginning in and might require the recapture of bad debt reserves established after under varying factual situations 
the proposed legislation is currently under review and may change significantly before final legislation is enacted  if ever 
risks and uncertainties in the normal course of business  the company encounters two significant types of risk economic risk and regulatory risk 
there are three main components of economic risk interest rate risk  credit risk and market risk 
the company is subject to interest rate risk when its interest earning assets reprice in different time frames  or on a different basis than its interest bearing liabilities 
see asset liability management 
credit risk is the risk of default on the company s loan portfolio that results from the borrowers inability to make contractually required payments 
see loan loss provisions and non performing assets 
market risk reflects changes in the value of the collateral underlying loans receivable and the valuation of real estate held by the company 
the determination of the allowance for loan losses and the valuation of real estate collateral is based on estimates that are susceptible to changes in the economic environment and market conditions 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses as of december  was adequate based on information available at that time 
a continuation of the current economic climate could increase the likelihood of losses due to credit and market risks 
this could create the need for additional loan loss provisions 
regulatory risk is the risk that the regulators will reach different conclusions than management regarding the financial position of the company 
the ots examines the bank s financial results annually 
the ots reviews the allowance for loan losses and may require the bank to adjust the allowance based on information available at the time of their examination 
other risks the bank has been named as a defendant in various lawsuits  none of which is expected to have a materially adverse effect on the company 
the outcome of the lawsuits cannot be predicted but the bank intends to vigorously defend the actions 
inflation substantially impacts the financial position and operations of financial intermediaries  such as banks and savings institutions 
these entities primarily hold monetary assets and liabilities and  as such  can experience significant purchasing power gains and losses over relatively short periods of time 
in addition  interest rate changes during inflationary periods change the amounts and composition of assets and liabilities held by financial intermediaries and could result in regulatory pressure for additional equity investment 
components of earnings net interest income net interest income is the primary component of the company s earnings 
the chief determinants of net interest income are the dollar amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid thereon 
the greater the excess of average interest earning assets over average interest bearing liabilities  the more beneficial the impact on net interest income 
the excess of average interest earning assets over average interest bearing liabilities was million in  million in and million in the improvement in compared to was due to increased average earning assets  as a result of a decline in average non performing assets 
the compression in was due to the company s net loss in that year  offset by a small decrease in average non performing assets 
the company s net interest income is also impacted by a three month time lag before changes in the cost of funds can be passed along to monthly adjustable rate loan customers 
savings and borrowing costs adjust to market rates immediately while it takes several months for the loan yield to adjust 
this time lag decreases the company s net interest income during periods of rising interest rates 
the reverse is true during periods of declining interest rates 
see asset liability management for further discussion 
the following table sets forth the components of interest earning assets and liabilities  the excess of interest earning assets over interest bearing liabilities  the yields earned and rates paid and net interest income for the periods indicated dollars in thousands average loans and mortgage backed securities    average investment securities    average interest earning assets    average savings deposits    average borrowings    average interest bearing liabilities    excess of interest earning assets over interest bearing liabilities    yields earned on average interest earning assets rates paid on average interest bearing liabilities net interest rate spread effective net spread total interest income    total interest expense    net interest income    non accrual loans were included in the average dollar amount of loans outstanding but no income was recognized during the period that each such loan was on non accrual status 
dividends on fhlb stock and miscellaneous interest income and expense were not considered in this analysis 
the net interest spread decreased in compared to primarily due to higher interest rates paid during although the frb decreased its federal funds rate by in july and december of  these adjustments only offset the increase that occurred in february of the same year 
the frb increased interest rates six times during by  however  interest rates were at their lowest point in several years at the beginning of the dollar amount of net interest income remained virtually unchanged during compared to because the impact of the lower net interest spread during was offset by growth in average interest earning assets 
average interest earning assets increased during compared to due to substantial new loan originations which occurred late in average interest earning assets also increased during compared to due to improvement in average non performing assets which decreased to in from in the table below sets forth certain information regarding changes in the interest income and interest expense of the bank for the periods indicated

dividends on federal home loan bank stock and miscellaneous interest income and expense were not considered in this analysis 
interest expense on borrowings includes accruals of million  million and million  during  and  respectively  for amounts potentially due as a result of irs and california franchise tax board audits 
the company provides for interest on the disputed items based on relevant tax rulings and case law as well as the progression of the audit at the appeals office of the irs

weighted average yield on all interest earning assets less weighted average rate paid on all interest bearing liabilities 
loss provisions the company recorded million in loan loss provisions during due to continued weakness in the southern california real estate markets 
another million in loss provisions were recorded as an adjustment to gain loss on sale of loans 
this compares with million recorded in and million in the company recorded its largest provisions for loan losses during and in response to the economic recession in southern california 
the provision also includes amounts provided for losses resulting from the earthquake which occurred in southern california on january  the bank has a policy of providing for general valuation allowances  unallocated to any specific loan  but available to offset any future loan losses 
the allowance is maintained at an amount that management believes adequate to cover estimable and probable loan losses 
general valuation allowances totaled million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the decrease in general valuation allowances from to is consistent with the decrease in charge offs from of average loans outstanding in to of average loans outstanding in the company also maintains valuation allowances for impaired loans and loans sold with recourse 
see allowances for loan losses 
management performs regular risk assessments of the bank s loan portfolio to maintain appropriate general valuation allowances 
additional loan loss provisions may also be required to the extent that charge offs are recorded against the valuation allowance for impaired loans or the general valuation allowance 
loan charge offs decreased to million in from million in and million in charge offs for include million directly related to the earthquake 
charge offs for include million directly related to the earthquake 
charge offs are due primarily to declines in the estimated value of the underlying collateral of the bank s loans 
the southern california area has experienced declines in real estate values and other economic problems for the past several years resulting from increased unemployment  reductions in defense spending and natural disasters 
multi family properties have been particularly affected in the current recession 
the bank s loan portfolio excluding mortgage backed securities of which is secured by multi family properties  has required additional loss provisions primarily due to these recessionary factors 
non interest income loan and other fees decreased to million in compared to million in and million in primarily as a result of decreased servicing income due to prepayments in the portfolio of loans serviced for others and decreased miscellaneous loan fees due to the decline in loan originations in compared to and gain loss on sale of loans and mortgage backed securities decreased to a loss of million in from gains of thousand in and million in the loss includes a million provision for loans that had been sold with recourse in prior years 
the gain includes a million gain on the sale of a mortgage backed security from the bank s available for sale portfolio 
loans originated for sale declined during and due to increased mortgage banking competition in the current economic environment 
real estate operations resulted in a net gain of million in compared to a net gain of million in and a net loss of thousand in the gains recorded in and resulted primarily from the recovery of excess valuation allowances upon the sale of foreclosed properties 
losses recorded in resulted primarily from the operation of foreclosed properties prior to sale 
the bank normally sells foreclosed properties within a few months after acquisition  usually after the properties have been rehabilitated 
other operating income  which increased to million in from million in and million in  consists primarily of fees earned for services provided by the retail savings branches 
fees earned by retail savings branches increased in compared to directly as a result of management efforts to improve fee income 
other operating income during includes additional trustee fees earned due to the high level of foreclosures in that year 
non interest expense non interest expense decreased to of average total assets in from of average total assets in and of total assets in the decreasing trend in non interest expense over the last three years resulted from management s ongoing cost control programs 
salary and benefit costs increased only in compared to decreased salary and related payroll and benefit insurance costs caused by attrition were offset by year end performance bonuses and an increase in the contribution to the employee stock ownership plan esop 
the decrease in compared to was due to lower amounts contributed to the bonus and profit sharing plans in occupancy expense decreased in compared to due to decreased maintenance and equipment costs and the consolidation of existing loan offices 
occupancy expense increased by in compared to due to rent escalation clauses 
one loan office was closed and consolidated with an existing loan office in two loan offices were closed and consolidated with existing loan offices during other operating expenses decreased in compared to due primarily to lower insurance  legal and contribution expenses 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to increased data processing  goodwill and insurance costs 
advertising expense decreased by in and in due to cost containment efforts and the realignment of costs to reflect business activity in and federal deposit insurance increased by in compared to due to a higher average assessment rate in compared to the increase of in compared to was due to growth in average savings deposits 
the following table details the components of non interest expense for the periods indicated non interest expense year ended december  dollars in thousands salaries and employee benefits salaries      incentive compensation     payroll taxes     employee benefit insurance      bonus compensation    profit sharing   pension other salaries and benefits  occupancy rent      equipment     maintenance costs other occupancy  other operating expense insurance goodwill data processing     contributions professional services supervisory exam other operating costs      federal deposit insurance      advertising      total      non interest expense as of average assets balance sheet analysis consolidated assets at the end of were billion  slightly less than billion at the end of the decline in consolidated assets during was the result of sales of loans and a reduction in investment securities 
also  loan originations during were substantially offset by loan payoffs during the year 
assets increased in compared to due to growth in the loan portfolio 
loan portfolio at the end of  of the bank s loan portfolio was adjustable based on monthly changes in the eleventh district federal home loan bank cost of funds index 
the bank has maintained the level of adjustable loans in its portfolio at over for the last several years 
management believes that the high level of adjustable rate mortgages will help insulate the bank from fluctuations in interest rates  notwithstanding the several month lag between a change in its monthly cost of funds and a corresponding change in its loan rates 
see asset liability management 
the board of directors authorized the origination of fixed rate loans up to an aggregate limit of million 
management believes that the limited origination of fixed rate loans will enhance the company s overall return on assets and improve loan originations in this economy 
the initial interest rate is fixed for  or years 
at the end of the fixed period  the interest rate becomes adjustable based upon changes in the one month libor 
loans originated under this program in were insignificant 
the bank began a mortgage banking program near the end of to take advantage of borrower demand for fixed rate and other loan products not kept in its loan portfolio 
under this program  competitively priced loans are originated for immediate sale in the secondary market 
to date  no significant amounts of loans have been originated for this program due to decreased borrower demand for real estate loans in the current recession 
loans sold under the mortgage banking program totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
loans originated and purchased totaled million in  million in and million in included in the amount is million in single family adjustable rate mortgages purchased from other financial institutions 
in  loans made on the security of single family properties one to four units comprised of the dollar amount of new loan originations  loans made on the security of multi family properties comprised of new originations  and loans made on the security of commercial real estate properties comprised less than of new originations 
no construction loans and an insignificant amount of consumer loans were originated in adjustable rate mortgages comprised of new loan activity during compared to in the following table details loan originations by loan type for the periods indicated loan originations by type year ended december  dollars in thousands single family one to four units      multi family      commercial      other    total      loans originated upon the sale of the bank s real estate owned were million or of total originations in million of these loans were originated based on the security of single family properties  million were originated based on the security of multi family properties and million were based on the security of commercial properties 
the bank converted million of its loans into mortgage backed securities in for use in securitized borrowings reverse repurchase agreements 
in  million in loans were securitized compared with million in securitized loans have a lower risk weighting for regulatory risk based capital purposes 
in exchange for the enhanced credit risk associated with mortgage backed securities  the bank pays guarantee fees to fhlmc and or fnma 
the bank s adjustable rate loan products often provide for first year monthly payments that are lower than the fully indexed interest and principal due 
any interest not fully paid by such lower first year payments is added to the principal balance of the loan 
this causes negative amortization until payments increase to cover interest and principal shortfalls 
due to negative amortization  loan to value ratios may increase above those calculated at the inception of the loan 
to date  the bank s foreclosure experience on loans with negative amortization has been no different from that on the fully amortizing portfolio 
the amount of negative amortization recorded by the bank decreases in periods of declining interest rates and increases during periods of increasing interest rates 
the balance of negative amortization on all loans serviced by the bank was million at december  compared to thousand at december  and thousand at december  the bank does not normally lend in excess of of the appraised collateral value on adjustable mortgage loans amls 
where the bank does lend in excess of of the appraised value  additional fees and rates are charged and there is no initial below market interest rate 
mortgage insurance is required on loans in excess of or premium rates and or fees are charged if the mortgage insurance requirement is waived 
subsequent to the origination of a loan  the bank may purchase private mortgage insurance with its own funds 
loans originated under this program for which there is no private mortgage insurance totaled million at december  compared to million at december  and million at december  see business interest rates  terms and fees 
loan composition loans based on the security of single family properties one to four units comprise the largest category of the bank s loan portfolio including mortgage backed securities 
the loan portfolio also includes loans secured by multi family and commercial properties 
at december   approximately of the loan and mortgage backed securities portfolio consisted of first liens on single family properties 
first liens on multi family properties comprised approximately of the portfolio  and first liens on commercial properties represented approximately of the portfolio 
multi family and commercial real estate loans are considered more susceptible to market risk than single family loans and higher interest rates and fees are charged to borrowers for these loans 
due to inadequate market pricing  management elected to de emphasize the origination of multi family loans starting in and continuing in approximately of loan originations in were multi family loans compared with during multi family loans originated upon the sale of real estate were approximately and of total loan originations during and  respectively 
the bank has not emphasized the origination of commercial real estate loans for several years 
the bank also has loss exposure on certain loans sold with recourse 
these loans are substantially all secured by multi family properties 
loans sold with recourse totaled million as of december   million as of december   and million as of december  although no longer owned by the bank  these loans are combined with the bank s loan portfolio for purposes of computing general valuation allowances and measuring risk exposure for regulatory capital purposes 
under the bank s current policy  it no longer enters into loans sold with recourse agreements

non performing assets non performing assets  as defined by the bank  include loans delinquent over days or in foreclosure  real estate acquired in settlement of loans  and other loans less than days delinquent but for which collectibility is questionable

the decrease in non performing loans in compared to was due primarily to a million bulk sale of non performing loans 
the increase in real estate owned in compared to was due to additional foreclosures on single family and commercial real estate loans 
the decrease in real estate owned in compared to was due to a decline in foreclosure activity 
also  million in foreclosed real estate was sold as part of a bulk sale in single family non performing loans are primarily due to recession related factors such as layoffs  decreased incomes and decreased real estate values 
multi family and commercial non performing loans are attributable primarily to economic factors  declines in occupancy rates  and decreased real estate values 
the bank actively monitors the status of all non performing loans 
the bank implemented statement of financial standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan sfas no 
 as of january  and statement of financial standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures sfas no 
 as of january  impaired loans totaled million and million  net of related allowances of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
see business risk elements for a further discussion of impaired loans 
the bank has debt restructurings which result from temporary modifications of principal and interest payments 
under these arrangements  loan terms are typically reduced to no less than a required monthly interest payment 
any loss of revenues under the modified terms would be immaterial to the bank 
if the borrower is unable to return to scheduled principal and interest payments at the end of the modification period  foreclosure procedures are initiated  or  in certain circumstances  the modification period is extended 
as of december   the bank had modified loans totaling million  net of loan loss allowances 
this compares with million  net  as of december  modified loans included in the impaired loan totals above totaled million  net  and million  net  as of december  and  respectively 
no modified loans were days or more delinquent as of december  or allowances for loan losses for an analysis of the changes in the loan loss allowances  see business risk elements 
at december   the general allowance for loan losses was million or of the bank s assets with loss exposure 
this compares to at the end of and at the end of in addition to the general allowance for loan losses and the allowance for impaired loans mentioned above  the bank also maintains an allowance for loans sold with recourse 
these allowances amounted to  and of loans sold with recourse at december   and  respectively 
management considers the current level of loss allowances adequate to cover the bank s loss exposure at this time 
however  there can be no assurance that future additions to loan loss allowances will not be required 
capital resources and liquidity liquidity requirements ots regulations require a savings association to maintain a specified ratio of cash and short term united states government and other specified investment securities to net withdrawable deposits and borrowings payable in one year or less 
this liquidity requirement is based upon average liquidity balances maintained during each month and may vary from time to time  depending upon economic conditions and deposit flows 
the liquidity requirement is currently 
for the periods ended december  and  the bank s regulatory liquidity ratios were and  respectively 
external sources of funds external sources of funds include savings deposits  loan sales  advances from the fhlbsf and reverse repurchase agreements reverse repos 
for purposes of funding asset growth  the source or sources of funds with the lowest total cost for the desired term are generally selected 
the funding sources used most often during were fhlb advances and reverse repos 
deposits obtained from national brokerage firms brokered deposits are considered a source of funds similar to a borrowing 
since the bank achieved the capital ratios necessary to be deemed well capitalized during  brokered deposits can be obtained at the bank s discretion as long as applicable capital standards are met 
previously  the bank obtained brokered deposits pursuant to a waiver of regulatory requirements from the fdic 
in evaluating brokered deposits as a source of funds  the cost of these deposits  including commission costs  is compared to other funding sources 
brokered deposits were million at december  this compares to million at december  and million at december  deposits at retail savings offices have remained steady at billion for the last three years 
the bank experienced million in deposit outflows from savings offices during due to the availability of alternate investments paying higher returns to customers and intense competition for deposits by other financial institutions 
the bank also solicits deposits through telemarketing efforts 
telemarketing deposits are obtained by the bank s employees via telephone  principally from pension funds 
telemarketing deposits increased by to million at the end of from million at the end of the level of telemarketing deposits varies based on the availability of higher yielding investments to investors  who are usually managers of pension funds 
the availability of telemarketing deposits also varies based on the investors perception of the bank s creditworthiness 
telemarketing deposits were million at the end of reverse repos are short term borrowings secured by mortgage backed securities 
these borrowings increased to million at the end of from million at the end of reverse repos at the end of were million 
million in loans were securitized during to increase the availability of this type of borrowing 
fhlb advances increased to million at the end of from million at the end of advances at the end of totaled million 
advances increased during because these were often the most available source to the bank 
sales of loans were million during this compares to million during and million sold during the volume of loans sold varies with the amount of saleable loans originated 
loans originated for sale in the secondary market decreased during consistent with the overall decline in loan originations 
the bank sold million in non performing loans under a bulk sale arrangement during the sales figure includes the sale of a million mortgage backed security 
internal sources of funds internal sources of funds include scheduled loan principal payments  loan payoffs  and positive cash flows from operations 
principal payments were million in compared with million in and million in principal payments include both amortization and prepayments and are a function of real estate activity and the general level of interest rates 
capital requirements current regulatory capital standards require that the bank maintain tangible capital of at least of total assets  core capital of of total assets  and risk based capital of of total assets  risk weighted 
among other things  failure to comply with these capital standards will result in restrictions on asset growth and necessitate the preparation of a capital plan  subject to regulatory approval 
generally  any institution with a risk based capital ratio in excess of and a core capital ratio greater than is considered well capitalized for regulatory purposes 
institutions who maintain this capital level can take in brokered deposits at their discretion  and if they achieve a sufficient ranking on their regulatory examination  may be assessed a lower deposit insurance rate 
effective january   institutions whose exposure to interest rate risk as determined by the ots is deemed to be above normal may be required to hold additional risk based capital 
as of december   the bank was not required to hold additional capital as a result of this regulation 
management presently intends to maintain its capital position at levels above those required by regulators to ensure operating flexibility and growth capacity for the bank 
the bank s capital position is actively monitored 
in september of  the company issued million in year notes 
the proceeds from these notes were contributed to the bank as capital 
see business borrowings 
the bank met the regulatory capital standards to be deemed well capitalized at december  the bank met all three capital requirements at the end of as indicated by the chart below regulatory capital requirement ratio tangible capital core capital risk based capital asset liability management the bank s asset liability management policy is designed to improve the balance between the maturities and repricings of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in order to better insulate net earnings from interest rate fluctuations 
under this program  the bank emphasizes the funding of monthly adjustable mortgages with short term savings and borrowings and matching the maturities of these assets and liabilities 
the majority of the bank s assets are monthly adjustable rate mortgages with interest rates that fluctuate based on changes in the federal home loan bank of san francisco eleventh district cost of funds index index 
these mortgages constitute over of the loan portfolio at the end of comparisons over the last several years show that changes in the bank s cost of funds generally correlate with changes in the index 
the bank does not use any futures  options or swaps in its asset liability strategy 
assets and liabilities which are subject to repricing are considered rate sensitive 
the mismatch in the repricing of rate sensitive assets and liabilities is referred to as a company s gap 
the gap is positive if rate sensitive assets exceed rate sensitive liabilities 
generally  a positive gap benefits a company during periods of increasing interest rates 
the reverse is true during periods of decreasing interest rates 
however  because the index lags changes in market interest rates by three months while the bank s short term savings and borrowing costs adjust immediately  the bank s net interest income initially decreases during periods of rising interest rates and increases during periods of declining interest rates 
in order to minimize the impact of rate fluctuations on earnings  management s goal is to keep the one year gap at less than of total assets positive or negative 
at december   the company s one year gap was a positive million or of total assets 
this compares with positive gap ratios of and of total assets at december  and december   respectively
