somatogen  inc 
at june   the company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately  under the federal income tax laws  approximately  of these loss carryforwards cannot be utilized due to prior changes in stock ownership 
the remainder of the loss carryforwards will expire in the years through future changes in stock ownership could result in a further limitation on the utilization of present and future loss carryforwards 
the company also has research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately  which expire in the years through deferred tax assets have been reduced to the amount realizable  zero  by a valuation allowance based on the company s history of losses 
liquidity and capital resources somatogen s operations to date have consumed substantial amounts of cash 
negative cash flow from operations is expected to increase during fiscal compared to the levels experienced in fiscal  and to increase in subsequent fiscal years as the clinical trials for optro increase in scope and the preclinical and clinical studies of new products are undertaken 
somatogen will need to raise significant additional funds in order to fund the company s future operations and capital expenditures prior to commercialization of the company s products 
the company has relied primarily on public and private offerings of equity and cost sharing and equity investments pursuant to the lilly alliance to fund its operations and upon equipment leasing arrangements to finance the acquisition of capital equipment for the company s laboratory and pilot manufacturing facilities 
at june  the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of  the company s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased approximately  during fiscal this increase is primarily due to cash proceeds provided from the issuance of common stock offset partially by the use of cash for operations 
somatogen  inc 
in september  the company commenced construction of a clinical manufacturing facility 
the company had also acquired land for  and begun the design of  a larger commercial manufacturing facility 
in conjunction with entering into the lilly alliance  an evaluation of the company s future manufacturing requirements was completed and construction of the clinical manufacturing facility was discontinued 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recognized a non recurring charge  which was principally non cash  associated with the writedown of its clinical and commercial manufacturing assets of approximately  the components of the charge included approximately  for the clinical manufacturing facility   for related manufacturing equipment and approximately  for engineering design costs for the proposed commercial manufacturing facility 
land and building related to manufacturing facilities and the related manufacturing equipment aggregating  are classified in somatogen s balance sheet as assets held for sale 
for the year ended june   the company realized  in proceeds from the sale of clinical manufacturing assets 
at june   approximately  was recorded as an accrual related to obligations resulting from the discontinuance of construction of the clinical manufacturing facility and related activities 
at june   the balance of this accrual is  the company believes the aggregate carrying value of all assets held for sale approximates the assets net realizable value  however  the company continues to monitor estimated realizable values on a quarterly basis 
there can be no assurance that the company will realize the aggregate carrying value of assets held for sale 
proceeds from such asset sales are being used for general corporate purposes 
the company historically has leased a significant portion of the equipment used in its laboratory and pilot manufacturing facilities 
as of june   the company had outstanding capital lease obligations of  additionally  the company had aggregate future operating lease obligations of approximately  at june  the company spent  during the year ended june  for the purchase of capital equipment and leasehold improvements

during the fiscal year beginning july   the company s operating requirements include increases in research and development costs  including costs related to clinical trials and product development and manufacturing 
the company s capital spending program includes purchases of additional equipment for its research and development laboratories and pilot manufacturing facility 
in subsequent fiscal years  the company s operating requirements will include continuing increases in research and development funding to cover the costs of expanded preclinical and clinical trials and product development  including reimbursements to lilly  as well as general  administrative  marketing and distribution expenses 
in order to meet its long term financing requirements  the company may pursue a number of financing alternatives  including public and or private offerings of securities and additional strategic alliances 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to raise additional financing from any of such sources  or that any additional funding which may become available to the company will be on acceptable terms 
the company s ability to raise additional financing may be dependent on many factors beyond the company s control  including the state of the capital markets and the rate of progress of the company s clinical field trials 
any additional financing that the company may be able to obtain could result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available  the company will be required to significantly curtail operations 
any such action could impact the company s research and development programs  including the company s clinical field trial program 
any of these events could adversely affect the company s ability to commercialize its products 
cash requirements for the company may vary materially from those now planned due to results of research and development  results of clinical testing  changes in focus and direction of the company s research and development programs  manufacturing processes  competitive and technological advances  the fda regulatory process  changes in the company s marketing and distribution strategy and other factors
