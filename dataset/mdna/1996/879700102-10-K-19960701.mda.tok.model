see factors that may affect future results below and cautionary statements appearing under item business and elsewhere in this form k for a discussion of the important factors affecting the realization of those results 
overview fiscal results represented a continuation of the revenue and earnings growth which began in late fiscal in fiscal  revenues increased as compared to fiscal while costs and operating expenses decreased as a percentage of total revenues for the same period 
for fiscal  the company reported net income of million  or per share 
this compares to a net income of million or 
per share for fiscal inflation has not had a significant impact on consolidated results of operations 
the company anticipates its first half of fiscal results to reflect approximately revenue growth and a loss of approximately 
per share due to changing market conditions as described below 
the company anticipates a return to profitability in the second half of fiscal the company s continuing strategic objectives are to increase revenues and market penetration while reducing costs as a percentage of total revenues  to drive new product development and use vertical systems groups to expand into targeted markets 
the company s goal is to deliver profitable growth and increased stockholder value over the coming years 
the company operates in a rapidly changing and dynamic market  and the company s strategies and plans are designed to adapt to changing market conditions where and when possible 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s strategies and plans will take into account all market conditions and changes thereto 
accordingly  the historical results presented in the company s consolidated financial statements and discussed herein are not necessarily indicative of future results 
see factors that may affect future results for a discussion of risk factors which may affect the company s future results of operations 
factors that may affect future results the risks and other important factors which may affect the company s business  operating results  and financial and other condition include  without limitation  the following the company s results of operations are affected by a variety of factors  including economic conditions specific to the industries in which it competes  decreases in average selling price over the life of any particular product  the timing  manufacturing complexity and expense of new product introductions both by the company and its competitors  the timely implementation of new manufacturing technologies  the ability to safeguard patents and other intellectual property in a rapidly evolving market  the rapid increase in demand for some products and the rapid decline in demand for others and the company s ability to anticipate and plan for that changing market demand 
certain of these factors are beyond the company s control 
the company s shipments during any particular quarter generally represent orders received either during that quarter or shortly before the beginning of that quarter 
the company endeavors to maintain sufficient levels of purchased components to meet the delivery requirements of its customers 
however  there can be no assurance that during any given quarter  the company has or can procure the appropriate mix of purchased components to accommodate any given order 
therefore  the company s financial performance in any quarter is dependent to a significant degree upon obtaining orders which can be manufactured and delivered to its customers in that quarter 
financial performance for any given quarter cannot be known or fully assessed until near the end of that quarter 
the company has historically recognized a substantial portion of its product revenues in the last month of each quarter 
a significant portion of the company s expenses are relatively fixed  and timing of increases in such expenses is based in large part on the company s forecast of future revenues 
as a result  if revenues do not meet expectations  the company may be unable to quickly adjust expenses to levels appropriate to actual revenues  which could have a materially adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the markets in which the company competes are intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change  introduction of new products with improved performance characteristics  product obsolescence and price erosion 
failure to keep pace with product and technological advances could negatively affect the company s competitive position and prospects for growth 
customers anticipation of new or enhanced product offerings by the company or a competitor may lead them to defer purchases of the company s existing products 
in addition  companies that are participants in the broader computer industry are potential competitors 
some of the company s competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  intellectual property  marketing and human resources than the company 
the company s future success depends on its ability to develop and rapidly bring to market technologically advanced products 
from time to time the company invests in development stage and other entities who possess or who could potentially possess strategically important technologies 
due to the nature of these entities and the nature of their operations  there can be no assurance that these investments will be realizable or will result in marketable and or successful products 
there can be no assurance that the company s research and development activities will lead to the commercially successful introduction of new or improved products or that the company will not encounter delays or problems in connection therewith 
the cost of perfecting new and improved technologies to satisfy customer quality and delivery expectations as they are brought to market cannot always be fully anticipated and may adversely affect company operating profits during such introductions 
in addition  the average selling prices for computer products generally decrease over the products lives 
to mitigate such decreases  the company seeks to reduce manufacturing costs of existing products and to introduce new products  functions and other price performance enhancing features 
to the extent these do not occur on a timely basis  the company s operating results could be materially adversely affected 
to date  the company s revenues have been concentrated in the retail industry  historically representing over of its total revenues 
the company s future growth depends  in part  on its ability to successfully penetrate and expand its revenues in new markets 
there can be no assurance that such penetration and expansion into new markets can be achieved 
the company believes its future success is also dependent  in part  upon its ability to continue to enhance and broaden its current line of products through internal development and the acquisition of new businesses and technologies  but there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify  acquire or profitably operate new businesses or otherwise implement its growth strategy successfully 
for the company to manage its growth and integrate any newly acquired entities  it must continue to improve operations and financial and management information systems and effectively motivate and manage employees 
if the company is unable to successfully pursue and manage such growth  its business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
the company regards certain of its hardware and software technologies as proprietary and relies on a combination of united states and foreign patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as  license and other contractual confidentiality provisions  to protect its proprietary rights 
despite the company s efforts to safeguard its proprietary rights  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in doing so or that the company s competitors will not independently develop or patent technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to or otherwise circumvent the company s technologies and proprietary rights 
the company s products utilize hardware and software technologies licensed from third parties 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to license needed technology in the future 
an early termination of certain of these license agreements including patent rights licensed from symbol technologies  inc  one of its principal competitors  necessary for the company s manufacture and sale of its integrated laser scanning terminals which account for a material portion of the company s current sales could have a materially adverse effect on the company s ability to market certain of its products  hence  on its business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company believes that its products  processes and trademarks do not infringe on the rights of third parties  but there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement or other related claims against the company or its licensors in the future 
any infringement claim or related litigation against the company  or any challenge to the validity of the company s own intellectual property rights  and the expense of defending the same could materially adversely effect the company s ability to market its products and hence  on its business  results of operations and financial condition 
certain components and sub assemblies of the company s products are procured from outside the united states 
certain of the company s products  sub assemblies and components are procured from a single source supplier and others are procured from only a limited number of suppliers 
the company has in the past encountered  and may in the future encounter  shortages of supplies and delays in deliveries of necessary components 
such shortages and delays could have a materially adverse effect on the company s ability to ship products 
as a substantial portion of the company s total revenues  ranging from approximately in recent years  is from customers located outside of the united states  the company s results could be negatively affected by global and regional economic conditions  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  trade protection measures  regulatory acceptance of the company s products in foreign countries  longer accounts receivable collection patterns and other considerations peculiar to the conduct of international business 
the company is subject to similar risks in its procurement of certain of its materials and components from foreign sources 
certain of the company s products intentionally transmit radio signals as part of their normal operation 
these products are subject to regulatory approval  restrictions on the use of certain frequencies and the creation of interference  and other requirements by the federal communications commission fcc and corresponding authorities in each country in which they are marketed 
regulatory changes could significantly impact the company s operations by restricting the company s development efforts  obsoleting current products or increasing the opportunity for additional competition 
the intentional emission of electromagnetic radiation has also been the subject of recent public concern regarding possible health and safety risks  and though the company believes that the low power output and the distance typically maintained between a product and the user means that its products do not pose material safety concerns  there can be no assurance that such safety issues will not arise in the future and will not have a materially adverse effect on the company s business 
among other things  the company s future depends in large part on the continued service of its key technical  marketing and management personnel and on its ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees  particularly those highly skilled design  process and test engineers involved in the manufacture of existing products and the development of products and processes 
the competition for such personnel is intense  and the loss of key employees could have a materially adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to the factors discussed above and elsewhere in this form k which may adversely affect the company s conduct of its business and the results thereof  the company s financial condition is also subject to the possible adverse effects of certain pending litigation and other contingencies discussed above under item legal proceedings  and in note to the financial statements included below in item below  in this form k
