initial sales of the company s das ship docking aid system and increased volume sales of the company s traffic safety and survey and mapping products comprised the majority of the increase in sales in as compared to as a result of initial revenues realized from sales of the company s das ship docking aid systems in fiscal  sales of the company s traffic safety products  as a percentage of net sales  were in as compared to in  and sales of the company s survey and mapping products  as a percentage of net sales  were in compared to in management anticipates that sales of its das will greatly fluctuate between financial periods due to the specialized nature of the system 
sales of the company s survey and mapping products increased in as compared to  primarily due to the introduction of the company s impulse series of survey lasers during the fourth quarter of fiscal net sales of the company s traffic safety products increased in compared to increased volume sales of the company s laser digicam photo laser system internationally offset a decrease in hand held marksman sales 
domestic hand held marksman sales declined slightly during the third quarter of due to what management believes is the effect of government purchasing deferrals related to prolonged delays in the international association of chiefs of police iacp standardization tests of laser based technology for use in speed enforcement 
in april  the company s hand held marksman laser speed detection system was certified by the iacp to meet the federal standard for laser speed detection devices 
upon receiving iacp certification  the marksman was subsequently placed on the iacp approved products list 
this list is comprised of speed enforcement products which have passed the national standard 
management anticipates that placement on the iacp approved products list will allow federal funds from the united states department of transportation to become more accessible for law enforcement agencies to purchase the marksman 
because the approval occurred so late in the year  management believes that law enforcement agencies are deferring purchases of the company s marksman hand held laser speed detection system until their next budget cycle in order to purchase them with the aid of federal funding  although there is no assurance of this 
international sales comprised in compared to in due to increased foreign sales of the company s laser digicam photo laser system and criterion and impulse survey lasers 
historically  the company experiences quarterly fluctuations in it s foreign sales due to the placement of typically large orders for the company s marksman and laser digicam traffic safety products 
management anticipates that foreign sales of its traffic safety and survey and mapping product lines will continue to comprise a significant portion of its revenues 
the company currently requires that all international sales be paid for with us dollars 
cost of goods sold increased to  in from  in due to increased sales levels 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold decreased slightly to in from in  thus improving the company s gross profit margin  as a percentage of net sales  to in compared to in the increase in gross profit margins in resulted primarily from higher gross margins on initial sales of the das management recognizes that competitive pressure may affect the company s gross profit margins 
however  such impact from reduced selling prices is expected to be offset by reduced manufacturing costs through second generation instrumentation and a better application of fixed costs as the company s sales volumes increase 
the company anticipates that gross profit margins from international markets will remain consistent with those realized domestically in most international markets for the company s current product lines 
however  management believes that gross profit margins on high volume international sales of its marksman laser speed detection systems may be less than those realized domestically due to reduced selling prices on high volume orders 
the company currently minimizes the effect of currency fluctuations by requiring payment in us funds

foreign sales foreign sales of the company s products equalled for both fiscal years ended september  and for the year ended september   the company s foreign sales comprised due to increased sales of the company s laser digicam system  part of the company s traffic safety product line 
management believes that foreign sales of the company s products will continue to comprise a significant portion of its revenues 
the company requires that all international sales be paid for with us dollars 
an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could make the company s products less competitive in those markets 
research and development costs research and development costs related to the continual development of the company s laser measurement instruments are expensed as incurred and included in operating expenses 
research and development costs totalled approximately   and  for the years ended september   and  respectively 
year to year increases in research and development expenditures are primarily attributable to increased personnel costs related to increased personnel requirements
