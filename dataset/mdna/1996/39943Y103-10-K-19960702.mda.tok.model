seasonality and inflation group in the past has experienced greater sales and earnings in the january march quarter  the fourth quarter of its fiscal year  although there can be no certainty that this will occur in the future 
this seasonal factor is believed to be attributable to buying patterns of major accounts and also to a fiscal year incentive program for company sales representatives 
group s revenue and resultant earnings have shown substantial variation on a quarter to quarter basis 
a substantial portion of revenue in any given quarter is comprised of a relatively limited number of high value software license agreements 
these license agreements represent the culmination of a sales cycle averaging three to six months 
any significant lengthening in the sales cycle can have the effect of moving revenue from one quarter into the next  contributing to quarter to quarter variations 
prices remain stable for group s products

deferred revenues increased cash by  and other working capital items increased cash provided by operating activities by  cash flows from investing activities are primarily expenditures for investments in software development and capital equipment of  cash of  was generated from the sale of marketable securities 
proceeds from the exercise of the company s stock options generated cash of  long term debt was reduced by  and dividends of  were paid

the installment receivable balance  in addition to group s policy of offering competitive trade terms of payment  make it difficult to accurately portray a relationship between the outstanding accounts receivable balance and the current year revenues 
group continually evaluates the credit and market risks associated with outstanding receivables 
in the course of this review  group considers many factors specific to the individual client as well as to the concentration of receivables within industry groups 
group s installment receivables are predominately with clients service bureaus who provide computer services to the direct marketing industry 
many of these clients have limited capital and insufficient assets to secure their liability with group the service bureaus are highly dependent on group s software and services to offer their customers the economic benefit of postal discounts and mailing efficiency 
to qualify for the us postal service and canada post corporation postal discounts  service bureaus require continuous regulatory product updates from group the service bureau industry is also highly competitive and subject to general economic cycles  as they impact advertising and direct marketing expenditures 
group is aware of no current market risk associated with the installment receivables 
service bureaus represent approximately  or  of the installment receivables at march  as of march   the company s capital resource commitments consisted primarily of non cancelable operating lease commitments for office space and equipment 
the company believes that its current debt services  minimum lease obligations and other short term and long term liquidity needs can be met from cash flows from operations 
the company believes that its long term liquidity needs are minimal and no large capital expenditures are anticipated  except for the continuing investment in capitalized software development costs which the company believes can be funded from operations 
historically  the company has been able to negotiate capital leases for its acquisition of equipment
