ahmanson company accelerated its drive to become a leading  full service consumer bank 
the company made important progress in transforming itself from a traditional savings and loan institution to a consumer bank that can compete effectively in the rapidly evolving financial services marketplace 
several key factors are in its favor 
home savings of america  its principal operating unit  holds an enviable customer franchise high name recognition in its primary markets  a reputation for integrity and service  a strong capital position  and financial service centers in california  florida  texas and arizona  as well as lending offices in ten states 
the company is focused on being a profitable consumer bank rather than america s largest thrift 
home savings asset size may well decrease over time as the company repositions itself from a traditional portfolio mortgage lender  in which virtually all adjustable rate loans were retained  to align itself more closely with agile  highly flexible consumer banks 
residential lending is and will continue to be a core business 
home savings intends to originate and sell fixed rate mortgages and lower margin adjustable rate mortgages arms to the secondary market while retaining only the more profitable arms in the portfolio 
as a result  portfolio size may be reduced through opportunistic loan sales from its held for sale portfolio and through loan payoffs 
the company will continue striving to improve the fundamentals of its business as it becomes a full service consumer bank 
the company has established a long term goal of achieving a return on average equity at least equal to 
this goal will not be easy to attain quickly and in order to make substantial progress in moving from its return on average equity of  the company must continue to 
increase efficiency in meeting customer needs  
improve profitability by offering more consumer banking products

because of numerous and simultaneous changes in both balances and rates from year to year  it is not practical to allocate precisely the effects thereof 
for purposes of this table  the change due to volume is initially calculated as the current year change in average balance multiplied by the average rate during the preceding year and the change due to rate is calculated as the current year change in average rate multiplied by the average balance during the preceding year 
any change that remains unallocated after such calculations is allocated proportionately to changes in volume and changes in rates

the decrease of million  or  in net interest income in resulted from the decrease of basis points in the net interest margin to for from for  partially offset by the increase of billion in average interest earning assets 
the increases in average interest earning assets during and were primarily funded with interest costing liabilities 
included in net interest income were provisions for losses of delinquent interest related to nonaccrual loans of million  million and million in  and  respectively  which had the effect of reducing the net interest margin by nine basis points in both and and basis points in the changes in and in the company s net interest margin and net interest income principally reflect the lag between changes in the monthly weighted average cost of funds for federal home loan bank fhlb eleventh district savings institutions as computed by the fhlb of san francisco cofi  to which a majority of the company s interest earning assets are tied  and changes in the repricing of the company s interest costing liabilities 
the company believes that its net interest income is somewhat insulated from interest rate fluctuations within a fairly wide range primarily due to the adjustable rate nature of its loan and mbs portfolio 
in a rising market interest rate environment  as experienced during  lagging increases in cofi and the delayed repricing of the company s cofi arms could compress the net interest margin and net interest income 
the company s net interest margin began to improve during the first quarter of and increased during the remainder of the year due to a significant decline in market interest rates during the year 
the net interest margin was at december   an increase of basis points from at december   which had decreased basis points from at december  the expansion of the net interest margin slowed during the fourth quarter of principally due to the company s funding of the new york sale in september which increased wholesale liabilities  a higher costing source of funds  to approximately of total interest costing liabilities at december  compared to approximately at december  as part of the funding of the new york sale  the company sold billion of mbs and retained the servicing on these mbs 
the company s cost of funds was seven basis points  basis points and basis points below the average of cofi of  and during  and  respectively 
changes in the composition of the company s interest costing liabilities will likely preclude the company s cost of funds from being significantly lower than cofi in the near future 
substantially all arms originated since have maximum interest rates 
in the event of sustained significant increases in rates  such maximum interest rates could also contribute to a decrease in the net interest margin 
as of december   the interest rate on approximately in outstanding principal amount of the company s cofi arms could have increased  as a result of a corresponding increase in cofi  by at least basis points without exceeding the applicable maximum interest rate

such conduit loans are typically multi family loans in excess of million  and include loans that are refinancings of loans from the company s commercial and industrial real estate loan portfolio and the non california multi family loan portfolio 
this program enables the company to increase its presence in the secondary market and generate additional fee income by originating and servicing these loans with no related credit exposure

    borrowings     asset liability management one of the company s primary business objectives continues to be the management of volatility in net interest income resulting from changes in interest rates 
this is accomplished by managing the repricing characteristics of its interest earning assets and interest costing liabilities 
interest rate reset provisions of both assets and liabilities  whether through contractual maturity or through contractual interest rate adjustment provisions  are commonly referred to as repricing terms 
in order to manage the interest rate risk inherent in its portfolios of interest earning assets and interest costing liabilities  the company has historically emphasized the origination of arms for retention in the loan and mbs portfolio  with the majority of originated arms indexed to cofi 
during late the company began offering arms which provide for interest rates that adjust based upon changes in the yields of u 
s 
treasury securities 
the company originated million of these treasury arms in at december   of the company s billion loan and mbs portfolio consisted of arms indexed primarily to cofi  compared to of the billion loan and mbs portfolio at december  the average factor above cofi on the company s cofi arm portfolio was basis points at december   up three basis points from basis points at december  although residential lending is and will continue to be the company s primary business  the company is repositioning itself to become more of a consumer bank 
the company intends to originate and sell fixed rate mortgages and lower margin arms to the secondary market while retaining only the more profitable arms in its portfolio 
as a result  the company s portfolio size may be reduced through opportunistic loan sales from its held for sale portfolio and through loan payoffs 
during the company securitized billion of arms into mbs which increase the company s access to less expensive collateralized borrowings 
the company s funding for the new york sale included short term borrowings of approximately billion which increased wholesale liabilities to approximately of total interest costing liabilities at december  compared to approximately at december  cofi arms do not immediately reflect current market rate movements referred to as the cofi lag 
the cofi lag arises because cofi is determined based on the cost of all fhlb eleventh district savings institutions interest costing liabilities  some of which do not reprice immediately and the company s cofi arms reprice monthly based on changes in the cost of such liabilities approximately two months earlier 
the company s basic interest rate risk management strategy has included a goal of having the combined repricing terms of its interest costing liabilities not differ materially from those of the fhlb eleventh district savings institutions  in aggregate 
the company s approach to managing interest rate risk includes the changing of repricing terms and spreading of maturities on term deposits and other interest costing liabilities and acquiring assets more responsive to interest rate changes  including plans to diversify away from cofi on certain interest earning assets 
the company manages the maturities of its borrowings to balance changes in depositor maturity demand 
the company has adopted a pro active strategy to increase the percentage of customer checking accounts in its deposit portfolio which the company believes is a steady funding source having less sensitivity to changes in market interest rates than other funding sources

when a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan and does not cure the delinquency promptly  the loan is characterized as delinquent 
the procedural steps necessary for foreclosure vary from state to state  but generally if the loan is not reinstated within certain periods specified by statute and no other workout arrangements satisfactory to the lender are entered into  the property securing the loan can be acquired by the lender 
although the company generally relies on the underlying real property to satisfy foreclosed loans  in certain circumstances and when permitted by law  the company may seek to obtain deficiency judgments against the borrowers 
a loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when the company becomes aware that the borrower has entered bankruptcy proceedings and the loan is delinquent  or when the loan is past due days as to either principal or interest 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  interest accrued but not received is reversed against interest income 
cash receipts on nonaccrual loans are used to reduce principal balances  rather than being included in income 
a nonaccrual loan may be restored to accrual basis when delinquent loan payments are collected and the loan is expected to perform according to its contractual terms

include nonaccrual major loans excluding those collectively reviewed for impairment  tdrs  and performing major loans and major loans less than days delinquent other impaired major loans which the company believes will be collected in full  but which the company believes it is probable will not be collected in accordance with the contractual terms of the loans 
the company considers a loan to be impaired when  based upon current information and events  it believes it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the company continues to accrue interest on tdrs and other impaired major loans since full payment of principal and interest is expected and such loans are performing or less than days delinquent and therefore do not meet the criteria for nonaccrual status 
the company bases the measurement of loan impairment on the fair value of the loans collateral properties in accordance with sfas no 
impairment losses are included in the allowance for loan losses through a charge to provision for loan losses 
adjustments to impairment losses due to changes in the fair value of impaired loans collateral properties are included in provision for loan losses 
upon disposition of an impaired loan  any related valuation allowance is charged off from the allowance for loan losses

single family underwriting standards were modified in and to change the focus from collateral valuation  which is most effective when real estate values are stable or rising  to an emphasis on the borrowers credit history 
the combination of a weak economy and a steep decline in real estate values since  particularly in southern california  has contributed to the large proportion of single family nonperforming assets related to loans originated prior to the conversion to a new loan servicing system in september  which caused a temporary disruption in the collection process  also contributed to an increase in single family nonperforming assets 
the amount of future nonperforming assets is primarily dependent upon the strength of the residential real estate market  particularly in southern california

allowance for loan losses 
management believes the company s allowance for loan losses was adequate at december  the company s process for evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses has three basic elements first  the identification of impaired loans  second  the establishment of appropriate loan loss allowances once individual specific impaired loans are identified  and third  a methodology for estimating loan losses based on the inherent risk in the remainder of the loan portfolio 
the identification of impaired loans is achieved mainly through individual review of all major loans over million and certain major loans under million 
loan loss allowances are established for specifically identified impaired loans based on the fair value of the underlying collateral property 
the allowance for loan losses also includes estimates based upon consideration of actual loss experience for loans during the past several years by loan type  year of origination  delinquency statistics  condition of collateral property and projected economic conditions and other trends 
based upon this process  consideration of the current economic environment and other factors  management determines what it considers to be an appropriate allowance for loan losses 
immediately upon or prior to the foreclosure of a mortgage loan  the company obtains an appraisal of the collateral property 
in the case of a single family or california multi family loan  such appraisal generally is conducted by an appraiser employed by the company  in the case of a commercial and industrial real estate or non california multi family loan  such appraisal is conducted by an independent fee appraiser and reviewed by the company s appraisal review department 
based upon such appraisal  foreclosed loans are recorded at fair value less estimated selling costs

 credit cards  the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by type at december  reflects continued reduction in the commercial and industrial real estate loan portfolio and the increase in the level of single family nonperforming loans 
the commercial and industrial real estate portfolio has diminished in size due to loan principal payments and the company s decision in to discontinue originating new commercial and industrial real estate loans 
although the single family loan portfolio decreased billion or in due to principal payments and loan sales  the allocation of the allowance to the single family loan portfolio increased since december  in response to the increase in single family nonperforming loans and other factors 
as a result of the changes in the composition of the company s nonperforming assets  the ratio of allowances for losses on loans and reo to nonperforming assets declined from in to in for additional information regarding the allowance for loan losses  see financial condition asset quality nonperforming assets and potential problem loans

the majority of charge offs related to loans originated prior to and secured by california properties  especially southern california properties 
approximately of gross single family loan charge offs related to loans originated prior to single family loans originated prior to represented approximately of the loan and mbs portfolio at december  single family underwriting standards were modified in and to change the focus from collateral valuation  which is most effective when real estate values are stable or rising  to an emphasis on the borrowers credit history 
the combination of a weak economy and a steep decline in real estate values since  particularly in southern california  has contributed to the large proportion of single family loan charge offs related to loans originated prior to while single family loans originated after the modification of underwriting standards in and have performed better than such loans originated prior to the modifications  there can be no assurance that this experience will continue in the future 
the amount of future loan charge offs and related credit costs are primarily dependent upon the strength of the residential real estate market  particularly in southern california 
although the company believes it has a sound basis for its estimate of the appropriate allowance for loan losses  actual charge offs and the level of nonperforming assets incurred in the future are highly dependent upon future events  including the economies of the areas in which the company lends 
management believes that the principal risk factor which could potentially require an increase in the allowance for loan losses is the potential further deterioration in the residential purchase market in california  particularly in southern california 
rei 
the company s rei decreased million or to million at december  from million at december  the allowance for losses on rei was million or of gross rei at december   compared to million or of gross rei at december  the decline in net rei was primarily due to the continued development and sale of ongoing residential projects and the sale of five commercial development projects 
in addition  the provision for losses for totaled million  which included a million charge during the third quarter of due largely to a deterioration in the value of a commercial rei project in california

although the company does not intend to acquire new properties  it intends to develop  hold and or sell its current properties depending on economic conditions 
the company has certain projects with long term holding and development periods 
plans are underway for the sale of several other properties in no new projects have been initiated since the company carries each of its rei properties at the lower of cost or nrv  and adjusts such values through provisions for losses recorded as additions to the allowance for losses on rei 
nrv is the estimated selling price when the real estate is eventually liquidated  less estimated costs to complete the development and the costs to hold and dispose of the property 
the company s basis for such estimates include project business plans monitored and approved by management  market studies and other information 
in computing nrv  interest holding costs are based on the company s cost of funds 
in addition  the company may also establish general valuation allowances based on management s assessment of the risk of further reductions in nrv 
although management believes the nrv of rei and the related allowance for losses are fairly stated  declines in nrv and additions to the allowance for losses could result from continued weakness in the specific project markets  changes in economic conditions  changes in the company s cost of funds and revisions to project business plans  which may reflect decisions by the company to accelerate the disposition of the properties 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity consists of cash  cash equivalents and certain marketable securities which are not committed  pledged or required to liquidate specific liabilities 
the liquidity portfolio  totaling approximately billion at december   increased million or from december  the increase is primarily due to mbs sales of billion  a net increase in borrowings of billion and the creation of billion of liquid qualifying mbs  substantially offset by a net decrease of billion in deposits 
regulations of the office of thrift supervision ots require each savings institution to maintain  for each calendar month  an average daily balance of liquid assets equal to at least of the average daily balance of its net withdrawable accounts plus short term borrowings during the preceding calendar month 
ots regulations also require each savings institution to maintain  for each calendar month  an average daily balance of short term liquid assets generally those having maturities of months or less equal to at least of the average daily balance of its net withdrawable accounts plus short term borrowings during the preceding calendar month 
for december the average liquidity and average short term liquidity ratios of home savings were and  respectively 
sources of additional liquidity consist primarily of positive cash flows generated from operations  the collection of principal payments and prepayments on loans and mbs and increases in deposits 
positive cash flows are also generated through the sale of mbs  loans and other assets for cash 
sources of liquidity may also include borrowings from the fhlb  commercial paper and public debt issuances  borrowings under reverse repurchase agreements  commercial bank lines of credit and  under certain conditions  direct borrowings from the federal reserve system 
the principal sources of cash inflows during were principal payments and prepayments on loans and mbs  proceeds from borrowings and proceeds from sales of loans and mbs 
each of the company s sources of liquidity is influenced by various uncertainties beyond the control of the company 
scheduled loan payments are a relatively stable source of funds  while loan prepayments and deposit flows vary widely in reaction to market conditions  primarily market interest rates 
asset sales are influenced by general market interest rates and other unforeseeable market conditions 
the company s ability to borrow at attractive rates is affected by its size  credit rating  the availability of acceptable collateral and other market driven conditions 
in order to manage the uncertainty inherent in its sources of funds  the company continually evaluates alternate sources of funds and maintains and develops diversity and flexibility in the number and character of such sources 
the effect of a decline in any one source of funds generally can be offset by use of an alternate source  although potentially at a different cost to the company 
loans receivable 
during  the company s primary use of cash  excluding the new york sale  was to fund billion of internally generated mortgage loans 
gross loan originations in of billion included billion of cofi arms with an average factor of basis points above cofi  million of treasury arms  billion of fixed rate loans originated for sale and million of consumer loans 
loans receivable totaled billion at december   a decrease of billion or during  primarily due to the securitization of billion in arm loans 
principal payments on loans were billion in  representing a decrease of billion or from billion in for additional information see financial condition liquidity and capital resources mbs 
during the company sold loans  primarily fixed rate  totaling billion 
the company designates certain loans as available for sale  including most of its fixed rate originations 
at december  the company had million of loans available for sale 
the loans designated for sale include million in cofi arms  million of treasury arms and million of fixed rate loans 
at december  the company was committed to fund mortgage loans totaling million  of which million or were cofi arms  million or were treasury arms and million or were fixed rate loans 
the company expects to fund such loans from its liquidity sources 
mbs 
during the company sold billion of mbs available for sale  comprised of billion of arm mbs and million of fixed rate mbs 
such sales included billion of arm mbs and million of fixed rate mbs sold to fund the new york sale 
as a part of the funding of the new york sale  the company sold million in fixed rate mbs and million in arm mbs originally classified as held to maturity which was necessary in order for the company to maintain its interest rate risk position as it existed prior to the funding transactions related to this major disposition as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
during the fourth quarter of  the financial accounting standards board fasb provided a one time opportunity for institutions to reclassify securities from the held to maturity designation to the available for sale designation 
such reclassification was permitted  in a single transaction  during the period november  through december  the company reclassified billion of mbs  with an unrealized gain of million  during this time period 
at december  the company had billion of mbs available for sale 
in may the company securitized billion of cofi arms into federal home loan mortgage corporation collateralized mortgage obligations 
an additional billion of arms were securitized into mortgage pass through securities during the first quarter of these mbs increase the company s access to less expensive collateralized borrowings 
deposits 
savings deposits were billion at december   a decrease of billion or during  primarily reflecting deposits sold of billion in the new york sale  partially offset by deposits purchased of billion and a net deposit inflow of million 
the net deposit inflow reflects the company s strategy to increase certain term deposit accounts by offering market competitive interest rates on such deposits and reduce certain higher costing borrowings 
on june   the company completed the purchase of billion in deposits from household bank  fsb for a deposit premium of approximately 
as a result of this purchase  the company acquired retail branches in southern california of which were consolidated with existing home savings branches 
the company also purchased deposits totaling million from three other california financial institutions  for an average deposit premium of approximately during the company intends to continue consideration of branch purchases and sales as opportunities to consolidate the company s presence in its key strategic markets 
at december     and of the company s total deposits were in california  florida  texas and arizona  respectively  compared to   and  in california  new york  florida and texas  respectively  at december  borrowings 
borrowings totaled billion at december   an increase of billion or from billion at december   reflecting increases in short term borrowings of billion and fhlb and other borrowings of billion 
the increase in short term borrowings was primarily due to the funding strategy related to the new york sale 
the funding strategy was fully incorporated into the company s asset liability management process and will be fully implemented into the longer term strategy of extending repricing duration of the company s interest costing liabilities 
the company s long term strategy is to gradually return to a risk profile not materially different from the risk profile in place prior to the new york sale 
in august  the company fully paid a maturing note which had an outstanding balance of million and an effective interest rate of 
in september  the company redeemed million of subordinated notes at par 
in december  the company fully paid two maturing notes  one of which had an outstanding balance of million and an effective interest rate of  with the other note having an outstanding balance of million and a contract interest rate of 
in  the company had four issuances of medium term notes totaling million 
the notes will mature in three to seven years and have a weighted average interest rate of 
such borrowings are being used for general corporate purposes 
capital 
stockholders equity totaled billion at december   an increase of million or from december  the increase is primarily due to net earnings of million and an increase of million to the net unrealized gain on securities available for sale 
the net unrealized gain on securities available for sale at december  was million 
these increases to stockholders equity were partially offset by dividends paid to common and preferred stockholders of million and payments of million to purchase million shares of the company s common stock 
the ots has adopted regulations that contain a three part capital standard requiring savings institutions to maintain core capital of at least of adjusted total assets  tangible capital of at least of adjusted total assets and risk based capital of at least of risk weighted assets 
special rules govern the ability of savings institutions to include in their capital computations investments in subsidiaries engaged in activities not permissible for national banks  such as real estate development 
in addition  institutions whose exposure to interest rate risk as determined by the ots is deemed to be above normal may be required to hold additional risk based capital 
home savings believes it does not have above normal exposure to interest rate risk 
under ots regulations which implement the prompt corrective action system mandated by the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act  an institution is well capitalized if its ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets is or more  its ratio of core capital to risk based assets is or more  its ratio of core capital to total assets is or more and it is not subject to any written agreement  order or directive to meet a specified capital level 
at december  home savings exceeded these standards 
home savings is in compliance with the ots regulations 
the following table shows the capital amounts and ratios of home savings at december  balance ratio dollars in thousands tangible capital to adjusted total assets  core capital to adjusted total assets  core capital to risk weighted assets  risk based capital  the regulatory capital requirements applicable to home savings are continuing to become more stringent as the amount of home savings investment in real estate investment subsidiaries includable in capital will be phased out through july  home savings currently meets the requirements of the ots assuming the present application of the full phase out provisions 
at december  the capital ratios computed on this more stringent  fully phased in basis were for tangible capital to adjusted total assets  for core capital to adjusted total assets  for core capital to risk weighted assets and for risk based capital

subsequent event in march  the company redeemed at par approximately million of subordinated debt due in june recapitalization of the savings association insurance fund home savings is a bif member institution 
home savings deposits are treated in part as saif insured and in part as bif insured 
the bif and the saif are both administered by the fdic 
during  home savings paid deposit insurance premiums to the saif on its saif deposits and to the bif on its bif deposits 
the reserves of the bif have reached the statutorily designated reserve ratio drr  defined as the ratio of the fund s net worth to the amount of its total insured deposit liabilities  of 
the lowest deposit insurance assessment rate for bif deposits has therefore been reduced to  per institution per year 
the reserves of the saif have not reached its drr of 
the lowest deposit insurance assessment rate for saif deposits therefore remains of covered deposits 
the difference between bif and saif assessment rates provides institutions whose deposits are exclusively or primarily bif insured  such as most commercial banks  a competitive advantage over institutions whose deposits are primarily saif insured  such as home savings 
in order to eliminate the difference between bif and saif assessment rates  congress adopted a proposal to recapitalize saif to its drr by means of a special one time assessment on saif insured deposits 
the proposal  however  was included as part of the congressional balanced budget program which was vetoed by president clinton and therefore has not been implemented 
congress continues to consider the recapitalization of saif although the company cannot predict whether or when a recapitalization will be effected 
if a recapitalization of saif had been effected in as proposed by means of a special assessment equal to of saif deposits as of march   home savings would have paid a special assessment of approximately million  net of taxes 
an assessment of this amount would have had a material effect on the company s net earnings  but would not have had a material effect on the company s total assets or liquidity 
such an assessment would also not have materially affected home savings capital ratios and home savings would still have been considered well capitalized
