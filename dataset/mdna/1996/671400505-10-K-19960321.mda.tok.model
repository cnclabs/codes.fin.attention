the closing date of this transaction and the ultimate purchase price cannot be reasonably estimated 
however  management believes adequate financial resources are available to consummate the transaction 
the company intends to aggressively pursue acquisitions in the telecommunications sector which will enhance growth and profitability 
an acquisition may require new borrowing arrangements 
currently  the company has no commitment  understanding  or arrangement relating to any material acquisition and there is no assurance that additional transactions will be completed in the company believes that funds generated by operations  existing cash balances and its available credit facility will be sufficient to fund the company s ongoing operations over the next year 
risks and uncertainties revenues from telecommunications components will account for a majority of the company s future revenues 
although demand for these products has grown in recent years with the build out of telecommunications networks in domestic and international markets  a decrease in the rate of infrastructure construction or upgrade programs could have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
the telecommunications industry is very competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change  new product development  product obsolescence and evolving product specifications 
additionally  price competition in this market is intense with significant price erosion over the life cycle of a product 
the ability of the company to compete successfully depends on the continued introduction of new products and ongoing manufacturing cost reduction 
sales of the company s controls components are in large part dependent on the production level of a few north american appliance manufacturers  which in turn is sensitive to the strength of the economy  including housing starts  consumer disposable income and interest rates 
adverse changes in the economy would have a negative impact on the company s financial results 
the company currently buys a number of raw materials from single sources 
in most cases there are readily available and qualified alternative sources of supply 
although the company does not at this time have a qualified second source for one critical component used in the production of fiber optic modules  management believes there are other suppliers that could provide a like quality product on comparable terms 
a change in suppliers for this product could cause a delay in manufacturing and adversely impact operating results 
the company must comply with governmental regulations relating to the environment 
the cost of compliance with environmental regulations in was immaterial and is not expected to have a material effect on capital expenditures or operating results in various pending or threatened legal proceedings by or against the company or one or more of its subsidiaries involve alleged breaches of contract  torts and miscellaneous other causes of action arising in the course of business 
the company s management  based upon advice of legal counsel representing the company with respect to each of these proceedings  does not believe any of these proceedings will have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial position 
the company s international operations and its results could be affected by changes in policies of foreign governments and in social and economic conditions outside the us including civil unrest  changing inflation and foreign exchange rates  and trade restrictions or prohibitions 
any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on future results
