item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general base ten has historically specialized in the design and manufacture of electronic systems employing safety critical software for defense markets  both nationally and internationally 
the company also manufactures defense products to specifications for prime government contractors and designs and builds proprietary electronic systems for use in secure communications applications by various us government agencies 
specialization in these extreme reliability defense products has enabled the company to develop expertise in the field of safety critical technology dedicated to the prevention of performance errors 
during the last several years  base ten has redirected its resources and streamlined its operations in response to the worldwide reduction in defense spending 
since  base ten has sold or discontinued various foreign operations  downsized part of its domestic operations and emphasized new commercial product development programs with a view to balancing its business activities 
these programs have manufacturing execution  medical screening and image archiving products with significant potential markets 
each of these products rely on the same safety critical techniques developed in the company s established businesses 
although revenues from these operations have yet to offset the decline in defense revenues  the company has augmented its technical and sales staff to support increased development and marketing operations in both commercial and government markets 
recent developments defense operations 
the company s primary revenue source during the last three years has been defense related programs with the united states military and other agencies or contractors 
these programs accounted for million or of revenues in fiscal  million or of revenues in and million or of revenues  in the largest program was a sidewinder control system comprised of flight line  intermediate level and depot test equipment for the f aircraft under a million contract completed in for delivery to the taiwanese air force 
the company s domestic defense related programs have also included contract manufacturing for various prime contractors 
during the last three years  the sale of weapons control systems for the tornado program has also remained a major source of revenues 
base ten s participation in this program has included the preparation of software upgrades and new product development to enhance the aircraft s mission capabilities as well as sms production orders 
these operations accounted for million or of revenues in  million or of revenues in and million or of revenues in late in  base ten received full funding on a tornado production contract  resulting in acceleration of the manufacturing schedule  with most of the work expected to be completed in in the first quarter of fiscal  the company received initial funding for a new software program for the tornado program under a contract valued at million and scheduled to be completed in early despite profit margins limited by strict government procedures and intense competition  the company s defense related operations have provided a relatively stable revenue base  while enabling base ten to maintain its position as a seasoned provider of safety critical control systems developed for high reliability under stringent performance standards 
to enhance this position  base ten has invested its own funds from time to time in product development for the domestic defense market  including recent investments in the development of a new weapons control system for helicopters and a new gun control unit for a popular chain gun 
while these efforts have not always resulted in sales  base ten aggressively pursues opportunities in this market and will continue to seek participation in defense programs that utilize its established technologies and skills 
current activities in this area include extensive quotations to international customers under the itar rules 
in  base ten supplied its upgraded computer interface known as the bic to the us navy 
the company expects to receive additional orders for bic cards from this customer in in addition to its telecommunications interface products  base ten has developed proprietary encryption devices endorsed by the national security agency 
while sales of the company s secure communications products have been limited to government users 
base ten believes this technology may present commercial opportunities that it would expect to pursue if they arise 
nondefense operations 
during the last three years  the company advanced its business plan for redeploying resources to commercial applications by concentrating development efforts on products requiring the application of its electronic  software and systems engineering capabilities in safety critical  highly regulated environments 
the company s commercial development efforts through its medical technology division have been focused on manufacturing execution  medical screening and image processing software as well as secure communications products 
while these efforts have been internally funded and could be adversely affected by delays in the development cycle  competition and changing technology  sales of these proprietary products could be expected to provide more favorable profit margins than the company s defense business 
in  the company s medical technology division generated million or of total revenues  primarily from sales of the company s prenata tm medical screening software through johnson johnson and the manufacturing execution system marketed as pharmasyst tm 
as of the date of this report  base ten has received bookings and notifications of its selection by pharmaceutical companies expected to result in pharmasyst tm installations in over sites throughout the world  including sales to miles pharmaceuticals  abbott hospital products division  pfizer international products group  minnesota mining and manufacturing  nycomed  berlex and others 
in addition  given the flexibility and broad market applicability of this product  marketing efforts during were expanded to other regulated industries  with initial pharmasyst tm sales made to frito lay 
the company has significantly increased its technical staff and facilities to accommodate anticipated growth in this field and is actively pursuing additional pharmasyst tm sales to the pharmaceutical and other regulated industries  both domestically and abroad 
in view of the initial success and market potential of its pharmasyst tm system  base ten intends to continue concentrating resources in the refinement and marketing of this product 
the shift in resources to exploit these opportunities contributed to the company s net loss in and can be expected to have an adverse impact on its financial results until pharmasyst tm sales increase 
during  base ten also concentrated on the introduction of its upacs archiving system for ultrasound images 
although this product line has not yet generated meaningful revenues and faces rigorous competition on both price and features  the company is endeavoring to overcome these obstacles with advances in the design  including a networking feature to reduce the cost of the system relative to the number of ultrasound scanners being serviced 
selling efforts are underway in europe through several distributors  and alliances are being sought with oem manufacturers and important users of ultrasound systems in the eec 
in addition  base ten plans to file a k premarket notification application in early to secure fda clearance for upacs sales in the united states 
while the company believes its upacs product fills an important market need and could generate significant revenues over the next decade  opportunities in this field could be eroded by competition  potentially requiring base ten to discontinue further development and expense the capitalized costs incurred to date 
after several years of approval procedures  base ten received fda clearance for its prenval tm medical screening software during on the basis of its k premarket notification  positioning the company as a supplier of safety critical medical devices 
although the basic software used in prenval tm can be applied to other cati programs  the company has temporarily delayed applying further resources to this product line to exploit the greater near term potential of its pharmasyst tm systems and potentially benefit from current discussions and hearings by the fda on its medical software regulations  any simplification of which could enable the company to complete future medical software products at lower costs 
during  base ten recognized revenues under its licensing agreement with j j  covering the introduction of the company s more complex prenata tm medical screening software into the european market 
the agreement is expected to generate royalties for the remainder of the current term ending in under the agreement  the company is entitled to certain minimum royalties but could receive substantially greater revenues if the product is successfully marketed by j j 
in addition  despite regulatory obstacles  the company intends to pursue domestic sales of prenata tm or a similar program if a suitable marketing partner willing to absorb the cost of clinical trials can be found 
unlike many defense programs in which the company participates  current development activities for nondefense products are being funded by base ten 
although most of the development costs for these programs is capitalized  the amortization of the capitalized development expenses along with substantial growth in sales and marketing costs will continue to impact the company s financial results 
moreover  limited financial resources could impair the company s ability to successfully complete the development and marketing of resulting products 
results of operations seasonality 
the company s revenues and operating results are subject to quarterly fluctuations due primarily to the timing of contract stage completions and product deliveries 
these factors are characteristic of base ten s business environment and can affect quarterly performance materially without necessarily reflecting results for the full year or long term profitability 
in the fourth quarter of  the company experienced delays in order writing for its defense products  resulting in reduced shipment schedules for the first fiscal quarter of in addition  despite steadily increasing pharmasyst tm orders  the percentage of completion method used by base ten in accounting for these orders results in its recognition of revenues from pharmasyst tm sales primarily toward the beginning of the installation schedule 
although these factors plus higher marketing expenses are expected to result in a loss for the first quarter of fiscal  the company anticipates a return to profitability later in based on anticipated shipment schedules for the balance of the year 
cost reduction plan 
the nature of the company s business requires it to maintain significant engineering and management resources to fulfill existing contracts and take advantage of business opportunities as they arise  with external sources generally utilized on a short term basis to satisfy peak overloads 
to reflect current conditions  wages were increased at the beginning of after remaining generally unchanged for two years 
the higher labor costs do not necessarily result in comparable price increases for the company s products due to competitive forces 
in order to improve financial performance pending anticipated revenue gains from the company s medical technology division in  base ten implemented a cost reduction plan in under the plan  each officer of the company and its divisions worked for the minimum wage during a three month period beginning may  each of these employees other than the chairman received three year loans equal to their relinquished salary with interest at annually 
the chairman and the presidents of the company s two divisions continued to work for the minimum wage for the balance of the fiscal year  and the two presidents received three year loans for the additional relinquished salary 
all of the employee loans will be repayable either in cash or as an offset against future compensation 
subject to meeting its performance goals  the company will adjust compensation with an increase in salary levels and an incentive plan based on earnings performance 
the cost reduction plan also includes a decrease in manufacturing staff  a suspension of various consulting agreements and other cost saving measures 
in addition  as a means of optimizing the use of base ten s manufacturing facility  certain defense products with an established market expected to result in sales were built to inventory during fiscal compared to fiscal revenues for the twelve months ended october  were million compared to million in  a decrease of 
the decrease in revenues reflects reduced defense budgets in both the united states and western europe  the company s two largest markets 
approximately of fiscal revenues were generated from various contracts for weapons control software  development of new software for the tornado program  some tornado production work and contract manufacturing 
the balance of base ten s revenues during the year was generated from pharmasyst tm sales and revenues from the company s license agreement with j j for prenata tm medical screening software 
cost of sales as a percent of revenues in fiscal declined to from in the improved performance reflects a shift in product mix to include a higher percentage of software and engineering content  with a corresponding decrease in material costs 
although the direct labor content of sales by the medical technology division increased in  higher margins were maintained through capitalization of the associated software development costs 
r d costs charged as expense in fiscal decreased to  or of revenues from  or of revenues 
r d costs do not include software development costs of million capitalized in compared to million in most of the capitalized costs incurred in were attributable to the development of pharmasyst tm software by the medical technology division 
extensive efforts to accelerate the marketability of pharmasyst tm as well as prenval tm medical screening software and the upacs archiving system for ultrasound images were recorded as selling  general and administrative expenses rather than r d costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal or of revenues compared to million or of revenues in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses reflects expanded marketing activities primarily for the company s nondefense products 
selling  general and administrative expenses include direct labor costs of million in fiscal compared with million in interest expense was million in and million in all of the interest expense represents capitalized lease costs incurred under a sale and lease back transaction involving the sale of the company s facility in trenton  new jersey and repayment of the outstanding mortgage loan at the end of the transaction resulted in total long term lease obligations aggregating million 
after accounting for an income tax benefit of  base ten incurred a net loss of  or 
per share in compared to net earnings of  or 
per share after income taxes of  in the loss per share in was based on million weighted average shares compared to million fully diluted shares in the dilutive effect of outstanding options  rights and warrants was determined using the weighted average shares outstanding for the calculation and the modified treasury stock method for fiscal compared to fiscal revenues for the twelve months ended october  decreased to million compared with million in the decrease in revenues reflects reduced defense budgets in both the united states and western europe 
fiscal revenues were generated from various contracts for weapons control software  development of new hardware for the tornado program  some tornado production work  production of bus interface units for the us navy and contract manufacturing 
cost of sales as a percent of revenues in fiscal was compared to in despite the reduced volume reflecting a smaller base over which to spread certain fixed overhead costs and additional costs from two contract overruns  consistency in cost of sales was achieved by a reduction of approximately  in manufacturing expenses 
r d costs shown as expenses in fiscal increased to  from  in due to increased development costs for certain defense related and secure communication products 
r d costs for pharmasyst tm  prenval tm and ultrasound imaging products were capitalized at million for  with an aggregate capitalized cost since the start of development of million through the end of extensive efforts to accelerate the marketability of pharmasyst tm and prenval tm software products were recorded as selling  general and administrative expenses rather than r d costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal or of revenues compared to million or of revenues in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues primarily reflects expanded marketing activities relative to the reduced revenue base 
selling  general and administrative expenses include direct labor costs of million in fiscal compared with million in interest expense declined from million in to million in as a result of reduced borrowings 
no borrowings were made under the company s million line of credit in later in the year  long term debt was eliminated through the sale of the company s facility in trenton  new jersey and repayment of the outstanding mortgage loan  although the transaction resulted in long term lease obligations aggregating million 
net earnings for fiscal were  or 
per share on million fully diluted shares compared with  or 
per share on million fully diluted shares in the prior fiscal year  reflecting reduced revenues without a corresponding reduction in r d and selling  general and administrative costs 
management s decision to maintain a high level of research and development as well as marketing activities was taken to provide the basis for future revenue growth 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity 
significant liquidity factors are as follows october  october  working capital   current ratio to to debt to equity ratio 
to 
to unused line of credit n a  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities 
the ratio of total liabilities to shareholders equity 
these ratios all improved during due principally to funds raised from the exercise of outstanding series b rights and class a common purchase warrants prior to their expiration 
the company received net proceeds in the transactions aggregating million 
a portion of the proceeds was used to fund an increase of million in accounts receivable and an increase of million in other assets principally comprised of capitalized software development costs 
cash remaining at october  totaled million  an increase of million over the prior year 
capital resources 
at the end of fiscal  the company maintained a million credit facility with the bank of new york 
in view of its cash position  base ten let the facility expire in january in november  base ten issued  shares of its class a common stock upon the exercise of substantially all the company s expiring series b rights at an exercise price of per share 
net proceeds from the exercise of the series b rights aggregated approximately million 
in april and may   the company issued approximately million shares of its class a common stock upon the exercise of substantially all the expiring class a common purchase warrants at an exercise price of per share 
net proceeds from the exercise of the warrants totaled approximately million 
the company believes that its working capital and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to support its operations and planned development activities 
accordingly  base ten does not anticipate incurring any long term borrowings to support its operations for the foreseeable future 
inflation 
a significant portion of the company s inventory is funded by its customers and committed to specific orders 
as a result  the effects of inflation are not significant to base ten s operations
