accordingly  the operating results of the acquired entities have been included in the consolidated results of operations of the company since the respective acquisition dates 
overview the company s net income was million or per common share in  increases of and  respectively  from million or per common share in fully diluted earnings per common share  which assumes the full conversion of outstanding preferred stock into common  was in and in  an increase of 
in  net income was million while primary and fully diluted earnings per common share were and  respectively 
excluding the after tax effect of securities transactions  net income and earnings per common share were million and  respectively  in compared with million and in and million and in on the same basis  fully diluted earnings per common share were  and in  and  respectively 
the company achieved a return on average assets in of  compared with in and 
in the return on average common stockholders equity was in  in and in excluding the after tax effect of securities transactions  the return on average assets was  while the return on average common stockholders equity was in  compared with and in and 
and in  respectively 
growth in average earning assets  primarily in loans  was the most significant factor contributing to a rise in taxable equivalent net interest income to million in from million in average earning assets totaled billion in  a increase from billion in the beneficial impact on net interest income of growth in earning assets exceeded the effect of a narrowing of the spread between yields on earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
as a result of such narrowing  net interest margin  or taxable equivalent net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets  decreased basis points hundredths of one percent in to from in taxable equivalent net interest income was million in when average earning assets and net interest margin were billion and  respectively 
reflecting generally stable economic conditions in market areas served by the company  the provision for possible credit losses decreased to million in  compared with million in and million in net charge offs in were million  compared with million in and million in nonperforming loans totaled million at december   up from million at december  and million at year end in december  first empire transferred appreciated investment securities with a fair value of million to an affiliated  tax exempt charitable foundation 
such securities had been previously classified by first empire as available for sale 
as a result of the transfer  the company recognized charitable contributions expense and tax exempt other income of million and million  respectively  resulting in an after tax increase in net income of million 
excluding the impact of securities gains and the december transfer of investment securities to the affiliated foundation  noninterest income for totaled million  above the million in and above the million in noninterest expense was million in  up from million in excluding million related to the december transfer of investment securities and from million in as described in note of notes to financial statements  during the second quarter of the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for mortgage servicing rights  retroactive to january  the effect of implementing sfas no 
was to increase noninterest income and noninterest expense by million and million  respectively  and  as a result  net income increased by million for the year ended december  net interest income lending and funding activities taxable equivalent net interest income rose to million in from million in a billion increase in average earning assets to billion in from billion in was the major factor for the rise 
taxable equivalent net interest income and average earning assets in were million and billion  respectively 
the growth in average earning assets in was predominately attributable to increased demand for loans offered by the company and the impact of the december acquisition of million of loans of ithaca bancorp 
average loans outstanding grew to billion in from billion in and billion in the acquisition of ithaca bancorp did not substantially impact average loans in the increase in net interest income resulting from growth in average earnings assets was partially offset by a narrowing of the net interest spread  or the difference between the yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest spread in was  compared with in and in a combination of higher market interest rates  in general  and a greater proportion of loans  which typically yield more than money market assets and investment securities  in the composition of the portfolio of earning assets resulted in a basis point increase in to in the yield on earning assets  from in however  rising market interest rates throughout much of and had the effect of increasing the cost of the company s interest bearing liabilities more than the yield on earning assets 
as a result  the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased basis points to in from in the yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities in were and  respectively 
in  the benefit obtained from increased holdings of loans as compared with was offset by a rise in interest expense on deposits and short term borrowings 
the contribution to net interest margin of interest free funds  which consist primarily of noninterest bearing demand deposits and stockholders equity  rose to 
in from 
in and 
in the improvement in from resulted largely from the basis point increase to in the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities used to value these funds  supplemented by an increase in average interest free funds 
the basis point addition to the contribution of interest free funds in from was a reflection of the basis point increase in the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities from coupled with a increase in average interest free balances 
average interest free funds were billion in  billion in and billion in changing interest rates and spreads affect the company s net interest income and net interest margin 
as a result of the changes described herein  the company s net interest margin declined to in from in and in management believes that further changes in market interest rates or reductions in spreads could adversely impact the company s net interest margin and net interest income 
although not necessarily indicative of future results  the company s net interest spread declined in each quarter of accordingly  the net interest spread in the fourth quarter of of was below that achieved in any other quarter of management analyzes the company s exposure to changing interest rates and spreads by projecting net interest income under a number of different interest rate scenarios 
as part of the management of interest rate risk  the company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of the loan and deposit portfolios 
revenue and expense arising from these agreements are reflected in either the yields earned on loans or  as appropriate  rates paid on interest bearing deposits 
in general  under the terms of swaps in effect through december   the company receives payments based on the outstanding notional amount of the swaps at a fixed rate of interest and makes payments at a variable rate 
the effect of interest rate swaps on the company s net interest income and margin as well as average notional amounts and rates are presented in table the company estimates that as of december  it would have received approximately million if all interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes were terminated 
this estimated fair value of the interest rate swap portfolio results from the effects of changing interest rates and should be considered in the context of the entire balance sheet and the company s overall interest rate risk profile 
changes in the estimated fair value of interest rate swaps entered into for interest rate risk management purposes are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
additional information about interest rate swaps is included in note of notes to financial statements 
as previously noted  average loans and leases grew to billion in from billion in and billion in  due  in large part  to improved economic conditions  the december acquisition of ithaca bancorp and expansion of the company s consumer lending business 
table summarizes by type  average loans and leases outstanding in and percentage changes in average loans over the past two years 
loans secured by real estate  excluding million of outstanding home equity lines of credit which are classified as consumer loans  represented approximately of the loan portfolio during  compared with in and in at december   the company held approximately billion of commercial real estate loans and billion of consumer real estate loans 
commercial real estate loans originated by the company are predominately secured by properties in the new york city metropolitan area  including areas in neighboring states generally considered to be within commuting distance of new york city  and western new york  which includes buffalo  niagara falls  rochester and surrounding areas 
commercial real estate loans are also originated in the hudson valley and southern tier regions of new york state 
in general  commercial real estate loans originated by the company are fixed rate instruments with monthly payments and a balloon payment of the remaining principal at maturity  usually five years after loan origination 
for borrowers in good standing  the customer may extend the terms of the loan agreement for an additional five years at the then current market rate of interest 
table presents commercial real estate loans at december  by geographic area  type of collateral and size of the loans outstanding 
approximately of the billion of commercial real estate loans in the new york city metropolitan area were secured by multi family residential properties  by office space and by retail space 
the company s experience has been that office space and retail properties tend to demonstrate more volatile fluctuations in value through economic cycles and changing economic conditions than do multi family residential properties 
approximately of the aggregate dollar amount of new york city area loans were for million or less 
commercial real estate loans secured by properties elsewhere in new york state  mostly in western new york  tend to have a greater diversity of collateral types and include a significant amount of lending to customers who use the mortgaged property in their trade or business 
most loans in this segment of the portfolio were for million or less 
commercial real estate loans secured by properties located outside of new york state and outside of areas of neighboring states considered to be part of the new york city metropolitan area comprised less then of total commercial real estate loans 
the company normally refrains from construction lending  except when the borrower has obtained a commitment for permanent financing upon project completion 
as a result  the commercial construction loan portfolio totaled only million  or 
of total loans at december  excluding million of loans held for sale  the company s portfolio of real estate loans secured by one to four family residential properties totaled billion at december   approximately of which were secured by properties located in new york state 
the company originates residential mortgage loans in new york state  as well as in colorado  massachusetts  ohio  oregon  pennsylvania  utah and washington 
as a percentage of average loans  consumer loans and leases were in  in and in  however  no consumer loan product type exceeded ten percent of the company s average loan portfolio 
beginning in and  to a greater extent  continuing in  the company began to market automobile loans and leases and credit cards in areas outside of new york state 
automobile loans and leases are generally originated through dealers  however  all applications submitted by dealers are subject to the company s normal underwriting and loan approval procedures 
credit card accounts are marketed through mail campaigns and co branding initiatives 
the company s portfolio of investment securities averaged billion in  billion in and billion in the level of the investment securities portfolio is influenced by such factors as management of balance sheet size and resulting capital ratios  demand for loans  which generally yield more than investment securities  ongoing repayments  and the level of deposits 
the investment securities portfolio is largely comprised of collateralized mortgage obligations  other adjustable rate mortgage backed securities and shorter term us treasury notes 
when purchasing investment securities  the company considers its overall interest rate risk profile as well as the adequacy of expected returns relative to prepayment and other risks assumed 
during  the company sold approximately million of investment securities for a pre tax gain of approximately million 
included in the securities sold was a municipal bond with a carrying value of million that had been classified as held to maturity 
such bond was sold for a modest loss immediately following the downgrading of the municipality s credit rating by several rating agencies 
gains realized from sales of bank investment securities were 
million and 
million in and  respectively 
to enhance flexibility in managing the investment securities portfolio  and as allowed by the financial accounting standards board  in december the company transferred approximately million of us treasury notes from held to maturity to available for sale classification 
no gain or loss was realized as a result of such transfer 
the average balance of money market assets  which are comprised of interest bearing deposits at banks  trading account assets  federal funds sold and agreements to resell securities  was million in  compared with million in and million in the lower level of such assets in and largely reflects increased demand for loans  the company s decision to limit the amount of short term borrowings  which had been used to fund money market assets  and  in  reduction of the size of the balance sheet in order to strengthen capital ratios in anticipation of the december acquisitions 
core deposits represent a significant source of funding to the company 
core deposits are commonly generated through the branch network at generally lower interest rates than are available on wholesale funds of similar maturities  and include noninterest bearing demand deposits  interest bearing transaction accounts  savings deposits and domestic time deposits under  in  average core deposits rose to billion from billion in increases in interest rates paid on deposits in response to higher money market rates and the december and july acquisitions of million and million  respectively  of core deposits contributed to this rise 
higher interest rates also contributed to a shift into time deposits from more liquid deposit accounts 
core deposits averaged billion in funding provided by core deposits totaled of average earning assets in  compared with in and in an analysis of changes in the components of core deposits is presented in table in addition to core deposits  the company obtains funding through domestic time deposits of  or more  offshore deposits originated through the company s international office  and brokered certificates of deposit 
domestic time deposits over  excluding brokered certificates of deposit  averaged million in compared with million in and million in offshore deposits  comprised primarily of accounts with balances of  or more  averaged million in  compared with million and million in and  respectively 
brokered deposits averaged million in and million in  and totaled million at december  the weighted average remaining term to maturity of brokered deposits as of december  was years 
additional amounts of brokered deposits may be solicited from time to time depending on such factors as current market conditions and the cost of funds available from alternative sources 
the company also uses short term borrowings from banks  securities dealers  the federal home loan bank of new york fhlb and others as sources of funding 
short term borrowings averaged billion in  billion in and billion in in general  short term borrowings have been used to fund the company s discretionary investments in money market assets and investment securities  and  if necessary  to replace deposit outflows 
additionally  m t bank has issued million of subordinated capital notes of which million mature in and million mature in although issued primarily to enhance regulatory capital ratios  such notes also provided funding to the company 
provision for possible credit losses the purpose of the provision is to replenish and build the company s allowance for possible credit losses to a level necessary to maintain an adequate reserve position 
in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for possible credit losses  management performs an ongoing evaluation of the loan portfolio and other credit commitments  including such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category  the current financial condition of specific borrowers  the economic environment in which borrowers operate  the level of delinquent loans and the value of any collateral 
based upon the results of such review  management believes that the allowance for possible credit losses at december  was adequate to absorb credit losses from existing loans  leases and credit commitments 
reflecting generally stable economic conditions in market areas served by the company throughout much of  the provision for possible credit losses was reduced to million from million in the provision was million in when there was concern by management about unsettled commercial real estate markets  in particular in the new york city metropolitan area  and the timing and sustainability of economic recovery in market areas served by the company in general 
net charge offs in were million  compared with million in and million in net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding were 
in  
in and 
in nonperforming loans totaled million or 
of loans outstanding at december   compared with million or 
a year earlier and million or at december  the allowance for possible credit losses was million or of net loans and leases at the end of  compared with million or at december  and million or at december  the ratio of the allowance to nonperforming loans was  and at year end  and  respectively 
a comparative allocation of the allowance for possible credit losses for each of the past five year ends is presented in table amounts were allocated to specific loan categories based upon management s classification of loans under the company s internal loan grading system and estimates of potential charge offs inherent in each category 
however  as the total reserve is available to absorb losses from any loan category  amounts assigned do not necessarily indicate future losses within these categories 
the increase in the allocated portion of the reserve since compared with prior years is not indicative of a deterioration of credit quality within the loan portfolio  but rather reflects certain revisions to the assumptions used to calculate the allocated portion of the allowance for possible credit losses 
nevertheless  the unallocated portion of the reserve represents management s assessment of the overall level of credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio over a longer time frame 
the company s credit loss experience is influenced by many factors  including overall economic conditions  in general  and  due to the size of the company s commercial real estate loan portfolio  real estate valuations  in particular 
nonperforming commercial real estate loans totaled million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
at december   million of nonperforming commercial real estate loans were secured by properties located in the new york city metropolitan area  compared with million and million at december  and  respectively 
net charge offs of commercial real estate loans were million in  million in and million in included in these totals are net charge offs of commercial real estate loans secured by properties in the new york city metropolitan area of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net charge offs of consumer loans were million in  or 
of average consumer loans outstanding during the year  compared with million or 
in and million or 
in higher charge offs of credit card balances were the principal factor contributing to the increase in consumer loan charge offs in net credit card charge offs were million in  compared with million and million in and  respectively 
nonperforming consumer loans totaled million or 
of outstanding consumer loans at december   compared with million or 
at december  and million or 
at december  the company has limited exposure to possible credit losses originating from concentrations of credit extended to any specific industry 
no such concentration exceeded of total loans outstanding at december  furthermore  the company had no exposure to less developed countries  and only million of foreign loans in total 
repossessed assets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans totaled million at december   compared with million and million at the end of and  respectively 
the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  in the first quarter of as amended  sfas no 
requires that creditors measure certain impaired loans based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or at the loan s observable value or the fair value of underlying collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
in general  the company places loans considered to be impaired on nonaccrual status 
the adoption of sfas no 
had no impact on the company s results of operations or on its loan classification policies 
other income other income in included million of tax exempt income resulting from the transfer of appreciated investment securities to an affiliated  tax exempt charitable foundation 
excluding the effect of such income  as well as gains from sales of bank investment securities  other income increased to million in from million in and from million in including the impact of deposit accounts associated with the franchises acquired in late and  service charges on deposit accounts increased to million in from million in  and from million in merchant discount and other credit card fees in totaled million  compared with million in and million in trust income of million increased from million in  and from million in the increases in trust revenues were attributable  in large part  to enhanced earnings from mutual fund management fees and from personal and corporate trust business 
trading account gains increased to million in from 
million in  but decreased from million in other revenues from operations totaled million in  compared with million in excluding the million of tax exempt income related to the transfer of securities to the affiliated foundation and million in mortgage banking revenues  which consist of residential mortgage loan servicing fee income  gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights  and other residential mortgage related fees  increased to million in from million in and million in fees earned in for servicing residential mortgage loans for others increased million from a year earlier  while gains from sales of residential mortgage loans increased million  including million resulting from the previously noted adoption of sfas no 
additionally  in the company realized million of gains from sales of rights to service approximately million of residential mortgage loans 
the million improvement in mortgage banking revenues in from was also largely attributable to growth in the company s residential mortgage servicing business 
residential mortgage loans serviced for others totaled billion  billion and billion at december   and  respectively 
revenues from servicing residential mortgage loans for others were million in  million in and million in other expense other expense totaled million in  compared with million in and million in salaries and employee benefits expenses were million in  an increase of million or from million in factors contributing to the higher personnel expenses were acquisitions  expansion of the company s residential mortgage banking and securities businesses  and incentive based compensation arrangements  including an increase of million in expenses related to stock appreciation rights granted to employees in and personnel costs in increased million or from million in such increase was due largely to merit salary increases and higher pension and other benefits costs 
the number of full time equivalent employees was  at december   up from  and  at december  and  respectively 
as previously noted  during the company incurred million of charitable contributions expense related to the transfer of securities to a charitable foundation affiliated with the company 
excluding the impact of such contributions expense  which is included in s other costs of operations  nonpersonnel expenses totaled million in  up from million in and million in higher mortgage banking related expenses and expenses associated with operating the entities acquired in late and contributed to the increases 
additionally  in february  the company wrote off million of non marketable securities of nationar  a bank that provided services to financial institutions  which was seized by banking regulators 
during  the assessment to the company from the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic for deposit insurance provided by the bank insurance fund bif was reduced  and effective january  was substantially eliminated 
although first empire s banking subsidiaries are bif insured institutions  the company has approximately billion of deposits obtained in so called oakar acquisitions for which deposit insurance premiums are paid to the savings association insurance fund saif of the fdic 
the fdic has not reduced the assessment rate for saif insured deposits 
furthermore  in  congressional committees considered proposals that would require a one time special assessment related to deposits insured by the saif 
although final legislation has yet to be enacted  management believes that it is likely that a special assessment will ultimately be levied against the company on its saif insured oakar deposits 
the amount of any such special assessment cannot be precisely predicted at this time 
the million decline in nonpersonnel expenses to million in from million in  as cited above  was due  in part  to a combined million reduction in expenses for professional services and other real estate owned and a reduction in the amount of write downs in the carrying value of excess servicing receivables and capitalized mortgage servicing rights associated with residential mortgage loans serviced for others 
such write downs totaled 
million in and million in there were no write downs of excess servicing receivables or capitalized mortgage servicing rights in  however  an impairment allowance of million for declines in value of capitalized mortgage servicing rights was recorded 
at december   excess servicing receivables and capitalized mortgage servicing rights were million and million  respectively  compared with million and million  respectively  at december  income taxes the provision for income taxes in was million  up from million in and million in the effective tax rates were in and  and in a reconciliation of income tax expense to the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to pre tax income is provided in note of notes to financial statements 
international activities the company s investment in international assets was million at december   consisting largely of eurodollar placements  and million at december  total offshore deposits were million and million at december  and  respectively 
liquidity and interest rate sensitivity as part of its ongoing operations  the company is exposed to liquidity risk whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ 
accordingly  a critical element in managing a banking institution is ensuring that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy demands for loans  deposit withdrawals  operating expenses and other corporate purposes 
the company s core deposits have historically provided a large source of funds 
such deposits are generated from a large base of consumer  corporate and institutional customers  which over the past several years has become more geographically diverse as a result of acquisitions and expansion of the company s businesses 
nevertheless  in recent years the company has faced increased competition in offering services and products from a large array of financial market participants  including banks  thrifts  mutual funds  securities dealers and others 
as a result  and consistent with banking industry experience in general  the company has experienced a reduction in the percentage of average earning assets funded by core deposits 
core deposits financed of the company s earning assets at december   compared with at december  and at december  the company supplements funding from core deposits with various wholesale borrowings  such as federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  and brokered certificates of deposit 
additionally  m t bank and east new york have a combined credit facility with the fhlb aggregating million  with any borrowings secured by loans and investment securities 
borrowings outstanding under such credit facility totaled million at december  and million at december  although informal and sometimes reciprocal  sources of funding are also available to the company through various arrangements for unsecured short term borrowings from a wide group of banks and other financial institutions 
other sources of liquidity include maturities of money market assets  repayments of loans and investment securities  and cash flow generated from operations  such as fees collected for services 
first empire s ability to pay dividends  repurchase stock and fund operating expenses is primarily dependent on the receipt of dividends from its banking subsidiaries  which are subject to various regulatory limitations 
first empire also maintains a line of credit with an unaffiliated commercial bank 
management does not anticipate engaging in any activities  in either the short or long term  which would cause a significant strain on liquidity of either first empire or its subsidiary banks 
furthermore  management believes that available sources of liquidity are more than adequate to meet anticipated funding needs 
net interest income earned by the company is subject to the effects of changing interest rates 
the company s management of interest rate risk is intended to limit the variability of net interest income under differing interest rate scenarios 
as part of such management  the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements having an aggregate notional amount of approximately billion at december  information about interest rate swaps entered into for interest rate risk management purposes is included herein under net interest income lending and funding activities and in note of notes to financial statements 
in accordance with industry practice  table presents information about the repricing or maturity of assets and liabilities on a contractual basis within the specified time frames  as well as the impact of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes 
management believes this measure does not appropriately depict interest rate risk since changes in interest rates do not necessarily affect all categories of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities equally nor  as assumed in the table  on the contractual maturity or repricing date 
furthermore  this static presentation of interest rate risk fails to consider the effect of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities  projected changes in balance sheet composition or any subsequent interest rate risk management activities the company is likely to implement 
in management s opinion  the interest rate sensitivity analysis presented in the table does not accurately reflect the company s actual sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
the asset liability committee  which includes members of senior management  monitors the company s exposure to changing interest rates 
interest rate risk is measured by the variability of projected net interest income under a number of possible interest rate scenarios 
management s philosophy toward positioning the company for interest rate movements is to attempt to limit such variability 
management monitors the company s interest rate sensitivity with the aid of a computer model which considers the impact of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities  as well as statistically derived interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments  including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities 
giving consideration to interest rate swaps in place at december  and utilizing the model described above  management s assessment is that the variability of net interest income would be largely unaffected by changes in interest rates in the coming year  but a sustained decrease in interest rates would likely have a detrimental effect on net interest income in later years 
management closely monitors the company s exposure to changing interest rates and spreads and stands ready to take action  through the use of on or off balance sheet instruments  to mitigate such exposure when deemed prudent to do so 
possible actions include  but are not limited to  changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products  modifying the composition of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and entering into or modifying existing interest rate swap agreements 
capital common stockholders equity totaled million at december   compared with million and million at the end of and  respectively 
on a per share basis  common stockholders equity was at december   an increase of from at december  and from at december  total stockholders equity at december  was million or of total assets  compared with million or at december  and million or at december  the ratio of average total stockholders equity to average total assets was  and in  and  respectively 
stockholders equity at december  was reduced by million  or 
per common share  for the net after tax impact of unrealized losses on investment securities classified as available for sale  compared with a reduction of million  or per common share  at december  such unrealized losses represent the amount by which amortized cost exceeded the fair value of investment securities classified as available for sale  net of applicable income taxes 
the market valuation of investment securities should be considered in the context of the entire balance sheet of the company 
with the exception of investment securities classified as available for sale  trading account assets and liabilities  and mortgage loans held for sale  the carrying values of financial instruments in the balance sheet are generally not adjusted for appreciation or depreciation in market value resulting from changes in interest rates 
federal regulators generally require banking institutions to maintain core capital and total capital ratios of at least and  respectively  of risk adjusted total assets 
in addition to the risk based measures  federal bank regulators have also implemented a minimum leverage ratio guideline of of the quarterly average of total assets 
under regulatory guidelines  the unrealized gains or losses on investment securities classified as available for sale are not recognized in determining regulatory capital 
the capital ratios of the company and its banking subsidiaries  m t bank  east new york and m t bank  na  as of december  are presented in table the company has historically maintained capital ratios well in excess of minimum regulatory guidelines largely through a high rate of internal capital generation 
the rate of internal capital generation  or net income excluding the after tax effects of gains from sales of investment securities less dividends paid expressed as a percentage of average total stockholders equity  was in  in and in cash dividends on common stock of million were paid in  compared with million in and million in in the fourth quarter of  first empire s quarterly common stock dividend was increased to 
per share from 
in total  dividends per common share increased to in from in and in dividends of million were paid to the preferred stockholder in  and during  first empire acquired  shares pursuant to and thereby completing the program announced in december to repurchase and hold as treasury stock up to  shares of common stock for reissuance upon the possible future conversion of its convertible preferred stock 
the  repurchased shares were acquired at an average cost of 
the preferred stock is convertible at any time into shares of first empire s common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to certain adjustments 
first empire has the right to redeem the preferred stock without premium on or after march  however  upon receipt of notification of such a planned redemption  the holder may convert the preferred stock into common shares 
on february   first empire notified the preferred stockholder of its intention to redeem the preferred stock 
on february   the preferred stockholder advised first empire of its intention to convert the preferred stock into shares of common stock of first empire 
in november  first empire announced an additional plan to repurchase and hold as treasury stock up to  shares of common stock for reissuance upon the possible future exercise of outstanding stock options 
as of december   first empire had repurchased  common shares pursuant to such plan at an average cost of per share 
fourth quarter results first empire earned million or per common share in the fourth quarter of  increases of and  respectively  from the fourth quarter of when net income was million or per common share 
taxable equivalent net interest income increased to million in the fourth quarter of  up million from million in the fourth quarter of growth in average loans outstanding was the primary factor contributing to the improvement in net interest income 
average loans for the fourth quarter of totaled billion  a increase from billion during the fourth quarter of the increase in net interest income resulting from growth in average loans was partially offset by a narrowing of the net interest spread to in the recent quarter  compared with in the fourth quarter of net interest margin was in the fourth quarter of  compared with in the year earlier quarter 
the provision for possible credit losses was million and net charge offs were million in the final quarter  compared with million and million  respectively  in the fourth quarter of net charge offs as an annualized percentage of average loans and leases were 
in both quarters 
exclusive of the effects of investment securities transactions and the december transfer of investment securities to an affiliated charitable foundation  other income rose to million in the fourth quarter of from million in the year earlier quarter 
higher revenues associated with mortgage banking activities and the sales of mutual funds and annuities contributed to this increase 
also excluding the effect of the december transfer of securities to the affiliated foundation  other expense was million in the fourth quarter of  compared with million in the fourth quarter of acquisitions  expansion of first empire s mortgage banking and securities businesses  and stock appreciation rights expense were factors contributing to the rise in other expense over the comparable prior year period
