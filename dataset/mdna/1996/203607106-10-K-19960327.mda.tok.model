item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to facilitate an understanding and assessment of significant changes in trends related to the financial condition of the company and the results of its operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
all references in the discussion to financial condition and results of operations are to the consolidated position and results of the company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole 
results of operations net income trend shareholder return trends million reported earnings return on return average on reported earnings recurring earnings assets average equity earnings per share year amount change amount change change net income for rose over last year to an all time high of million 
earnings per share were  down primarily due to the company s issuance of additional common and preferred stock in mid this issuance put sufficient capital in place to facilitate the purchase of branches from the chase manhattan bank  na on july  recurring or core earnings were up over from last year to million after removing the impact of certain nonoperating expenditures and net losses on the sale of investment securities and other assets 
s results climbed slightly over the prior year net income rose to million or per share  core earnings rose at a pace 
these results reflect the second consecutive year in which acquisitions had an important impact on the company s results 
approximately  in one time expenses was incurred this year associated with integrating the chase purchase and consummating the subsequent sale of three of these branches  including related loans and deposits  to nbt bank  na on december   the facilities sold were the only properties in the purchase package from chase not located in or adjacent to cbsi s existing market area 
in  when three branches from the resolution trust company and one from chase were acquired  nearly  in nonrecurring expenses was incurred to assimilate the purchases 
one time expenses in the earlier years largely related to the company s operational and organizational consolidation of its five formerly independent commercial banks into today s community bank  na  a decision announced in the fall of s improvement in net income over the prior year is explained by the following major factors o net interest income full tax equivalent basis climbed  reflecting earning asset growth of million on average or 
as of the chase branch acquisition date  earning assets rose approximately million or after repayment of short term borrowings from the million in deposits purchased 
earning asset growth more than offset the impact of a basis point decline in the company s net interest margin to 
o noninterest income excluding net losses on the sale of investment securities and other assets was up owing to continued strength in fiduciary services income  higher fees from the sale of annuities and mutual funds  and greater overdraft fees  service charges  and commissions from an expanded customer base gained from acquisitions in as well as the chase branch purchase 
net losses on the sale of investment securities and other assets were  this year versus  in o overhead expense increased by  excluding one time costs of the chase acquisition  growth was million or 
approximately of the latter increase reflected personnel costs  largely because of the chase branches and required operations center support as well as selective additions in lending and financial product sales 
a significant balance of the nonpersonnel expense increase was also related to the new branches and the cost of servicing their  customers net of the branches sold to nbt bank  in addition to amortization of intangible assets associated with the chase transaction 
o loan loss provision expense rose  increasing the loan loss reserve to million or of loans outstanding  a basis point decrease from one year earlier 
though loans rose a record  asset quality remained strong  with the net charge off average loans ratio improving to 
and nonperforming loans falling by over one third to million or 
of loans outstanding 
consequently  coverage of reserves to nonperformers is ample in the opinion of management at times 
the above combination of factors resulted in a level of profitability at or above that of cbsi s peer bank holding companies  this group is comprised of companies nationwide having billion to billion in assets based on data through september  as provided by the federal reserve system 
net income per dollar employed  or return on average assets  was  though off basis points from the prior year s level  it nonetheless is in the peer normal th percentile 
shareholder return on equity  or net income as a percent of average equity  was reduced to  or the th peer percentile 
these modestly lower levels of profitability reflect the half year impact of the chase acquisition  which at the outset increased the company s deposit base by 
by year end  approximately full time equivalent employees were added  either formerly employed by chase or hired to provide operational support or develop business in the new markets 
in addition  this early period of assimilation included relatively high one time implementation expenses as well as the dampening impact on margins of the acquired branches initially low loan to deposit ratio 
as of year end  loans in the markets served by the former chase branches had more than doubled  increasing their loan to deposit ratio to 
return on average assets return on average assets  return on average equity  dividend payout and equity to asset ratios for the years indicated are as follows at december  percentage of net income to average total assets percentage of net income to average shareholders equity percentage of net income to average shareholders equity plus average preferred stock percentage of dividends declared per common share to net income per common share percentage of average shareholder s equity to average total assets percentage of average shareholder s equity plus average preferred stock to average total assets net interest income net interest income is the company s principal source of core operating income for payment of overhead and possible loan losses 
it is the amount that interest and fees on earning assets exceeds the cost of funds  primarily interest paid to the company s depositors 
net interest margin is the difference between the gross yield on earning assets and the cost of interest bearing funds as a percentage of earning assets

net interest income with nontaxable income converted to a full tax equivalent basis totaled million in  this represents a million or increase from the prior year 
higher asset and liability volumes had a positive impact on net interest income of million  while interest rate changes had a negative impact of million 
in  net interest income totaled million  an increase of million or over the prior year 
higher volumes accounted for million of this increase while interest rate changes negatively impacted margins by million 
greater average earning assets of million helped contribute million in additional gross interest income during reflective of the chase branch acquisition  earning asset volumes were up over s figures  a record for the company since its formation in the increase surpasses the previous year s record growth of million or 
increases in investment outstandings  due primarily to the strategic use of excess cash from the chase branch deposit acquisition  accounted for million or over of s average earning asset growth 
including the impact of selected pre investment strategies prior to the acquisition s closing date  higher investment volumes produced an additional million towards the increase in gross interest income 
average investment yields improved by basis points from in to in through september   the company s investment yield was in the very favorable th peer bank percentile 
the remaining million in average earning asset growth reflected increased lending activity from both existing markets and those from the newly acquired chase branches 
this growth in activity contributed an additional million towards the increase in gross interest income 
because of the small initial amount of loans purchased from chase  the ratio of loans to earning assets decreased this year 
average loan yields improved by basis points from in to this year 
through september   the company s loan yield was in the favorable th peer bank percentile 
average deposit and other funding liabilities grew by million in  increasing total interest expense of the company by an additional million 
nearly one quarter of this additional expense is traceable to higher average rates paid on time deposits  whose costs closely track the movement of the treasury yield curve 
during  time deposit rates averaged  or basis points higher than their average of 
in addition  interest expense rose due to a growing mix of time deposits to total deposits  reflecting movement of funds from savings and money market accounts as well as the fact that the acquired chase deposits contained a relatively higher portion of time accounts 
management was quite successful in in controlling the rising cost of its interest bearing account base not directly priced relative to the treasury yield curve 
the average rate on savings including interest checking and money market accounts increased by a combined total of only basis points during  rising from in to this year 
this containment was able to be accomplished without materially affecting total average deposits outstanding  separate from the chase branch acquisition 
largely because of the impact of the chase deposits  the portion of interest bearing funds which supports earning assets rose slightly in through september   the company s average cost of funds rate was in the st peer bank percentile 
overall  cbsi s net interest margin declined from in to in this is attributable to a basis point increase in the average cost of funds as compared to a rise in the yield on earning assets of less than half that amount 
an increased mix of investment securities to earning assets largely contributed to the decline in earning asset yields  as marketable securities have historically had lower yields than most types of loans 
besides the impact of increased time deposits costs  the average rate on cost of funds was relatively higher during the first half of  when more costly borrowings were used to support investment growth prior to being replaced by the lower priced chase deposits 
despite the decline in the company s net interest margin  it ranks in the st peer bank percentile through september  while the company s net interest margin has historically been well above the norm  the primary objective in recent years has been to maximize shareholder returns through active utilization of tangible capital  which in the past has involved various borrowing and investment strategies 
thus  as management focuses on growing the earning asset base of the company  a potential downward change in margin may be considered secondary to increasing the future stream of net interest income

noninterest income the primary sources of noninterest income are recurring fees from core banking operations and revenues from one time events  defined as net gains losses from the sale of investments  loans  and miscellaneous assets 
cbsi presently has no active nonbanking subsidiaries 
its former mortgage banking and data processing companies were closed in and  respectively  as part of the company s restructuring plan to reduce overhead and eliminate unprofitable functions

of average assets  slightly lower than s level of 
the decrease in this ratio is primarily because of nearly more in average assets as a result of the chase branch acquisition  expanded borrowings in anticipation of the planned chase closing date in mid july  and the full year impact of the branch acquisitions in june and october of approximately  of s noninterest income resulted from fees generated by the chase branches  about of that improvement pertained to the three branches sold to nbt bank in mid december 
though progress has been steady in dollar terms over the last few years  strong asset growth has placed noninterest income in the relatively low th peer percentile compared to management s intermediate term objective of becoming peer normal at approximately 
of average assets

excluding investment security gains losses 
as a percentage of average assets in light of management s objective  emphasis has been placed on a program of continuous improvement in recurring noninterest income 
these efforts have resulted in new products  such as the visa debit card initiated this year allows customer access to deposited funds at any merchant accepting visa  secondary mortgage market sales servicing beginning in  and the sale of mutual funds and annuities  a program also launched in the focus on growth continues to drive efforts to increase fiduciary income  control waived fees  and competitively price deposit service charges and commission based services 
as a result of these efforts  in addition to the impact of the chase acquisition and the full year effect of the smaller acquisitions  fees from core banking operations improved in several key areas in o fiduciary fees expanded to over million  up in this improvement represents growth in fees from employee benefit trust products of  reflective of cbsi s attractive  creatively designed plans for construction  nonprofit  and other specialty industries  both within and outside the company s core banking areas 
fees from personal trust services  however  decreased as a result of trust assets being transferred into the special investment products group  which is responsible for mutual funds and annuity sales 
a more focused program of business development planned for is expected to strengthen future fiduciary income growth 
o service charges on deposit accounts and overdraft fees increased to million in  an excellent growth rate versus in the full year impact of s acquisitions and s chase acquisition explain most of this growth 
the increase also reflects favorable movement in cbsi s core deposit volumes and the aforementioned emphasis on ensuring competitive pricing and reducing waived fees 
o merchant fees earned through the company s visa affiliation fell approximately in to  attributable to the loss of a large vendor early in however  because of the low margin on the lost vendor and continued improvement in the margins of the remaining vendors  the direct margin net of processing expense rose over percentage points to an all time high of 
o is the second year in which cbsi has offered annuities  mutual funds  and other investment products through financial services representatives fsrs located in selected geographic markets within its branch network 
net commission income from this activity amounted to almost  on asset sales of million  more than triple the level of approximately  on sales of million 
the number of fsr positions staffed by registered representatives working through primevest financial services  inc of saint cloud  minnesota increased by two during to seven as of year end 
this line of special investment products is anticipated to continue strong growth in  reflective of the full year impact of an expanded sales staff as well as the additional  new customers contributed by the former chase branches 
o general commissions and miscellaneous income at million were up more than in the majority of this year s increase is attributable to miscellaneous commissions on wire transfers  check orders  travelers checks  utility payment fees  and other recurring commissions that result from daily branch operations  as well as to safe box rent increases  all primarily a consequence of the acquisitions made over the past two years 
nonrecurring other income reflected a loss of  in versus a loss of  in this year s results were caused by a  loss on the sale of million in lower yielding investments being almost completely offset by gains on the sale of student loans and mortgages sold in the secondary market 
the prior year s  investment loss resulted from the sale of million in lower yielding securities 
benefits from incurring these investment losses include potential reinvestment of the proceeds into higher yielding assets intended to increase net earnings over the average term to maturity of the investments sold  a possible lowering of future reinvestment risk  and reduction in market value exposure in the available for sale investment portfolio

non interest expense the following table sets forth selected detailed information by category of non interest expenses of the company for the years indicated year ended december  in thousands salary expense    payroll taxes and benefits    net occupancy expense    equipment expense    professional fees    data processing expense    amortization  stationary and supplies  deposit insurance premiums   other    total    total operating expenses as a percentage of average assets efficiency ratio non interest expense to recurring operating income noninterest expense or overhead rose million or in to million compared to a moderate increase in the prior year 
the primary reasons for this year s increase are the one time and recurring additions to overhead associated with the acquisition of the company s new locations former chase branches net of those sold to nbt bank plus one former fleet bank facility in olean  new york 
overhead growth also reflects the full year impact of the branch acquisitions 
as a percent of average assets  this year s overhead at was in the favorable th peer percentile  an improvement from or the th percentile in in brief  approximately million in additional expense was incurred in related to the new chase branches  of which  was the nonrecurring cost of operationally consummating the transaction 
second  approximately million in expense was associated with the direct operation of the chase branches  relate to branches sold to nbt bank 
third  servicing the  former chase customers required additional operational support in the company s regional processing centers and some limited incremental administrative expense 
and last  amortization of the intangible assets created by the chase transaction added about million 
for cbsi as a whole  higher personnel expense accounted for of s increase in overhead  with personnel costs being up versus being higher in salary expense increased by  primarily reflective of new full time equivalent ftes staff additions either formerly employed by chase or hired to provide operational support or develop business in the new markets 
additionally  the increase in salaries resulted from the full year impact of the four branches acquired in  modest annual merit awards  staffing of the new olean branch facility  and continued strengthening of the lending and fiduciary services functions 
total ftes at year end were versus at year end payroll taxes and benefits rose largely due to the additions to staff  higher benefit costs per employee including the impact of several large medical claims  and severance expense associated with the chase transaction 
nonpersonnel expense rose almost million or this year as opposed to a  or a increase in higher occupancy expense  supplies  telephone  postage  and computer services resulted from the new locations before the mid december sale of three locations added in the last half of and the full year impact of s acquisitions 
amortization of intangible assets rose as a result of the premium paid on the deposits acquired from chase and the premiums paid on the prior year s acquisitions 
various other increases related to inflation  internal volume growth  and acquisitions were partially offset by lower credit card processing expense caused by the loss of a large vendor and a reduction in the fdic deposit insurance premium rate from basis points to zero during the year 
the efficiency ratio is defined as overhead expense divided by recurring operating income full tax equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income  excluding net securities gains and losses  the lower the ratio  the more efficient a bank is considered to be 
the sharp drop in the ratio from in to in resulted from the restructuring of the company into a single bank holding company 
s flattening was caused by additional net overhead of the four branches acquired that year  which added million in deposits and only a de minimus amount of related loans 
the slight increase in the ratio to  which represents the favorable th peer percentile  reflects increased costs resulting from the million chase deposit acquisition  as with the much smaller transactions  there has initially been a disproportionately smaller increase in net interest income since practically all of the acquired deposits are funding investments rather than higher yielding loans 
without the  in one time chase implementation expenses  the efficiency ratio would have been in management has set an objective to bring this ratio downward to within the next three to five years 
while the company s expense ratios have generally been favorable  management maintains a heightened focus on controlling costs and eliminating inefficiencies 
areas for improvement have been identified through detailed peer comparisons  employee involvement  and targeted use of outside consultants 
a task force has been initiated to coordinate technology improvements that may bring future expense savings such as bringing automation to the branch customer service functions and capturing information on optical disk instead of microfiche 
further  line item expense monitoring on a regional basis has been assigned to individual managers as a supplement to regular surveillance by the corporate finance department 
these efforts are intended to offset pressure from inflation and higher transaction volumes and allow the company to more fully benefit from economies of scale as it continues to grow

income and income taxes income before tax in was nearly million  up over the prior year s amount  which was higher than s level 
when pre tax income is recast as if all tax exempt revenues were fully taxable on a federal basis  s results rose by million or 
the main reasons for improved pre tax earnings were the favorable million increase in net interest income full tax equivalent basis  which reflected the strong earning asset growth discussed previously  and a million climb in noninterest income including the change in net losses on the sale of securities and other assets 
these factors were partially offset by million more in overhead expense  including the aforementioned million in one time and other expenses associated with the chase branches  and  more in loan loss provision expense 
the company s combined effective federal and state tax rate rose basis points this year to 
this rate has increased since largely as a result of a decreasing proportion of tax exempt municipal investment holdings 
more specifically  taxable earning assets have experienced a high rate of growth compared to tax exempt holdings  whose level has been flat to falling primarily because of the less attractive nature of these investments

in addition to the contribution of strong earnings partially offset by dividends paid to shareholders  the large increase in capital during can be attributed to shares of common and preferred stock issued to facilitate the chase branch acquisition as indicated below 
in total  million in new capital was raised 
the resulting profile of cbsi s common shareholder base as of september  reflects a net increase of shareholders from year end  the bulk of which is associated with the mid year common stock offering 
o on june   cbsi issued  shares of common stock per share and  shares of cumulative perpetual preferred stock per share 
o pursuant to an overallotment option granted to the underwriter   shares of common stock were issued on july  along with  shares reserved for directors and employees per share 
o on november   cbsi repurchased half million or  shares of its preferred stock at par value without any prepayment penalty 
the company took this action in light of the success of its common stock issuance and the demonstrated earnings contribution of the chase branch acquisition 
the repurchase also eliminated a relatively high cost funding source

n a n a the ratio of tier i capital to assets or tier i leverage ratio  the basic measure for which regulators have established a minimum to be considered well capitalized  remains sound at 
this level compares to a year ago 
the change reflects growth in assets resulting from the chase acquisition and the decision by management to limit the size of the company s secondary capital offering to that required to remain well capitalized 
the total capital to risk weighted assets ratio is as of year end  well above the minimum requirement for well capitalized banks 
the company is confident that capital levels are being prudently balanced between regulatory and investor perspectives 
cash dividends paid in of million represented an increase of over the prior year 
this growth reflects the greater number of shares outstanding due to both the secondary offerings and the exercise of stock options  payment of the preferred stock dividend  and a three cent per share increase in quarterly common stock dividend in the fourth quarter of from 
to 
raising the company s expected annualized dividend to per common share represents management s confidence that earnings strength is sustainable and that capital can be maintained at a satisfactory level

the flattening of growth during the last two years reflects the increase in mortgage rates from their historic lows in late  though demand began to improve in the summer of after rates started to soften 
growth has also been muted because of a program which began in mid to sell selected fixed rate originations in the secondary market

the company s policy is to place a loan on a non accrual status and recognize income on a cash basis when it is more than ninety days past due  except when in the opinion of management it is well secured and in the process of collection 
nonperforming loans  defined as nonaccruing loans plus accruing loans days or more past due  ended at a very manageable million 
this level is nearly million lower than one year earlier  largely due to resolution of a single public housing project where cost overruns delayed a take out by the farmers home administration 
today s level is also lower than the million in nonperformers at year end  which was established following a critical view of certain commercial credits taken by the then new ceo and lending personnel added as a result of organizational turnover 
consistent with the reduction in nonperforming loans is a significant improvement in its ratio to total loans  which ended at  down by almost half from the 
level of one year earlier 
as of september   when the nonperforming loan ratio stood at  the company s asset quality was in the very strong th percentile compared to peers 
the ratio of nonperforming assets which additionally include troubled debt restructurings and other real estate to total loans plus oreo is also highly favorable at 
as of december  and for years then ended  the bank had no loans deemed to be impaired under fasb total delinquencies  defined as loans days or more past due and nonaccruing  followed a saucer shaped trend during  ending the year at  virtually unchanged from twelve months earlier and down from at year end after a significant reduction in the second quarter as discussed above  commercial delinquencies remained relatively constant  concluding at a modest 
past due installment loans dipped below during spring of this year  reaching by year end 
real estate delinquencies fluctuated in the 
range during most of the year  finishing at 
in december 
as of september   when overall delinquencies were at  the company ranked in the very favorable lowest peer quartile  consistent with historically being better than the peer norm due to its reliable consumer borrower base 
other factors contributing to successful underwriting  collection  and credit monitoring include selective addition of experienced lenders over the last several years  clear delineation of authority along with newly adopted loan policies and procedures  regional loan servicing and collection departments focused on taking prompt corrective action  and a centralized loan review function which is given priority attention and has monthly board of director accountability 
summary of loan loss experience the following table summarizes loan balances at the end of each period indicated and the daily average amount of loans 
also summarized are changes in the allowance for possible loan losses arising from loans charged off and recoveries on loans previously charged off and additions to the allowance which have been charged to expenses

real estate construction real estate mortgage installment total recoveries net loans charged off     additions to allowance charged to expense      balance at end of period      ratio of net charge offs to average loans outstanding the additions to the allowance during through were determined using actual loan loss experience and future projected loan losses and other factors affecting the estimate of possible loan losses 
besides its favorable delinquency and nonperforming asset levels  another measure of the company s strong asset quality is a low net charge offs record  which for the third consecutive year was better than its historically acceptable norm 
gross charge offs rose a relatively small to million  or 
of average loans outstanding versus 
in in addition  this year s recoveries were an all time record both in dollar amount and in relation to prior year gross charge offs 
as a result  net charge offs at million represented a very acceptable 
ratio to average loans 
since the banking industry in general has benefited from very favorable credit loss experience  the net charge off ratio approximates the peer norm 
a timely charge off policy and relatively low nonperforming loans have enabled the company to carry a reserve for loan losses well below peers  but sufficient in the event of an economic downturn 
in addition  the company s small business loan orientation reduces the likelihood of large  single borrower charge offs 
as a percent of total loans  the loss reserve ratio was  down slightly from the levels when major building of the ratio took place 
though the reserve ratio is presently in the relatively low th peer percentile  coverage over nonperforming loans as of september  was well above the norm in the rd percentile  management considers the year end level at to be ample 
another measure of comfort to management is that after conservative allocation by specific customer and loan type  over of loan loss reserves remains available for absorbing general  unforeseen loan losses  up from at year end the annual loan loss provision has characteristically been well in excess of net charge offs  being covered by over times since  this year s coverage exceeded times 
this practice has enabled a steady increase in the loan loss reserve level  which rose by almost  or to an all time high of million at year end compared to average loans  the annual loan loss provision has been slightly above the peer norm 
the allowance for possible loan losses has been allocated according to the amount deemed to be reasonably necessary to provide for the possibility of losses being incurred within the following categories of loans at the dates indicated at december  percent of percent of percent of loans in loans in loans in percent of each each each percent of loans in category category category loans in each each amount of to total amount of to total amount of to total amount of category to amount of category to allowance loans allowance loans allowance loans allowance total loans allowance total loans commercial  financial  agricultural      real estate construction real estate mortgage   installment      unallocated  n a n a n a  n a n a total      funding sources typical of most commercial banking institutions today is the need to rely on a variety of funding sources to support its earning asset base as well as to achieve targeted growth objectives 
there are three primary sources of funding that comprise cbsi s overall funding matrix  which considers maturity  stability  and price deposits of individuals  partnerships  and corporations ipc deposits  collateralized municipal deposits  and capital market borrowings 
sources of funds average th quarter balances million total funds ipc deposits public funds capital borrowings sources amount total amount total amount total amount the company s key funding matrix was positively impacted by the chase branch acquisition completed in july as a result of this purchase  ipc deposits on average for fourth quarter accounted for over of all funding  up significantly from for the comparable period 
ipc deposits are generally considered the most attractive source of funding for a bank because of their general stability and relatively low cost  and because they provide management with a working customer base from which to cross sell a variety of loan  deposit  and other financial services related products 
although ipc deposit outstandings averaged million during the fourth quarter of  million of this average were deposits purchased from the chase branch acquisition 
without this acquisition  fourth quarter average ipc outstandings would have been million  or a decrease from fourth quarter outstandings of million 
this level of performance met management s expectations  given the nonaggressive deposit pricing strategy for  expected deposit inflows from the chase branch acquisition heavily influenced this pricing objective 
deposits of local municipalities accounted for of total cbsi funding during the fourth quarter of  down slightly from its position as of the fourth quarter of under new york state municipal law  the company is required to collateralize all local government deposits with marketable securities from its investment portfolio 
because of this stipulation  management considers this source of funding to be equivalent to capital market borrowings 
as such  cbsi endeavors to price these deposits at or below alternative capital market borrowing rates 
capital market borrowings are defined as funding sources available on a national market basis  generally requiring some form of collateralization 
borrowing sources for the company include the federal home loan bank of new york  as well as access to the national repurchase agreement market through established relationships with primary market security dealers 
capital market borrowings declined from of total funding sources in to as of fourth quarter this decline in outstandings was largely the result of management s decision to repay all short term borrowings with deposit inflows from the chase branch acquisition 
on average  capital market borrowings in at million were virtually unchanged from s level 
the mix of cbsi s ipc deposits has changed over the last three years 
the steady growth in time deposit mix reflects consumer movement away from immediately available  lower earning savings and money market accounts  in addition  the former chase deposits contained a relatively higher proportion of time deposits

investments and asset liability management the primary objective of cbsi s investment portfolio is to prudently provide a degree of low risk  quality assets to the balance sheet 
this must be accomplished within the constraints of a absorbing funds when loan demand is low and infusing funds when demand is high  b implementing certain interest rate risk management strategies which achieve a relatively stable level of net interest income  c providing both the regulatory and operational liquidity necessary to conduct day to day business activities  d considering investment risk weights as determined by regulatory risk based capital guidelines  and e generating a favorable return without undue compromise of other requirements

change total growth in investments during was largely influenced by the need to strategically utilize excess cash from the chase branch acquisition 
consequently  average portfolio outstandings grew by nearly during  compared to an increase of in primarily because of investments made as a result of the branch acquisitions and the strategy to pre invest certain of the anticipated chase branch deposits  growth in investments as measured by year end outstandings was greater in than in consistent with the company s long standing practice  all investment strategies implemented during were developed in conjunction with cbsi s asset liability position  with particular attention given to interest rate risk irr of the entire balance sheet  not just that associated with incremental investment decisions 
in order to effectively manage irr  both a short term tactical and longer term strategic horizon are considered 
as a result of the chase branch deposit acquisition  the asset liability profile underwent a dramatic  though fully anticipated  repositioning in the high level of year end liability sensitivity was eliminated as all short term borrowings were replaced by longer term core deposits from the branch purchase 
beginning in mid  the balance sheet reflected a structurally asset sensitive position  as measured by cbsi s gap maturity matrix 
the year end matrix and supporting data are displayed at the end of this section 
this new balance sheet profile afforded management the opportunity to extend the duration of certain investment purchases made in  a move primarily aimed at reducing the company s exposure to falling interest rates 
this strategy was largely accomplished by the purchase of longer dated  fixed rate callable us government agency issues and discounted  fixed rate mortgage backed securities 
the timing of this strategy was largely limited to the first two quarters of as the yield curve began to flatten in the second half of  the appeal of longer term  fixed rate investments began to wane due to the potentially high degree of market value volatility such securities might experience over their expected lifetime 
this concern prompted management to focus on a more defensive investment strategy for the remainder of the majority of securities purchased by cbsi during the second half of were floating rate us government agency collateralized mortgage backed obligations or cmos 
these instruments featured discount margin spreads of between and basis points above the one month libor rate  adjusted monthly 
as with most floating rate instruments  these bonds were subject to life time yield caps  which ranged between to 
the composition of the portfolio continues to heavily favor us governments and agency mortgage backed obligations  resulting in effective use of regulatory risk based capital 
as of year end  these two security types excluding federal home loan bank stock and federal reserve bank stock accounted for of total portfolio investments  up from a level of five years earlier 
the average life of the portfolio  including the exercise of embedded call options  extended to years as of december  as of year end and  the average life of the portfolio stood at years and years  respectively 
the investment strategies pursued during and were largely responsible for this extension 
average investment yields for the year increased to from in the december portfolio yield averaged compared to for the same month one year prior 
through september   the company s investment yield was in the very favorable th peer bank percentile 
during the fourth quarter of  management chose to reclassify approximately million of held to maturity investments as available for sale  under a special one time adjustment window granted by the financial accounting standards board on october  securities which were moved as a result of this opportunity included million in floating rate investments and million in mortgage backed securities with current face values of under million 
while these securities are now eligible for sale due to their change in accounting treatment  management has no immediate plan to exercise this option given the current interest rate environment

a tool known as a gap maturity matrix is used to isolate interest rate sensitivity or repricing mismatches between assets and liabilities 
the diagonal bank on the matrix indicates basic matching of asset liability repricing and maturity opportunities 
outstandings shown above the band are assets subject to repricing more quickly than their supporting liabilities asset sensitivity 
outstandings shown below the band are liabilities subject to repricing more quickly than the assets which they support liability sensitivity

copyright darling consulting group  inc   liquidity due to the potential for unexpected fluctuations in deposits and loans  active management of the company s liquidity is critical 
in order to respond to these circumstances  adequate sources of both on and off balance sheet funding are in place 
cbsi s primary approach to measuring liquidity is known as the basic surplus deficit model 
it is used to calculate liquidity over two time periods first  the relationship within days between liquid assets and short term liabilities which are vulnerable to nonreplacement  and second  a projection of subsequent cash flow funding needs over an additional days 
the minimum policy level of liquidity under the basic surplus deficit approach is of total assets for both the and day time horizons 
as of year end  this ratio was a conservative and  respectively 
effects of inflation the financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
virtually all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rate changes have a more significant impact on the company s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation
