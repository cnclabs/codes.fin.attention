throughout this report  unless otherwise specified  all dollar amounts refer to us dollars 
from time to time management has written off certain costs associated with various properties when it has become apparent that such costs would not be recoverable 
management believes that the financial statements included herein reflect capitalized costs under mineral properties that can be recovered and that no further write downs are necessary at this time 
the company has a number of mineral properties in three countries  the united states  chile and bolivia 
the company has interests in one project in the united states and  as at december   a equity interest in a copper project in chile and a interest in an exploration gold property in bolivia 
historically  the company s principal mineral target has been gold 
north lily s common shares traded on the over the counter market for approximately years and  beginning in may of  were included in the national association of securities dealers  inc system nasdaq symbol nlmc 
financial information about industry segments the company and its subsidiaries are primarily engaged in the gold and copper business 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
sales and marketing gold  silver and copper can be readily sold on numerous markets throughout the world and it is not difficult to ascertain the market price for such metals at any particular time 
the company s owned silver city mine produced gold and silver ore which was processed at handy harman refineries  and then sold to precious metal traders on a competitive basis 
the silver city mine ceased mining operations in february  residual gold leaching continued during and the reclamation process was implemented in the company s owned tuina mine produced copper precipitate which was transported from chile  south america and sold in the united states to a metal trader on a competitive basis 
the number of companies willing to purchase copper precipitates is limited 
the company had an agreement with metals concentrates international inc mcii to purchase its copper precipitate for operations at the tuina mine were suspended in due to high transport  refining and treatment charges and reduced copper prices 
as a result  the agreement with mcii was terminated 
the company does not plan to resume production of copper precipitates and has determined the most effective production process for the tuina property is a solvent extraction electrowinning process sx ew 
an sx ew production process would allow the company to manufacture cathode copper at the mine site with significantly reduced operating costs 
in addition cathode copper is more readily marketable and the marketing costs for this product are also significantly lower 
in order for the company to produce copper utilizing the sx ew process  an sx ew plant is required to be constructed at the mine site

an affidavit must be sworn attesting that the local currency used originates exclusively from the business to which the original investment was made or from the sale or liquidation of the original investment 
corresponding taxes must have previously been paid 
dl the minimum investment amount is us  after the approval of the foreign investment committee  a contract is entered into between the investor and the state of chile 
thereafter remittances or investments may be made under the contract and each individual remittance need not be registered 
the investment may enter the country and be valued in freely convertible foreign currency  tangible assets  credits  capitalization of foreign loans and debts  or capitalization of profits qualifying for remittance aboard

out of the overall rate first category tax is payable annually on accrued taxable income 
an additional tax of is payable on dividends or distributed profits 
the investor may waive this right and become subject to the general taxation regime described below in government regulations 
in order to repatriate capital contributions and or profits  the petitioner must deposit the equivalent in local currency at a chilean bank and obtain the prior approval of the central bank 
an affidavit must be sworn attesting that the local currency used originates exclusively from the business to which the original investment was made or from the sale or liquidation of the original investment

to date all of the company s investment in chile has been made via dl government regulations the company s mining  processing and exploration activities are subject to various laws governing the protection of the environment  prospecting  development  production  exports  taxes  labour standards  occupational health  waste disposal  toxic substances  mine safety and other matters 
mining operations and exploration activities are also subject to substantial regulation under these laws by governmental agencies 
failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in orders being issued that may cause operations to cease or be curtailed or may require installation of additional equipment 
violators may be required to compensate those suffering loss or damage by reason of violations and may be fined if convicted of an offense under such legislation 
the company believes it is in compliance with all material laws and regulations applicable to it or its operations 
additional legislation or amendments may be proposed from time to time that might affect the company s business 
the company is unable to predict in advance which proposals may be enacted or their effective dates 
such changes could  however  require increased capital or operating expenditures or both  and could prevent or delay certain operations by the company 
outlined below are some of the more significant aspects of governmental controls and regulations which materially affect the company 
in the united states the company is subject to federal and state income taxes  state and local franchise taxes  personal property taxes and state severance taxes 
state severance taxes vary between the states and within a single state 
the amount of the tax  based on a percentage of the value of the mineral being extracted  may vary from mineral to mineral 
operations are subject to taxation by each locality in which mineral properties are owned or business is done 
because many state and local tax laws are not uniform  the company runs a risk of double taxation on portions of its income by various jurisdictions 
this may adversely effect earnings  if any 
in chile the company is subject to income taxes on earnings  if any 
a first category tax rate of is applied on taxable income 
amounts distributed from chile to non residents are subject to an additional tax of  against which the first category corporate tax may be credited 
the current combined effect of these taxes on distributed income for non residents is an effective tax rate of 
there are no taxes on the value of the mineral being extracted 
there are also some minor municipal taxes 
environmental regulations united states legislation and implementing regulations adopted or proposed by the united states environmental protection agency  the bureau of land management blm and comparable agencies in various states directly and indirectly affect the mining industry in the united states 
these laws and regulations address potential contamination of air  soil and water from mining operations 
in particular  legislation such as the federal water pollution control act  the comprehensive environmental response and the compensation and liability act impose effluent standards  new source performance standards  air quality and emission standards  waste disposal requirements and other requirements with respect to present  and in some cases past mining and mineral processing  including gold mining 
us mine operators must comply with the federal mine safety and health act  which is enforced by the mine safety and health administration msha  an agency within the department of labour 
all mines  both underground and surface  are subject to inspections by msha 
the occupational safety and health administration also has jurisdiction over safety and health standards not covered by the federal mine safety and health act  although there are areas where the authority of both administrative agencies overlap 
with respect to operations in the united states  the montana department of lands administers the montana metal mine reclamation act and the montana environmental policy act  the purposes of which are to protect the usefulness  productivity and scenic values of the state s lands and waters and to reclaim to beneficial use the lands used for metal mining 
the montana department of health and environmental sciences administers and enforces air  water and waste regulations through various bureaus existing under that department  such as the montana air quality act and the montana water quality act 
the water rights bureau under the montana department of natural resources and conservation  reviews existing and proposed surface and ground water rights and uses 
existing laws and regulations with respect to the reclamation of mining operations are in place and may necessitate substantial planning and bonding requirements 
the company may be required to prepare and present to federal  state or local authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that any proposed exploration for  or production of  minerals may have upon the environment 
it may be anticipated that future legislation will significantly emphasize the protection of the environment  and that as a consequence  the activities of the company may be more closely regulated to further the cause of environmental protection 
such legislation  as well as future interpretation of existing laws  may require substantial increases in equipment and operating costs to the company and delays  interruptions  or a termination of operations  the extent of which cannot now be predicted 
chile with respect to operations in chile  the government administers and enforces mining laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations are principally administered by servicio nacional de geologia y minas sernageomin 
no bonding requirements or environmental impact statements are required in chile 
however  the current government in chile has indicated that additional regulations or laws may be introduced which emphasize the protection of the environment 
as a consequence  the activities of the company may be more closely regulated to further the cause of environmental protection 
such legislation  as well as future interpretation of existing laws  may require substantial increases in equipment and operating costs to the company and delays  interruptions  or a termination of operations  the extent of which cannot now be predicted 
employees and facilities as of march   the company has three employees in the us through its joint projects  two in chile through its joint tuina project  and the following company officers stephen e 
flechner  president and chief executive officer  w 
gene webb  executive vice president and corporate secretary  john r

north lily s office in denver  colorado is leased 
the office of the company s wholly owned chilean subsidiary  which is leased  is located at napoleon suite  las condes santiago  chile 
item properties the company has acquired and maintained its mining claims in a manner that is consistent with common industry practice and believes that title to all its material properties and mineral interests is satisfactory 
united states all of the company s properties in the united states consist of unpatented and patented mining claims  and are owned by the company or its subsidiaries or leased from third parties 
unpatented mining claims are located upon public land pursuant to procedures established by the general mining law of and related laws of the various states 
requirements for the location of a valid mining claim on public land depend on the type of claim being located and the relevant state law  but generally include discovery of valuable minerals  erecting a monument and posting on it a location notice  marking the boundaries of the claim  and filing a certificate of location with the county in which the claim is located and with the blm 
if the statutes and regulations for the location of a mining claim are complied with  the locator obtains a valid possessory right to the claim and the right to mine  remove and sell the contained minerals 
to maintain an otherwise valid claim  a claimant must also annually perform a specified amount of work  or pay rental fees directly to the blm  and make certain additional filings with the county and the blm 
failure to perform such work or make the required filings in a timely manner may render the mining claim void or voidable 
because mining claims are self initiated and self maintained  they possess some unique vulnerabilities not associated with other types of property interests 
it is impossible to ascertain the validity of unpatented mining claims from public real estate records alone  and therefore  it can be difficult or impossible to confirm that all of the requisite steps have been followed for location and maintenance of a claim 
if the validity of an unpatented mining claim is challenged by the federal government or by claimants of conflicting rights to the ground  the claimant has the burden of proving the present economic feasibility of mining minerals located within the claim as well as the steps taken to perfect the claim s location 
thus  it is conceivable that during times of falling metals prices  claims which were valid when located could become invalid if challenged 
the patent procedure permits claimants to purchase from the federal government fee title to claims upon demonstrating that the mineral deposit on the claims can be mined at a profit and by satisfying other procedural requirements 
patented mining claims are similar to other fee real property interests 
significant portions of the company s united states properties consist of patented mining claims on which the company s relevant local counsels have given their opinion that the company  or the entity through which the company holds rights to mine the property  has good title 
chile in chile the state is the owner of all mineral and fossil substances regardless of the surface ownership  but mining concessions may be obtained for the purpose of exploring or exploiting the underlying property in accordance with a jurisdictional process regulated by the mining code 
the acquisition of title to new exploration mining concessions is a detailed jurisdictional process which can be divided into three stages the recording of the application for an exploration mining concession pedimento covering the desired ground before the court and mining register of the relevant county comuna where the ground is located and its publication in the official gazette 
all persons except certain government officials  some of their relatives and other similar persons may prospect on any land not cultivated or enclosed 
the request for a court judgment formally constituting and granting the concession sentencia during which process a judge checks the procedure and the payment of certain fees  and representatives of the national geological and mining service check the technical aspects of the title to the ground 
the issuance by the court of the constituting sentencia whereby a two year exploration mining concession is granted from the date of the sentencia 
this sentencia then has to be published in extract in the official gazette and recorded in the corresponding mining register within a certain period of time 
prior to its expiration the owner of an exploration mining concession may conduct all kinds of exploration activities  may apply for an exploitation mining concession pertenencia to the corresponding judge which also requires a jurisdictional process  and may request easements or facilities from neighbour concessions or from surface land owners  as necessary 
prior to expiration of exploration mining concessions  a single extension for a further two years can be applied for  however  in order to obtain such extension  the area of the concession must be reduced by 
an alternative to extension is to obtain one or more exploitation mining concessions or pertenencia over the same ground 
in order to obtain an exploitation mining concession which permits commencement of production from a mineral property it is necessary to go through a process which is similar in its structure to that for obtaining an exploration mining concession but requires a longer time period 
an application manifestacion for the concession must initially be recorded and  following certain additional procedures  a request for a formative survey of the concession mensura is made 
following the survey location on the ground of the boundaries of the concession and certain additional procedures  including opportunities for third parties to put forward opposition to the survey of the concession  a formative judgment sentencia is issued and the exploitation mining concession is formally granted 
all exploitation mining concessions are granted for an indefinite period 
pedimento  as well as exploration mining concessions and exploitation mining concessions concessions are transferable and irrevocable but only concessions can be mortgaged 
both are regulated by the same civil law rules that regulate real estate and fixed assets  save that they are not subject to attachments 
chilean mining law recognizes a preference to a concession owner and not to the land surface owner because the state is interested in the development of mining resources 
however  in the case of houses and their immediately surrounding lands  or lands where vineyards and fruit trees are planted  only the owner may grant the permission to a concession holder to obtain easements and surface rights 
the owner of a concession  commencing as of the date of the request of the sentencia  has to pay a yearly licence fee to the state in order to maintain its property over the same 
lack of payment may cause loss of ownership through auction by the state  although the licence fee can be paid up to the day of auction to prevent any loss 
license fees are significantly higher for exploitation mining concessions than for exploration mining concessions 
exploration budget the following table lists the properties in which the company has an interest  and the exploration budget for each property 
in approving the budgets for mineral properties  the company considers a number of factors  among them are total capital resources available to the company  joint venture participation  terms of joint venture agreement if applicable  estimated length of time before the property could be placed into production and activity in the immediate area  evaluation of preliminary geological data  anticipated costs and geologic location 
property portfolio approximate property interest held size by the company exploration property name state location acres as of budget san simon beni bolivia   silver city utah united states tintic utah united states  nsr  tintic utah united states  tuina region ii chile  total  nsr net smelter return minimum work commitment to be incurred on the property  of which the company s portion is  minimum expenditure commitment to be incurred by lessee of property due to the company s current financial situation it does not plan to conduct any significant exploration activities in activities will be limited to making required property payments to maintain the company s interest  unless a joint venture or acquisition and related financing is accomplished 
during the company assessed the capitalized costs of its mineral properties in the united states and chile 
in the opinion of management it was appropriate to write off the remaining  carrying value and reverse an accrual of  for the nine mile property  for a net charge of  as abandonment of mineral properties 
reserves minerals the proven and probable ore reserves stated in this report are geologic reserves that reflect drill based estimates of the quantities and grades of mineralized material at the company s mines which the company believes can be recovered and sold at prices in excess of the cash cost of production 
the estimates are based largely on current costs and on the projected prices and demand for the minerals based upon factors relevant to each mine 
ore reserves are based on calculations of geologic reserves provided to the company by the operator 
the company has reviewed but has not independently confirmed those calculations 
ore reserves are reported as general indicators of minimum mine life 
changes in reserves represent general indicators of the results of efforts to develop additional reserves as existing reserves are depleted through production 
grades of ore fed to process may be different from stated reserve grades because of variation in grades in areas mined from time to time  mining dilution and other factors 
recovered grades reflect variations in the characteristics and payable content of ore fed to process and the success of efforts to improve processing efficiencies 
reserves should not be interpreted as assurances of mine life or of the profitability of current or future operations 
mineral properties the company has acquired rights to various mineral properties in chile  bolivia and the states of montana and utah 
the following is a description of certain of the company s mineral properties 
tuina project ownership the tuina properties are held by phoenix  a chilean company that is owned by the company and by mahogany at december  during  the company  mahogany and yuma gold mines limited yuma entered into a number of agreements which may result in yuma acquiring mahogany s interest in the tuina properties 
yuma may also increase its ownership in the tuina property by a further 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
description of property the property is located approximately kilometers miles east of calama  in region ii in the country of chile and consists of a total of  hectares  acres 
hectares net san jose lease  other properties mineralization to date the company has calculated a mineable tonnage of million metric tonnes of copper ore contained in the san jose and san martin pits at an estimated soluble copper grade of 
the estimated stripping ratio to mine this tonnage would be to description of property agreements san jose lease the san jose lease covers an area of hectares and hosts all  or substantially all  of the current proven reserves 
there are two known areas of copper mineralization on this property called the san jose pit and the san martin pit 
to date all production has been from properties held under this lease 
during phoenix renegotiated its lease on the property the operating lease 
the operating lease has a term of years and requires a payment of of the copper produced with a minimum payment of tonnes of copper per month 
under the terms of the operating lease the obligation to make the minimum lease payments has been waived until august and in return a payment of  was made 
this  payment represented an advance payment against which future lease payments could be offset 
since august the minimum lease payments have been partially met through application of this advance payment 
the minimum lease payment is a cost which is funded by yuma pursuant to the tuina agreements 
in addition phoenix has agreed to make certain bank payments while the operating lease is in effect 
the payments required of phoenix are shown below included in the payments is a lump sum payment of approximately  this amount is payable only if phoenix is producing from the leased claims 
phoenix has also agreed to pay the property owner  per month  for the lease of certain equipment 
this agreement will allow the company to continue using the equipment after the lease on the mineral properties has expired 
this obligation to pay  per month will only commence when the operating lease is terminated or when it expires 
other properties the company has the exploration rights for an additional  hectares which are not subject to any underlying royalties or agreements 
the company is in the process of transforming these exploration rights to exploitation rights 
there are two known areas of copper mineralization on this property called inca and milagro 
prior activities since its acquisition in june  the company has expanded the camp facilities to accommodate persons and completed a detailed mine plan for the production of copper precipitate 
in december the first section of the leach pad was completed 
in and the company carried out several drill programs on the properties 
the company started mining operations in the first quarter of  producing copper precipitates 
mining stopped later in due to a dispute with the mining contractor see also item  legal proceedings 
the mining contractor was able to obtain a temporary embargo during preventing the company from achieving its planned levels of production 
the embargo was removed during the fourth quarter of and new contracts were signed with a replacement to provide services for crushing  transportation  drilling and blasting 
due to high transportation and refining and treatment charges and reductions in the price of copper  the tuina mine was experiencing negative cash flow throughout as a result of these factors  the company and mahogany suspended production of copper precipitates and put the mine on a care and maintenance program 
employment of a significant portion of the mine s workforce was terminated and the mine office in calama was closed during the last shipment of copper precipitates was made in july a reverse circulation drill program was completed in the drill program has confirmed a probable geological reserve of approximately million tonnes grading total copper soluble at the san jose pit  and a probable geological reserve of million tonnes grading total copper soluble at the san martin pit 
at both prospects sulfide mineralization was encountered below the oxide zone 
activities during  yuma commissioned um engineering um to prepare an independent bankable feasibility study on the economics of a solvent extraction electrowinning sx ew plant for the tuina project 
um delivered its report in july  the um report 
the um report concluded that  based on current reserves of approximately  tons of recoverable copper  a  ton per year plant could generate a rate of return of and achieve payout in approximately four years 
in addition  the economics of the sx ew plant could be improved by conducting a mining survey to increase proven reserves  obtaining other ore sources from surrounding properties  and or decreasing the capital investment by using second hand equipment or subcontracting parts of the operation 
planned activities activities on the tuina project have been curtailed pending completion of yuma s proposed acquisition of mahogany s interest in phoenix 
yuma is currently funding ongoing costs relating to the tuina project 
it is expected that once this transaction closes yuma will proceed with bringing the tuina copper project into production 
yuma  mahogany and company management are reviewing and assessing alternatives to further improve the economics of the tuina project 
tintic properties ownership the properties are held by the company 
description of property the property is located in the tintic mining district  utah and juab counties in the state of utah  approximately miles south of salt lake city

mineralization there are currently no gold reserves identified on the properties  however deep exploration targets are renewing the interest of several companies 
description of property agreements the company owns the tintic properties outright and has no obligations for underlying payments other than annual fees to the state of utah 
on january   the company entered into a ten year mining lease with centurion mines corporation  a non affiliated mining company  covering approximately  acres 
the lease  which specifically excludes the mine dumps and tailings  silver city mill  and existing grazing leases  requires a production royalty equal to a nsr 
during north lily renegotiated its mining lease 
the lessee is required to make advance royalty payments of  in   in   in and  thereafter payments to have been received 
the lessee is also required to fulfil a work commitment with respect to the leased premises at a minimum cost to lessee of  in   in and  during each succeeding year 
prior activities to date the lessee has made all lease payments and has fulfilled all work commitments on exploration and development in the tintic mining district since negotiating the lease agreement 
planned activities the property remains subject to a lease agreement with centurion mines corporation who are operators of the property 
centurion mines corporation have advised the company that they will be spending at least  in exploration work on the property in order to fulfil their work commitments 
silver city joint venture ownership the joint venture property is owned by north lily and by mahogany 
description of property the joint venture property is located in juab county  approximately miles south of salt lake city  utah and consists of approximately acres 
mineralization the silver city joint venture was a project designed to extract gold and silver from a previous mine s tailings using a heap leach process 
the project is now undergoing reclamation work  while considering leaching opportunities  and it is not known if the project will produce any further gold or gold equivalent 
description of property agreement pursuant to an agreement dated july   the company conveyed a undivided beneficial interest  in the joint property  to magellan resources inc magellan  a wholly owned subsidiary of mahogany 
to earn its interest magellan funded the initial  development expenditures of the joint venture 
prior activities all necessary environmental and building permits were obtained for the heap leach facility in early construction of the facility and pad was completed by june at a total capitalized cost of approximately  the joint venture was considered to be in a pre production status until october  the excess of revenues from costs from june through september were netted against capitalized costs  which reduced capitalized costs by  silver city produced gold and silver through heap leaching with cyanide 
the gold and silver is recovered through zinc precipitation 
a gold silver ore is produced at the plant and then sold to a refinery 
to date silver city has processed only the mineral tailings dumps from the nearby area 
production ounces gold equivalent silver conversion rate n a n a during the company proceeded with the closure and reclamation of the silver city heap leach facility 
the company sold non essential equipment and leased and commenced use of carbon columns to recover precious metals and base metals in the pregnant solution for income and reclamation purposes 
planned activities the remaining reclamation costs have been budgeted for  of which  is the company s share 
approximately  in state reclamation bonds have been jointly posted 
after reclamation work is completed  to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities  the reclamation bonds are to be returned 
funding of reclamation work in remains a substantial burden to the company

prior activities the companies are not aware of any prior work on the san simon property 
however  the region was worked on as early as and recently sporadic production has taken place from gold rich zones adjacent to the san simon property by a number of local miners 
it is estimated that they are removing approximately two kilograms of gold per day by using crude mining methods 
activities minimal work was performed on the san simon property in planned activities the companies are seeking a joint venture partner to help exploit the san simon property and have had discussion with several major mining companies 
if the companies are unable to conclude any arrangements the companies will commence work on the san simon property pursuant to the terms of its agreements 
montana properties the company holds various interests in a number of properties in the state of montana 
there are no obligations for underlying payments other than annual state fees to the state of montana 
the company has not conducted any exploration work in on these properties 
costs relating to these properties were mostly written off in prior years

in addition  yuma is required to make two further payments to the company  due upon commencement of tuina commercial production and one year thereafter 
these payments are to be calculated in relation to the initial capital costs of the tuina project  from a high of  where the initial capital costs are less than  with graduating payments decreasing as capital costs increase  and may be made  at yuma s election  in cash or shares of yuma  and iii all participants will be responsible for contributing their share of funding following completion and delivery of the feasibility study 
the failure of any participant to contribute its share of funding will result in a dilution of that participant s interest in accordance with a dilution formula 
once a participant s interest has been diluted to  then the ownership interest will convert to a net profits interest 
since april   yuma has assumed all indebtedness of phoenix  provided funding for the preparation of the feasibility study  the costs of securing the water rights for the tuina project and the ongoing costs of phoenix 
these costs are partially recoverable by yuma the yuma payments from the company from the proceeds to be received from the sale of the interest in phoenix  as noted in item ii above

if the water rights approval date does not occur as contemplated  yuma may elect to terminate the mahogany yuma agreement and in such circumstances  the company must reimburse yuma for the yuma payments 
the reimbursement would be payable by the company from proceeds from the subsequent sale of its interest in the tuina project  or commercial production commences on the tuina project 
if the water rights approval date occurs by may   and yuma is unable to close the yuma purchase agreement and mahogany agrees to an extension of the closing  then yuma shall lose the rights to reimbursement of the yuma payments 
the company and mahogany have an agreement in principle to conduct the activities of the tuina project on a joint venture basis

as a result of this decision  a write down of  was charged against earnings in during  properties with book values of  were abandoned  with a corresponding charge to earnings 
in addition  in the company recognized a  provision for diminution in value of the nine mile property 
no provision was recognized in as a result of steadily declining cash balances and general reduction in interest rates for funds on deposit  the company has earned substantially lower amounts of interest since unless the company sells for cash one of its resource properties  the company is not expected to earn any significant amounts of interest in future years

the company believes it holds properties with development potential 
in order for the company to develop its properties or property interests  the company requires funds to pay company overheads  pay property commitment costs and fund property development work 
resource property development is both costly and time consuming 
development of a property to a position of generating cash flow from underlying mineral sales is normally measured in years  and there is no guarantee of the property s ultimate financial success 
the company requires funds for its future operations 
funding is traditionally provided to corporations by way of funds from ongoing company operations  funds from the issuance of company debt instruments  funds from company equity issues and funds from the sale of company assets 
with the suspension of operations at the tuina mine  and continuing reclamation work at silver city  the company does not have operations from which funds from ongoing company operations can be accumulated 
with the company s present asset base  the company is not able to generate funds from operations within the next two years at a minimum  except to the extent that a tuina may be brought into successful production in conjunction with the restructuring of the tuina project  and b a new project and financing may be acquired with company stock

sale proceeds were used to reduce company liabilities and help fund company property cost commitments 
during  the company sold a further  common shares of baja and other marketable securities for net proceeds of  the proceeds were used to reduce company liabilities 
during  pursuant to the issuance of promissory notes  the company borrowed a total of   cdn 
from baja  secured by  common shares of baja 
the notes bear interest at per annum 
these funds were used to meet a portion of the tuina operating costs 
during  the company was advanced  cdn 
 from a private corporation related to a director of the company 
the company subsequently issued a promissory note and borrowed  cdn 
 from a third party  secured by  common shares of baja

the cash portion will be paid only upon the company completing a financing and the deferred compensation will be paid only in the event that the company generates operating cash flow or completes a major financing 
the deferred compensation may be either settled with cash or the issuance of the company s common stock  at a predetermined price per share  at the officer s election 
the company has reviewed its asset base and has identified those assets that are considered to be non essential for the company s future growth  including small company properties in montana with little  if any  resource potential 
in order for the company to meet its current operating obligations and property commitments  the company is required to sell all non essential company assets 
company management is  therefore  reviewing all other resource properties  and may be required to sell certain of them that do not meet its investment criteria

impact of sfas no 
effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires a change from the deferred method to the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under the liability method  deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax laws and rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities 
under this new standard  the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
under the deferred method  deferred taxes were recognized using the tax rate applicable to the year of the calculation and were not adjusted for subsequent changes in tax rates 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have any impact on the consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation north lily will be affected by inflation because market value of its potential products gold and silver tends to fluctuate with inflation 
other major costs should not increase at a rate in excess of inflation
