competition community banking  ann arbor the bank s attraction and retention of deposits depends on its ability to provide investment opportunities that satisfy the requirements of investors with respect to rate of return  liquidity  risk and other factors 
the bank competes for these deposits by offering competitive rates  personal service  a variety of savings programs  tax deferred retirement programs and foreign currency deposits 
the bank competes for loan originations primarily through the interest rates and loan fees it charges  the quality of services it provides to its loan customers  and the range of services it offers 
the bank s competition in originating loans comes principally from other commercial banks  credit unions  insurance companies and savings and loans 
the following table shows market share of deposits for washtenaw county by financial institution for june and june from the fdic s annual branch deposit survey washtenaw county financial institution deposits great lakes bancorp first of america bank key bank nbd first chicago bank comerica bank republic bank standard federal fsb citizens bank chelsea state bank university of michigan cu michigan natl bank huron river area cu ann arbor commerce bank hospital health services cu credit unions  banks  s l total deposits bn total deposits in the county grew from june to june in attracting deposits  the bank s primary competitors are other commercial banks  credit unions and savings and loans operating outside of the upper peninsula of michigan 
the bank s main office is adjacent to the university of michigan hospital complex 
the complex employs a total of  persons 
the nearest competitors to the bank s main office are first of america bank and hospital health services credit union 
the bank s main office was formerly the headquarters of the latter credit union  which moved its office to a new office building three miles from the complex 
the ann arbor banking market is dominated by banks which are owned by out of area holding companies 
in the city of ann arbor  the university of michigan credit union is the largest locally owned financial institution 
the only locally owned community financial institutions  excluding university bank  are the hospital health services credit union and bank of ann arbor  a new start up bank 
the bank recruited a management team of local bankers  mostly from great lakes bancorp  to operate university bank 
great lakes was acquired in early by tfc bank of minneapolis  minnesota 
prior to the acquisition  great lakes was the largest locally owned financial institution in the ann arbor area 
mortgage banking origination 
the bank s ann arbor community bank  the bank s mortgage banking division and varsity mortgage purchase or originate internally residential home loans which generally qualify for sale to secondary market investors under the underwriting criteria of the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc or the federal national mortgage association fnma from correspondents in michigan and in the eastern united states 
loans purchased or originated internally are either sold directly to fhlmc or fnma  or are pooled into mortgage backed securities and the securities are sold to investors in the secondary market 
the bank s ann arbor community bank  the bank s mortgage banking division and varsity mortgage encounter competition for the origination of residential real estate loans primarily from savings institutions  commercial banks  insurance companies and other mortgage banking firms 
many of these firms have a well established customer and or borrower client base 
some competitors  primarily savings institutions  insurance companies and commercial banks  have the ability to create unique loan products from time to time because they are able to close the loans for their own portfolio rather than sell into the secondary market 
most loans sold into the secondary market  however  go to the same sources  those being federal national mortgage association fnma  federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc and government national mortgage association gnma guaranteed securities 
most lenders have access to these secondary market sources  therefore  competition often becomes more a matter of service and pricing than that of product 
as a mortgage loan originator and a purchaser of mortgage loans through correspondents  the bank and its affiliates must be able to compete with respect to the types of loan products offered by competitors to borrowers and correspondents  including the price of the loan in terms of origination fees or fee premium or discount  loan processing costs  interest rates  and the service provided by the bank s staff 
during lower interest rate environments  competition for loans is less intense due to the large number of loans available for origination 
as interest rates rise and the number of loans available for origination diminishes  competition becomes quite intense and companies with larger investor bases  flexibility with respect to type of product offered and greater experience in dealing in these types of markets tend to be the most successful 
although the bank generally does not originate residential loans to be held in portfolio  management believes that the product offerings which fhlmc and fnma have is sufficient for its competitive needs 
although the bank is currently licensed as a hud title and title seller servicer  it has no plans at this time to expand its utilization of hud or gnma programs 
the bank and varsity funding also are correspondents for several impaired credit conduits and sells this type of residential mortgage on a non recourse  servicing released basis 
mortgage servicing 
the bank currently retains all fhlmc and fnma mortgage servicing rights which it originates or purchases 
servicing competition is somewhat less intense than the loan origination aspect of mortgage banking 
due to net worth and management requirements  many mortgage origination companies do not have the capacity to service loans 
servicing is dependent on the capability of the origination and loan purchase correspondent network for its volume 
falling interest rates also present competitive challenges for the mortgage servicing operation in that mortgagors are more likely to refinance existing mortgages 
the quality of service and the ability of the origination operation to compete on price and service is important in retaining such customers by refinancing them internally  rather than losing the refinancing transaction to a competitor 
increased refinancing activity as a result of falling interest rates should decrease profitability of mortgage servicing by increasing amortization charges on purchased mortgage servicing rights 
midwest loan services  inc is located in houghton  michigan in the western upper peninsula of michigan 
personnel and occupancy costs are the largest costs in a mortgage servicing operation  and the prevailing wages and occupancy costs in the upper peninsula of michigan are substantially below the national average 
as a result  management believes that midwest loan services mortgage servicing operation could potentially offer its mortgage banking operations a competitive advantage in the future if the mortgage servicing operation were to continue to grow 
eastern upper peninsula banking as noted above  pursuant to the branch sale  on december  the bank s existing two branches in sault ste 
marie  and its main office in newberry  michigan were sold 
following the sale  the bank established a new branch office in its mortgage operation offices 
at year end  this office had approximately million in deposits 
pursuant to the terms of the branch sale  the bank is restricted from soliciting deposits from non affiliates in the upper peninsula of michigan 
accordingly  the bank has focused its efforts on soliciting deposits from its mortgage customers nationwide  brokered deposits and local depositors from sault ste 
marie  ontario  which is the canadian sister city of sault ste 
marie  michigan 
with respect to attracting deposits and lending in sault  ontario  canada  the bank s primary competitors include royal bank of canada  canadian imperial bank of commerce  bank of nova scotia  bank of montreal  toronto dominion bank  hong kong shanghai bank  algoma steel credit union and northern credit union  most of which have substantially larger financial resources than the bank 
the sault  canada deposit market is estimated by management to approximate c  of which the bank is believed to have approximately a market share 
the bank also manages the foreign exchange business of the bank which purchased its two branches in sault ste 
marie  and its main office in newberry  michigan under a contract which calls for payment monthly at an annual rate of  michigan bidco and northern michigan foundation michigan bidco seeks to invest in businesses located in michigan 
the bidco s objective is to seek profit while fostering job growth and economic development in its market area 
michigan bidco makes its investments directly  or through investment entities formed with other participants  to make investments  in the form of loans or direct equity investments  or a combination thereof 
as such  it competes with other specialized lenders and wealthy investors who make risk oriented investments in businesses located in michigan 
the bidco assumes more credit risk in a typical investment than commercial banks generally are willing to assume when they make loans 
the bidco does not make an investment in a company unless it can be shown that the funds are not available from a traditional bank lender  therefore  the bidco does not compete with banks 
there is only one other bidco in northern michigan  the bidco is one of eleven bidcos in michigan 
the bidco s non profit relending affiliate  northern michigan foundation received a loan of  at interest for years from the us recds under the recds sponsored intermediate relending program

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the purpose of the following discussion and analysis is to assist the reader in understanding and evaluating the changes in financial position and results of operations over the past three years 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  the related notes thereto  and statistical information presented elsewhere in this report 
general the discussion below must be considered in light of the fundamental changes resulting from the opening in february of a new main office of the bank in ann arbor  and the closing on december  of the sale by the bank of assets pertaining to its newberry  michigan headquarters office and its two branches in sault ste 
marie  michigan  which included the sale of deposits and loan portfolios the branch sale 
accordingly  historical results of operations of the commercial banking division are not indicative of future operations 
in addition  results of operations for and  and attributes of the bank s assets and liabilities at year end and  were significantly affected by the branch sale 
the operations of the company and the banking industry in general are significantly influenced by general economic conditions  related monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government  and policies of financial institution regulatory authorities  including the federal reserve board frb  the michigan state financial institutions bureau fib  and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
deposit flows and cost of funds are influenced by interest rates in competing investments and general market rates of interest 
lending activities are affected by the demand for loan borrowing  which in turn is affected by the interest rates at which such financing may be offered and other factors affecting the economy and the availability of funds 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources total assets of the company at december  amounted to million compared to million at december  loans receivable increased by million from million to million 
cash and cash equivalents including federal funds sold on an overnight basis and time deposits at the end of increased by million from the prior year  while securities decreased by million 
loans held for sale in the bank s mortgage banking division increased to million from million 
university bank  as an fdic insured bank  is subject to certain regulations which require the maintenance of minimum liquidity levels of cash and eligible investments 
the bank has historically exceeded this minimum as a result of its investments in federal funds sold  us treasury and agency securities and cash 
in addition the bank holding company had million in cash and equity securities at the end of to meet cash needs  primarily operating expenses and interest and principal reductions on the holding company s bank loan 
the balance of the loan was  at year end and the note matures november   but may be renewed for an additional one year subject to the company s compliance with the loan terms 
management believes that the cash and securities on hand together with available unrestricted retained earnings that university bank is able to pay the company in the form of dividends  with permission of the company s secured debt lender  is currently sufficient to cover any required principal reductions during on the holding company s loan 
total stockholders equity of the company at december  was approximately million or of total assets compared to million or of total assets the year earlier 
the bank s regulatory capital at year end was million or of the bank s total regulatory assets and the risk adjusted capital ratio of exceeded the minimum regulatory risk based capital requirement of of the risk adjusted assets for the bank

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial condition and operating results in terms of historical dollars with the exception of the bidco  which uses the investment company method of accounting  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on operations is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services  since such prices are affected by inflation 
in the current interest rate environment  where there are rapid increases and decreases of interest rates  liquidity and the maturity structure of the bank s assets and liabilities are crucial determinants of the bank s profitability 
asset liability management all financial institutions are significantly affected by fluctuations in interest rates commonly referred to as interest rate risk 
the principal exposure of a financial institution s earnings to interest rate risk is the difference in time between interest rate adjustments or maturities on interest earning assets compared to the time between interest rate adjustments or maturities on interest bearing liabilities 
such difference is commonly referred to as a financial institution s gap position 
in periods when interest rates are increasing  a positive gap position will result in generally higher earnings as short term assets are repricing upward faster than longer term liabilities 
however during a declining rate environment  the opposite effect on earnings is true  with earnings being reduced due to short term assets repricing downward faster than longer term liabilities

summary of results of operations the net loss from operations of the company was  in there was net income of  in and  in earnings loss per share for  and were  and  respectively 
the change from to was principally due to the sale in december of the bank s former main office in newberry and two branch offices in sault ste 
marie  including deposits and associated loan portfolios for a premium above book value of  before certain expenses related to the sale the branch sale 
was primarily a transition year in which plans were laid to establish a new main office of the bank in ann arbor and to expand the bank s mortgage banking activities 
expenses associated with these initiatives and other unusual expenses decreased income in also  the bank sold most of its core loan portfolio in december  and a decrease in average earning assets together with the resulting decrease in net interest income as a percent of earning assets depressed the income of the bank in versus the increase in net income in was principally the result of the bank s sale of the former main office and two branch banks and an income contribution from michigan bidco  which offset a decline in profitability of the branch banks prior to the sale 
net interest income net interest income represents the dollar amount by which interest income generated by interest earning assets exceeds the cost of funds 
interest earning assets consist primarily of loans and investment securities  and the principal cost of funds is the interest paid on deposit accounts and other borrowings 
net interest income is affected by i the difference between the average rate of interest earned on the bank s interest earning assets and the average rate paid on its interest bearing liabilities interest rate spread and ii the relative amounts of its average interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in order to maintain and increase earnings during periods of fluctuating interest rates  it is imperative that interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities be managed effectively 
trends in net interest income provide a measure of the effectiveness by which a financial institution manages its interest rate sensitivity 
in each period  net interest income on a consolidated basis was reduced by interest expense associated with the holding company s bank loan indebtedness 
such interest expense was million in  million in and million in the following table presents  for the periods and dates indicated  the average balances all averages are calculated using monthly averages of  the interest earned or paid on  and the weighted average yield earned or rate paid on  the bank s interest earning assets and liabilities net interest income years ended december  interest average interest average interest average average income yield average income yield average income yield balance expense rate balance expense rate balance expense rate interest earning assets loans commercial       real estate construction       real estate mortgage       installment consumer       total loans       investment securities       federal funds       total interest bearing assets       interest bearing liabilities deposit accounts now s now       savings       canadian dollar savings       time       borrowed funds       money markets       total       holding company debt       total interest bearing liabilities       net earning assets  net interest income  and interest rate spread       net yield on interest earning assets actual yields  not adjusted to take into account tax equivalent yields resulting from tax free municipal income and includes ban the table above does not specify the average level of non interest bearing demand deposits  which were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  as computed using month end balances for such years 
net interest income of the bank decreased to million in from million in  mainly as a result of a decrease in the amount of earning assets and liabilities and a reduction of the spread achieved on the smaller base 
during the year ended december   the bank s average interest earning asset base fell by million or over  while average interest bearing liabilities decreased by million or 
due to repricing of variable rate securities and increases in the portfolio loan lending rate  the average yield on interest earning assets increased from to in due to a rise in short term interest rates  the average cost of funds increased from in to in as a result of the branch sale  which increased funding costs and resulted in a decrease in higher yielding loans  the net interest margin decreased to in from in net interest income of the bank decreased to million in from million in  mainly as a result of a decrease in the spread between the rate on earning assets and liabilities 
during the year ended december   the bank s average interest earning asset base rose by million or over  while average interest bearing liabilities increased by million or 
due to a repositioning of earning assets into variable rate securities  the average yield on interest earning assets decreased from to in due to a persistent rise in interest rates  the average cost of funds increased from in to in as a result of an expansion in variable rate investments and a decrease in higher yielding loans  the net interest margin decreased to in from in moreover  management of the bank opted to raise rates paid on deposits faster than otherwise would have been required in an attempt to stem the loss of deposits following the announcement of the branch sale in early may the branch sale agreement required the bank to deliver at the closing of the branch sale a minimum amount of deposits  and management opted to decrease margins by raising deposit rates rather than risk a drop in deposits under the minimum amount required pursuant to the branch sale agreement 
at december   the net spread between the bank s interest earning assets and interest earning liabilities was up from the average net spread for the year of  principally as a result of a decrease in the cost of funds as result of a decline in short term interest rates  further helped by a small rise in the yield on earning assets as a result of a modest rise in the yield on the loan portfolio 
fee income from the bank s mortgage banking originations and income from the bank s portfolio of mortgage servicing rights are not included in these calculations 
as a result of the branch sale  the relative importance of these types of non interest income to the bank s profitability increased in the following table presents information regarding fluctuations in interest income and interest expense of the bank for the periods indicated

each year s provision reflects management s analysis of the amount necessary to maintain the allowance for possible loan losses at a level adequate to absorb anticipated losses 
in its evaluation  management considers such factors as historical loan loss experience  specifically identified problem loans  composition and growth of the loan portfolio  current and projected economic conditions  and other pertinent factors 
a loan is charged off by management as a loss when deemed uncollectible  although collection efforts continue and future recoveries may occur 
non performing loans amounted to  and  at december  and  respectively 
non performing loans are defined as loans which have been placed on non accrual status and loans over days past due as to principal or interest and still in an accrual status 
where serious doubt exists as to the collectibility of a loan  the accrual of interest is discontinued 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding impaired loans 
the provision for loan losses in was  a decrease of  from the level  which in turn was an increase of  from the level of  loans charged off net of recoveries were   and  in   and  respectively 
the allowance for possible loan losses totaled   and  at the end of   and  respectively 
in addition  the bank is a participant in the capital access program of the michigan strategic fund 
the michigan strategic fund the msf is a state of michigan sponsored program 
under the terms of the program  the bank can assign  at the bank s sole discretion  business loans to be covered by msf guarantees 
the borrower pays points at the loan closing which are matched by the msf 
the funds which are paid to the bank by the msf are held at the bank in a segregated account to offset such loan losses 
if there are no losses and the loans are all liquidated  the msf would retain ownership of the funds in the segregated account 
management takes the msf fund into account in determining the collateral backing of its msf guaranteed loans 
a michigan strategic fund balance of   and  was available at year end   and  respectively  to offset loan losses on a group of commercial loans amounting to   and  at year end   and  respectively 
a total of  of the bank s msf fund balance was transferred in connection with the branch sale 
included in past due loans days and still accruing at december  and was  and  respectively  in fha title insured loans 
on december   the bank sold approximately  in loans associated with three bank offices 
the general loan loss reserve associated with such loans of  was transferred to the acquiror along with the loan balances

includes both msf and general loan loss reserve during  management decreased the monthly rate of reserve provision for loan losses to  or  per year  and added a  extra provision at year end to account for the adoption of a new accounting principle under which the bank has allocated a portion of the allowance for loan losses to the balance of impaired loans 
the historic and current levels of the reserve have been set at a level which management believes will be sufficient to maintain the overall allowance  including the michigan strategic fund loan loss reserve  at an appropriate amount 
at year end  such ratio was  or  the ratio reflects management s realization that the loan portfolio the bank retained after the branch sale is  in some instances  of lower credit quality than the much larger loan portfolio which was sold 
the buyer s decision to put back loans was not based solely on credit quality  but on geography  familiarity with the borrower  and lack of time to complete due diligence on smaller balance loans  among other reasons 
loans put back by the buyer to the bank subsequent to the branch sale were transferred at the current payoff figure less the associated general or specific loan loss reserve which the bank had assigned to the loans immediately prior to the branch sale 
the future performance of the loans is geographically concentrated and dependent upon the performance of a relatively limited geographical area 
the loan loss reserve goal is believed to be at the high end of the bank s peer group  and is reflective of management s desire to have a loan loss reserve in excess of its peer group average as a result of the forgoing 
based upon current economic conditions in the eastern upper peninsula market area  management currently anticipates that net loan losses in will not exceed  the redevelopment of the previously closed state of michigan newberry regional mental health hospital into a medium security prison  has had a positive impact on the bank s loan portfolio 
the prison added base economic jobs to the newberry area economy  on a base of  jobs 
local area real estate prices rose during and with increased economic activity in the area  the prison may prove beneficial to the bank in mitigating future loan losses from its loan portfolio 
moreover  the improving real estate market allowed to bank to sell all of its repossessed real estate properties in the newberry area in and early  and has provided an incentive for borrowers to cure defaults rather than allowing foreclosure of properties 
while the bank has just begun lending in the ann arbor area  and the local economy is growing  management has no historical basis upon which to predict credit losses from this new lending activity 
management believes that the current reserve level is adequate to absorb future losses inherent in the loan portfolio  although the ultimate adequacy of the reserve is dependent upon future economic factors beyond the company s control 
a downturn in the general nationwide economy will tend to aggravate  for example  the problems of local loan customers currently facing some difficulties 
a general nationwide business expansion could conversely tend to diminish the severity of any such difficulties
