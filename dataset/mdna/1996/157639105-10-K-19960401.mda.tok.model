seasonality the company s wine sales from quarter to quarter are highly variable because the exact dates when wines are released for sale vary from year to year 
sales are typically highest during the fourth quarter  because of heavy holiday sales and because most wines are released around the end of the third and beginning of the fourth quarters 
liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital increased by  in the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the sale in october  of  restricted shares of its common stock and a like number of warrants for consideration  net of expenses  of million 
this new equity and the conversion of million in convertible debentures into equity in reduced the company s total debt by approximately million 
wine sales have historically provided sufficient revenues from operations to sustain the company s on going operational financial requirements except during grape harvesting  when the company has relied on short term borrowings to finance grape purchases and the increased seasonal payroll
