on october   congress passed the cable act  which significantly expands the scope of regulation of certain subscriber rates and a number of other matters in the cable industry  such as mandatory carriage of local broadcast stations and retransmission consent  and which will increase the administrative costs of complying with such regulations 
the fcc has adopted rate regulations that establish  on a system by system basis  maximum allowable rates for i basic and cable programming services other than programming offered on a per channel or per program basis  based upon a benchmark methodology  and ii associated equipment and installation services based upon cost plus a reasonable profit 
under the fcc rules  franchising authorities are authorized to regulate rates for basic services and associated equipment and installation services  and the fcc will regulate rates for regulated cable programming services in response to complaints filed with the agency 
the act ends fcc regulation of cable programming service tier rates on march  the original rate regulations became effective on september  amendments to the rate regulations became effective may  further amendments were adopted on november  the original rate regulations required a reduction of existing rates charged for basic services and regulated cable programming services to the greater of i the applicable benchmark level or ii the rates in force as of september   reduced by  adjusted forward for inflation 
the amended regulations generally require a reduction of up to percent from the rates for regulated services in force as of september   adjusted forward for inflation and certain other factors 
rate reductions are not required to the extent that a cable operator at its option elects to use an alternative cost of service methodology and shows that rates for basic and cable programming services are reasonable 
refunds with interest will be required to be paid by cable operators who are required to reduce regulated rates 
the fcc has reserved the right to reduce or increase the benchmarks it has established 
the rate regulations will also limit future increases in regulated rates to an inflation indexed amount plus increases in certain costs such as taxes  franchise fees  costs associated with specific franchise requirements and increased programming costs 
cost based adjustments to these capped rates can also be made in the event a cable operator adds or deletes channels or completes a significant system rebuild or upgrade 
on november   the fcc adopted an alternative method for adjusting the rates charged for a cable programming services tier when new services are added 
this will allow cable operators to increase rates by as much as over a two year period to reflect the addition of up to six new channels of service on cable programming service tiers 
in addition  a new programming tier can be created  the rate for which would not be regulated as long as certain conditions are met  such as not moving services from existing tiers to the new one 
because of the limitation on rate increases for regulated services  future revenue growth from cable services will rely to a much greater extent than has been true in the past on increased revenues from unregulated services and new subscribers than from increases in previously unregulated rates 
the fcc has adopted regulations implementing all of the requirements of the cable act 
the fcc is also likely to continue to modify  clarify or refine the rate regulations 
in addition  litigation has been instituted challenging various portions of the cable act and the rulemaking proceedings including the rate regulations 
the act deregulates the rates for cable programming services on march  adelphia cannot predict the effect if the act on future rulemaking proceedings or changes to the rate regulations 
effective september   as a result of the cable act  adelphia repackaged certain existing cable services by adjusting rates for basic service and introducing a new method of offering certain cable services 
adelphia adjusted the basic service rates and related equipment and installation rates in all of its systems in order for such rates to be in compliance with the applicable benchmark or equipment and installation cost levels 
adelphia also implemented a program in all of its systems called cableselect under which most of adelphia s satellite delivered programming services are now offered individually on a per channel basis  or as a group at a price of approximately to below the sum of the per channel prices of all such services 
for subscribers who elect to customize their channel lineup  adelphia will provide  for a monthly rental fee  an electronic device located on the cable line outside the home  enabling a subscriber s television to receive only those channels selected by the subscriber 
these basic service rate adjustments and the cableselect program have also been implemented in all systems managed by adelphia 
adelphia believes cableselect provides increased programming choices to its subscribers while providing flexibility to adelphia to respond to future changes in areas such as customer demand and programming 
a letter of inquiry  one of at least sent by the fcc to numerous cable operators  was received by an olympus system regarding the implementation of this new method of offering services 
olympus responded in writing to the fcc s inquiry 
on november   the fcc released amended rules under which  on a prospective basis  any a la carte package will be treated as a regulated tier  except for packages involving premium services 
also  on november   the cable services bureau of the fcc issued a decision holding that the cableselect program was an evasion of the rate regulations and ordered this package to be treated as a regulated tier 
this decision  and all other letters of inquiry decisions  were principally decided on the number of programming services moved from regulated tiers to a la carte packages 
adelphia has appealed this decision to the full commission which affirmed the cable service bureau s decision 
adelphia has sought reconsideration of the decision 
certain other cable television companies that utilized a la carte packages have recently reached settlement resolution with the fcc on this issue 
adelphia believes that in view of this experience with other operators  resolution of these differences is possible  consistent with the terms and conditions of those earlier resolutions 
accordingly  results of operations for the fiscal year ended march  include a  charge representing management s estimate of the total costs associated with the resolution of this matter 
such costs include  i an estimate of credits to be extended to customers in future periods of up to  ii legal and other costs incurred during the fiscal year ended march   and iii an estimate of legal and other costs to be incurred associated with the ultimate resolution of this matter 
at march    of the charge to earnings remained as an estimate of future costs to be incurred to resolve this matter 
while adelphia cannot predict the ultimate outcome or effect of this matter  management of adelphia does not expect the ultimate outcome of this matter to have a material adverse effect on adelphia s financial position and results of operations 
also  no assurance can be given as to what other future actions congress  the fcc or other regulatory authorities may take or the effects thereof on the company 
the company is currently unable to predict the effect that the amended regulations  future fcc treatment of a la carte packages or other future fcc rulemaking proceedings will have on its business and results of operations in future periods 
cable television companies operate under franchises granted by local authorities which are subject to renewal and renegotiation from time to time 
because such franchises are generally non exclusive  there is a potential for competition with the systems from other operators of cable television systems  including public systems operated by municipal franchising authorities themselves  and from other distribution systems capable of delivering television programming to homes 
the cable act and the act contain provisions which encourage competition from such other sources 
the company cannot predict the extent to which competition will materialize from other cable television operators  local telephone companies  other distribution systems for delivering television programming to the home  or other potential competitors  or  if such competition materializes  the extent of its effect on the company 
fcc rules heretofore permitted local telephone companies to offer video dialtone service for video programmers  including channel capacity for the carriage of video programming and certain non common carrier activities such as video processing  billing and collection and joint marketing agreements 
on december   new jersey bell telephone company filed an application with the fcc to operate a video dialtone service in portions of dover county  new jersey  in which the company serves approximately  subscribers 
the fcc approved the application on july  the company has appealed this decision to the us court of appeals for the district of columbia 
this case is presently pending 
the act repealed the prohibition on local exchange telephone exchange companies lecs from providing video programming directly to customers within their local exchange areas other than in rural areas or by specific waiver of fcc rules 
the act also authorized lecs to operate open video systems ovs without obtaining a local cable franchise  although lecs operating such a system can be required to make payments to local governmental bodies in lieu of cable franchise fees 
where demand exceeds capacity  up to two thirds of the channels on an ovs must be available to programmers unaffiliated with the lec 
the statute states that the ovs scheme supplants the fcc s video dialtone rules  but existing authorizations are grandfathered 
once the fcc has promulgated rules to implement the ovs concept  however  new jersey bell will presumably have the option of converting its video dialtone authorization to an ovs authorization 
direct broadcast satellite dbs service became available to consumers during a single dbs satellite can provide more than channels of programming 
dbs service can be received virtually anywhere in the united states through the installation of a small outdoor antenna 
dbs service is being heavily marketed on a nation wide basis 
the extent to which dbs will be competitive with cable systems will depend on the continued availability of reception equipment and programming at reasonable prices to the consumer 
the company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the video dialtone proceeding 
however  the company believes that the provision of video programming by telephone companies in competition with the company s existing operations could have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
at this time  the impact of any such effect is not known or estimable
