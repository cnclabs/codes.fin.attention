seasonality seasonality generally does not affect the company s waste treatment technology operations  however  it does have an effect on the company s technical support services business 
a large component of the company s staff augmentation business is devoted to nuclear power plant outage support 
the seasonal nature of this work is caused by utilities desire to schedule their nuclear unit refueling and maintenance outages during spring and fall when  due to moderate temperatures  electrical load demand is lowest 
in addition  a significant portion of the company s computer and communications consulting services client base is in the federal  state and local government sectors 
funding appropriations for many of these clients projects are coordinated with the government s fiscal years which causes some seasonal impact on this business 
in contrast to the outage support business  demand for computer and communications consulting services typically peaks in winter and summer months
