contracts available for renewal in a particular period include contracts with expiration dates within the period  as well as contracts renewed during that period which have expiration dates in a later period 
software sales increased in fiscal year compared with fiscal year due primarily to increased licenses of adage enterprise resource planning erp software 
adage is developed by the manufacturing and distribution business of sct 
additionally  licenses of banner to the utilities and local government markets increased in fiscal year compared with the prior year 
the increase in software sales in fiscal year is attributable to increases in licenses of banner to the global higher education and utilities markets 
the and increases in maintenance and enhancements revenues in fiscal years and are the result of continued high annual renewal rates and the growing installed base of clients  primarily in the higher education market

the increase in software services revenue in fiscal year compared with the prior period is due primarily to growth of systems integration services provided to the international utilities market 
gross profit gross profit decreased as a percentage of total revenue excluding interest and other revenue from to for fiscal year the decreased gross profit in onsite services is the result of lower margins on new contract signings compared with older contracts 
the decreases in software services gross profit were primarily the result of the increased cost of services required to satisfy certain contract obligations relating to the banner customer information system cis product in the utility business  as well as increased expenditures associated with the manufacturing and distribution business acquired in june the company is increasing its focus on software services  including software installation and systems integration services in each of its markets  which have historically resulted in a decreased profit margin when compared to a revenue mix with a higher percentage of license fees 
the decrease in total gross profit as a percentage of total revenue excluding interest and other revenue from in fiscal year to in fiscal year resulted from a change in revenue mix 
the percentage of software services revenues to the international utilities market increased relative to license fees during the period 
the decrease in interest and other revenue in fiscal year is primarily attributable to a decreased short term investment portfolio compared with the prior year 
contract loss provision in the quarter ended march   the company recorded a contract loss provision of million to reflect the cost of satisfying certain obligations relating to the banner customer information system product for us utilities 
the aforementioned charge was principally for one us client to cover the estimated cost of remaining obligations in excess of unrecognized revenue

management believes that this reserve is adequate to cover remaining obligations 
adage acquisition in june  the company acquired adage systems international  inc adage for consideration of one million shares of common stock valued at approximately million 
adage offered a newly developed enterprise resource planning system to multinational users in the manufacturing and distribution industries 
in conjunction with the acquisition  the company incurred a charge of million for in process research and development 
included in this amount were the fair values of adage products under development that had not reached technological feasibility at the time of the acquisition 
these products were incorporated into the june adage erp software release which had been under development since september adage is a graphical erp solution with a special emphasis on the process manufacturing and distribution industries 
the software employs a business process based approach that focuses on configuring objects and business rules as process flows to support key business processes across the supply chain 
income taxes the provision for income taxes for the year ended september  reflects valuation allowances provided with respect to tax loss carryforwards in various state and international jurisdictions and the relative impact of non deductible expenses  offset by the impact of the reinstatement of the research and development tax credit which had expired june  the fiscal year provision for income taxes does not reflect the customary relationship between income and tax expense principally due to the write off of purchased research and development  which is not deductible for tax purposes 
the fiscal year effective tax rate would have been without the write off of purchased research and development 
the rate was further affected by the expiration of the research and development tax credit as of june  the purchased research and development write off had an impact on both the state effective tax rate and the relationship between income and the effect of the research and development tax credit 
foreign operations the functional currency is the local currency of the company s operating foreign subsidiary 
foreign operations represented approximately of the company s consolidated revenue 
the net assets of the international subsidiary are approximately million at september  the company does not believe its foreign currency exposure is significant and analyzes the desirability of hedging the exposure on an ongoing basis 
seasonality certain factors have resulted in quarterly fluctuations in operating results  including variability of software license fee revenues  seasonal patterns of capital spending by clients  the timing and receipt of orders  competition  pricing  new product introductions by the company or its competitors  levels of market acceptance for new products  and general economic and political conditions 
while the company has historically generated a greater portion of license fees in total revenue in the last two fiscal quarters  the non seasonal factors cited above may have a greater effect than seasonality on the company s results of operations 
liquidity  capital resources  and financial position the company s cash and short term investments balance was million and million at september  and  respectively 
the short term investment portfolio is classified as available for sale 
the available cash and short term investments balances are derived from continuing operations 
cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal year compared with million for fiscal year the increase in cash provided by operations reflects the increase in net income for fiscal year compared with the prior year period 
in addition  september  accounts receivable balances increased by a smaller percentage than prior year to year increases 
this reflects the company s increased attention to cash collections and improved payment terms 
the increase in accounts receivable at september  is due to increases in revenues and the timing of billings on the company s services contracts and software licenses 
the company provides onsite services and software related services  including systems implementation and integration services 
contract fees from onsite services are typically based on multiyear contracts ranging from five to years and provide a recurring revenue stream throughout the term of the contract 
software services contracts generally have shorter terms than onsite services contracts  and billings are often milestone based 
during the beginning of a typical onsite services contract  services are performed and expenses are incurred by the company at a greater rate than in the later part of the contract 
billings usually remain constant during the term of the contract and  in some cases  when a contract term is extended  the billing period is also extended over the new life of the contract 
revenue is usually recognized as work is performed 
the resulting excess of revenues over billings is reflected on the company s consolidated balance sheet as unbilled accounts receivable 
as an onsite services contract proceeds  services are performed and expenses are incurred at a lesser rate  resulting in billings exceeding revenue recognized  which causes a decrease in the unbilled accounts receivable  as will the achievement of a milestone in a software services contract 
the company s working capital at september  was million and was million at september  cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal year compared with million for fiscal year the million reduction in the use of cash during fiscal year was primarily the result of decreases in capital expenditures on new business infrastructure and new facility improvements and a reduction of short term investments in fiscal year the primary use of cash during the period was the capitalization of newly developed software  the majority of which related to adage erp software 
in fiscal year  the company expects the software capitalization rate to return to a rate more consistent with prior year rates 
the company s financing activities during fiscal year consisted primarily of the borrowing and repayment of the company s senior revolving credit facility 
the company has outstanding million of convertible subordinated debentures bearing interest at and maturing on september  the debentures are convertible into common stock of the company any time prior to redemption or maturity at a conversion price of per share 
the debentures are redeemable at any time after september  at prices decreasing from of the principal amount at september   to par on september  the company has a million senior revolving credit facility  available for general corporate purposes  which expires in june with optional annual extensions 
at september   there were no borrowings outstanding 
as long as borrowings are outstanding and as a condition precedent to new borrowings  the company must comply with certain covenants  and the company is prohibited from paying any dividends other than stock dividends 
see note f to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that its cash and cash equivalents  cash provided by operations  and borrowing arrangements should satisfy its needs for the foreseeable future 
primary common shares and equivalents used in the income per share calculation increased as a result of employee stock option exercises during the years ending september  and and  for  by shares issued for the adage acquisition 
equivalent shares used in the fully diluted income per share calculation increased for primarily as a result of the inclusion of the increased number of shares that would be outstanding assuming the conversion of the convertible subordinated debentures 
fully diluted equivalent shares decreased for the year ending september  versus as a result of the anti dilutive effect of the aforementioned debentures for contingencies a purported class action complaint was filed against the company and certain of its officers and directors on october  the plaintiff filed an amended complaint on november  the amended complaint alleges violations of certain disclosure and related provisions of the federal securities laws 
the amended complaint seeks damages in unspecified amounts as well as equitable relief 
in april the company s motion to dismiss the amended complaint was granted in part and denied in part 
management believes the claims remaining in the amended complaint are without merit and intends to contest the remaining allegations vigorously 
while management  based on its investigation to date  believes that resolution of this action will not have a materially adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  the ultimate outcome of this matter cannot presently be determined

 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of fas 
the statement requires impairment losses to be recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amount 
fas also addresses the accounting for long lived assets that are expected to be sold or discarded 
the company will adopt fas in fiscal year and  based on current circumstances  does not believe the effect of adoption will be material 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no

the company anticipates continuing to account for stock based compensation under the provisions of apb  and  as a result  fas will not impact its operating results or financial position 
miscellaneous the matters discussed herein and elsewhere that are forward looking statements are based on current management expectations that involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
potential risks and uncertainties that could affect the company s future operating results include  without limitation  the effect of publicity on demand for the company s products and services  general economic conditions  continued market acceptance of the company s products and services  the timing of the receipt of software licenses  the timing of services contracts and renewals  the timing and complexity of large transactions  continued competitive and pricing pressures in the marketplace  the company s ability to develop and market new and updated products and enhancements cost effectively and on a timely basis  and the company s ability to complete fixed price contracts profitably
