item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis relates to the financial condition and results of operations of the company for the three years ended december  after giving effect to the idb merger  which was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
this information should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this document 
general the company s emphasis on acquisitions has taken the company from a small regional long distance carrier to one of the largest long distance telecommunications companies in the industry  serving customers domestically and internationally 
the company s operations have grown significantly in each year of its operations as a result of internal growth  the selective acquisition of smaller long distance companies with limited geographic service areas and market shares  the consolidation of certain third tier long distance carriers with larger market shares  and international expansion 
on january   the company completed the acquisition of the network services operations of williams telecommunications group  inc wiltel  a subsidiary of the williams companies  inc williams  for approximately billion in cash the wiltel acquisition 
through this purchase  the company acquired a nationwide common carrier network of approximately  miles of fiber optic cable and digital microwave facilities 
the wiltel acquisition was accounted for as a purchase transaction for financial reporting purposes 
the funds paid to williams were obtained by the company under new credit facilities entered into on december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s long distance revenues are derived principally from the number of minutes of use billed by the company 
minutes billed are those conversation minutes during which a call is actually connected at the company s switch except for minutes during which the customer receives a busy signal or the call is unanswered at its destination 
the company s profitability is dependent upon  among other things  its ability to achieve line costs that are less than its revenues 
the principal components of line costs are access charges and transport charges 
access charges are expenses incurred by ixcs for accessing the local networks of the lecs in order to originate and terminate calls and payments made to ptts to complete international calls made from the us transport charges are the expenses incurred in transmitting calls between or within latas 
the most significant portion of the company s line costs is access charges which are highly regulated 
the fcc regulates international communications services and interstate telephone service and certain states  through the appropriate regulatory agency  regulate intrastate telephone service 
accordingly  the company cannot predict what effect continued regulation and increased competition between lecs and other ixcs will have on future access charges 
however  the company believes that it will be able to continue to reduce transport costs through effective utilization of its network  favorable contracts with carriers and network efficiencies made possible as a result of expansion of the company s customer base by acquisitions and internal growth 
on february   president clinton signed legislation  that will  without limitation  permit the bocs to provide domestic and international long distance services upon a finding by the fcc that the petitioning boc has satisfied certain criteria for opening up its local exchange network to competition and that its provision of long distance services would further the public interest  removes existing barriers to entry into local service markets  significantly changes the manner in which carrier to carrier arrangements are regulated at the federal and state level  establishes procedures to revise universal service standards  and  establishes penalties for unauthorized switching of customers 
the enactment of this legislation has made it possible for the company to form business associations to provide long distance telecommunications services with certain lecs and the company expects to pursue resale of local service in those markets where it is both economically and technically feasible 
while the effects of this legislation on the company and the industry remain uncertain  the company believes that it is positioned to take advantage of business opportunities in the rapidly changing telecommunications marketplace 
in the first quarter of  the company signed agreements to provide long distance telecommunications services to gte long distance  ameritech communications  inc  and southwestern bell mobile systems  inc 
worldcom also entered into an agreement to become a major provider of data telecommunications services for eds  a global information services company 
additionally  in response to the changing regulatory environment  worldcom has filed applications with public utility commissions in several states to offer customers a full range of local telephone exchange services  an important capability that will serve as a complement to the company s national and international service offerings 
to date  worldcom has received permission to provide local service on a resale basis in california  connecticut  florida  illinois and texas

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
line costs increased from million in to billion in this increase is due to increased traffic volumes  partially offset by network efficiencies and rate reductions resulting from favorable contract negotiations 
as a percentage of revenues  line costs increased to in from in this increase is attributable to the change in product mix including increased international traffic  which carries higher line costs 
additionally  idb s margins decreased in as idb was unable to deliver all of its inbound traffic over its existing facilities and had to use other carriers at a higher cost to deliver this overflow traffic 
also in  idb s carrier revenue as a proportion of total international traffic increased and these rates are typically lower than rates charged to commercial customers 
certain of these idb carrier contracts provided either a break even or negative margin to the company and accordingly  service to these customers was discontinued in december sg a increased to million in from million in  and as a percentage of revenues  these expenses increased to in from in the increase in sg a as a percentage of revenues is attributable to various idb related one time adjustments which were recorded in these adjustments included million to adjust the provision for doubtful accounts receivable  million in accounting and legal expenses incurred in connection with the resignation of idb s prior auditors and million related to various investment write downs and other balance sheet accruals

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
although the company continues to offer idb broadcast services  such services are not a part of the company s core business operations

accordingly  the company charged to operations in  the estimated costs of the idb merger and restructuring of million and million  respectively 
in  plans were approved to reduce idb s cost structure and to improve productivity

in connection with this plan  million was charged to operations in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
depreciation and amortization expense  which includes depreciation of the company s call transmission facilities  increased to million from million in or and of revenues in and  respectively 
the increase in such expenses was due primarily to depreciation and amortization of the additional property and equipment  customer bases and goodwill resulting from acquisitions by the company during interest expense in was million or of revenues  as compared to million or of revenues in this decrease as a percentage of revenues was a result of several factors  including the company s prepayment of long term debt with funds obtained through the public offering of idb common stock in may and the issuance by idb in august of million of convertible subordinated notes due additionally  as some of the company s acquisitions were funded by a combination of stock and debt  the interest expense has not grown as rapidly as the revenues 
in the third quarter of  the company recorded a million charge which represents an estimated shareholder litigation settlement of million and million in related legal costs 
this liability was paid by the company in april the company recorded a provision for income taxes of million on a pretax loss of million in although the company generated a consolidated pre tax loss in  permanent items aggregating approximately million resulted in the recognition of taxable income 
also  because the current year net operating loss nol generated by idb prior to the idb merger may be offset only by future taxable income generated at the idb level of the company s operations  the company believed that only a portion of the current year nol could be utilized under a more likely than not scenario 
accordingly  the company placed a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset attributable to approximately million of the nol 
liquidity and capital resources on january   in conjunction with the wiltel acquisition  the company utilized its billion long term credit facilities and repaid all debt under the company s previous credit facilities and million in senior notes 
total additional borrowings for were billion 
at december   the company had access to an additional million under its long term credit facilities 
the credit facility is comprised of a billion  six year reducing revolving credit facility the revolving facility commitment and a billion  two year term facility the term principal debt 
the maximum principal amount permitted to be outstanding under the revolving facility commitment will be reduced at the end of each fiscal quarter  commencing september   in varying amounts  and the outstanding balance must be paid in full on december  the term principal debt matures in a single installment on december  the revolving facility commitment and the term principal debt bear interest  payable quarterly  at variable rates selected by the company under the terms of the credit facilities 
the company is permitted to choose from several interest rate options including a base rate plus applicable margin  the london interbank offering rate libor plus applicable margin  or  for the revolving facility commitment only  any competitive bid rate 
the applicable margin varies from to for base rate borrowings and to for libor rate borrowings from time to time based upon the lower of a specified financial test or the company s long term debt rating 
the credit facilities are unsecured and require compliance with certain financial and other operating covenants which require the maintenance of certain minimum operating ratios and which limit  among other things  the incurrence of additional indebtedness by the company and restricts the payment of cash dividends to worldcom shareholders 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
in february  to protect against the effect of rising interest rates  the company entered into financial hedging agreements with various financial institutions  in connection with requirements under the credit facilities 
the hedging agreements establish capped fixed rates of interest ranging from to on an aggregate notional value of billion 
if interest rates do not reach this cap  the company s interest rate remains variable 
these contracts range in duration from one to two years with million maturing in each of the years ending and the million which matured in  was replaced with a hedging agreement which caps the fixed interest at and matures in the company is committed to a priority plan of accelerating operating cash flow to reduce debt 
the company anticipates that the existing debt balances including the billion term principal debt  which matures december  will be refinanced with a new revolving commercial bank credit facility with similar terms 
additional capital availability may be generated through a combination of commercial bank debt and public market debt 
successful execution of the refinancings and the priority plan would provide continued compliance with required operating ratio covenants and would eliminate any type of equity financing other than equity issued in connection with acquisitions 
no assurance can be given that the company will achieve its priority plan or that any refinancing will be available on terms acceptable to worldcom 
the company has historically utilized cash flow from operations to finance capital expenditures and a mixture of cash flow  debt and stock to finance acquisitions 
the company will continue to analyze potential acquisitions utilizing primarily equity financing until the additional leverage from the wiltel acquisition is reduced 
for  the company s cash flow from operations was million  increasing from million in and million in the increase in cash flow from operations was primarily attributable to cash flow from acquired operations  internal growth and the sale of the company s receivables as noted below 
cash used in investing activities in totaled billion and included billion for acquisitions and related costs and million for capital expenditures 
primary capital expenditures include purchases of switching  transmission  communication and other equipment 
current budgeted network capital expenditures for total approximately million 
included in cash flows from financing activities are payments of million for preferred dividend requirements and million for the non recurring payment to metromedia 
all of the series preferred stock was converted by metromedia in august and accordingly  no further dividends will be required on the series preferred stock 
a portion of the company s series preferred stock was also converted during the third quarter of the series preferred stock remaining is expected to be redeemed by the company during assuming that the redemption of the series preferred stock occurs  as approved by the company s board of directors  on or about june   the dividend expense is not anticipated to exceed million 
during  the company amended wiltel s existing million receivables purchase agreement to include certain additional receivables and received additional proceeds of million 
the company used these proceeds to reduce the outstanding debt under the company s credit facilities and provide additional working capital 
as of december   the purchaser owned an undivided interest in a million pool of receivables which includes the million sold 
the aggregate purchase limit under this agreement was million at december  in april  an additional million was borrowed against the company s long term credit facilities to pay the idb shareholder litigation settlement liability  which had been recognized by the company during the third quarter of during  metromedia exercised its right to purchase a total of million shares of the company s common stock under purchase warrants 
aggregate proceeds of million from these exercises were used to reduce the outstanding debt under the company s credit facilities
