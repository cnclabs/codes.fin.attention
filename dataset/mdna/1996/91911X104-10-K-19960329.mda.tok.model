the increase in icn galenika sales of  or  is primarily due to improved unit sales and favorable price increases for the year compared to icn galenika has also benefited from strong growth of antibiotics  where it holds a market share in yugoslavia

prescription dermatologicals increased to  in from  in  an increase of 
pharmaceutical net sales in western europe rose to  in from  in this increase in net sales of is primarily a result of continued strong unit sales of calcitonina calcitonin for osteoporosis and huberdoxina tm  an antibiotic in spain 
in addition  expanded resources were used to promote virazole r sales in western europe for the rsv season contributing to an increase in net sales of  the company s largest selling product  virazole r  accounts for approximately of total company sales and is sold principally in the united states for the treatment of rsv in young infants 
rsv is a seasonal disease and overall sales of virazole r from year to year are subject to the incidence and severity of the disease  which cannot be predicted with certainty 
the incidence of rsv in the united states for the season is not as prevalent as was experienced in the season 
the overall impact on earnings of the incidence of rsv in the season is uncertain 
the increases in net pharmaceutical sales noted above were partially offset by lower sales in latin america which were negatively impacted by inflation and the devaluation of the mexican peso 
sales in latin america decreased to  in from  in  a decrease of 
the biomedical business  acquired in the merger  had net sales for of  or approximately of total net sales 
this represents an increase over proforma net sales  assuming the merger occurred on january   of  primarily due to the additional sales of diagnostic products acquired from becton dickinson in net pharmaceutical sales for declined to  compared to  in this decrease in net sales was primarily a result of lower sales at icn galenika 
net sales at icn galenika were  in compared to  in  primarily due to the differences in exchange rates during compared to and the reluctance of the yugoslavian government to allow sales price increases during the decrease in sales at icn galenika in is partially offset by sales increases of  or  in the company s operating units excluding icn galenika 
the sales in these operations increased to  in compared to  in this increase is primarily due to increased virazole r sales of  compared to sales and operating results for were not adversely affected by the devaluation of the mexican peso during december as a result of the merger  the company acquired a biomedical research products business that contributed  of sales to the operating results since november  gross profit gross profit as a percentage of sales was for compared to for the increase in gross profit is primarily due to improved unit costs at icn galenika where gross profit margins increased to in from in during  the unit cost of inventory had risen due to higher prices resulting from the economic conditions that existed in yugoslavia 
this higher priced inventory is reflected in cost of sales for and has been replaced with inventory having a lower unit cost in  resulting from an improved economic environment in yugoslavia and higher production levels 
the gross profit margin in the company s operating units  other than icn galenika  decreased to in compared to in due primarily to a full year impact of biomedical sales in compared to two months of biomedical sales in the biomedical business has gross profit margins of compared to the pharmaceutical business gross profit margins  excluding icn galenika  of

gross profit margin at icn galenika decreased to in from in primarily due to higher unit costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were in compared to in this increase was primarily due to higher operating expenses at icn galenika resulting from inflationary pressures and the impact of a full year of biomedical operations in compared to two months of biomedical operations in the biomedical selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales is compared to for the pharmaceutical business 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were for compared to for the decrease was primarily due to expense reductions at icn galenika resulting from a lower provision for bad debts  lower wages and the impact of differences in the exchange rates in compared to research and development costs the increase in research and development costs  excluding the write off of purchased research and development of  in compared to of  is primarily due to the acquisition of the viratek research programs and increased spending at icn galenika 
the decrease in research and development costs in compared to of  is primarily due to lower costs at icn galenika of  resulting from wage reductions for research and development personnel and differences in exchange rates 
the decrease in research and development expense was partially offset by research and development expenses of  resulting from the merger 
translation and exchange gains losses  net foreign exchange gains  net  in were  compared to foreign exchange losses  net  of  in foreign exchange gains at icn galenika were  in related to exchange rate fluctuations of the dinar and a devaluation of the dinar on november  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation icn galenika which was partially offset by exchange losses of  on the company s foreign denominated debt 
the increase in foreign exchange loss in compared to resulted from increased losses at icn galenika related to exchange rate fluctuations that occurred before the implementation of the stabilization program 
the exchange losses at icn galenika were offset by foreign exchange gains related to certain of the company s foreign denominated debt 
interest expense the increase in interest expense in compared to of  is primarily due to interest expense on additional debt assumed in the merger and the issuance of  convertible notes in november  the proceeds of which were used to pay a portion of the debt assumed in the merger 
additionally  the weighted average interest rate on short term borrowings increased to in compared to in this increase reflects a hyperinflationary average short term borrowing rate at icn galenika in compared to a stabilized rate of in the decrease in interest expense in compared to of  was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense of  at icn galenika 
the economic stabilization program enacted by the yugoslavian government early in resulted in lower interest rates in compared to this decrease in interest expense at icn galenika during was partially offset by increased interest expense in the united states resulting from the assumption of additional debt in connection with the merger 
income taxes the company s effective income tax rate was  and for  and  respectively 
in  the company benefited from a devaluation of icn galenika s tax liability balances  utilization of construction tax credits in yugoslavia and the revaluation of the company s deferred tax assets 
the company s effective tax rate of in was significantly different than the expected united states statutory rate of due to the write off of purchased research and development related to the merger for which there is no related tax benefit 
the company s effective rate of in was significantly less than the united states statutory rate primarily due to the utilization of foreign and alternative minimum tax credits and other deferred tax benefits for which a valuation allowance existed at january  during  the company utilized  of acquired domestic net operating loss carryforwards nols having a tax benefit of  for which a valuation allowance had been established as of the effective date of the merger 
the corresponding reduction in the valuation allowance of  resulted in a reduction of goodwill and intangibles acquired in connection with the merger 
in addition to the utilization of the nols described above  the company recognized a  tax benefit of an additional  of acquired nols and other deferred tax assets through a reduction in the company s deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
this reduction in the valuation allowance of  resulted in a  reduction in goodwill and intangibles acquired in connection with the merger and a  reduction in deferred income tax expense 
realization of the deferred tax assets are dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the loss carryforwards 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized 
the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the future if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
certain tax benefits that were acquired in the acquisition of icn galenika will expire in the expiration of these tax benefits will increase the effective tax rate for icn galenika 
however  this increase may be partially offset by tax credits in connection with plant construction provided in yugoslavia 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities continues to be the company s primary source of funds for its operating needs  capital expenditures and dividend payments 
in  cash provided by operating activities increased  to  primarily due to increased earnings before depreciation and minority interest and an advance payment from schering plough of  related to the use of virazole r for the treatment of hepatitis c  partially offset by cash payments used for the expansion of inventory levels at icn galenika of on july   the company entered into an exclusive license and supply agreement the agreement and a stock purchase agreement with a subsidiary of schering plough corporation schering to license the company s proprietary anti viral drug ribavirin as a treatment for chronic hepatitis c in combination with schering s alpha interferon 
the agreement provided the company an initial non refundable payment by schering of  and future royalty payments to the company for marketing of the drug  including certain minimum royalty rates 
schering will have exclusive marketing rights for ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis c worldwide  except that the company will retain the right to co market in the countries of the european economic community 
in addition  schering will purchase up to  in common stock of the company upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones 
under the agreement  schering will be responsible for all clinical developments worldwide 
the  non refundable payment has been recorded by the company as prepaid royalty income of  a license fee of  and a liability to schering for certain cost sharing agreements of  the prepaid royalty will be amortized to income based upon future sales of the product and the license fee will be amortized to income over the exclusive period of the agreement  fifteen years 
cash used in investing activities increased  to  due to the continuation of the plant expansion program at icn galenika 
during and  icn galenika has expended  toward an estimated  project that is expected to be completed in icn galenika intends to fund this program through existing funds and funds generated from local operations and locally funded debt 
cash used in financing activities increased  to  reflecting principally the early retirement of the sinking fund debentures of  and a reduction of notes payable  collateralized by marketable securities  of  in  the company sold common stock in the amount of  of which approximately  of the proceeds were utilized to purchase the radioimmunoassay product line from becton dickinson and the remainder utilized for working capital purposes 
the increase in distribution payments compared to is due primarily to a greater number of shares outstanding resulting from the merger 
during  cash used in financing included cash payments to the parent company of  which did not recur in  as a result of the merger 
product liability in december  management discontinued product liability insurance in the united states 
while to date no material adverse claim for personal injury resulting from allegedly defective products has been successfully maintained against the company  a substantial claim  if successful  could have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity and financial performance 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
investment in russia on july   the company purchased an additional interest in the russian pharmaceutical company  oktyabr  raising its ownership from to 
in connection with the acquisition of the additional interest  the company issued  shares of its common stock  valued at approximately  based upon the market price of the stock at the time the shares were issued  in exchange for the shares in oktyabr 
the acquisition is not material to the financial position or results of operations of the company 
demands on working capital management believes that funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet its normal operating requirements during the coming year 
if these funds prove to be insufficient  or if new acquisitions or other opportunities require the company to raise capital  the company may seek additional financing or issue preferred stock or additional common stock 
the company is actively engaged in the identification of new businesses and products that complement the company s existing product lines and markets 
at december   the company has several preliminary acquisition prospects that could require equity or debt financing during in january   the company sold approximately  shares of its common stock to a foreign bank for net proceeds of  the proceeds were used by the company for the acquisition of gly derm  a michigan based skin care company  and several smaller acquisitions 
inflation and changing prices foreign operations are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business abroad  including price and currency exchange controls  fluctuations in the relative values of currencies  political instability and restrictive governmental actions 
changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and may  in certain instances  materially affect the company s results of operations 
the effect of these risks remains difficult to predict 
the company is subject to foreign currency risk on its foreign denominated debt of  of which  is in swiss francs  at december  and to devaluation losses on net monetary assets positions in yugoslavia and russia 
the effects of inflation are experienced by the company through increases in the costs of labor  services and raw materials 
while the company attempts to raise selling prices in anticipation of inflation  adverse effects have been experienced in yugoslavia and in mexico as a result of price controls 
the company is subject to price control restrictions on its pharmaceutical products in the majority of countries in which it operates 
to date  the company has been affected by the lag in allowed price increases in yugoslavia and mexico  which has created lower sales in us dollars and reductions in gross profit 
future sales and gross profit could be materially affected if the company is unable to obtain price increases commensurate with the levels of inflation 
icn galenika hyperinflation and devaluation icn galenika  a owned subsidiary  operates in a highly inflationary economy and uses the dollar as the functional currency rather than the yugoslavian dinar 
before the enactment of an economic stabilization program in january  the rate of inflation in yugoslavia was over billion percent per year 
the rate of inflation was dramatically reduced when  on january   the yugoslavian government enacted a stabilization program designed to strengthen its currency 
throughout  this program was successful in reducing inflation to approximately per year  increasing the availability of hard currency  stabilizing the exchange rate of the dinar and improving the overall economy in yugoslavia 
throughout  the effectiveness of the stabilization program weakened and icn galenika began experiencing a decline in the availability of hard currency in yugoslavia and inflation levels accelerated to an approximate annual rate of by the end of the year 
through the third quarter of  the net monetary asset position of icn galenika had increased due to rising accounts receivable balances resulting from improved sales and the lengthening of the collection period of receivables resulting from the lack of availability of dinars in yugoslavia 
from a beginning balance of  at december   the net monetary asset position of icn galenika had risen to  at september  upon devaluation of the dinar  a net monetary asset position will result in translation losses 
therefore  early in the fourth quarter of  icn galenika took action to reduce its monetary exposure by shortening the payment terms on its receivables  reducing sales levels  accelerating the purchase of inventory and accelerating the purchase of building materials for its plant expansion 
on november   the dinar devalued from a rate of dinars per us to a rate of dinars per us on this date  icn galenika had a net monetary liability position that resulted in a gain of  as of december   icn galenika had a net monetary asset position of  which would be subject to foreign exchange loss if a devaluation of the dinar were to occur 
as required by generally accepted accounting principles gaap  the company translates icn galenika s financial results at the dividend payment rate established by the national bank of yugoslavia 
to the extent that changes in this rate lag behind the level of inflation  sales and expenses will  at times  tend to be inflated 
future sales and expenses can substantially increase if the timing of future devaluations falls significantly behind the level of inflation 
the future of the economic and political environment of yugoslavia is uncertain and could deteriorate to the point that a severe impact on the financial position and results of operations of the company could occur 
sanctions a substantial majority of icn galenika s business is conducted in the federal republic of yugoslavia serbia and montenegro 
in december  the united nations security council unsc adopted a resolution that suspended economic sanctions that had been imposed on the federal republic of yugoslavia since may sanctions contributed to an overall deteriorating business environment in which icn galenika operated and denied icn galenika access to export sales which previously totaled approximately  per year 
sanctions also created restrictions on icn galenika s overseas investments and imposed administrative burdens in obtaining raw materials outside of yugoslavia 
the company believes the suspension of sanctions will provide a more favorable business environment in the future  however  the beneficial effects of the suspension will not take place immediately as the economy needs to adjust to new opportunities 
if the peace process in the balkans deteriorates there is a risk that sanctions could be reinstated 
price controls icn galenika is subject to price controls in yugoslavia 
the size and frequency of government approved price increases is influenced by local inflation  devaluations  cost of imported raw materials and demand for icn galenika products 
during and  icn galenika received fewer price increases than in the past due to lower relative levels of inflation 
as inflation increases  the size and frequency of price increases is expected to increase 
during the third quarter of  icn galenika received a price increase on its pharmaceutical products 
this was the first price increase the government had allowed since the start of the stabilization program 
subsequent to the devaluation on november   icn galenika received an price increase on its pharmaceutical products 
price increases obtained by icn galenika are based on economic events preceding the price increase and not on expectations of ongoing inflation 
this lag in allowed price increases creates downward pressure on the gross margins that icn galenika receives on its products 
when necessary  icn galenika will limit sales of products that have poor margins until an acceptable price increase is received 
the impact of an inability to obtain adequate price increases in the future could have an adverse impact on the company as a result of declining gross profit margins or declining sales in an effort to maintain existing gross margin levels
