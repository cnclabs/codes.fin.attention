item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations sales sales increased in following a increase a year ago 
domestic sales accounted for almost all of the increase in the current year due to better economic conditions in our industry and some added distribution channels 
foreign sales increased only modestly as brazil struggled with the effects of high real interest rates 
last year s sales increase came primarily from our foreign operations 
exchange rate changes in both scotland and brazil contributed somewhat  but the main factor was the brazilian economy causing unit volume there to be up 
earnings before taxes pretax earnings are up for the year 
this follows a increase in looking at domestic results only  pretax earnings are up this year and were up last year  both year s increases being due primarily to volume and the related effects of increased factory hours and overhead absorption 
on the foreign side  significant unit volume and price increases achieved in brazil in fiscal could not be improved upon in as the economy fought the effects of high real interest rates 
mandated wage increases in brazil during a period when it was difficult to raise prices caused a decline in pretax income in net earnings net earnings are up over while earnings were up over the effective tax rate is in compared to in and in the fiscal effective tax rate is back to a normal range after two years of wide fluctuation 
tax exempt interest  puerto rico tax incentives and dividends on esop stock usually contribute to an overall effective tax rate that is slightly lower than the combined domestic statutory rate 
the increase in the effective tax rate in came about because of the monetary plan instituted in brazil two years ago that caused high local taxable income until pre plan inventories were sold  which has largely happened by the end of in addition  there were several statutory rate reductions in brazil toward the end of the big drop in the effective tax rate in again came from brazil where two things happened higher inflation resulted in higher tax deductions for monetary correction an accounting concept unique to brazil and the company resolved favorably a tax dispute dating to liquidity and capital resources years ended in june cash provided by operations    cash used in investing activities    cash used in financing activities    effect of translation rate changes on cash increase decrease in cash  cash flows provided by operating activities decreased million in the increase in the cash from earnings was more than offset by the cash used to finance increased inventory 
the increase of million was primarily due to the increase in earnings 
the company s investing activities consist mainly of expenditures for property  plant and equipment and the investment of cash not immediately needed for operations 
plant expenditures of  and million in  and are typical and the company anticipates similar levels of capital expenditures in the near term 
cash flows from financing activities are primarily the payment of dividends  which tend to be quite steady from year to year 
the company requires little debt to finance day to day operations and the proceeds from the sale of stock under the various stock plans tend to be used to purchase treasury shares 
the company maintains sufficient liquidity and has adequate resources to fund its operations under current business conditions 
the company maintains two lines of credit as discussed in the notes to the financial statements 
these lines have been used primarily to finance acquisitions in prior years 
the company continues to maintain a strong financial position with a working capital ratio of to as of june  and to as of june  cash not immediately required for working capital is invested in short term money market instruments with maturities generally less than one year however  see notes to financial statements regarding investments in puerto rico 
the fact that the changes in receivables and payables in the statement of cash flows do not exactly match the changes in the related balance sheet accounts is because of changes in foreign exchange rates 
these differences should not be interpreted as uses and sources of cash  but rather as noncash adjustments to net income to arrive at cash generated from operations 
also  in brazil  these differences tend to be offset by unrealized exchange gains and losses 
safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of this item  as well as other portions of this document and the annual report  including the chairman s letter to stockholders  include forward looking statements about the company s business  sales  expenditures  foreign operations  debt service  liquidity and capital resources  and other operating and capital requirements 
in addition  forward looking statements may be included in future company documents and in oral statements by company representatives to security analysts and investors 
the company is subject to risks that could cause actual events to vary materially from such forward looking statements  including the following risk factors risks related to foreign operations for the period ended june   approximately of the company s sales were derived from foreign operations and  as of june   approximately of the company s net assets were located outside the united states 
foreign operations are subject to special risks that can materially affect the sales  profits  cash flows  and financial position of the company  including taxes and other restrictions on distributions and payments  currency exchange rate fluctuations  inflation  minimum capital requirements  and exchange controls 
in particular  the company s brazilian operations  which constitute over half of the company s revenues from foreign operations  is a study in contrasts  very often changing from year to year due primarily to their political situation and high inflation economy 
as a result  the future performance of the brazilian operations is inherently unpredictable 
risks related to cyclical nature of the industry the market for the company s products is subject to general economic conditions  including the level of capital spending by industrial companies 
as such  recessionary forces decrease demand for the company s products and adversely affect performance 
risks related to competition the company s business is subject to direct and indirect competition from both domestic and foreign firms 
in particular  low wage foreign sources have created severe competitive pricing pressures 
under certain circumstances  including significant changes in us and foreign currency relationships  such pricing pressures might reduce unit sales and or adversely affect the company s margins
