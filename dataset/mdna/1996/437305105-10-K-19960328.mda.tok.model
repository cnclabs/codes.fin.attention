fiscal year as compared to fiscal year net sales of million were unchanged from the prior fiscal year 
during the year  however  the company identified certain products to discontinue primarily in the home organization category 
as a result  product sales of this category declined 
further  juvenile products declined as a result of reduced trade channel fill in of initial product offerings 
these reductions were offset by healthy improvements up in the company s stronger categories of home bathwares and hooks  where the company has larger market shares 
increased sales of these products were driven by a increase in domestic sales to the company s largest customer due to improved distribution and new product offerings

offsetting much of the savings from the above actions  were increased payroll and travel costs for sales personnel 
administrative expenses  net of the unusual charges discussed above  increased slightly from of net sales in to in the increase is attributable to costs incurred related to the company s search for strategic acquisitions 
during  the company evaluated several acquisition targets and incurred legal  audit and investment banking fees during the evaluation and negotiation process 
fees and costs related to acquisition activities are expensed as incurred unless a transaction is completed 
administrative expenses also increased as a result of the company s management incentive plans 
expenses for such plans increased as a result of the company achieving its operating budget in the operating budget was not achieved in and no management incentive costs were incurred 
amortization of intangibles  net of the unusual charges discussed above  decreased from of sales in to in the decrease is the result of the reduction in patents  trademarks and other intangibles during the reduction in these assets resulted in reduced amortization in further  some of the company s intangibles reached the end of their respective amortization periods during early further reducing amortization expense as compared to restructuring charges were incurred in both and such charges increased from million in to million in in  the company s new senior management team began a restructuring of operations  analysis of customer and market trends  assessment of product lines  sku s and customers served together with a review of operating strategies

the losses from both years will be available to reduce future taxable income 
the net loss in was million or per share based on  weighted average common share and common share equivalents 
this compares to the net loss of million recorded in or per share based on  of weighted average common share and common share equivalents 
the increase in common share and common share equivalents is the result of stock issued in connection with the acquisition of mericon child safety products and the partially offsetting impact of treasury shares acquired 
the million decrease in net loss between years was due primarily to the million reduction in unusual charges discussed above 
outlook the management initiatives during and have resulted in the elimination of many unprofitable and other poorly performing product lines together with reduced overhead and improved operating efficiencies

million  respectively

interest expenses decreased primarily because of a reduction in the industrial revenue bond irb debt 
the interest rates associated with the irb debt did not increase as quickly as the increases in the prime rate 
the increase in other income and expense resulted from an accrual of approximately 
million for the remaining obligation to a former owner of ipc under consulting and non compete agreements

the housewares segment was negatively impacted in and by million and million  respectively 
the home improvement segment was not impacted in but was negatively impacted by 
million in housewares the operating loss of the housewares segment  net of the unusual charges previously discussed  was million in as compared to an operating loss of 
million in the increase in the loss was primarily the result of higher resin costs 
other factors impacting results were the decline in gross profit margins due to canadian sales mix shifts to a lower margin hardware product line  the costs associated with the company s search for strategic acquisitions and the additional costs of new management incentive plans 
the majority of the company s anticipated improved results in are expected to come from the housewares segment 
the housewares segment reported an operating profit in of million  significantly better than the 
million operating loss  net of unusual charges  reported in the decline in profitability is a direct result of increased material costs of  higher freight costs  additional marketing spending to support new product development and sales mix shifts towards less profitable products which were subsequently discontinued 
home improvement products the operating profit of the home improvement segment improved significantly in operating profits in of 
million were up 
million as compared to s result of

during  the company was able to finance operations  capital spending and a small acquisition through the collection of a million patent suit settlement and cash from operations 
despite a million loss  cash flow from operations was positive due to the non cash nature of much of the loss even though severance and other unusual items from were funded in the key components of cash uses and sources were as follows inventories declined 
million as a result of reduced sku s and safety stocks 
the decrease in inventory was accomplished despite a average increase in plastic resin costs 
raw materials accounts for approximately of total inventories 
collection of a million patent suit settlement
