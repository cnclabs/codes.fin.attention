quarterly results of operations the tables in part ii  item of this form k include selected unaudited quarterly consolidated results of operations for fiscal and this information was derived from the company s unaudited consolidated financial statements that  in the opinion of management  reflect all recurring adjustments necessary to fairly present this information  when read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements 
the results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future quarter 
phoenix s future operating results may vary substantially from period to period 
the timing and amount of its license fees are subject to a number of factors that make estimating revenues and operating results prior to the end of a quarter uncertain 
while phoenix receives recurring revenue on royalty based license agreements and some agreements contain minimum quarterly royalty commitments  a significant amount of license fees in any quarter is dependent on signing agreements and delivering the licensed software in that quarter 
generally  phoenix has experienced a pattern of recording of its quarterly revenues in the third month of the quarter 
phoenix has historically monitored its revenue bookings through regular  periodic worldwide forecast reviews during the quarter 
however  while these reviews keep management informed of areas where additional selling effort may be needed in order to meet the internal plans and market expectations  there can be no assurances that this process will result in revenue expectations being met 
operating expenses for any year are normally based on the attainment of planned revenue levels for that year and are incurred ratably throughout the period 
as a result  if revenues are less than planned in any quarter while expense levels remain relatively fixed  phoenix s operating results would be adversely affected for that quarter 
in addition  the incurring of unplanned expenses could adversely affect operating results for the period in which such expenses were incurred 
business risks the additional following factors should be considered carefully when evaluating phoenix and its business 
uncertainties relating to the integration of virtual chips 
phoenix and virtual chips entered into the acquisition agreement with the expectation that the merger will result in beneficial synergies for the combined companies 
achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger will depend in part upon whether the integration of the two companies businesses is achieved in an efficient and effective manner and there can be no assurance that this will occur 
virtual chips products address new and emerging technologies and its customer base includes peripheral device manufacturers which have not been among phoenix s traditional customers 
the combination of the two companies will require  among other things  the integration of the two companies sales forces 
there can be no assurance that such integration will be accomplished smoothly  on time  or successfully 
phoenix s operating results could be adversely affected if phoenix does not adequately train its sales force to sell the products based on these new technologies into this new market 
product development 
phoenix s long term success will depend on its ability to enhance its existing products and to introduce new products on a timely and cost effective basis that meet the needs of its current customers in their present markets and of current and future customers in new and emerging markets 
there can be no assurance that phoenix will be successful in developing new products or in enhancing existing products or that new or enhanced products will meet market requirements 
phoenix has from time to time experienced delays in introducing new products which could adversely impact acceptance and revenue generated from the sale of such products 
finally  phoenix s software products and their enhancements contain complex code which may contain undetected errors or bugs when first introduced  despite testing 
there can be no assurance that new products or enhancements will not contain errors or bugs that will adversely affect commercial acceptance of such products or enhancements 
protection of intellectual property 
phoenix relies on a combination of trade secret  copyright  trademark laws and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary rights in its software products 
there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate or that competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to phoenix s technology 
in addition  copyright and trade secret protection for phoenix s products may be unavailable or unreliable in certain foreign countries 
the company has been issued one patent with respect to its current product offerings and has a number of patent applications pending with respect to certain of the products it markets 
phoenix maintains an active internal program designed to identify internally developed inventions worthy of being patented 
there can be no assurance that any of the applications pending will be approved and patents issued or that phoenix s engineers will be able to develop technologies capable of being patented 
as the number of software patents increases  phoenix believes that software developers may become increasingly subject to infringement claims 
there can be no assurance that a third party will not assert that its patents or other proprietary rights are violated by products offered by phoenix 
any such claims  whether or not meritorious  can be time consuming and expensive to defend  and could have an adverse effect on phoenix s business  results of operations and financial condition 
infringement of valid patents or copyrights or misappropriation of valid trade secrets could also have an adverse effect on phoenix s business  results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on third party providers of technology 
phoenix s products use certain products and technologies of various third party software developers  including both complete products offered as extensions of phoenix s product lines and technology used in the enhancement of internally developed products 
in addition  phoenix recently announced that it had become the exclusive distributor to oems of first aid  a diagnostic and repair utility from cybermedia  inc for pcs and pc software 
these products are licensed under contractual agreements  which in some cases are for limited time periods and in some cases provide for termination under certain circumstances 
there can be no assurance that the technology plans and directions for the third party products will remain compatible with phoenix s needs  that these third party providers will commit adequate development resources to maintain or enhance these products and technologies  or that the license agreements with limited duration will be renewed upon expiration 
in such circumstances  phoenix may not be able to obtain or develop substitute products or technology  which could adversely affect phoenix s business  results of operation and financial condition 
importance of microsoft and intel 
for a number of years  phoenix has worked closely with microsoft corporation and intel corporation in developing standards for the pc industry 
in addition  phoenix has been a supplier of its system level software technology to intel and in december the two companies entered into a significant  long term technology agreement pursuant to which phoenix licensed its desktop and server bios products for intel to include with its motherboard products 
phoenix presently expects its ongoing relationships with these two industry leaders to remain good 
there can  however  be no assurance that either microsoft or intel will not develop alternative product strategies which could conflict with phoenix s product plans and marketing strategies and  accordingly  adversely impact phoenix s business and results of operations 
presently  there is little overlap or conflict in phoenix s product offerings and strategies and those of intel 
windows nt and windows ce  microsoft s newer operating systems  incorporate some functionality that has traditionally resided in the bios 
however  pcs which support multiple operating systems still require this support in the bios 
to provide products to oems which are manufacturing systems using only these newer microsoft operating systems  phoenix must migrate its intellectual property from the bios to the lower levels of these operating systems 
there can be no assurances that phoenix will be successful in these efforts 
retention of key personnel 
phoenix believes it employs more bios engineers than any other company in the pc industry 
virtual chips products are based on new and emerging technologies which are different than bios technologies 
phoenix s ability to achieve its revenue and operating performance objectives will depend in large part on its ability to attract and retain technically qualified engineers 
the available pool of engineering talent is limited for both operations 
accordingly  failure to retain and grow its research and development teams could adversely affect phoenix s business and operating results 
competition 
the market for phoenix s products is extremely competitive 
phoenix competes primarily with three other independent suppliers with respect to its system level software products american megatrends  inc  award software international inc and systemsoft corporation 
it also competes for bios business with in house research and development departments of pc manufacturers that have significantly greater financial and technical resources than those of phoenix 
these companies include compaq computer corporation  international business machines corporation  dell computer corporation and toshiba corporation 
in the synthesizable core business begun with the acquisition of virtual chips  phoenix competes with businesses such as mentor graphics corporation  synposys corporation and cadence systems who have resources far greater than those of phoenix and with other companies such as sand microsystems and cae technology 
there can be no assurance that phoenix will continue to compete successfully with its current competitors or that it will be able to compete successfully with new competitors 
international sales and activities 
revenue derived from phoenix s international operations comprises a majority of total revenues 
there can be no assurances that phoenix will not experience significant fluctuations in international revenues 
while virtually all of phoenix s license fee or royalty contracts are u 
s dollar denominated  phoenix is considering permitting its overseas offices to invoice in local currencies 
phoenix has sales and engineering offices in england  france  japan and taiwan and uses a madras  india software engineering firm for assistance in the synthesizable core business 
phoenix s operations and financial results could be adversely affected by factors associated with international operations such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  uncertainties relative to regional economic circumstances  political instability in emerging markets  and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  as well as by other risks associated with international activities 
volatile market for phoenix stock 
the market for phoenix s stock is highly volatile 
the trading price of phoenix common stock has been and will continue to be subject to fluctuations in response to operating and financial results  announcements of technological innovations  new products of customer contracts by phoenix and its competitors  changes in phoenix s or its competitors product mix or product direction  changes in phoenix s revenue mix and revenue growth rates  changes in expectations of growth for the pc industry  as well as other events or factors which phoenix may not be able to influence or control 
statements or changes in opinions  ratings or earnings estimates made by brokerage firms and industry analysts relating to the market in which phoenix does business  companies with which phoenix competes or relating to phoenix specifically could have an immediate and adverse effect on the market price of phoenix s stock 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market price for many high technology companies and that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
certain anti takeover effects 
phoenix s certificate of incorporation  bylaws and stockholder rights plan and the delaware general corporation law include provisions that may be deemed to have anti takeover effects and may delay  defer or prevent a takeover attempt that stockholders might consider in their best interests 
these include provisions under which members of the board of directors are divided into three classes and are elected to serve staggered three year terms 
the stockholder rights plan permits holders of phoenix common stock to purchase shares of series a junior participating preferred stock in the event of the acquisition by a third party of or more of phoenix s outstanding common stock or if a third party announces its tender offer for at least of phoenix s outstanding common stock 
if phoenix is acquired in a merger or other business combination  each right will entitle its holder to purchase a number of shares of phoenix common stock which equals the exercise price of the right divided by one half of the then current market price of phoenix common stock 
in addition  in connection with the february sale of shares representing of the outstanding phoenix common stock and of a warrant to purchase an additional  phoenix granted intel corporation certain rights in the event of solicited or unsolicited offers to acquire phoenix
