the increases were partially offset by the impact of legislative reforms in certain states which have led to lower premium rates and a reduction in losses and commission expenses  resulting in higher profit margins 
the increases in this segment were also mitigated by a shift towards high deductible workers compensation products  which also have lower premium rates 
reinsurance special programs net premiums written decreased  to  in from  in and increased  in from  in net premiums written by dpic for professional liability insurance  the largest special program  were   and  in  and  respectively

the year to year changes in net investment income reflect an increase in equity earnings from limited partnership investments of  from to  and a decrease in limited partnership income of  from to earnings from limited partnership investments can vary considerably from year to year  however  the company s long term experience with these investments has been quite favorable 
the increase in net investment income for is also attributable to a higher average portfolio yield on a higher investment base 
net investment income was increased in both years by income generated from the deployment of operating cash flow of  in and  in the carrying value of the company s investment portfolio amounted to  at december  and  at december  effective december   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  which establishes the available for sale category of investment securities and requires such securities to be recorded at market value  with unrealized gains and losses reported in a separate component of stockholders equity 
as a result of the adoption of this standard on december   the company reclassified investments with a market value of  from fixed maturities recorded at amortized cost to fixed maturities recorded at market  and increased unrealized appreciation on investments  a component of stockholders equity  by  net of deferred income taxes 
in december of  the company reclassified additional investments with a market value of  from fixed maturities recorded at amortized cost to fixed maturities recorded at market  increasing stockholders equity by  this one time transfer from the held to maturity portfolio was permitted by the implementation guide for sfas no 
fixed maturity investments which the company has both the positive intent and the ability to hold to maturity are recorded at amortized cost

the carrying value of fixed maturity and short term investments amounted to  and  at december  and  respectively  or approximately and of the company s cash and investments 
the company s investment philosophy is to achieve a superior rate of return after taxes  while maintaining a proper balance of safety  liquidity  maturity and marketability 
the company invests primarily in investment grade securities and strives to enhance the average return of its portfolio through limited investment in a diversified group of non investment grade fixed maturity securities or securities that are not rated 
the risk of loss due to default is generally considered greater for non investment grade securities than for investment grade securities because the former  among other things  are often subordinated to other indebtedness of the issuer and are often issued by highly leveraged companies 
at december  and  the company s investment in non investment grade and unrated fixed maturity securities were carried at  and  with market values of  and  respectively 
these investments represented a total of and of cash and investments and and of total assets at december  and  respectively 
the company monitors the financial condition of the issuers of securities that it owns 
when conditions are deemed appropriate  the company ceases to accrete discount  or accrue interest and dividends  and  in cases where the value of such investments is deemed to be other than temporarily impaired  recognizes losses 
the company s non investment grade investments are highly diversified  with an average investment per issuer of approximately  at december  only four non investment grade investments aggregating  were in excess of  at december  realized investment gains net realized investment gains amounted to  in   in and  in sales of equity securities resulted in net gains of   and  and sales of fixed maturities resulted in net gains losses of   and  in  and  respectively 
realized investment gains were reduced by provisions for losses on securities deemed to be other than temporarily impaired 
these provisions amounted to  in   in and  in for equity securities and   and  in  and  respectively  for fixed maturity investments 
such provisions  based on available information at the time  were made in consideration of the decline in the financial condition of the issuers of these securities 
realized gains losses vary from period to period  depending on market conditions relative to the company s investment holdings  the timing of investment sales generating gains and losses  the occurrence of events which give rise to other than temporary impairment of investments  and other factors 
at december  the company held equity securities with unrealized appreciation of  as compared to unrealized appreciation of  for equity securities held at december  the market value of the fixed maturities portfolio at december  exceeded amortized cost by  this compares with an excess of amortized cost over market value of  for fixed maturities at december  such amounts can vary significantly depending upon fluctuations in the financial markets 
the rise in market values during is primarily attributable to the decline in interest rates during the year 
the average maturity of the company s fixed maturities has not varied significantly in recent years 
the company intends to shorten the maturity of a portion of its fixed maturity portfolio during the performance of the company s investments  including net investment income  net realized gains losses and unrealized appreciation depreciation is as follows for the three most recent years year ended december  s omitted net investment income    net realized gains losses fixed maturities   equity securities    net unrealized appreciation depreciation fixed maturities    equity securities    expenses and other operating ratios the following table sets forth certain ratios of insurance operating expenses to premiums earned for the company year ended december  loss and loss adjustment expenses policy acquisition and other insurance expenses total before policyholders dividends 
policyholders dividends total after policyholders dividends 
the ratio of loss and loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned the loss ratio was  and in  and  respectively 
the decreases in the and loss ratios were attributable to improvements in both the regional operations and reinsurance special programs segments 
the loss ratio for regional operations was in  in and in these loss ratios reflect the continued success of the company s service oriented approach for workers compensation insurance  and the growth in high deductible policies where experience has been favorable 
reinsurance special programs loss ratio was in  in and in the improvement in the loss ratio for this segment is primarily the result of favorable loss experience for dpic and the cancellation of connecticut specialty s personal injury protection and physical damage programs which had unfavorable loss experience in the decrease for is attributable to increased writings in programs with lower loss ratios  offset in part by increased losses incurred in the two connecticut specialty cancelled programs 
the ratio of deferred acquisition costs and other insurance expenses to premiums earned the expense ratio was  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in the expense ratio in is attributable to a number of factors including ebi companies opening offices in new territories  a change in the mix of business toward policies with lower premiums and losses relative to policyholder servicing expenses and general inflationary increases in fixed operating expenses 
the and expense ratios reflect low levels of assessments from certain assigned risk pools 
the ratio of policyholders dividends to premiums earned the dividend ratio was  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in the dividend ratio for is reflective of the lower loss ratios on workers compensation insurance coverages 
the combined ratio was in  in and in provisions for losses and loss adjustment expenses include development of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves relating to prior accident years  which increased the calendar year combined ratio by percentage points in  percentage points in and percentage points in the loss ratios were adversely affected by loss development in the pool and association including assigned risk pools and reinsurance businesses where loss reserves are established by the company based on information provided from sources outside the company  and where loss patterns were significantly different than in the past 
other contributing factors were higher than anticipated reported losses for commercial multiple peril business and reserve strengthening for certain other lines of business  including discontinued programs 
in and adverse development was reduced by the continued improvement in workers compensation insurance from the application of risk management and loss control procedures 
the company s environmental claims principally relate to asbestos and hazardous waste  arising from certain liability business written prior to the mid s  which business was never a major element of the company s operations 
environmental claims are also received from certain reinsurance pools and associations where reserves are established based on information reported to the company by the managers of those pools and associations 
establishing reserve liabilities for environmental claims is subject to significant uncertainties that make reserve estimation difficult 
legal decisions have tended to expand insurance coverage beyond the intent of the policies 
the disposition of such claims often requires lengthy and costly litigation 
uncertainties as to required clean up remedies and difficulties in identifying the responsible parties add further to the complexity of reserve estimation for these claims 
in recent years  the company has intensified its efforts to settle and close environmental claims 
to help minimize the cost of losses and claims  the company maintains a dedicated environmental claims staff which administers and continually evaluates each claim and its defense and settlement possibilities 
in  and  the company paid   and  respectively  for the costs of defending and settling such claims 
payments in  and related to  and claims  respectively  for the company s direct business 
claim counts have been aggregated by year of coverage for each occurrence for which policyholders are being defended  and often include numerous claimants 
as of december  and  the company has environmental claims related loss and loss adjustment expense reserves  net of reinsurance recoverables  of  and  respectively  which include and claims  respectively  for direct business written by the company 
in estimating liabilities for environmental related claims  the company considers all pertinent information as it becomes available 
management believes that the company s reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses make reasonable and sufficient provision for the ultimate cost of all losses on claims incurred 
however  there can be no assurance that changes in loss trends will not result in additional development of prior years reserves in the future 
variability in claim emergence and settlement patterns and other trends in loss experience can result in future development patterns different than expected 
the company believes that any such development will continue at the low levels experienced in recent years  considering actions taken to increase reserving levels  improve underwriting standards and emphasize loss control and prevention 
the company s loss ratios in recent years  including development of prior years losses  have compared favorably with loss ratios experienced by the industry 
the company limits both current loss expense and future development of losses by ceding business to reinsurers 
the company continually monitors the financial strength of its reinsurers and  to the company s knowledge  has no material exposure with regard to potential unrecognized losses due to reinsurers having known financial difficulties 
interest expense interest expense was  in   in and  in the increase of in is due to higher average debt outstanding after the issuance of  of senior notes by orion on july  the increase in interest expense in is primarily attributable to an increase in average interest rates

in orion also received an extraordinary dividend of  principally securities from a california domiciled subsidiary which was simultaneously contributed as capital to a connecticut domiciled subsidiary to effect a change in pooling percentages among its insurance subsidiaries 
payments of dividends by orion s insurance subsidiaries must comply with insurance regulatory limitations concerning stockholder dividends and capital adequacy 
state insurance regulators have broad discretionary authority with respect to limitations on the payment of dividends by insurance companies 
limitations under current regulations are well in excess of orion s cash requirements 
orion s insurance subsidiaries maintain liquidity in their investment portfolios substantially in excess of that required to pay claims and expenses 
the insurance subsidiaries held cash and short term investments of  and  at december  and  respectively

all of the company s bank debt was repaid in july from the proceeds of the senior notes 
the terms of orion s indentures for its  of senior notes due and its  of senior notes due limit the amount of liens and guarantees by the company  and the company s ability to incur secured indebtedness without equally and ratably securing the senior notes 
management does not believe that these limitations unduly restrict the company s operations or limit orion s ability to pay dividends on its stock 
at december  the company was in compliance with the terms of its senior note indentures 
management believes that the company continues to have substantial sources of capital and liquidity from the capital markets and bank borrowings 
on december   orion called for redemption its preferred stock on january  the market price of the shares of common stock that a holder would receive upon conversion of the preferred stock was substantially higher than the redemption price of per share
