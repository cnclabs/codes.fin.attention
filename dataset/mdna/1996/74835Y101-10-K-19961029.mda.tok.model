following the ipo  the company for the first time had sufficient capital to expand its research and development activities  begin preparation of the inds and conduct related clinical activities 
in addition  the company incurred substantial costs associated with being a public company 
accordingly  research and development  clinical and regulatory and general and administrative costs increased substantially over the prior fiscal yealiquidity and capital resources the company has principally funded its activities to date through its initial public offering ipo in november  in which it raised net proceeds of  subsequent exercises of its redeemable class a warrants in and early  which raised  exercises by the underwriter of the ipo of its unit purchase options and the redeemable class a warrants within such options  which raised  that it had received as part of its compensation for the ipo and a private placement of mandatorily convertible notes during july  which raised  through the issuance of  units  each comprising a share of common stock  a redeemable class a warrant class a warrant and a redeemable class b warrant class b warrant 
in october  the company received proceeds of  from the exercise of bridge warrants for  shares of common stock the bridge warrant exercise which had been issued in connection with a bridge loan to the company prior to the ipo 
from december to march  the company conducted a special program designed to encourage holders of class a warrants to exercise their warrants immediately the class a warrant program in order to provide the company with additional working capital prior to commencing clinical testing 
the holders of the class a warrants were offered one half of a class b warrant and shares of common stock upon exercise of each class a warrant at an adjusted price of equal to of the original exercise price of 
this program resulted in the company s receipt of net proceeds of  from the exercise of  class a warrants and the company s issuance of  shares of common stock and  class b warrants 
at july   the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of  compared to  compared to  at july  the period to period increase was principally due to the private placement of convertible notesbridge warrant exercise and the 
this factor also contributed to the increase in working capital at july  to  compared to  compared to  at july  the company expects that its cash needs will increase significantly in future periods due to expansion of its research and development programs  increased clinical testing activity  growth of administrative  clinical and laboratory staff and their related equipment and space needs 
the companymanagement believes that the company s working capital will be sufficient to fund the operations of the company for approximately months dependent  in part  on the timing of the commencement of each phase of the clinical trials on cpc and cpc and the funding priorities that it gives its various research programs  the results of clinical tests and research programs  competing technological and market developments  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals and in obtaining  maintaining and enforcing patents  the cost of product acquisitions and their resulting cash flows and other factors 
estimates that its existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and the income from the phase ii sbir grant will be sufficient to meet the company s cash needs for at least the next months 
accordingly  the company will need to raise substantial additional funds to continue development and commercialization of its products 
the company s future cash requirements will be affected by results of research and development programs and clinical testing  competing technological and market developments  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals and in obtaining  maintaining and enforcing patents  success in obtaining additional grants and other factors 
the company expects to seek additional funds through exercises of its currently outstanding options and warrants  public or private equity financings  and collaborations or from other sourceswith corporate partners 
there can be no assurance that funds can be obtained on desirable terms or at all 
the company may seek to raise additional capital whenever conditions in the financial markets are favorable  even if the company does not have an immediate need for additional cash at that time
