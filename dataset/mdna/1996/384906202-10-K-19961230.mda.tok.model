item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general there is considerable risk in any mining venture  and there can be no assurance that the company s operations will be successful or profitable 
from inception of the company to september   the company has an accumulated deficit of  exploration for commercially minable ore deposits is highly speculative and involves risks greater than those involved in the discovery of mineralization 
mining companies use the evaluation work of professional geologists  geophysicists and engineers in determining whether to acquire an interest in a specific property  or whether or not to commence exploration or developmental work 
these professional evaluations are not always scientifically exact  and in some instances result in the expenditure of substantial amounts of money on a property before it is possible to make a final determination as to whether or not the property contains economically minable ore bodies 
the economic viability of a property can not be finally determined until extensive exploration and development work plus a detailed economic feasibility study have been performed 
also  the market prices for mineralization produced are subject to fluctuation and uncertainty  which may negatively affect the economic viability of properties on which expenditures have been made 
as of september    of the company s total assets of  are investments in mineral properties for which additional exploration is required to determine if they contain ore reserves that are economically recoverable 
the realization of these investments is dependent upon the success of future property sales  the existence of economically recoverable reserves  the ability of the company to obtain financing or make other arrangements for development  and upon future profitable production 
the ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time  and  accordingly  no provision for any asset impairment which may result in the event the company is not successful in developing or selling these properties has been made in the company s consolidated financial statements 
financial condition 
at september   the company had a positive cash balance of  and accounts receivable of  of which  was collected subsequent to year end  and positive working capital of  subsequent to september   the company received an additional  from the sale of common shares 
these funds will be used for future operating expenses 
the company s long term debt is in the form of equipment leases 
liquidity and capital resources 
in comparison with its financial condition at september   the company had  at september    of cash  accounts receivable of  and negative working capital of  as in fiscal  manage ment determined for fiscal that it would be in the best interests of the company to limit the private placement of common stock 
the  receivable at september   and the  receivable at september   were for routine items due the company 
prepaid mining leases decreased primarily due to a net relinquishment of leased mineral properties 
mineral properties  however  increased from  at september   to  at september   as a result of investments in  and the acquisition and exploration of  properties and equity investments in cash 
accounts payable decreased from  as of september   to  as of september   primarily because of management s efforts to reduce expenses 
the accrued expenses payable increased from  as of september  to  as of september  for fiscal  this expense item was the result of an accrual for directors fees and em ployees salaries  for fiscal  this expense item was the result of the accrual of employees salaries  associated taxes and workers compensation insurance 
directors fee shares are issued only upon the fulfillment of cer tain conditions  but the fees are recorded on the company s books at the earliest time that fees could become due  even though all of the conditions may not be met until a later date 
the amount of cash used by the company s operations decreased from  for fiscal  to  for fiscal this decrease is primarily the result of a significant increase in the amount of other income thereby reducing the net loss for fiscal also  the amount of cash used by the company on acquisition and exploration of mineral properties increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this increase primarily is due to the acquisition of certain field and exploration equipment  whose purchase allows company personnel to perform necessary exploration work with less dependence upon the availability of outside equipment and at a lower cost to the company 
the company expended  in fiscal and  in fiscal  to acquire equipment 
the company funded its cash expenditures primarily by issuing common shares for cash in the amount of  in fiscal  and  in fiscal as in fiscal  the company expended in fiscal to acquire interests in subsidiary companies

during the years ended september  and  the company received advances from a shareholder of  and  respectively  and made payments of  and  respectively  on those advances 
management expects the company s consolidated cash expenditures will approximate  during fiscal the anticipated cash expenditures consist of the following  for exploration and development activities   for production related activities   for acquisition of mineral properties   for property lease payments  and  for general and administrative expenses 
these cash expenditures are expected to be primarily funded from  from the sale of properties   of production income   from the partial liquidation of royal common stock  and  from joint venture partners 
at september   the company had working capital of  the company also contemplates financing further exploration of its mineral properties through joint venture arrangements 
the company s long term debt is partially related to the lease of equipment that was acquired during fiscal the other multi year obligations of the company are note payments on mining claims the company has purchased  payments on mining claim leases that are cancelable at the company s option  and a long term debt obligation to a related company 
moreover  if the company is not successful in raising additional equity capital  achieving production profitability  selling some of its mineral properties  or negotiating joint venture arrangements  the company will reduce the level of expenditures by releasing some properties to match its cash flow position 
the company does not have sufficient capital to fully explore and develop its mineral properties 
the company plans to continue financing its exploration activities through joint ventures  production activities  equity funding  or by selling properties and retaining royalty interests 
in addition  the company expects to receive royalties from properties that were sold during fiscal and which currently are under exploration and development by larger mining companies 
results of operations fiscal as compared to fiscal during fiscal and the company had no revenues 
centurion did not receive advance mineral royalties or reimbursements related to venture properties 
no properties were sold in fiscal or  therefore  there was no corresponding cost of mineral properties sold 
general and administrative expenses increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase primarily is the result of the increase in personnel and payroll expense

office leasing costs increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  due to the requirement for additional office space during fiscal the costs for office and technical supplies and of producing the company s annual report decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  primarily as a result of cost cutting policies implemented by management of the company 
legal expenses decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  primarily because fewer mineral properties and companies were acquired in fiscal than in  thereby reducing the legal fees and costs

centurion did not receive advance mineral royalties or reimbursements related to venture properties 
no properties were sold in fiscal or  therefore  there was no corresponding cost of mineral properties sold
