the increase is a result of recovery in the general economic conditions in the southwest and the expansion of business along the pacific coast region

industry wide sales of asbestos abatement products are expected to remain relatively flat in however  the company s sales and share of the asbestos abatement market are expected to continue to increase primarily because of the marketplace s recognition of the company as a reliable and stable supplier 
several of the company s competitors have ceased operations or significantly reduced their presence over recent years in the company s geographic locations 
spending on asbestos abatement has dropped in the us over the past several years due largely to the lack of full recovery in the commercial real estate industry 
concerns raised about the comparative health risks of removing asbestos and the costs related to such removal  as opposed to leaving it in place  also have resulted in the delay or cancellation of some projects

sales to the hazardous materials remediation  industrial safety and construction tools supply markets are increasing both in absolute amounts and as a percentage of revenues to the company
