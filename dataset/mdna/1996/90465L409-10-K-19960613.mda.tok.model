the company believes that the cash generated from increased profitability together with borrowings  if necessary  will be sufficient to meet its working capital needs both on a short and long term basis 
however  the company s capital needs will depend on many factors  including the company s ability to maintain the upward trend of profitable operations  the need to develop and improve products  and various other factors 
depending on its working capital requirements  the company may seek additional financing through debt or equity offerings in the private or public markets at any time 
the company s ability to obtain additional financing will depend on its results of operations  financial condition and business prospects  as well as conditions then prevailing in the relevant capital markets 
seasonality and inflation the company s operations have not proven to be significantly seasonal  although quarterly revenues and net income could be expected to vary 
although the company cannot accurately determine the amounts attributable thereto  the company has been affected by inflation through increased costs of employee compensation and other operating expenses 
the company believes that these have not had a material effect on the company s operations or its financial condition
