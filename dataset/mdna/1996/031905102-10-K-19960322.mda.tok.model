return on average shareholders equity return on average capital employed consolidated net income for was  million  compared with  million and  million for and  respectively 
year to year comparisons in net income were affected by the significant unusual items that are summarized in the table below incr 
decr 
net income millions of dollars impairment gains on dispositions crude oil excise tax settlement restructuring accruals environmental provisions 
tax obligations and other 
included in earnings were non cash charges of million associated with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
requires long lived assets with recorded values that are not expected to be recovered through future cash flows to be written down to current fair value

adversely affecting earnings were charges of million associated with amoco s restructuring of operations  and provisions for future environmental remediation expenditures relating to past operations totaling million 
excluding unusual items for all periods  earnings would have been  million  up percent from earnings of  million  earnings would have been about the same as the increase in results of operations primarily represented higher chemical earnings resulting from both higher volumes and margins across most product lines  and strong exploration and production e p earnings overseas 
these strong results  as well as continuing efficiency improvements throughout the organization  more than offset lower us petroleum product margins and lower north american natural gas prices 
sales and other operating revenues totaled billion in the percent increase in revenues primarily resulted from increased chemical product revenues  which were up percent  reflecting higher volumes and prices for most product lines 
natural gas revenues were lower in by percent  primarily reflecting lower north american prices 
total costs and expenses increased percent in operating expenses were down million compared with  after adjusting operating expenses for restructuring charges of million related to various facility closings and asset dispositions 
in  expense reductions resulting from restructuring efforts more than offset increased costs to support expanded chemical activities and higher planned and unplanned refinery maintenance expenses

included in results were charges of million for impairment of long lived oil and gas producing properties associated with the adoption of a new accounting standard 
under this method  these properties are evaluated by individual field  previously an aggregated approach was used 
the earnings benefited from the crude oil excise tax coet settlement of million  offset by restructuring charges of million 
excluding these items from both periods  e p earnings for were million  compared with million for the decline in earnings primarily resulted from lower us natural gas prices  and higher exploration expenses  which increased by million over partly offsetting were higher crude oil prices and lower operating expenses 
amoco s us natural gas prices averaged approximately per thousand cubic feet mcf in  down about 
per mcf from reflecting increased industry supplies 
amoco s us crude oil prices averaged per barrel for  up about per barrel over us crude oil prices began the year at per barrel and increased gradually through the first six months of  fluctuated downward over the latter part of the year  before increasing slightly at year end 
us natural gas production averaged billion cubic feet per day in  about the same as in crude oil and natural gas liquids ngl production averaged  barrels per day in  also level with  as higher ngl production offset declining crude oil production 
canada canadian exploration and production operations  which include supply and marketing of ngl  earned million in  compared with restated earnings of million in and million in the decrease in earnings primarily resulted from impairment charges of million  lower natural gas prices  which averaged 
per mcf  
per mcf below levels  and lower crude oil production reflecting property dispositions 
also adversely affecting results was unfavorable currency effects of million 
partly offsetting were higher crude oil prices  up per barrel over  an increase in supply and marketing earnings on the strength of higher ngl margins  and lower operating expenses 
natural gas production averaged million cubic feet mmcf per day in  percent above crude oil and ngl production declined percent to  barrels per day in overseas european exploration and production operations earned million in compared with restated losses of million and million in and  respectively 
the improvement in earnings over reflected lower exploration expenses of million before tax  and a reduction in operating expenses 
also favorably affecting results were higher crude oil and natural gas prices 
average crude oil prices increased about per barrel over while average natural gas prices were up percent to per mcf 
gains on property dispositions in added about million to results  approximately million lower than production  on an energy equivalent basis  increased slightly as higher natural gas production more than offset a percent decline in crude oil and ngl production 
exploration and production operations in other overseas areas earned million in this compared with restated earnings of million in and a restated loss of million in higher energy prices and lower expenses contributed to the improvement in earnings 
also  performance benefited from a gain of million related to the divestment of congo operations and the absence of a charge of million associated with the relinquishment of the myanmar concession 
natural gas production increased percent in to mmcf per day  as a result of higher production in sharjah 
crude and ngl production averaged  barrels per day in  essentially level with vs 
us exploration and production operations earned million in compared with million in adversely affecting earnings were lower energy prices and lower crude oil production volumes

in the near term  amoco expects to be operating in a crude oil and natural gas price environment that will be relatively flat  reflecting adequate supplies 
us and canadian natural gas production levels are expected to remain approximately at levels 
overseas natural gas production is expected to increase modestly in in the united states  crude oil and ngl production is expected to remain at levels with additional ngl production offsetting lower crude oil production as natural field decline offsets new development efforts 
outside the united states  increased heavy oil production in canada and initial production from the liuhua oil field in the south china sea  which is expected to begin in april  should benefit crude oil production by an average of more than  barrels per day 
amoco will continue to benefit from both past and ongoing cost reduction programs 
amoco will also continue to evaluate and divest marginal properties and underperforming assets 
as recently announced  amoco and shell oil company plan to form a partnership combining exploration and production assets in the greater permian basin area of west texas and southeast new mexico

included in results were after tax charges totaling million related to estimated future cost of environmental remediation activities  and million for restructuring related activity 
refining expenses decreased in  with savings from restructuring efforts more than offsetting expenses associated with higher planned and unplanned refinery maintenance 
marketing expenses increased  largely resulting from major marketing initiatives  including same price  cash or credit pricing method for gasoline 
the refinery utilization rate in averaged percent  down percentage points from  reflecting the higher refinery maintenance 
petroleum product sales volumes averaged  barrels per day in  about the same as gasoline sales averaged  barrels per day and distillates averaged  barrels per day  both about the same as in vs 
in  petroleum products operations earned million compared with million for the decrease in primarily resulted from lower petroleum product selling prices  which decreased cents per gallon in a very competitive us market 
also adversely affecting earnings were environmental remediation charges of million and restructuring expenses of million 
included in earnings were unusual items favorably affecting results by million 
outlook the petroleum products industry is faced with both significant challenges and opportunities 
profitability is affected by crude oil price volatility and overall industry supply demand balance 
amoco anticipates weak refining margins in the near term

the combination of favorable supply and demand factors has caused exceptional growth in polyester leading to high growth in pta and px 
pta s average annual growth is expected to be percent over the next decade  with the largest demand growth expected to be in the asia pacific region 
to pursue these marketing opportunities  amoco is planning pta expansions at wholly owned and joint venture facilities in south carolina  belgium  malaysia and indonesia 
also  amoco s joint ventures in mexico and brazil are increasing capacity through debottlenecking 
when these projects are completed in  amoco will own or share in a pta manufacturing capacity of about million metric tons  an increase of about percent from year end worldwide px demand is expected to grow about percent per year in the near term

also  at december   the corporation had fixed the future sales price of million barrels of crude oil and trillion british thermal units of natural gas using futures contracts and swaps 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
environmental protection and remediation costs the corporation has provided in its accounts for the reasonably estimable future costs of probable environmental remediation obligations 
these amounts relate to various refining and marketing sites  chemical locations  and oil and gas operations  including multiparty sites at which amoco has been identified as a potentially responsible party by the us environmental protection agency 
such estimated costs will be refined over time as remediation requirements and regulations become better defined 
however  any additional costs cannot be reasonably estimated at this time due to uncertainty of timing  the magnitude of contamination  future technology  regulatory changes and other factors 
although future costs could be significant  they are not expected to be material in relation to amoco s liquidity or consolidated financial position 
in total  the accrued liability represents a reasonable best estimate of amoco s remediation liability 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the corporation and its subsidiaries maintain insurance coverage for environmental pollution resulting from the sudden and accidental release of pollutants 
various deductibles of up to million per occurrence could apply  depending on the type of incident involved

amoco s estimated capital spending for environmental cleanup and protection projects is expected to be approximately million  spending for remediation in is expected to approximate the level 
millions of dollars capital and exploration expenditures exploration and production united states  canada europe other subtotal      petroleum products 
chemicals corporate and other operations total      petroleum exploration expenditures charged to income included above united states canada europe other total through restated to conform to the new reporting basis 
capital and exploration expenditures spending in totaled billion  an increase of percent over the billion spent in capital and exploration expenditures of billion have been approved for  an increase of percent over spending 
approximately percent of e p spending will target international locations 
significant spending in includes construction of a liquefied natural gas plant in trinidad and continuation of programs in egypt and the north sea 
chemicals expenditures are expected to be approximately billion  with the majority for expansions or new facilities in indonesia  malaysia  singapore  belgium  and the united states 
it is anticipated that the capital and exploration expenditures budget will be financed primarily by funds generated internally 
the planned expenditure level is subject to adjustment as changing economic and worldwide political conditions may dictate
