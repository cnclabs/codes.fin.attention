item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following is management s assessment of the company s financial condition and a discussion of the principal factors that affect consolidated results of operations for the years  and earnings and dividends per share results for were up over  despite the negative impact of warm weather on residential and commercial consumption 
warm weather during the heating season negatively impacted net earnings by an estimated per share 
earnings and dividends in thousands except per share data net income    net income per share dividends per share average shares outstanding    per share net earnings for were reduced by non recurring costs of for interstate pipeline capacity to serve oregon customers and for revaluation of certain non operating assets 
warmer than normal temperatures also affected the comparison to  when temperatures were colder than normal 
the warmer than normal temperatures impacted per share net earnings by an estimated 
residential and commercial operating margin residential and commercial operating margin dollars in thousands degree days    average customers residential    commercial    consumption per customer residential commercial    margin residential    commercial    the average number of residential and commercial customers increased by  in which contributed approximately million of additional operating margin 
the rate of customer growth is down from the increase of  due primarily to a general slow down of economic activity in much of the service area 
consumption per customer for was down for residential and for commercial from the reductions were directly attributable to weather  warmer than normal in november  and warmer than normal in december 
the weather resulted in declines of for residential consumption and for commercial consumption in the key fourth quarter heating months 
eliminating the effects of weather  estimated consumption per customer for the year would have been approximately therms for residential and  therms for commercial 
normalized residential consumption levels remain consistent over the last three years because additional natural gas equipment  such as water heaters converted from electricity are offsetting the effects of more energy efficient buildings and appliances 
non core industrial non core industrial operating margin was million in  an increase of million  or 
the increase is attributable to the start up in june of a new cogeneration plant at an existing customer site and increased throughput to a broad spectrum of industrial customers 
operating margins in increased million over primarily as a result of service to a new cogeneration customer beginning in april a fifth cogeneration plant is expected to begin receiving distribution service from cascade in the first quarter of operating expenses operating expenses  almost of which are payroll and benefits costs  increased over by  or 
the increase is due primarily to a december  enhancement in retirement plan benefits to bring benefits up to industry norm 
there was also an increase in lease expense reflecting the use of operating leases beginning in for certain vehicles formerly purchased 
mitigating the expense increase was the company s ability to maintain a stable number of employees in the face of strong  continuing customer growth 
another moderating factor was the increase in payroll capitalized due to increased capital expenditures 
operating expenses in were up over by 
payroll and benefits costs account for of this increase  with the largest factor being additional payroll cost of  this upward movement is the result of general salary and wage increases  the addition of employees as of the end of the year  and a reduction in payroll expense capitalized resulting from lower capital expenditures in employee medical benefits expense increased over due to adverse claims experience 
depreciation and amortization  property and payroll taxes depreciation and amortization were up in over the increase is due to higher depreciable plant consistent with an increase in utility plant 
property and payroll taxes were essentially unchanged from due to a reduction in property tax rates stemming from a voter mandated reduction in oregon 
this reduction in property taxes is reflected in oregon rates 
depreciation and amortization expense in  along with property and payroll taxes  were up over a total of million  or  primarily because of increases in plant and equipment 
interest expense and other interest expense in was million  or higher than of this increase  million is due to million of additional long term debt issued in october the remainder of the increase is due to interest on credits for lower gas costs deferred for pass back to customers  discontinuance of interest rate swaps amortized over the term of the underlying debt agreement  and interest on customer deposits 
interest expense for increased million over due to an increase of million in the amount of debt outstanding 
other expense for includes charges of  for revaluation of certain non operating assets 
liquidity and capital resources the seasonal nature of the company s business creates short term cash requirements to finance customer accounts receivable and construction expenditures 
to provide working capital for these requirements  the company entered into a new year credit agreement on september   for a commitment of million from three banks which replaces two separate commitments that totaled million 
the committed lines also support a money market facility of a similar amount 
a subsidiary has a million revolving credit facility used for non regulated business  which expires in  and at december   million was outstanding under the facility 
the company also has million of uncommitted lines from three banks 
the company has a medium term note program used for long term financing with million outstanding at december   and million registered under the securities act of and available for issuance 
because of the availability of short term credit and the ability to issue long term debt and additional equity  management is of the opinion it has adequate financial flexibility to meet its anticipated cash needs 
capital expenditures capital expenditures dollars in thousands capital expenditures    operating cash flow    dividends paid    redemption of preferred available cash flow    internally funded expenditures available cash flow increased in  primarily due to increased net earnings  lower gas costs and a reduction in accounts receivable to a level approximating these lower gas costs will be refunded to customers beginning in budgeted expenditures for will approximate million and will be financed to from operating cash flow net of common and preferred dividends 
over the next five years it is expected that capital expenditures will be close to million 
in addition to internally generated cash  the company s cash flow is enhanced from monthly sales of common stock to participants of the dividend reinvestment plan and employees in the company s k plan 
cash in flow from these sources was million in  million in and  in the significant increase from to reflects opening the dividend reinvestment plan in to customers wishing to invest in cascade stock 
financing plans for include the possible private placement of million of preferred stock in the first half of the year and issuance of to million common shares later in the year 
proceeds from these financings will be used to retire short term debt and for other general corporate purposes 
the method  timing and amount of these and any future financings by the company will depend on a variety of factors  including capitalization ratios  coverage ratios  interest costs  the state of the capital markets and general economic conditions 
effects of inflation changing prices have had minimal impact on the company s operating margins in the last three years 
the effects of price changes in purchased gas costs and the cost of transporting gas to the company s system are  for the most part  passed on to customers in accordance with regulatory policy 
inflationary increases in wages and other operating expenses are generally recognized by the regulatory agencies in their rate decisions in general rate filings 
regulatory matters since june  the company has engaged in a negotiation process with the staff of the wutc and other interested parties  to establish new rates for washington customers 
on december  cascade filed a formal request for a general rate increase  incorporating the results of agreements reached to date with the staff 
negotiations continue regarding remaining revenue level  rate spread and rate design issues 
under normal weather conditions  the annual revenue increase from the requested rates  if granted in full  would be million  a increase 
also included in the filing proposal are changes to the design of residential and commercial rates which would increase monthly service charges and per therm commodity rates for the first fifty therms of gas used each month  and decrease commodity rates for use in excess of fifty therms 
the higher monthly service charge would be applied to residential customers during winter months only 
commercial customers would experience a higher service charge throughout the year 
this rate structure would  if approved by the wutc  minimize the impact of cyclical weather on bills  and would reduce financial hardship experienced by residential and commercial customers as the result of extremely cold weather 
on december  cascade filed two additional applications with the wutc to lower rates to customers 
the first request  which passes through to customers reductions in the company s costs of purchased gas  is estimated to reduce annual revenues by million or 
the second application requests a pass through to customers  over a two year period  of million in gas cost savings and other deferred balances 
it is estimated that this application will reduce annual revenues by million  or 
on january   the company withdrew both applications in order to allow time to work with the wutc staff on its review of the filings 
it is the company s intent to re file the applications after any questions raised by the staff are satisfied  with a desire to have these filings go into effect at the same time as the general rate increase 
it is not known when the rate changes will be approved by the wutc 
effective december   the opuc approved an order allowing cascade to decrease rates approximately million or 
about million of this decrease is associated with current purchased gas costs applicable to oregon 
the remainder of the decrease relates to the amortization of conventional deferred revenue and gas cost amounts 
environmental the company has provided approximately  for cleanup costs associated with contamination in the area of the company s underground storage tanks at its sunnyside  washington office 
it is expected that any additional costs will not be significant 
the company has been notified of a claim regarding contamination of a former manufactured gas site in oregon once operated by a predecessor company 
at this date it appears that contamination is present at the site  but there is no estimate of the extent of clean up costs 
to the extent the company may be responsible for any portion of such costs  it will seek contribution from other responsible parties  recovery from its insurers and appropriate rate relief
