item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the information in this item contains forward looking statements 
the company desires to take advantage of the safe harbor which is afforded such statements under the private securities litigation reform act of when they are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statement identifying important factors that could cause results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
such cautionary statements are set forth under the heading important information regarding forward looking below in this item the discussion contained in this item should be read in connection with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes elsewhere in this form k 
in all periods discussed herein  the company s fiscal year ended on september general during the periods discussed below  the company s results of operations and financial condition have been affected by two acquisitions 
the first acquisition occurred in november when the company acquired the stock of autoworks for approximately million 
at the time  autoworks operated retail automotive parts stores principally in the midwest 
the second acquisition occurred on september  when the company acquired meisenzahl  through a tax free stock exchange 
meisenzahl operated three direct distribution centers in western new york 
for a further description of the acquisitions  see footnote of the consolidated financial statements 
on october   the company acquired a former customer with four direct distribution centers which operate in the rochester  new york area the total purchase price was million  of which the company paid  in cash and the balance with deferred payments 
the cash portion of the purchase price was financed with borrowings under the company s new credit facility described in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
these centers will be integrated into the company s direct distribution center division 
results of operation fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales for fiscal declined million  or  from the prior fiscal year to million 
the decline is attributable to a drop in autoworks net sales which was substantially offset by net sales increases of at the direct distribution centers  at the advantage auto stores and at the full service distribution centers 
the direct distribution net sales increase resulted from the addition of two direct distribution centers since the beginning of fiscal and a increase in comparable location sales from the previous fiscal year 
growth in advantage auto stores net sales resulted from four stores opened since the beginning of fiscal which was offset to a certain extent by four store closings during fiscal and a comparable store sales increase 
full service distribution center sales grew by over fiscal as a result of additional unit sales 
the autoworks sales decline is principally due to net store closings and a comparable store sales decrease primarily as the result of increased competition in certain markets  both of which were offset to a certain extent by increased selling prices 
gross profit for fiscal was million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales for fiscal gross profit expressed as a percentage of net sales grew as the result of increased sales prices at autoworks  purchasing economies  and to a lesser extent  the changing sales mix ie  increase of advantage auto store sales which generally carry a higher gross margin than full service distribution center sales 
selling  general and administrative expense decreased million from million in fiscal  or of net sales  to million  or of net sales  in fiscal the dollar decrease is primarily attributable to reduced autoworks net sales and the company s expense reduction program  which was partially offset by expenses incurred in the closing  relocating  remodeling and opening of autoworks and advantage auto stores 
the expense ratio decrease is generally attributable to the company s expense reduction program 
the company plans subject to debt service and other funding needs to open during fiscal autoworks stores  additional direct distribution centers and advantage auto stores where there are opportunities in geographical areas in which the company operates 
although the company expects to incur additional expense related to these additions  such costs are not expected to have any significant impact on the overall company 
any costs associated with the additions are expected to be equaled or exceeded within the year by the increased gross profit generated from sales of these new locations 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased  for fiscal from the previous fiscal year 
this decrease is attributable to the company s increased use of operating leases for replacements of fixed assets  such as vehicles and computers  the use of operating leases has resulted from the annual capital expenditure limitation imposed by the company s new credit facility discussed under the liquidity and capital resources heading below 
the company expects this trend to continue in fiscal and result in additional selling  general and administrative expenses  however  these expenses should be offset to a certain extent by a decrease in depreciation expense 
income from operations for fiscal increased million from million  or of net sales in fiscal  to million  or of net sales in fiscal on a segment basis  the company s wholesale business ie  full service distribution centers  direct distribution centers and advantage auto stores had an operating profit of million  while the retail business ie  autoworks had an operating loss of million 
wholesale operating profits dropped million primarily as a result of increased corporate expenses and the expiration of incentive programs for newly opened direct distribution centers  retail operating losses decreased by million as a result of the factors discussed above  including the autoworks re engineering plan 
interest expense was million for both fiscal years 
average borrowings outstanding under the company s revolving credit facility were slightly lower in fiscal  this was offset by slightly higher interest rates during the fourth quarter of fiscal as discussed under liquidity and capital resources below  the rates for the new revolving credit facility vary according to company s debt coverage ratio 
interest expense for fiscal is expected to increase next year as a result of higher rates and increased borrowings 
income taxes for fiscal were million compared to a benefit of  for fiscal the unusual relationship between the tax expense for and the tax refund for is due to taxes being payable in certain states despite the company s net loss for fiscal as a result of the factors discussed above  for fiscal  the company had a net profit of million  or 
per share  which compares favorably to the last fiscal year s net loss of million  or 
per share 
earnings per share and weighted average of shares outstanding as of september  and  and for each of the quarters presented  have been restated to reflect the stock dividends to shareholders of record on april  and this dividend was distributed on may of both years 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales for fiscal increased million or over the prior fiscal year to million 
the increase is primarily attributable to the million of net sales added by five direct distribution centers acquired or opened during the fiscal year  with the balance resulting from a increase in autoworks store sales and a increase in advantage auto store sales 
these increases were offset by a drop in full service distribution centers sales  which resulted mainly from the loss of meisenzahl sales after the company acquired the former customer 
autoworks sales increased on a year over year basis solely as the result of autoworks being operated for the entire year  rather than only months as occurred in fiscal on an annualized basis  autoworks sales dropped by from fiscal  primarily as the result of net store closings  increased competition in certain markets and the dramatic swing from the harsh winter to the mild winter 
temperature extremes tend to enhance sales by causing a higher incidence of parts failure and increasing sales of seasonal products  while mild weather tends to depress sales 
gross profit for fiscal was million  or of net sales  compared with million or of net sales for fiscal the dollar increase is attributable to the overall net sales increase discussed above  while both the dollar and the percentage increases are due to the change in sales mix ie  the addition of higher margin sales from the direct distribution centers and the advantage auto stores and purchasing economies achieved with the autoworks and meisenzahl acquisitions 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million from million in fiscal  or of net sales to million  or of net sales in fiscal the dollar increase resulted from the five new direct distribution centers  while the percentage increase is primarily due to the addition of operations with higher expense ratios including autoworks for the full fiscal year 
the increases are also due to one time charges incurred with closing  opening  relocating  and remodeling autoworks stores 
depreciation and amortization expense increased  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase is due to the addition of fixed assets from the autoworks and meisenzahl acquisitions 
autoworks fixed assets and corresponding depreciation were present for the entire fiscal year compared to months for fiscal the meisenzahl fixed assets and corresponding depreciation were not present during fiscal income from operations decreased to million for fiscal or of net sales from million for fiscal or of net sales 
on a segment basis  the wholesale business had income from operations of million and the retail business incurred a loss from operations of million 
interest expense increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the higher interest expense resulted from meisenzahl s million of debt  carrying the autoworks million acquisition debt for an entire fiscal year compared to months during the last fiscal year  higher average borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility and generally higher interest rates 
the net loss of million for fiscal or 
per share compared unfavorably to a net profit of million for fiscal or 
per share 
the fiscal net loss is due to the factors discussed above 
earnings per share and weighted average shares outstanding as of september  and  and for each of the quarters presented  have been restated to reflect a stock dividend to shareholders of record on april  this stock dividend was distributed on may  fiscal year compared to fiscal year fiscal s net sales of million were significantly higher than fiscal net sales of million 
of this increase  approximately million is attributable to the autoworks stores acquired on november   million to advantage auto stores and the remaining 
million to full service distribution centers 
sales increases at both the jobbing stores and the full service distribution centers arose principally from increased unit sales 
at the distribution center level  sales increases were offset  in part  by the conversion of the company s baltimore facility from a full service distribution center to a pick up distribution center early in fiscal and the discontinuance of the company s battery distribution centers in the third quarter of fiscal during fiscal  gross profit increased million  or  from million in the previous fiscal year to million in fiscal gross profit expressed as a percentage of net sales grew from in the previous fiscal year to for fiscal the addition of autoworks during fiscal contributed significantly to this increase  both in terms of dollars and gross profit percentage 
autoworks retail store sales generally carry a higher gross profit percentage than full service distribution center sales 
to a lesser extent  the gross profit improvement resulted from actions taken by management using increased purchasing power that resulted from the autoworks acquisition  to reduce overall costs of merchandise from suppliers 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased million to million in the fiscal year  and increased to of net sales during fiscal in comparison to for the previous fiscal year 
these increases are primarily attributable to the addition of autoworks sales  which have higher expense ratios 
depreciation and amortization increased from the fiscal year to million in the fiscal year 
this increase was primarily caused by the autoworks acquisition and  to some extent  the increasing costs of replacing delivery vehicles for the advantage auto stores and the full service distribution centers 
income from operations was million or of net sales for fiscal  compared to million  or of net sales for the prior fiscal year 
although profitable in fiscal  as a percentage of net sales  autoworks had a dilutive effect on operating income 
of the million of operating income  the wholesale business contributed million  or of net sales and the retail business contributed million  or of net sales 
interest expense increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase results primarily from additional financing incurred to acquire and operate autoworks and to a lesser extent  the increases in interest rates during the last half of the fiscal year 
net income increased  or from million of pro forma net income in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase resulted from the factors discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  operating activities generated net cash of million  resulting from net earnings adjusted for non cash items including depreciation and bad debt of million being reduced by an increase in long term notes receivable and other deferred assets 
the increase in long term receivables and other deferred assets resulted primarily from hahn s investment in the pinros automotive spare parts joint venture and certain financing costs 
for fiscal  operating activities consumed million of net cash  principally resulting from a million increase in the company s working capital from the previous fiscal year end  which was partially offset by net earnings adjusted for non cash items of million 
increases in working capital resulted mainly from the autoworks and meisenzahl acquisition and the opening of three new direct distribution centers since the beginning of fiscal  all of which was offset by moderate inventory and accounts receivables reductions and accounts payables increases during the fourth quarter of fiscal in fiscal  operating activities used million of net cash  reflecting primarily a million payment to autoworks vendors in connection with the termination of an extended payment program  which was partially offset by net earnings adjusted for non cash items of million 
as of the fiscal year end  working capital increased million due almost entirely to the autoworks and meisenzahl acquisitions 
investing activities consist mainly of routine capital expenditures for delivery vehicles  computer equipment and store and warehouse fixtures  and periodically  for distribution center  jobbing store and other acquisitions 
capital expenditures were million  million  and million excluding the autoworks acquisition in each of the last three fiscal years 
during fiscal  the company invested million net of cash acquired in the acquisition of autoworks 
this acquisition lead to a slight increases in routine capital expenditures during fiscal in the absence of additional acquisitions  the company anticipates capital expenditures during fiscal to be million together with the purchase incurred in the acquisition of the four direct distribution centers discussed above under the heading general 
financing activities for fiscal consumed million of net cash and  for fiscal and provided million and million of cash  respectively 
funds consumed during fiscal generally reflect the paydown of long term debt which was partially offset by net borrowings on the company s revolving credit facility and the futermans subordinated debt  referred to below 
funds from financing activities generally represent net borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility and are used to finance working capital growth  capital expenditures and payments due under the company s senior secured notes and capital leases 
in fiscal  the company obtained a million term loan to fund the autoworks acquisition  the company refinanced this term loan with proceeds from the company s new credit facility described below 
during fiscal  the company funded the acquisition of new computer hardware and software for autoworks through a five year operating lease with monthly payments of  each  the operating lease is cross defaulted to the company s credit facility 
the company expects in the future to make small strategic acquisitions and during fiscal to open new direct distribution centers in addition to the four direct distribution centers acquired in october  advantage auto stores and new autoworks stores  in each case to the extent that its debt service and other funding needs permit 
the company s ability to continue to open new direct distribution centers will depend on the company s ability to negotiate extended payment terms from vendors  which initially minimizes additional working capital requirements 
the company believes that it will be able to continue to obtain such financing  but there is no assurance of this 
the company plans to continue implementing the autoworks re engineering plan  which includes increasing the number of skus maintained at  or available to  each autoworks store  improving inventory management  marketing and merchandising strategies and opening  closing and or relocating non performing stores 
this initiative will require additional working capital and capital expenditures and is subject to the company s debt service and other funding needs 
on june   the company  its operating subsidiaries  and a lending syndicate the syndicate banks led by fleet bank fleet entered into a new credit facility agreement credit facility  the proceeds of which were used to refinance the existing bank debt of the company and its subsidiaries 
the credit facility provides for a million subject to a borrowing base formula revolving credit facility which matures in june as of december   the company had outstanding loans of million  leaving availability of million under the credit facility 
loans made pursuant to the credit facility accrue interest at a variable rate 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  the company entered into an interest rate cap agreement to hedge interest costs and risks associated with variable interest rates 
the agreement covers of the maximum borrowings under the credit facility and establishes a maximum prime rate of for prime rate borrowings  making the variable prime rate borrowings fixed rate debt subject to adjustment based on the company s debt coverage ratios 
the aggregate notional principal amount covered by the agreement is million  all of which matures simultaneously with the maturity of borrowings under the credit facility 
the agreement s counterparty is one of the syndicate banks and a credit loss from the counterparty nonperformance is not expected 
the company s obligations under the credit facility are secured by substantially all of the assets of the company and its subsidiaries 
the company and its subsidiaries are subject to customary secured lending covenants  including restrictions on additional liens  additional indebtedness  sale of assets  payment of dividends  affiliate transactions  certain loans  investments  acquisitions and fundamentals corporate changes including changes to the futerman s stockholdings that would result in the futermans no longer having effective voting control over the company 
the company and its subsidiaries are also required to comply with certain financial covenants  including current ratio  fixed charges ratio  funded debt ratio  tangible net worth  capital expenditures  and collateral coverage ratio 
the most restrictive covenants contained in the credit facility include the company s obligation to maintain a fixed charge ratio of not less than to at the last day of each fiscal quarter for the most recent four quarter periods and a collateral coverage ratio of to at the last day of each fiscal quarter 
in addition  the credit facility s prohibition on incurring capital expenditures beyond million plus a percentage of the previous year s cash flow annually is generally below the company s average annual expenditures for fixed asset replacements for the two fiscal years preceding the new credit facility and will require the company to replace certain capital assets with operating leases 
in addition  the credit facility s capital expenditure limitation effectively precludes the company from making future acquisitions without the consent of the syndicate banks 
in connection with the company s new credit facility  the company repaid and refinanced the million of loans advanced to it by michael futerman and eli futerman in february the company repaid  of this debt and exchanged five year subordinated notes with the futermans for the demand notes representing the remaining  principal balance 
the futermans subordinated notes bear interest at the rate of per annum 
interest is payable monthly 
the notes are redeemable at the option of the company  in whole or in part  at any time  subject to a subordination agreement with the syndicate banks 
the notes are payable in equal monthly principal payments which commence on january   and continue through and including february  in the event that the company at any time has net income of  or greater  then  in such event  the company must prepay principal on the notes in the aggregate amount equal to of its net income above and beyond such net income amount  provided that the company is not in default under the credit facility and such payment does not result in the company defaulting thereunder 
the futermans subordinate notes are unsecured and subordinated to all of the company s indebtedness to the syndicate banks 
the company expects to incur additional interest expense during fiscal as a result of higher interest rates under the new credit facility and the borrowings from the futermans 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company reported that it may record a charge against earnings to establish a reserve for costs incurred in the future for certain leases assigned by autoworks to a third party prior to the company s acquisition of autoworks 
the third party assignee of the leases filed for protection under the bankruptcy law and has rejected a number of the assigned leases 
as a result  certain landlords have asserted claims against autoworks for remaining rents and charges due under the assigned leases 
autoworks intends to oppose such claims where defenses exist 
the company is currently negotiating a settlement with autoworks former owner  which would result in a disproportionate sharing by autoworks and its former owners for liability resulting from the assigned leases 
to the extent that autoworks has legal liability to the landlords  it will attempt to mitigate such liability through the use or reletting of the leased property or by other means 
the company has not established a reserve for the expenses which it anticipates incurring in connection with these leases as it believes existing separate reserves are sufficient 
the statements in this paragraph are forward looking and  therefore  are subject to certain risks and uncertainties  including  among others the conclusion of settlement negotiations with autoworks former owner on terms acceptable to the company  the rejection of additional leases  the company s ability to successfully oppose or compromise claims made by landlords under the assigned leases  the company s ability to successfully use or relet the property covered by the assigned leases  the rate at which the company relets such property  and the ability of the company to succeed in mitigating or offsetting the liability by any other means which may be available 
the company s principal sources of liquidity for its operational requirements are internally generated funds  borrowings under its revolving credit facility  leasing arrangements and extended payment terms from vendors 
the company anticipates that these sources will provide sufficient working capital to operate its business  make expected capital expenditures  continue implementation of autoworks operational and organizational changes and to meet its other short term and longer term liquidity needs  except for repaying in full borrowings to the syndicate banks on the maturity of the credit facility 
the company currently does not expect to generate cash flow sufficient to fund the repayment of borrowings due under the credit facility upon its maturity in june and accordingly  expects that it will seek to refinance such amounts prior to such maturity 
no assurance can be given that such refinancing can be successfully accomplished 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas was issued 
sfas encourages companies to adopt a fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation plans in place of the intrinsic value based method provided for by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
companies which continue to apply the provisions of apb must make pro forma disclosures in the notes to their financial statements of net income and earnings per share as if the fair value based method of accounting defined in sfas had been applied 
the company has not yet made an election of which method will be followed for fiscal  the company does not believe that the election  when made  will have a significant impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
in march  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived asset be disposed of sfas was issued 
sfas establishes accounting standards for the recognition of the impairment of long lived assets  certain identifiable intangibles and goodwill related to those assets to be held and used  or to be disposed of 
the company does not believe the adoption of sfas in fiscal year will have a significant impact on the company s results of operations or financial conditions 
inflation the company does not believe that its operations have been materially affected by inflation 
in general  the company has been able to pass on to its customers any increases in the cost of its inventory 
seasonality the company s business is somewhat seasonal in nature  primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on the demand for automotive aftermarket products 
historically  the company s net sales and gross profits have been higher in the second half of each fiscal year than in the first half 
important information regarding forward looking statements the statements contained in this form k which are not historical facts  including but not limited to i the realization of continued benefits from the autoworks re engineering plan  ii anticipated trends in the company s business and the automotive replacement parts industry  iii the sufficiency of cash to fund the company s debt service requirements and working capital needs and iv the statements found under the captions results of operation and liquidity and capital resources above  are forward looking statements within the meanings of section a of the securities act of and section e of the exchange act of  as amended  such statements are typically identified by the words believe  expect  anticipate  intend  estimate  plan and similar expressions 
these statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties  certain of which are beyond the company s control 
the actual results of the future events described in the forward looking statements in this form k could materially differ from those contemplated in the forward looking statements in this form k 
in addition to the risks and uncertainties of ordinary business operations  some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the risks and uncertainties i discussed herein  ii contained in the company s other public reports and filings and public statements from time to time and iii set forth below the company operates in a highly competitive environment and its dollar sales and unit volume could be negatively affected by its ability to maintain or increase prices  changes in sales mix and changes in the demand for automotive products and changes in the automotive replacement parts industry generally  including pricing and other changes by the company s competitors 
the company competes directly and indirectly with numerous distributors  retailers and manufacturers of automotive aftermarket products  some of which distribute in channels that may be expanding in terms of market share relative to the channels in which the company distributes its products 
in addition  some of the company s current and potential competitors are larger  have greater financial resources  and are less leveraged than the company 
furthermore  particularly in light of the trend in the automotive parts industry toward increasing consolidation at the warehouse and jobber levels  the company s financial performance may be significantly affected by the company s ability to compete successfully for associated jobber customers and otherwise take advantage of consolidation opportunities and other trends 
the company s financial performance is subject to and could be negatively impacted by changes in economic conditions  vehicle quality  new parts warranties and maintenance  vehicle scrappage rates and weather conditions  which can cause seasonal variations in the company s results of operations 
the occurrence of violent weather or mild weather may result in significant fluctuations in results 
temperature extremes tend to enhance sales by causing a higher incidence of parts failure and increasing sales of seasonal products  while milder weather tends to depress sales 
the company s autoworks retail division is currently undergoing a re engineering effort involving a number of actions discussed elsewhere herein 
the cost of continuing this program including the cost of terminating leases at non performing locations and or subleasing such properties  the magnitude of the company s employee severance obligations  personnel changes and advertising and promotional expenditures could exceed the company s expectations and negatively impact the company s financial performance 
in addition  as part of the re engineering plan  the company is continuing to evaluate the autoworks business processes and organization structure in an effort to maintain or improve its competitive position which may result in changes to the autoworks business which are not currently contemplated 
such responses could result in additional expenses and or unusual items 
the company s continued growth and financial performance depends  in part  on the company s ability to secure the consent of the syndicate banks to future acquisitions and the company s ability to conclude such acquisitions on favorable terms and to enhance those acquisitions and integrate them into its operations 
full realization of the potential benefits of any significant acquisition will be dependent upon a variety of factors  including i retention of substantial portion of sales  ii achieving sales volumes sufficient to utilize reductions in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales  iii achieving significant reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses by  among other things  consolidating redundant operating and administrative facilities and closure of non performing facilities  iv obtaining deferred payment terms and other changeover incentives from suppliers 
there can be no assurance as to the extent to which any such benefits may be realized from any acquisitions or the timing of any such realization 
failure to achieve a substantial portion of such potential benefits within time frames anticipated by the company could materially and adversely affect the company s future results of operations and financial position
