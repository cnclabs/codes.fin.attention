earnings overview 
the company s net income was million or per share of common stock  which equates to a return on average common equity 
net income and earnings per share of common stock for compare to million and in  and million and in the return on average common equity was for and for the improved earnings for result from an 
per share gain on the sale by catamount energy corporation catamount  a wholly owned non utility subsidiary of the company  of approximately half of its limited partnership interest in the appomattox cogeneration limited partnership  the retail rate increase effective november  and increased retail sales 
in january  the vermont public service board psb issued an accounting order authorizing the company to accelerate recovery of approximately million or 
per common share of restructuring costs originally deferred pursuant to a psb accounting order dated march  as a result of this acceleration  future annual amortization expense  including the company s current rate increase request discussed below  will be reduced by approximately 
million through may the net income and earnings per share of common stock were reduced by approximately million and  respectively  for three non recurring charges resulting from cost disallowances associated with the psb rate order which reduced after tax earnings and earnings per share of common stock by approximately million and  respectively  the company s decision to discontinue its proposed new headquarters office building which reduced after tax earnings and earnings per share of common stock by million and respectively  and writing down smartenergy services  inc s investment in green technologies  inc s green technologies common stock to reflect management s estimate in the decline in value of the investment which reduced after tax earnings and earnings per share of common stock by 
million and  respectively 
earnings per share of common stock and return on common equity for were and  respectively 
absent the non recurring charges and the appomattox gain  net income and earnings per share of common stock would have been as follows dollars in thousands year ended december net income as reported    non recurring charges  net of taxes   appomattox gain  net of taxes net income before non recurring charges and appomattox gain    earnings per share of common stock before non recurring charges and appomattox gain in  the company earned return on average common equity on its vermont utility business and return on non utility investments 
the combined non utility investments return on average common equity of resulted from a return from catamount and loss from smartenergy services  inc smartenergy 
the loss of smartenergy was caused primarily by the write off of its remaining investment in green technologies 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on the company s non utility investments 
principally as a result of increasing purchased power costs  the company filed for a or million general rate increase on october  to become effective july   to offset the increasing cost of providing service as more fully discussed below 
on february   the company reached an agreement with the vermont department of public service dps regarding this rate increase request 
under terms of the agreement  the company would increase rates june  and january  the agreement effectively caps the company s allowed return on common equity in its vermont retail business for and at  by requiring the company to reduce deferred conservation and load management c lm costs to the extent its vermont retail return on common equity would otherwise exceed 
in addition  the agreement would remove the penalties imposed in a psb rate order dated october  discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the agreement is subject to psb approval 
results of operations 
the major elements of the consolidated statement of income are discussed below 
operating revenues and mwh sales a summary of mwh sales and operating revenues for and and the related percentage changes from is set forth below percentage percentage mwh sales increase revenues s increase decrease decrease residential   
  commercial     industrial     other retail     total retail sales     resale sales firm   entitlement     other     total resale sales     other revenues   total     year to year fluctuations in total retail mwh sales are primarily affected by customer growth  c lm programs  as well as relative prices of alternate energy sources  weather patterns and conservation induced by price changes and income elasticity responses of customers 
total retail mwh sales for increased 
compared to retail mwh sales declined during the first quarter of due to warm weather and its impact on winter recreational activities 
however  retail mwh sales improved throughout the remainder of the year 
retail revenues for increased million or due to an million increase in price resulting from the retail rate increase and million associated with the 
increase in mwh sales 
in anticipation of a more competitive environment and to better align costs with revenues by rate class  on may   the company filed with the psb a request for a retail rate redesign which would be revenue neutral overall 
the rate redesign  if subsequently approved by the psb  would decrease the average rate per kilowatt hour for the commercial and industrial sectors by approximately and would increase the average rate per kilowatt hour for the residential sector by about 
if approved by the psb  the rate redesign will also reduce the gap between peak and off peak rates 
technical hearings before the psb for the proposed rate design changes have been scheduled for mid due to current market conditions  some of the company s firm resale customers chose not to extend their contracts 
as a result  firm resale mwh sales and revenues declined for and however  two of those customers are currently purchasing power from the company based on market rates 
entitlement mwh sales and revenues increased and  respectively  due to the sale of power purchased from hydro quebec to boston edison company 
however  this increase was partially offset by decreased mwh sales made in conjunction with a swap arrangement with commonwealth electric  which terminated on october   reduced sell backs to hydro quebec of purchased power and reduced sales to unitil due to the scheduled refueling and maintenance shutdown of vermont yankee that began on march  other resale sales for decreased  mwh and related revenues decreased 
million  primarily from lower short term sales to nepool 
the company continues to make every effort to maintain or increase resale sales despite the weak market for capacity and energy in the region 
the table below analyzes the components of increases or decreases in revenues compared to the prior year dollars in thousands revenue increase decrease from retail mwh sales  retail rates   changes in firm resale sales  changes in entitlement sales   changes in other resale sales  changes in other revenues deferred revenues  net increase decrease over prior year   the increases in retail rates are due to the retail rate increase that became effective with service rendered november  the decrease in entitlement sales and revenues for compared to is due to reduced sell back of the hydro quebec power  partially offset by increased sales made in conjunction with a swap arrangement with commonwealth electric as well as higher sales to unitil 
the increase in other resale sales for resulted from increased sales to nepool and other utilities in new england 
deferred revenues of million in relate to the recognition in of revenues deferred from purchased power the company purchases approximately of its power needs under several contracts of varying duration 
over of these purchases are from affiliated companies whereby the company receives its entitlement share of the output 
the company s purchased power portfolio assures that a diversified mix of sources and fuel types are available to meet the company s long term load growth while providing short and intermediate term opportunities to purchase or sell capacity and energy to reduce overall power costs 
the percentages of the company s energy sources were as follows year ended december nuclear generating companies canadian imports psnh coal company owned hydro jointly owned units small power producers other sources the company has equity ownership interests in four nuclear generating companies vermont yankee vy  maine yankee my  yankee atomic ya and connecticut yankee cy 
the vy nuclear plant  which provides approximately one third of the company s power supply  was unavailable from august through october  and from march through may  due to its scheduled refueling outages 
vy also had unscheduled outages from april to april  and december to december  the my plant was shut down for refueling and maintenance from july through october  for details relating to my s shutdown and the permanent shutdown of ya  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the cy plant was shut down for a scheduled refueling outage from may through july  and from january through april  there were no scheduled refueling outages and no major unscheduled outages during during scheduled refueling outages  the company purchases more costly replacement energy from other sources to satisfy energy needs 
in accordance with current rate making treatment  the company defers and amortizes to expense over their respective fuel cycles the incremental replacement energy and maintenance costs associated with these refueling outages for the yankee plants and the millstone jointly owned nuclear generating unit 
during  the company deferred million and million of replacement energy and capacity costs  respectively  for vy  my  cy and millstone  and for  deferred million and million of energy and capacity costs  respectively  for vy  my  cy and millstone under various long term purchase power contracts expiring in  the company receives varying amounts of capacity and energy from hydro quebec 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details related to the hydro quebec power contracts 
under a year contract  which expires in  the company  through vermont electric power company  inc  purchases mw of capacity from merrimack  a coal fired generating plant owned by northeast utilities 
the company also owns hydroelectric generating units which have a total nameplate capability of mw and two gas fired and one diesel peaking units with a combined nameplate capability of mw 
in addition  the company maintains joint ownership interests in joseph c 
mcneil  a mw wood  gas and oil fired unit  wyman  a mw oil fired unit  and millstone  an mw nuclear unit 
millstone was shut down from july through november  and from april to june  for refueling outages 
the company s percentage ownership in these units is  and  respectively 
the company  under long term contracts  purchases power from a number of small power producers who own qualifying facilities under the public utility regulatory policies act of these qualifying facilities produce energy using hydroelectric  wood  biomass and refuse burning generation 
during  the company purchased  mwh of which approximately  mwh is associated with the vermont power exchange and  mwh with a new hampshire vermont solid waste plant 
the company engages in purchases and sales with other electric utilities and with nepool to take advantage of immediate pricing and other market conditions 
these purchases are included in other sources in the table above 
the net cost components of purchased power and production fuel costs for the past three years were as follows dollars in thousands units amount units amount units amount purchased and produced capacity mw    energy mwh       total purchased power costs    production fuel mwh       total purchased power and production fuel costs    entitlement and other resale sales mwh       net purchased power and production fuel costs    purchased capacity costs increased million for resulting from a or million increase in the amount of mw purchased offset by a favorable price variance of approximately 
million 
the decrease of million for resulted from a favorable price variance of million offset by an increase of or million in the amount of mw purchased 
the variances are primarily due to the absence of refueling outages for vermont yankee 
energy costs are directly related to the variable prices of oil  nuclear fuel and coal but  more importantly  to the proportion of the company s purchased energy that comes from each of these fuel sources 
in total  energy costs for increased million 
cost per mwh purchased increased or million and the amount of mwh purchased increased or million 
for  energy costs were about the same as cost per mwh purchased decreased or million offset by an increase of or million in the amount of mwh purchased 
the company is responsible for paying its entitlement percentage of decommissioning costs for vy  cy  my and ya as well as its joint ownership percentage of decommissioning costs for millstone see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
recently  the staff of the securities and exchange commission has questioned certain current accounting practices of the electric utility industry  including the company  regarding the recognition  measurement and classification of decommissioning costs for nuclear generating stations in financial statements of electric utilities 
in response to these questions  the financial accounting standards board has agreed to review the industry wide accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs 
if current electric utility industry accounting practices for such decommissioning costs are changed  it is possible that annual provisions for decommissioning costs could increase  the total estimated costs for decommissioning could be recorded as a liability  and income from external decommissioning trusts could be reported as investment income instead of a reduction to decommissioning expense 
the company does not believe that such changes  if required  would have an adverse effect on results of operations due to its ability to recover decommissioning costs through the regulatory process 
see liquidity and capital resources competition  for related information 
production fuel costs increased 
million for the increase results from an increase in price of approximately 
million offset by an decrease in the amount of mwh generated primarily by one of the company s jointly owned units  millstone  due to its scheduled refueling outage 
the increase of 
million resulted from a or  mwh increase in the amount of mwh generated mostly by millstone in order to optimize its power mix for baseload  intermediate and peaking power  the company engages in sales and purchases with other electric utilities  primarily in new england and with nepool 
these transactions typically take advantage of immediate pricing and other market conditions 
the profits from these transactions are used to reduce purchased power costs 
as stated earlier  the company is making every effort to maintain or increase these sales despite the weak resale market for excess capacity and energy in the region 
the company s forecast indicates that net purchased power and production fuel costs will be approximately million  million and million for the period through other operation expenses other operation expenses were relatively flat for and increased or million for primarily due to the charge off of approximately million in costs related to the proposed new corporate headquarters office building  an increase in pension and benefit costs and regulatory commission expenses 
depreciation the increases in depreciation expense for and are due to property additions and the installation of new computer systems in income taxes federal and state income taxes fluctuate with the level of pre tax earnings 
these taxes increased for as a result of higher pre tax earnings 
for  these taxes decreased as a result of lower pre tax earnings 
however  the decrease was offset by the write off of million of sfas no 
deferred tax assets which were expected to be collected from customers through rates 
recovery of these taxes was disallowed by the psb in its october  rate order 
other income and deductions equity in earnings of affiliates increased for resulting from higher earnings from the company s nuclear generating affiliates 
for  it decreased as compared to the decrease was attributable to a lower rate of return allowed by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc to some of the company s nuclear generating affiliates 
the increase in allowance for equity and borrowed funds used during construction for is due to increased capital expenditures and higher rates used for capitalization of these funds 
the increase in other income expenses  net results primarily from the million pre tax gain on the sale of a partial interest in the appomattox project in and the million write down of the company s investment in green technologies during however  the increase was partially offset by a 
million additional write off of the company s investment in green technologies in to reflect management s estimate of the permanent decline in the value of the investment 
this eliminates smartenergy s investment in green technologies 
on december   green technologies filed for bankruptcy under chapter the decrease of approximately 
million for compared to reflects the million write down in partially offset by higher income from non utility subsidiaries as well as higher interest on temporary cash investments due to a combination of higher investment levels and interest rates during interest on long term debt interest on long term debt for was about the same as the increase over results from the issuance of million of first mortgage bonds in december other interest expense due to increased short term debt levels and higher interest rates  other interest expense increased for compared to the increase of approximately 
million was due to the ferc settlement related to certain wholesale customers 
cash dividends declared preferred in january  the company redeemed  shares of preferred stock dividend series at a premium of 
per share 
this redemption resulted in a decrease in preferred dividends declared for and common the decrease in common dividends declared for results from an advanced quarterly common dividend declaration in december payable february  as a result  the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect three quarterly dividend declarations in and five in the december declaration reflected the reduction in dividends paid per share 
liquidity and capital resources competition as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  management believes that the company meets the requirement of sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  but continues to evaluate significant changes in the regulatory and competitive environment to ensure and assess the company s overall consistency with the criteria of sfas no 
in the future  if the company determines that it no longer meets the criteria for following sfas no 
 the accounting impact would be an extraordinary non cash charge to operations of an amount that could be material 
although these conditions do not currently exist  the company anticipates future competition will place pressure on both unit sales and the price the company can charge 
as a result  increased competitive pressure in the electric utility industry may restrict the company s ability to establish prices to recover embedded costs and may lead to a significant change in the manner rates are set by regulators from cost based regulation to a different form of regulation that approximates market conditions 
singly or together these events may give rise to the discontinuance of sfas no 
and  in addition  could diminish the company s ability to recover its embedded costs of providing service 
utility restructuring the electric utility industry is in a period of potential transition that may result in a shift away from cost of service and return on equity rates to one with more market based rates 
in many states  including vermont and new hampshire  where the company does business  new mechanisms are being explored to bring greater competition  customer choice and market influence to the industry while retaining the public benefits associated with the current regulatory system 
in vermont  the psb by order dated october   opened a process requiring all electric utilities in vermont to file proposed restructuring plans by mid  facilitating open competition for retail consumers 
the goal  as set forth in the order  is to achieve restructuring by december  the company released its vision statement for a restructured electric industry to interested parties on january  the company s vision statement provides for full recovery of prudently incurred utility investments and obligations that may become stranded as a result of restructuring in the electric industry 
potentially  costs that are currently being recovered in rates could become stranded in the future if the company were unable to reflect such costs in its rates after restructuring 
sources of potential stranded costs would include any then above market purchased power contracts or generation costs  nuclear decommissioning obligations  unrecovered regulatory assets  as well as other unrecovered investments and commitments made as a provider of electric utility service 
recovery of stranded costs would be sought through a mandatory distribution wires charge for access to the distribution system 
the extent of potential stranded costs  if any  depends upon the timing  nature  and degree of competition that may result from future changes in regulatory policies governing the company s activities and prices as well as future power costs and market prices of power 
as such  it is not currently possible to predict with any reasonable precision the level of costs that could be considered stranded as a result of future electric utility industry restructuring 
however  it is possible that stranded cost exposure could exceed the company s current total common stock equity 
in new hampshire  the new hampshire public utilities commission nhpuc  directed by the new hampshire legislature  has begun the process of establishing a pilot program pilot to determine the implications of retail competition in the electric utility industry 
the pilot is for a three year period beginning may  and will be open to all electric utilities and to all classes of customers in new hampshire  although only a small percentage of customers will be selected to participate 
connecticut valley electric company inc connecticut valley  the company s wholly owned new hampshire subsidiary  will be able to compete as a full or partial service provider to retain its customers and to acquire additional load currently served by other new hampshire utilities 
connecticut valley has engaged in a collaborative process with interested parties  including nhpuc staff  and has proposed a recommendation for implementation of the pilot in its service territory 
construction the company s liquidity is primarily affected by the level of cash generated from operations and the funding require ments of its ongoing construction and c lm programs 
net cash provided by operating activities generated million in  million in and million in the company ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of million  an increase of million from the beginning of the year 
the increase in cash for was the result of million provided by operating activities  million used for investing activities and million used for financing activities 
operating activities approximately million was provided from net income before non cash items  primarily depreciation and deferred income taxes 
about million was provided from other operation activities  including c lm programs  restructuring costs and net deferral amortization of nuclear replacement energy and maintenance costs  while million was applied to fluctuations in working capital 
investing activities construction and plant expenditures consumed approximately million  about million was used for c lm programs  
million was used for non utility investments and million was deposited in a special account in anticipation of a non utility investment 
proceeds of million were generated from the sale of a partial interest in a non utility investment 
financing activities dividends paid on common stock were million  while preferred stock dividends were million 
dividends paid on common stock for reflect the reduction from the level 
short term obligations provided million while retirement of long term debt and the repurchase of common stock required million and million  respectively 
excluding allowance for funds used during construction  construction expenditures are estimated at million  million  million  million and million for the years through  respectively 
these spending levels are consistent with the company s goal to move toward limiting annual capital expenditures to annual depreciation 
financing and capitalization utility the level of short term borrowings fluctuates based on seasonal corporate needs  the timing of long term financings and market conditions 
short term borrowings are supported by committed lines of credit and uncommitted loan facilities with several banks totaling million 
short term borrowings generally are reduced when long term debt or equity securities are issued 
in december  the company issued million of long term debt  of which million replaced first mortgage bonds redeemed in october and million replaced first mortgage bonds redeemed in january the balance was used to reduce short term debt outstanding 
in december  the company s wholly owned new hampshire subsidiary  connecticut valley  issued a promissory note of million under a five year loan agreement 
the proceeds were used to repay its note of million held by the parent company 
in the past  the company has been able to finance its construction and c lm programs out of net cash generated by operating activities and it expects to meet future commitments in the same manner 
on november   the board of directors board reduced the quarterly dividend rate from 
to 
as a result  the annual dividend of was reduced to 
effective with the first quarter dividend paid in february also  the board authorized the purchase of up to million shares of its outstanding common stock from time to time in open market transactions 
through december   the company had purchased  shares at an average price of per share 
these transactions are recorded as treasury stock  at cost  in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
no shares of common stock were purchased by the company subsequent to december  in january  the company redeemed million of the series preferred stock  par value 
beginning in august  dividend reinvestment and common stock purchase plan  and employee stock ownership plan requirements are satisfied by the purchase of shares of common stock on the open market 
the company s capital structure ratios including amounts of long term debt due within one year for the past three years were as follows december common stock equity preferred stock long term debt on july  and on august   duff phelps  inc duff phelps and standard poor s corporation standard poor s  respectively  lowered their rating on the company s first mortgage bonds and preferred stock 
duff phelps stated that the downgrade reflected its concerns about the continuing recession in new england  intensifying competition in the utility industry and excess power in the northeastern region  as well as the company s loss of wholesale revenues 
standard poor s stated the downgrade reflected the company s weak financial profile  adjusted for off balance sheet obligations  primarily associated with purchased power  combined with the company s low average business position  as well as  restrictive vermont regulation  the state of the vermont economy  nuclear asset concentration and increasing investments into non regulated businesses are other factors impacting the company s business position 
standard poor s also revised its ratings outlook on the company to stable from negative 
current credit ratings for the company s securities as of february are as follows duff standard phelps poor s first mortgage bonds bbb bbb preferred stock bbb bbb non utility catamount energy corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  maintains an irrevocable standby letter of credit with a bank to borrow up to an aggregate amount of million to replace its share of cash in the appomattox cogeneration limited partnership s project debt service reserve fund 
this letter of credit is for a one year term with annual extensions available and requires fees of of credit available 
smartenergy  also a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  maintains a million revolving line of credit with a bank to provide working capital and financing assistance for investment purposes 
financial obligations of the non utility wholly owned subsidiaries are non recourse to the company 
c lm programs the primary purpose of these programs is to offset the need for long term power supply and delivery resources that are more expensive to purchase or develop than customer efficiency programs 
total c lm expenditures in and were million and million  respectively  and are expected to be approximately million in on april   the company and the dps jointly filed a stipulation resolving issues related to the role of fuel switching as a c lm resource  promotion of electricity  and c lm spending levels for and this stipulation resolves the outstanding material issues related to c lm until the end of it also establishes a process to remove the return on equity penalty related to the company s failed efforts to acquire all cost effective energy efficiency resources imposed by the psb in the company s last rate case 
although not yet approved by the psb  the parties are implementing the stipulation as outlined in its terms 
the parties have recommended that the psb remove the return on equity penalty related to the c lm programs because the company has met the conditions outlined in the stipulation 
diversification catamount was formed for the purpose of investing in non regulated energy related projects 
currently  catamount  through its wholly owned subsidiaries  has interests in six operating independent power projects located in rumford  maine  east ryegate  vermont  hopewell  virginia  williams lake  british columbia  canada  and glenns ferry and rupert  idaho 
smartenergy was formed for the purpose of profitably providing reliable  energy efficient products and services  including the rental of electric water heaters 
rates and regulation the company recognizes adequate and timely rate relief is necessary if the company is to maintain its financial strength  particularly since vermont regulatory rules do not allow for changes in purchased power and fuel costs to be passed on to consumers through automatic rate adjustment clauses 
the company s practice of reviewing costs periodically will continue and rate increases will be requested when warranted 
the company filed for a or million general rate increase on october  to become effective july   to offset the increasing cost of providing service 
approximately million or of the rate increase request is to recover increased purchased power costs 
as part of the rate filing  the company proposed a special lifeline program for low income customers which  if approved  would serve to limit some of the impact of the rate case and rate design on residential low income customers 
on february   the company reached an agreement with the dps regarding this rate increase request 
for detail  see earnings overview 
at the company s annual meeting  shareholders approved two amendments to the company s articles of incorporation subject to obtaining the necessary regulatory approval 
one of the amendments was a so called fair price provision 
the other amendment served to limit the board s liability in certain circumstances 
because under vermont law the company cannot amend its articles of incorporation without the psb s permission  the company filed a petition seeking the necessary regulatory approval 
the dps vigorously opposed both amendments  significantly decreasing the likelihood of obtaining psb approval 
the case was further complicated by the intervention of one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in light of the limited prospect of obtaining regulatory approval  as well as the ongoing costs associated with the proceeding  the company decided to withdraw the petition with prejudice 
accordingly  on october   the company filed a notice of withdrawal  which the psb granted 
inflation the annual rate of inflation  as measured by the consumer price index  was for and for and the company s revenues  however  are based on rate regulation that generally recognizes only historical costs 
although the rate of inflation has eased in recent years  it continues to have an impact on most aspects of the business 
new accounting pronouncements effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and decided not to adopt the accounting option of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation
