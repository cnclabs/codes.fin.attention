item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations overview the company s business is both capital intensive and volume sensitive  making capacity planning and efficient capacity use imperative 
physical capacity  utilization of this physical capacity  yields and average unit sales price constitute the key determinants of the company s profitability 
of these key determinants  price and utilization are the most sensitive to changes in product demand 
if capacity and product price are fixed at a given level and demand is sufficient to support a higher level of output  then increased output attained through improved utilization rates and higher manufacturing yields will translate directly into increased sales and improved gross margins 
alternatively  if demand for the company s products decreases  falling average selling prices and lower capacity utilization could adversely affect the results of the company s operations 
the following discussion contains predictions  estimates and other forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
while this discussion represents the company s current judgment on the future direction of the business  such risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested herein 
factors that could cause actual results to differ include the following product transitions to next generation products  effective utilization of existing manufacturing facilities  continuation of improved manufacturing efficiencies  industry supply demand relationships and related pricing for high end disk products  execution of planned capacity additions  and vertical integration and consolidations within a limited customer base 
see business risk factors for more detailed discussions of the company s risk factors 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions to these forward looking statements which may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
vs 
net sales net sales for rose to million  a increase over the million reported in the combination of unit sales volume growth and an increase in the overall average selling price resulted in the substantially higher net sales 
nearly three quarters of the improvement in net sales was attributable to higher unit sales volume in relative to the overall average selling price typically strengthens only as the result of product mix shifts to higher priced  more technologically advanced product offerings 
price reductions for individual product offerings are characteristic of the thin film media industry 
the company began a rapid transition to its leading edge oe product offering in the fourth quarter of unit sales of this product increased to of unit sales volume in the fourth quarter of from of unit sales in the fourth quarter of the higher sales mix of oe product and a favorable pricing environment arising from an industry shortage of this product allowed the overall average selling price to increase in relative to the overall average selling price will likely trend downward from the average selling price in the fourth quarter of due to a continuing high proportion of oe product sales during the first half of the transition to higher priced oe products is expected to commence in the second quarter of and such products could account for more than of the company s sales during the fourth quarter of any delay in the introduction of these products could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
in addition to sales of its internally produced disk products  the company resells products manufactured by asahi komag co  ltd 
akcl  its japanese joint venture with asahi glass company  ltd 
distribution sales of product manufactured by akcl decreased to million in from million in the company purchased smaller quantities of product from akcl in as demand within the japanese thin film media market absorbed the majority of akcl s capacity 
the company anticipates that distribution sales of akcl produced product to us customers in will be minimal 
increased production volume may occur due to increased physical capacity additional production lines and or improvements in manufacturing efficiencies improved unit output from higher yields  better equipment utilization or shorter process cycle times 
the increase in unit production volume required to support the increase in unit sales volume for relative to was primarily achieved through the addition of production lines and improvement in cycle times 
production yields and equipment utilization rates were relatively unchanged between the years 
shortened process cycle times accounted for nearly one half of the increase in unit output in relative to net physical capacity additions provided the remaining increase in unit production volume 
the company added one new sputtering machine in each of january  august  march and september as of the end of the year  the company had a total of fifteen production lines  ten in the us and five in malaysia 
in late  the company began a program to upgrade its sputtering machines to enhance product capabilities and shorten process cycle times 
the company expects one us machine will be out of production on a rotating basis through the addition of two production lines in the first and second quarters of and full use of the two production lines installed during throughout  coupled with expected efficiency improvements  should allow unit output between and to grow approximately 
gross margin the gross margin percentage for rose to  up markedly from the gross margin achieved for the combination of the rapid transition to oe product in  strong industry demand for this product  and solid manufacturing performance produced this historically high gross margin for the company 
the increase in the overall average selling price accounted for over two thirds of the gross margin percentage improvement 
additionally  process cycle time improvements allowed the company to lower its overall average unit cost of production despite the inherently higher costs of producing more technologically advanced oe products 
the gross margin percentage increased sequentially in each quarter of from in the first quarter to in the fourth quarter of as the sales mix of oe product increased and market conditions for advanced thin film media remained strong 
the gross margin achieved in the fourth quarter of was well above the company s targeted range and the company anticipates that its quarterly gross margin percentage will decline toward its targeted range of as the fiscal year progresses 
continued focus on process improvement programs designed to increase production throughput and reduce the overall average unit production cost should reduce  but not eliminate  the impact of a decreasing overall average selling price on the company s gross margin in in spite of expected sequential increases in quarterly unit output  reductions in the gross margin percentage from the level achieved in the fourth quarter of will likely restrict sequential earnings growth during however  the company believes that its annual financial performance will compare favorably to that achieved for fiscal year operating expenses research and development expenses increased million in relative to the increase was primarily due to development of improved sputtering processes and next generation thin film media products 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased million in compared to the increase was primarily due to a million increase in the provisions for the company s bonus and profit sharing programs resulting from the substantially higher operating performance in provisions for bad debt increased million between the years 
excluding provisions for bad debt and the company s bonus and profit sharing programs  sg a expenses increased approximately million between the years 
increases in administrative costs required to support the growth in the business accounted for the majority of the increase 
interest income expense and other income interest income increased million in relative to the increase was due to the combination of higher interest rates and higher average investment balances in the company exited with million in cash and short term investments compared to million at the end of proceeds from the company s third public offering in september and significant cash flow provided by operations in allowed the company to maintain its higher average investment balances for interest expense decreased million in compared to due to a lower average outstanding debt balance for the company repaid all of its existing outstanding debt in september and exited the year with no bank debt 
other income increased million in relative to primarily due to receipt of an insurance recovery related to an electrical power disruption at the company s malaysian manufacturing facility 
income taxes the effective income tax rate for of was lower than the combined federal and state statutory rate of and the effective income tax rate of in primarily as a result of a tax holiday granted to the company s wholly owned thin film media operation in malaysia

akcl reported net income of million for  up from million for equity in net income of akcl contributed of the company s consolidated net income 
the company anticipates that akcl s equity income will account for a similar percentage of consolidated net income 
the company translates akcl s yen based income statements to us dollars at the average exchange rate in effect during the year 
the japanese yen strengthened approximately in relative to akcl s net income would have been approximately million in had the yen based income statement been translated at the average rate in effect for akcl s net income in will be affected by the start up costs associated with a new manufacturing facility and the financial performance of headway technologies  inc headway 
akcl began construction of a  square foot facility in thailand for front end production of thin film disks in and expects to begin production at this site in late akcl invested in headway in and has been recording partial writedowns of its investment based upon net losses incurred at headway 
akcl s net income reflected writedowns  net of tax  of million and million in and  respectively 
to the extent that such losses continue  akcl will record a portion of those losses 
alternatively  akcl will record a portion of headway s net income  if any  to the extent of previously recognized losses 
other the company operates facilities in the us and malaysia and ships products to both domestic and international locations 
in order to minimize the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations  the company denominates its sales in us dollars and periodically enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge firm purchase commitments 
the company had approximately million of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at december  no such foreign exchange contracts were open as of january  gains and losses created by the remeasurement of the financial statements of the company s malaysian operations into us dollars from malaysian ringgits have not had a significant effect on the consolidated results of operations

net sales unit sales of thin film media increased nearly in relative to the effect on thin film media revenue from this substantial increase in unit sales volume was reduced by a decrease in the overall average unit selling price between the years 
in  the company began a transition to more advanced oe product offerings 
the transition to this new disk product was more challenging and required more time than previous product transitions 
as a result of the more lengthy product transition time  the effects of traditionally declining prices for individual product offerings reduced the overall average selling price between the years 
distribution sales of product manufactured by akcl decreased to million in from million in the company purchased smaller quantities of product from akcl in as demand within the japanese thin film media market absorbed more of akcl s capacity 
the increase in unit production volume required to support the increase in unit sales volume for relative to was primarily achieved through a combination of higher manufacturing throughput  increased physical capacity  and improved production yields and utilization rates 
improvements in manufacturing throughput  primarily due to shortened sputter cycle times  and physical capacity additions each accounted for approximately of the increased unit production volume 
improvements in yields and utilization rates accounted for the remaining increase in unit production volume 
gross margin the thin film media gross margin percentage decreased to for from for excluding distribution sales of product manufactured by akcl for resale to the company s customers  the gross margin percentage decreased to from between the years 
the substantial decrease in the overall average selling price outpaced solid improvements in the average unit production cost and resulted in the lower gross margin percentage for manufacturing efficiencies  such as reduced cycle times and yield and utilization improvements  were the primary drivers in reducing the average unit production cost 
operating expenses research  development and engineering expenses increased million in compared to the increase between the years was mainly due to development costs for advanced thin film media  including costs associated with the company s thin film media pilot production line 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in relative to  primarily due to higher provisions for the company s bonus and profit sharing programs resulting from the higher operating profitability for the company s thin film media operations 
interest income expense and other income interest income increased million in relative to the increase was due to the combination of higher interest rates and higher average investment balances in interest expense decreased million 
in  the company reversed previously capitalized interest related to the construction of its thin film media manufacturing facility in malaysia  thus increasing interest expense 
excluding this reversal  interest expense decreased million primarily due to a lower average outstanding debt balance for other income  net decreased million in mainly due to higher losses on disposal of equipment in relative to income taxes the effective income tax rate for of was lower than the effective income tax rate of in primarily as a result of a tax holiday granted to the company s wholly owned thin film media operation in malaysia
