liquidity and capital resources the company requires capital for the acquisition and development of dialysis facilities  including the purchase of property  plant and equipment  and the acquisition and development of its new specialty products

routine capital expenditures were million and million for the fiscal years ended november  and  respectively

the company expects that its capital and acquisition expenditures for fiscal will exceed expenditures for fiscal to the extent the company is able to identify significant attractive investment opportunities  such expenditures could exceed million 
the company believes that cash generated from operations together with available cash  the ability to issue common stock for acquisitions and issue debt or equity capital will be adequate to meet the company s planned capital expenditure  acquisition and development and liquidity needs for fiscal inflation and changes in prices in and  approximately and of the company s dialysis revenues were funded by medicare and medicaid  at an average rate of per dialysis treatment  before ancillary services 
despite periods of significant inflation  the medicare and medicaid reimbursement rate has remained relatively constant since the company is unable to predict what  if any  future changes may occur in the reimbursement rate and  if made  whether such changes will help alleviate or increase inflationary pressures on the company s costs 
the balance of dialysis revenues  which are paid at rates significantly in excess of medicare and medicaid  represented of revenues in compared to in the decline in revenues from these sources was due to the april  clarification of the government s original interpretation of an amendment to the social security act contained in the omnibus reconciliation act of obra 
obra established rules for determining whether medicare or an employer group health plan eghp should be the primary payer when beneficiaries who are eligible for or entitled to medicare on the basis of end stage renal disease esrd are also entitled to medicare on the basis of age or disability 
the health care financing administration hcfa originally required eghp s to be the primary payer during the benefits coordination period when a patient had dual entitlement 
however  on april   hcfa revised its interpretation of this statute to make medicare the primary payer in cases where a patient would otherwise be eligible for medicare coverage prior to the patients esrd diagnosis or when the patient s eghp was intended to be supplemental 
on june   the united states district court for the district of columbia issued a preliminary injunction precluding hcfa from implementing its revised interpretation for services furnished between august  and april  in the event this preliminary injunction is not upheld  the company may be required to refund amounts paid by commercial payers and bill medicare as the primary payer for these patients whose medicare eligibility preceded their eligibility due to esrd 
furthermore  any restriction or reduction of the company s ability to charge rates in excess of those paid by medicare and medicaid would have a significant negative effect on the company s revenues and earnings 
intradialytic parenteral nutrition idpn therapy is a nutritional supplement administered during dialysis to patients suffering from nutritional deficiencies 
in early  hcfa designated four durable medical equipment regional carriers the dmercs to process reimbursement claims for idpn therapy 
to date these dmercs have denied most claims and the company is currently appealing these denied claims 
hcfa is currently reviewing the dmercs position with respect to medical policy and claims reimbursement 
the final outcome of this review is uncertain and may ultimately affect the number of patients eligible to receive reimbursement for idpn therapy 
patients receiving idpn therapy prior to the designation of the dmercs are grandfathered under the prior carriers medical policies and continue to be eligible for reimbursement 
since may and based upon the continued uncertainty with respect to reimbursement for services provided  the company has limited administration of this therapy to patients who have been grandfathered or have private insurance
