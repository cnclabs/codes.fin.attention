item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation management strategy the company is pursuing a strategy that is designed to improve its performance by positioning the bank as a locally managed full service community bank in an increasingly competitive environment 
although mortgage lending is expected to continue as an important part of the company s business  a key component of the company s strategy is the provision of nonbanking financial services and products  such as annuity and insurance products and brokerage services through invest to retain and attract customers 
in addition  the third party loan originator network enables the company to be a competitive  low cost provider of single and multi family mortgage loans 
the nonbanking financial services and products are also intended to generate additional fee income and thereby improve profitability 
the company also intends to diversify its asset base and at the same time develop further customer relationships through increased consumer lending activities  such as home equity lending 
finally  the company will continue to pursue opportunities for growth and expansion in the bank s existing marketplace  whether through acquisitions  such as the bank s acquisition of deposits from the rtc in  or through additional facilities  such as the schaumburg and harlem avenue offices  opened in fiscal the company may seek additional asset growth to further leverage its net worth 
in the event that its traditional retail sources of funding and investment opportunities ie  deposits and direct lending are insufficient for this purpose  or appear to be inappropriately priced  the bank may further utilize the wholesale markets  such as fhlb advances  for funding or mortgage backed securities for investment opportunities 
asset liability management the company s overall asset liability strategy is directed toward managing the bank s exposure to interest rate risk in changing interest rate environments 
asset liability management is a daily function of the bank s management due to continual fluctuations in interest rates and financial markets 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a special time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within that time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
at september   total interest earning assets maturing  repricing  or estimated to mature  reprice or decay  within one year exceeded total interest bearing liabilities maturing  repricing  or estimated to prepay  in the same period by million  representing a cumulative one year negative gap of of assets 
thus  during future periods of rising interest rates  the costs on interest bearing liabilities may increase more quickly than the yields on interest earning assets  which could adversely affect net interest income 
conversely  in a period of falling interest rates  the yields on its interest earning assets may decrease at a slower pace than the cost of its interest bearing liabilities 
the company closely monitors its interest rate risk as such risk relates to its operational strategies 
management s interest rate sensitivity strategy is designed to provide a relatively stable stream of net interest income in moderately varying interest rate environments 
the following table sets forth the scheduled repricing or maturity of the company s assets and liabilities at september   based on certain assumptions used by the ots with respect to now  checking and passbook account withdrawals 
the company s loan prepayment assumptions are based on national experience data 
these assumptions may not be indicative of the actual prepayments and withdrawals experienced by the company 
the effect of these assumptions is to quantify the dollar amount of items that are interest sensitive and may be repriced within each of the periods specified 
the table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the company s net interest yield because the repricing of certain categories of assets and liabilities is subject to competitive and other pressures beyond the company s control 
as a result  certain assets and liabilities indicated as maturing or otherwise repricing within a stated period may  in fact  mature or reprice at different times and at different volumes

after days  the bank will either set a date by which the loan must be brought current  enter into a written forbearance agreement  foreclose on any collateral or take other appropriate action 
the bank policies regarding delinquent consumer loans are similar except that telephone contacts and correspondence will generally occur after a consumer loan is more than days delinquent 
it is the bank s general policy to discontinue the accrual of interest on all first mortgage loans days past due 
consumer loans continue to accrue interest until a determination made by the bank that the loan may result in a loss 
property acquired by the bank as a result of a foreclosure on a mortgage loan is classified as real estate owned and is recorded at the lower of the unpaid principal balance or fair value at the date of acquisition and subsequently carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value

federal regulations require the bank to classify loans and other assets such as debt and equity securities  considered by the ots to be of lesser quality  as substandard  doubtful or loss assets 
the bank s classification policies provide that assets will be classified according to ots regulations 
an asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged  if any 
substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard  with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions  and values  highly questionable and improbable 
assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted 
assets which do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are required to be designated special mention by management 
when the bank determines that an asset should be classified  it generally does not establish a specific allowance for such asset unless it determines that such asset may result in a loss 
the bank may  however  increase its general valuation allowance in an amount deemed prudent 
general valuation allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities  but which  unlike specific allowances  have not been allocated to particular problem assets 
the bank s policies provide for the establishment of a specific allowance equal to of each asset classified as loss or to charge off such amount 
a savings institution s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the ots which can order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances 
the bank reviews the problem loans in its portfolio on a monthly basis to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations  and believes its classification policies are consistent with ots policies 
as of september   the bank had classified assets of million 
classified loans of million were categorized as substandard  consisting of residential mortgage loans  commercial loans  and unsecured lines of credit 
in addition to the mortgage and consumer portfolio  the bank classified its investment in commercial leases as substandard 
there were no assets classified as doubtful 
from october through january  the bank purchased full payout commercial equipment leases located in various parts of the country with original aggregate outstanding principal balances of million 
since that time normal lease payments had reduced the aggregate outstanding balance to million at february  these leases were all originated by  serviced by  and financially guaranteed by bennett funding group of syracuse  new york bfg 
on march  it was reported that bfg was the target of a civil complaint filed by the securities and exchange commission 
on that same date bfg filed a chapter bankruptcy petition in the northern district of new york and halted payments on the lease agreements 
the bankruptcy trustee is currently collecting the lease payments from the lessees and holding them in escrow pending the outcome of the litigation concerning bfg  its creditors  and related issues 
this disruption of payment flows from the servicer  bfg  has caused the company to classify all the leases as substandard  place them on non accrual status and to categorize them as non performing and impaired 
the bank is vigorously pursuing available legal remedies in an attempt to protect and collect amounts due under the terms of the underlying leases 
the substance of the bank s claims center on the assertion that the bank has a perfected security interest in the leases and the proceeds thereof 
the trustee disagrees 
the opinion of the bank s bankruptcy counsel at this time is that the bank s position should ultimately prevail 
there can be no assurance  however  of the actual results of this legal process or the extent of the bank s recovery  if any 
the bank has estimated what is believed to be the realizable value of the leases and established a valuation allowance of  in the event that the outcome of the litigation is not favorable  ie the bank s status is that of an unsecured creditor  the recovery may be substantially smaller 
any recovery by the bank of less than the net book value of the leases will cause additional losses to the bank 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan and lease losses based on management s evaluation of the risk inherent in its loan portfolio and the general economy 
such evaluation  which includes a review of all loans on which full collection may not be reasonably assured  considers among other matters the estimated net realizable value of the underlying collateral  economic conditions  historical loan loss experience and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an adequate loan loss allowance 
in recent years  in light of the general economic conditions  management has  from time to time  increased its provision to account for its evaluation of the potential effects of such conditions 
the bank will continue to monitor and modify its allowances for loan losses as conditions dictate 
although the bank maintains its allowance at a level which it considers adequate to provide for potential losses  there can be no assurances that such losses will not exceed the estimated amounts 
the following table sets forth the bank s allowance for loan losses at the dates indicated

for internal purposes  the bank does not allocate the allowance among loan classifications 
in the following table  the allowance for loan losses has been allocated by category for purposes of complying with public disclosure requirements 
the amount allocated on the following table to any category should not be interpreted as an indication of future charge offs and the amounts allocated are not intended to reflect the amount that may be available for future losses on any category since the bank s allowance is a general allowance

recent regulatory developments on september   president clinton signed into law the economic growth and regulatory paperwork reduction act of the regulatory reduction act 
subtitle g of the regulatory reduction act consists of the deposit insurance funds act of the difa 
the difa provides for a one time special assessment on each depository institution holding deposits subject to assessment by the fdic for the savings association insurance fund the saif in an amount which  in the aggregate  will increase the designated reserve ratio of the saif ie  the ratio of the insurance reserves of the saif to total saif insured deposits to on october  subject to certain exceptions  the special assessment is payable in full on november  as a saif member  the bank is subject to the special assessment 
under the difa  the amount of the special assessment payable by an institution is to be determined on the basis of the amount of saif assessable deposits held by the institution on march   or acquired by the institution after march  from another institution which held the deposits as of that date but is no longer in existence on november  the difa provides for a discount in calculating the saif assessable deposits of certain oakar banks ie  bank insurance fund bif member banks that hold deposits acquired from a saif member that are deemed to remain saif insured and certain sasser banks ie  banks that converted from thrift to bank charters but remain saif members 
the difa also exempts certain institutions from payment of the special assessment including institutions that are undercapitalized or that would become undercapitalized as a result of payment of the special assessment  and allows an institution to pay the special assessment in two installments if there is a significant risk that by paying the special assessment in a lump sum  the institution or its holding company would be in default under or in violation of terms or conditions of debt obligations or preferred stock issued by the institution or its holding company and outstanding on september  on october   the fdic adopted a final regulation implementing the saif special assessment 
in that regulation  the fdic set the special assessment rate at of saif assessable deposits held on march  the fdic has notified the bank that the dollar amount of the special assessment payable by the bank is estimated to be million  which the bank included in other liabilities at september  in light of the recapitalization of the saif pursuant to the special assessment authorized by the difa  the fdic  on october   issued a proposed rule that would reduce regular semi annual saif assessments from the current range of of deposits to a range of of deposits 
under the proposal  the new rates would be effective october  for oakar and sasser banks  but would not take affect for other saif assessable institutions until january  from october  through december   saif assessable institutions other than oakar and sasser banks would  under the proposal  be assessed at rates ranging from to of deposits  which represents the amount the fdic calculates as necessary to cover the interest due for that period on outstanding obligations of the financing corporation the fico  discussed below 
because saif assessable institutions have already been assessed at current rates ie  of deposits for the semi annual period ending december   the proposal contemplates that the fdic will refund the amount collected from such institutions for the period from october  through december  which exceeds the amount due for that period under the reduced assessment schedule 
assuming the proposal is adopted as proposed  and assuming the bank retains its current risk classification under the fdic s risk based assessment system  the deposit insurance assessments payable by the bank will be reduced significantly  to the same level currently paid by the bank s bif member competitors 
prior to the enactment of the difa  a substantial amount of the saif assessment revenue was used to pay the interest due on bonds issued by the fico  the entity created in to finance the recapitalization of the federal savings and loan insurance corporation the fslic  the saif s predecessor insurance fund 
pursuant to the difa  the interest due on outstanding fico bonds will be covered by assessments against both saif and bif member institutions beginning january  between january  and december   fico assessments against bif member institutions cannot exceed of the fico assessments charged saif member institutions 
from january  until the fico bonds mature in  fico assessments will be shared by all fdic insured institutions on a pro rata basis 
the fdic estimates that the fico assessments for the period january  through december  will be approximately of deposits for bif members versus approximately of deposits for saif members  and will be less than of deposits thereafter 
the difa also provides for a merger of the bif and the saif on january   provided there are no state or federally chartered  fdic insured savings associations existing on that date 
to facilitate the merger of the bif and the saif  the difa directs the treasury department to conduct a study on the development of a common charter and to submit a report  along with appropriate legislative recommendations  to the congress by march  in addition to the difa  the regulatory reduction act includes a number of statutory changes designed to eliminate duplicative  redundant or unnecessary regulatory requirements 
further  the regulatory reduction act removes the percentage of assets limitations on the aggregate amount of credit card and education loans that may be made by a savings association  such as the bank  increases from to of total assets the aggregate amount of commercial loans that a savings association may make  provided that any amount in excess of of total assets represents small business loans  allows education  small business  and credit card to be counted in full in determining a savings association s compliance with the qualified thrift lender qtl test  and provides that a savings association may be deemed to meet the qtl test if it qualifies as a domestic building and loan association under the internal revenue code 
the regulatory reduction act also clarifies the liability of a financial institution  when acting as a lender or in a fiduciary capacity  under the federal environmental clean up laws 
although the full impact of the regulatory reduction act on the operations of the company and the bank cannot be determined at this time  management believes that the legislation will reduce compliance costs to some extent and allow the company and the bank somewhat greater operating flexibility 
the company general 
the company  as the sole shareholder of the bank  is a savings and loan holding company 
as a savings and loan holding company  the company is registered with  and is subject to regulation by  the ots under the home owners loan act  as amended the hola 
under the hola  the company is subject to periodic examination by the ots and is required to file periodic reports of its operations and such additional information as the ots may require 
investments and activities 
the hola prohibits a savings and loan holding company  directly or indirectly  or through one or more subsidiaries from i acquiring control of  or acquiring by merger or purchase of assets  another savings association or savings and loan holding company without the prior written approval of the ots  ii subject to certain exceptions  acquiring more than of the issued and outstanding shares of voting stock of a savings association or savings and loan holding company except as part of an acquisition of control approved by the ots  or iii acquiring or retaining control of a financial institution that does not have saif or bif insurance of accounts 
a savings and loan holding company may acquire savings associations located in more than one state in both supervisory transactions involving failing savings associations and nonsupervisory acquisitions of healthy institutions  subject to the requirement that in any nonsupervisory transaction  the law of the state in which the savings association to be acquired is located must specifically authorize the proposed acquisition  by language to that effect and not merely by implication 
state laws vary in the extent to which they allow interstate acquisitions of savings associations 
illinois law presently permits financial institution holding companies located in any state of the united states to acquire financial institutions or financial institution holding companies located in illinois  subject to certain conditions 
a savings and loan holding company that controls only one savings association subsidiary is generally not subject to any restrictions on the non banking activities that the holding company may conduct either directly or through a non banking subsidiary  so long as the holding company s savings association subsidiary constitutes a qualified thrift lender 
if  however  the ots determines that there is reasonable cause to believe that the continuation by a savings and loan holding company of a particular activity constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety  soundness or stability of its savings association subsidiary  the ots may require the holding company to cease engaging in the activity or divest any subsidiary which engages in the activity or may impose such restrictions on the holding company and the subsidiary savings association as deemed necessary to address the risk  including imposing limitations on i the payment of dividends by the savings association to the holding company  ii transactions between the savings association and its affiliates and iii any activities of the savings association that might create a serious risk that liabilities of the holding company and its affiliates may be imposed on the savings association 
federal legislation also prohibits acquisition of control of a savings association or savings and loan holding company  such as the company  without prior notice to certain federal bank regulators 
control is defined in certain cases as acquisition of of the outstanding shares of a savings association or savings and loan holding company 
dividends 
the general corporation law of the state of delaware allows the company to pay dividends only out of its surplus  or if the company has no such surplus  out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and or the preceding fiscal year 
the company s ability to pay dividends is also dependent upon the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the company 
ots regulations impose certain restrictions on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the company 
see the bank dividends 
federal securities regulation 
the company s common stock is registered with the sec under the securities act of  as amended  and the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act 
consequently  the company is subject to the information  proxy solicitation  insider trading and other restrictions and requirements of the sec under the exchange act 
the bank general 
the bank is a federally chartered savings association  the deposits of which are insured by the saif of the fdic 
as a saif insured  federally chartered savings association  the association is subject to the examination  supervision  reporting and enforcement requirements of the ots  as the chartering authority for federal savings associations  and the fdic as administrator of the saif 
the bank is also a member of the federal home loan bank system the fhlb system  which provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions 
deposit insurance 
as an fdic insured institution  the bank is required to pay deposit insurance premium assessments to the fdic 
the amount each institution pays for fdic deposit insurance is determined in accordance with a risk based assessment system under which all insured depository institutions are placed into one of nine categories and assessed insurance premiums based upon their level of capital and supervisory evaluation 
institutions classified as well capitalized as defined by the fdic and considered healthy pay the lowest premium while institutions that are less than adequately capitalized as defined by the fdic and considered of substantial supervisory concern pay the highest premium 
risk classification of all insured institutions is made by the fdic for each semi annual assessment period 
as of september   saif member institutions were assessed at rates ranging from of deposits to of deposits 
the fdic has proposed to reduce saif assessment rates to a range of of deposits for the period october  through december   and to a range of of deposits commencing january  see recent regulatory developments 
the fdic may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution if the fdic determines  after a hearing  that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law  regulation  order  or any condition imposed in writing by  or written agreement with  the fdic 
the fdic may also suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for a permanent termination of insurance if the institution has no tangible capital 
management of the company is not aware of any activity or condition that could result in termination of the deposit insurance of the bank 
fico assessments 
since  a portion of the deposit insurance assessments paid by saif members  such as the bank  have been used to cover interest payments due on the outstanding obligations of the fico  the entity created to finance the recapitalization of the fslic  the saif s predecessor insurance fund 
pursuant to federal legislation enacted september   commencing january   saif members and bif members will be subject to assessments to cover the interest payment on outstanding fico obligations 
such fico assessments will be in addition to amounts assessed by the fdic for deposit insurance 
until january   the fico assessments made against bif members may not exceed of the amount of the fico assessments made against saif members 
it is estimated that saif members will pay fico assessments equal to of deposits while bif members will pay fico assessments equal to of deposits 
between january  and the maturity of the outstanding fico obligations in  bif members and saif members will share the cost of the interest on the fico bonds on a pro rata basis 
it is estimated that fico assessments during this period will be less than of deposits 
ots assessments 
savings associations are required to pay assessments to the ots to fund the operations of the ots 
the amount of the ots assessment is based upon each institution s total assets  including consolidated subsidiaries  as reported to the ots on the quarterly thrift financial reports 
during the year ended september   the bank paid total ots assessments of  capital requirements 
the ots has established the following minimum capital standards for savings associations  such as the bank a core capital requirement  consisting of a minimum ratio of core capital consisting primarily of stockholders equity to total assets of  a tangible capital requirement consisting of a minimum ratio of tangible capital defined as core capital minus all intangible assets other than a specified amount of purchased mortgage servicing rights to total assets of  and a risk based capital requirement  consisting of a minimum ratio of total capital to total risk weighted assets of  at least one half of which must consist of core capital 
the capital requirements described above are minimum requirements 
higher capital levels will be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profiles of individual institutions 
for example  the regulations of the ots provide that additional capital may be required to take adequate account of an institution s exposure to interest rate risk and the risks posed by concentrations of credit and nontraditional activities 
at september   the bank exceeded its minimum regulatory capital requirements  as follows actual required excess actual required capital capital capital percentage percentage dollars in thousands risk based    tangible    core leverage    although the ots capital regulations require savings institutions to meet a tangible capital ratio and a core leverage capital ratio  the prompt corrective action standards discussed below also establish  in effect  a minimum tangible capital standard  a core leverage capital ratio for institutions receiving the highest rating on the camel financial institution rating system  and  together with the risk based standard itself  a tier risk based capital standard 
federal law provides the ots with broad power to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized savings associations 
the extent of the ots s powers depends on whether the institution in question is well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized 
depending upon the capital category to which an institution is assigned  the ots s corrective powers include requiring the submission of a capital restoration plan  placing limits on asset growth and restrictions on activities  requiring the institution to issue additional capital stock including additional voting stock or to be acquired  restricting transactions with affiliates  restricting the interest rate the institution may pay on deposits  ordering a new election of directors of the institution  requiring that senior executive officers or directors be dismissed  prohibiting the institution from accepting deposits from correspondent banks  requiring the institution to divest certain subsidiaries  prohibiting the payment of principal or interest on subordinated debt  and ultimately  appointing a receiver for the institution 
dividends 
ots regulations impose limitations upon all capital distributions by thrifts  including cash dividends 
the rule establishes three tiers of institutions 
an institution that exceeds all fully phased in capital requirements before and after the proposed capital distribution tier institution could  after prior notice to  but without the approval of  the ots  make capital distributions during a calendar year of up to the higher of i of its net income to date during the calendar year plus the amount that would reduce by one half its surplus capital ratio the excess capital over its fully phased in capital requirements at the beginning of the calendar year  or ii of its net income over the most recent preceding four quarter period 
any additional capital distributions would require prior regulatory approval 
as of september   the bank was a tier institution 
the payment of dividends by any financial institution or its holding company is affected by the requirement to maintain adequate capital pursuant to applicable capital adequacy guidelines and regulations 
as described above  the bank exceeded its minimum capital requirements under applicable guidelines as of september  further  under applicable regulations of the ots  the bank may not pay dividends in an amount which would reduce its capital below the amount required for the liquidation account established in connection with the bank s conversion from the mutual to the stock form of ownership in for the year ended september   approximately million was paid as dividends to the company by the bank 
insider transactions 
the bank is subject to certain restrictions imposed by the federal reserve act on any extensions of credit to the company and its subsidiaries  on investments in the stock or other securities of the company and its subsidiaries and the acceptance of the stock or other securities of the company or its subsidiaries as collateral for loans 
certain limitations and reporting requirements are also placed on extensions of credit by the bank to its directors and officers  to directors and officers of the company and its subsidiaries  to principal stockholders of the company  and to related interests of such directors  officers and principal stockholders 
in addition  such legislation and regulations may affect the terms upon which any person becoming a director or officer of the company or one of its subsidiaries or a principal stockholder of the company may obtain credit from banks with which the bank maintains a correspondent relationship 
safety and soundness standards 
the ots has adopted guidelines which establish operational and managerial standards to promote the safety and soundness of savings associations 
the guidelines set forth standards for internal controls  information systems  internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  compensation  fees and benefits  asset quality and earnings 
in general  the guidelines prescribe the goals to be achieved in each area  and each institution is responsible for establishing its own procedures to achieve those goals 
if an institution fails to comply with any of the standards set forth in the guidelines  the ots may require the institution to submit a plan for achieving and maintaining compliance 
the preamble to the guidelines states that the ots expects to require a compliance plan from an institution whose failure to meet one or more of the guidelines is of such severity that it could threaten the safety and soundness of the institution 
failure to submit an acceptable plan  or failure to comply with a plan that has been accepted by the ots  would constitute grounds for further enforcement action
