results of operations continued general operating environment dresser is a fully integrated manufacturer and supplier of products and services to customers in the oil and gas industry 
the company produces a broad range of highly engineered products for hydrocarbon exploration  drilling  production  transmission and processing activities 
dresser also provides engineering  procurement and project management services for all aspects of the energy business 
operations are organized into three segments petroleum products and services  engineering services and energy equipment 
descriptions of the segments are contained in note n to consolidated financial statements 
the business environment for petroleum products and services is directly effected by prices for oil and natural gas  drilling activity and exploration and production spending by oil and natural gas producers 
in  the average posted price of west texas intermediate crude oil rose approximately percent to per barrel while the average spot price of natural gas declined percent to per million btus 
overall  the rig count declined percent in fiscal the rig count in north america was down percent reflecting a decline in wells drilled for natural gas  while the rig count in international markets increased percent reflecting higher activity levels in major producing regions like south america  africa and the north sea 
the business environment for engineering services and energy equipment is affected by numerous factors  including global and regional economic growth rates  the prices of oil and natural gas  the supply and demand for products created from hydrocarbons including gasoline  jet fuel  ethylene  petrochemicals  chemicals  fertilizers and power 
these factors determine the capital spending budgets  both upstream and downstream  of integrated oil and gas companies around the world 
according to published sources  economic growth is expected to continue at an average of percent or better for developing countries and percent or better for developed countries 
developing country growth expectations are due largely to steadily increasing population and greater industrialization that also will generate sharply rising per capita energy demand 
increasingly  consumption of oil and natural gas is expected to be driven by rising demand for refined products  petrochemicals  fertilizers and power 
capital and maintenance spending for downstream hydrocarbon processing projects is expected to increase to billion in  up from a projected billion in recent project award activity has increased for ethylene and fertilizer projects 
global project activity in hit its highest level  projects since internationally  project activity is currently at its highest level since consolidated results compared to net earnings in before the accounting change were million per share compared to million per share in excluding the effect of the special items discussed above 
this represents a earnings per share increase 
results of operations continued consolidated results continued compared to continued revenues of billion were up million or over the petroleum products and services segment revenues increased million or 
the engineering services segment revenues increased million or 
the energy equipment segment revenues increased million or 
segment operating profit of million increased million or from the petroleum products and services segment and the energy equipment segment were up while the engineering services segment was down versus see the industry segment analysis for discussion of changes in revenues and operating profit 
general corporate expenses of million were million higher than in the increase was primarily due to gains on sales of interests in m i drilling fluids company and iri international  inc net interest expense increased million to million primarily because of lower interest income due to a lower level of short term investments 
the effective income tax rate for was compared to an overall rate of in in  a lower tax basis on the investment in western atlas international  inc  compared to the book basis  resulted in a tax charge of million or on the book gain on sale 
the additional taxes on the gain on sale of western atlas were somewhat offset by the million of special tax benefits recognized upon sale of investment in iri international  inc excluding these two transactions  the effective rate for was 
minority interest provision was million  down million from the decrease was primarily attributable to the share in lower earnings of dresser rand 
compared to revenues were billion in compared to billion in petroleum products and services revenues were lower primarily due to the inclusion of both m i drilling fluids and baroid drilling fluids in  while included m i drilling fluids for only four months 
that decrease was more than offset by higher revenues by the other two segments 
revenues include the company s share of earnings of unconsolidated affiliates  which was down million in mostly attributable to million in for western atlas 
excluding the special items described earlier  net earnings decreased million to million 
segment operating profit for was million lower compared to however  included the results of western atlas million  the impact of a full year of m i drilling fluids earnings million and the favorable impact of a lifo inventory adjustment million at ingersoll dresser pump idp 
accordingly  comparable segment operating profit increased million  reflecting high levels of drilling activity in north america and strong levels of demand for certain of the company s energy equipment products 
see the industry segment analysis for a discussion of the results of each segment 
results of operations continued consolidated results continued compared to continued general corporate expenses declined million to million  reflecting lower self insurance costs and lower ongoing expenses associated with previously divested businesses 
net interest expense declined million primarily due to the investment of the proceeds from the sale of western atlas and m i drilling fluids 
other items impacting comparability of to include a non recurring gain of million in resulting from a change in the company s retiree medical benefit plan and an increase in goodwill amortization of million in associated with the bredero price  tk valve and axelson acquisitions 
the overall effective income tax rate was in both and excluding the impact of the western atlas and iri international  inc transactions described earlier and the impact of the other special items in both years  the effective rate was for and minority interest expense was million lower in primarily due to the sale of m i drilling fluids company  which had a minority owner 
industry segment analysis see details of financial information by industry segment and geographic area on pages through petroleum products and services drilling and production operations revenues of billion in were million or percent higher than levels 
excluding the revenues of m i drilling fluids  which was sold in february  revenues increased million or 
operating profit of million was million higher than excluding the impact of m i drilling fluids  operating profit increased million or over the operating margin improved to percent of sales from percent in  or percent excluding m i 
all geographic sectors improved in  in particular latin america and the north sea where drilling activity was greater than in the prior fiscal year 
although each operating division improved  the majority of the gains in sales and operating profit were attributable to baroid drilling fluids and sperry sun drilling services 
baroid revenues increased percent due to higher activity in major producing regions including the north sea  latin america and the gulf of mexico 
in addition  new market penetration of products developed within the last five years  including petrofree and dril n drilling systems  contributed to the performance 
sperry sun s revenues improved percent reflecting increasing demand  coupled with higher system capacity and utilization rates  for measurement while drilling and directional drilling services in most major markets 
in addition  new products including slim phase  lateral tie back system ltbs and underbalanced drilling contributed to the improvement 
results of operations continued industry segment analysis continued petroleum products and services continued drilling and production operations continued revenues for security dbs rose percent  reflecting an increase in international sales of roller cone drill bits 
operating profit improved significantly reflecting successful restructuring and manufacturing cycle time reductions 
dresser oil tools benefited from strong sales in canada and international markets as well as cost savings from the consolidation of manufacturing and sales and distribution operations 
new product introductions also contributed to the improvement 
despite a weak canadian market  the dresser wheatley division benefited from the marketing of additional dresser products 
revenues of billion in were down million compared to excluding the revenues of m i drilling fluids  revenues increased million or 
the increase in revenues was due to the acquisition of axelson in december and an increase in north american drilling activity in versus revenues from north american markets increased in  reflecting strength in the gulf of mexico and canada 
operating profit of million in was million higher than excluding the impact of m i drilling fluids  operating profit was up million or over the strong performance in north american drilling markets led to substantial increases in operating profit for sperry sun and baroid drilling fluids 
the acquisition of axelson as well as a million reduction in overhead costs resulting from the baroid merger also contributed to the increase 
these improvements more than offset the decline in operating profit from international markets and lower earnings attributable to costs associated with the combination of guiberson ava with axelson and security with dbs 
kellogg oil and gas services revenues and operating profit declined million and million  respectively  in compared to a cyclical downturn in the bredero price pipecoating business in the north sea and the far east resulted in significantly lower revenues and operating profit in however  bredero price s backlog of million at october  is up substantially from the million level at october  primarily due to a million project in the north sea which will be performed over the next four years 
bredero price has also entered key markets in the western hemisphere  particularly the united states and latin america 
prior to  bredero price had no activity in these markets 
the combination of higher backlogs plus new positions in previously unserved markets are expected to result in significantly improved performance for bredero price over the next three to five years 
the sub sea underwater engineering operations had higher revenues and operating profits in as the result of improvements in both the north sea and gulf of mexico  combined with the impact of three business acquisitions made during these acquisitions  which include north sea assets  subtec international and wellstream a manufacturer of flexible pipe and riser systems  are expected to generate revenues of approximately million during results of operations continued industry segment analysis continued petroleum products and services continued kellogg oil and gas services continued revenues of million in were higher than levels  with operating profit up over the increase in revenues resulted from the inclusion of bredero price for a full year in versus nine months in and higher sub sea project activity in the pacific region 
the increase in operating profit was negatively impacted by i a bredero price high margin equipment sale in that did not recur in and ii sub sea s increased engineering and operational staff expenses in both the united states and the north sea combined with higher than anticipated job costs on a project in australia

kellogg revenues of billion in rose percent from billion in major improvement in activity occurred in north america  latin america and europe 
these gains were partially offset by lower activity in the far east reflecting the wind down of projects in malaysia  africa and the middle east 
petrochemicals and gas processing activity accounted for much of the pick up in activity in the united states and europe 
m

kellogg operating profit in declined percent due principally to lower equity income of million from mw kellogg s investment in bufete industriale  sa de sa  a major mexican engineering and construction firm 
operating profit for also included a gain of million from the sale of one third of its investment in bufete  and the results included a gain of million associated with an initial public offering of bufete 
excluding the impact of bufete  operating profit in increased percent 
revenues of billion in were higher than in  but operating profit was down compared to excluding bufete 
the decrease in operating profit was primarily the result of achieving significant milestones on several large contracts in that were substantially completed that year 
although backlog of billion at october  was down from the year ago level  kellogg s backlog at december  had increased to approximately billion  reflecting major project bookings that occurred after fiscal year end 
energy equipment compression and pumping revenues and operating profit from compression and pumping operations both fell approximately percent in compared to dresser rand revenues declined million or to billion as a cyclical downturn in the compression industry resulted in lower volumes of complete units and repair parts during the first half of the year and from the impact of a major multi year gas compression project in venezuela that was completed early in fiscal in  of dresser results of operations continued industry segment analysis continued energy equipment continued compression and pumping continued rand s revenues were from markets outside of north america 
an increase in revenues in the united states and the far east were more than offset by declines attributable to the factors noted above 
dresser rand operating profit of million was down million from all markets were affected by margin pressure on complete unit sales  especially the far east 
cost reduction programs and the benefits associated with higher levels of production during the year partially offset the decline in margin 
dresser rand set a record for booking new orders during at billion 
bookings exceeded the prior year in virtually all product groups 
major orders for pipeline compressors  oil and gas production  ethylene  petrochemicals and refining bolstered backlogs of turbo products  compression service packages and steam turbine units 
overall  backlog of million at october  reflected a increase over dresser rand revenues of billion in increased from a year earlier due primarily to a increase in revenues from markets outside north america  particularly in the eastern hemisphere 
this primarily reflected the shipment of prior year backlog of centrifugal products and compression services 
operating profit continued strong at million but was down from million in due to restructuring and early retirement costs as well as margin pressure on complete unit sales 
dresser rand revenues from outside of north american markets were in compared to in operating profit from north america was essentially unchanged  with strong results from the field gas market offsetting a decline in the centrifugal products market 
internationally  significant improvements in operating profit in venezuela and the north sea only partially offset declines in continental europe and the middle east resulting from margin pressure on complete unit sales 
earnings from the owned ingersoll dresser pump idp joint venture were million in  million in and million in the improvement in compared to was primarily related to a continuing decline of costs associated with the formation of the joint venture 
the results included million of earnings from the release of lifo inventory reserves related to inventory contributed to idp by the company and sold by idp to third parties 
measurement measurement operation revenues of million in were million or higher than levels 
however  operating profit was essentially unchanged at million compared to million in although the wayne fuel dispensing division enjoyed improved sales in europe and south america  margins were negatively impacted by cost and pricing pressures in the results of operations continued industry segment analysis continued measurement continued us market  resulting in lower overall operating profit in the instrument division reported a revenue increase and a slight improvement in operating profit 
earnings from higher activity in south america and new product introductions were offset by a decline in europe and the effect of increased spending in the marketing and research and development areas 
sales and operating profit in improved and  respectively  over the wayne division contributed the majority of the improvement in with very strong performances in the us and scandinavia 
the instrument division also saw improved results in from higher sales volumes and the impact of a small acquisition in germany in early fiscal flow control flow control revenues of million were million or higher than operating profit of million was million or higher than the acquisition of grove spa in june was the major reason for the year to year increase in revenues and operating profit 
the valve and controls division performed ahead of as a result of increased project related orders in and the cost savings realized from the restructuring in europe 
revenues and operating profit declined and  respectively  in compared to the valve and controls division accounted for the majority of this decrease  as the lingering impact of an economic recession in europe ultimately resulted in a significant downsizing of its european operations 
power systems power systems operations operating profit improved in on a revenue increase 
waukesha division revenues of million increased million or  with a slight improvement in operating profit 
the sales improvement was primarily in the lower margin power generation market  and higher new product development costs also impacted operating profit in the roots division saw operating profit improve million on essentially flat sales of million 
the earnings improvement was primarily the result of a major reengineering effort to improve its manufacturing cost structure during the year 
revenues and operating profit improved and  respectively  in as compared to these improvements primarily came from the waukesha division where significant volume increases were realized in the higher margin gas compression market
