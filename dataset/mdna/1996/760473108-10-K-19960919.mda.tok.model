item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general consolidated results during fiscal  the company achieved record results in consolidated net sales  operating profits  and net income 
net sales increased and net income from to the company has now enjoyed five years of continuous improvement and solid growth in its results of operations 
these improvements are reflected in the following selected financial data in thousands net sales    operating profit    operating margin net income    income per share 
return on average capital employed recycled paperboard operations the company s recycled paperboard segment includes recycled paperboard mills at hutchinson  kansas  commerce city  colorado and halltown  west virginia 
additionally  the segment includes reclaimed paper fiber recycling centers at kansas city  missouri  topeka  kansas and denver  colorado 
total shipments of recycled paperboard from the company s recycled paperboard mills increased from to and from to the increase in shipments from to was primarily due to the acquisition of halltown paperboard company  halltown  west virginia  on june  this mill is currently operating at approximately of capacity or about  tons per year 
the facility has the capability to produce approximately  tons per year 
the company recently installed new production equipment at the halltown mill to enable it to produce recycled paperboard for a new product market previously untapped by the mill 
this market includes composite cans  tubes  and cores as well as other consumer and industrial packaging products similar to those produced by the company s other recycled paperboard mills 
shipments by the company s other recycled paperboard mills increased from to due to greater shipments of gypsum linerboard to external and intercompany customers 
from to  even though there was only a increase in total shipments  shipments to unaffiliated customers increased 
net sales of the entire recycled paperboard segment increased from to and from to the halltown paperboard company acquisition was  again  the primary factor influencing net sales from to the acquisition of two reclaimed paper recycling centers in kansas city  missouri and topeka  kansas during resulted in a large portion of the increase from to the recycled paperboard segment now accounts for approximately of net sales prior to eliminations 
net sales during fiscal were affected adversely by a reduction in the average net selling prices of reclaimed paper fiber sold by the company s paper recycling centers 
conversely  the large increase in net sales of recycled paperboard from to was  in large part  the result of rising selling prices for the product in response to sharp increases in the cost of reclaimed paper  the principal raw material component utilized in the manufacture of recycled paperboard 
operating profits for the segment were  in  as compared to  in and  in a significant improvement in operating margins and the contribution of the halltown mill were the major factors affecting in  it was operating profit at the reclaimed fiber centers that accounted for the improvement from the prior year 
the relationship between average variable per unit manufacturing costs and average net selling prices for recycled paperboard improved significantly from fiscal to raw material costs  principally reclaimed paper fiber  increased approximately  during fiscal even though the company was able to raise selling prices during fiscal  there was generally a one to three month delay between rising material costs and subsequent selling price increases 
conversely  during fiscal  the company enjoyed a significant reduction in the cost of reclaimed fiber  approximately 
overall  recycled paperboard per unit variable production costs declined from fiscal to according to one industry publication  from june through june  the price for old corrugated containers occ and double lined kraft dlk  two principal reclaimed fiber grades utilized by recycled paperboard mills  decreased from per ton and per ton  respectively  to per ton and per ton 
this compares to per ton for occ and per ton for dlk in june as there was a lag in raising selling prices in fiscal to cover the increases in raw material costs  there also was a lag in selling price reduction as raw material costs declined 
this resulted in operating margins of for the recycled paperboard segment in fiscal versus in fiscal management anticipates that the relationship between average net selling prices and average variable per unit manufacturing costs for recycled paperboard will be less favorable in fiscal than it was during as denoted earlier  the recycled paperboard operations segment includes the results of three reclaimed paper recycling centers located in kansas city  missouri  topeka  kansas and denver  colorado 
the denver facility began operations early this year 
these integrated operations ensure that adequate supplies of raw materials are available to the recycled paperboard mills 
in fiscal  the reclaimed paper recycling centers supplied approximately of the company s reclaimed paper requirements for the paperboard mills 
this compares to in and in the recycling centers in kansas city  missouri and topeka  kansas operated only one quarter of fiscal the recycling operations shipped of its total production to outside customers in fiscal  in  and in the company will continue to sell a major portion of its reclaimed paper fiber to unaffiliated customers 
the company believes that each paper recycling facility should operate as a profit center and ship its products to the markets most favorable to the center  while the company s paperboard mills purchase a significant portion of their raw material requirements from other nearby suppliers at delivered costs which are equal to or less than is available from internal sources of supply 
uncertainties about reclaimed paper fiber costs and supply are two primary factors which could affect the company s results in the future 
during fiscal  demand was strong throughout the entire paper industry for reclaimed paper fiber 
the company  even during this period of extreme demand  was able to procure adequate supplies for its operations 
during fiscal  reclaimed paper supplies were again plentiful 
during periods of short supply  the recycling centers help to ensure the availability of adequate reclaimed paper supplies for the company s recycled paperboard mills 
according to statistics compiled by the american forest and paper association  an industry trade association  production of recycled paperboard grew at an annual rate of during calendar year this compares to an overall growth rate of 
for the entire paper industry 
the demand for recycled paperboard continues to rise  perhaps fueled by greater environmental awareness by the public 
this demand has spurred the construction of several new recycled paperboard mills in the last few years 
however  these mills were designed and built to produce recycled containerboard 
historically  even during periods of excess capacity in the container board segment of the industry  there has not been much crossover competition by these mills for shipments to the company s traditional product markets 
there can be no assurance this will continue to be the case 
additionally  the construction of these new recycled paperboard mills  coupled with the ever increasing use of recycled paper fiber by traditional wood pulp mills  could further restrict the supply of reclaimed paper fiber available to the company 
substitution of plastics and even virgin paperboard for recycled paperboard are additional possibilities which could affect the company s results in the future 
the cost of fuel  principally natural gas and coal  is also a potential concern to the company because of its relative importance as a component of the variable cost of production 
from fiscal to fiscal  variable utility costs per unit decreased slightly 
from fiscal to fiscal utility costs again decreased  approximately 
the prevailing market price for natural gas rose during the last half of fiscal and may continue that upward trend 
some analysts have indicated the late increase was due to a harsh winter in many areas of the country 
however  the company s manufacturing facilities are located in areas of the country where natural gas or coal is plentiful 
the company believes its fuel cost  on average  should at least be comparable to its competitors 
the company began in fiscal  a five year plan for capital expansion and upgrades at two of its recycled paperboard mills located in hutchinson  kansas and denver  colorado 
the plan included the necessary equipment to increase productivity at the two mills by one third or an increase of approximately  tons per year 
additionally  the plan focused on improved product quality expectations as well as efficiency improvements 
this capital upgrade program is scheduled to be completed by the end of fiscal gypsum wallboard operations the company s gypsum wallboard operations include a gypsum wallboard manufacturing facility located in duke  oklahoma as well as remote public warehouses located in birmingham  alabama and cincinnati  ohio 
additionally  the company operates a short line railroad which connects to three major carriers miles from its plant  enabling the company to ship economically to distant markets 
the gypsum wallboard segment of the company enjoyed a increase in total shipments from fiscal to  a new record 
shipments grew from mmsf in to mmsf in the increase in shipments is attributable to a capital expansion upgrade to the production line in fiscal  with additional fine tuning in net selling prices for gypsum wallboard were essentially unchanged from period to period 
this compares to a increase in shipments and increase in net selling prices from to the following table indicates a strong housing construction industry which strongly influences wallboard shipments 
in millions year ended housing december starts although housing starts nationally decreased from to  the company did not experience any reduction in shipments to its traditional markets 
housing start estimates for and generally approximate the levels 
recently  interest rates have risen slightly 
the construction industry  and particularly the single multi family sector  is sensitive to interest rate changes 
strong demand continued to influence operating profits in operating margins averaged during fiscal compared to in and in operating profits in this segment decreased slightly from million in fiscal to million in this compares to an operating profit of million in fiscal manufacturing costs per unit were slightly higher in compared to per unit variable costs rose from to primarily caused by a sharp increase in the cost of recycled gypsum paperboard  the largest single component in the variable per unit cost of production 
there are items which could adversely affect the gypsum wallboard segment 
as with the recycled paperboard operations utility costs  principally natural gas  are a significant cost factor in the production of gypsum wallboard 
variable per unit utility costs decreased from to and from to the cost of natural gas  as previously stated under recycled paperboard operations has risen as of late 
additionally  mining costs influence manufacturing costs 
the company believes it has sufficient gypsum reserves but costs associated with removal and quality of ore may increase as quarrying operations continue in the current quarry location 
other factors which may influence future results include the possibility that new gypsum wallboard manufacturing facilities may be constructed to take advantage of the currently strong demand for wallboard 
two previously idled gypsum wallboard plants have been re opened in the last three years 
the company believes it operates one of the most efficient gypsum manufacturing facilities in north america due to line speed  mining and ore costs  and location 
the company will continue striving to improve the quality and efficiencies of the facility  in order to remain competitive under all construction market conditions 
other during fiscal  selling and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales were as compared to in and in increased costs associated with the acquisition of halltown paperboard company  halltown  west virginia in june of and the start up of a reclaimed paper fiber production facility in denver  colorado in early fiscal contributed significantly to the overhead burden of the company 
additionally  a increase in net sales from fiscal to fiscal added certain costs such as sales commissions and incentives 
a substantial increase in interest expense totalling  in is associated with a  loan for the purchase of substantially all the assets of halltown paperboard company  halltown  west virginia on june  the company s effective tax rate was in fiscal  in and in the company anticipates an effective income tax rate during fiscal near the range experienced the prior three years 
environmental matters in connection with the company s preparation for a warehouse addition to its paperboard mill located in commerce city  colorado  a suburb of denver  the company discovered and has been investigating the presence of subsurface petroleum hydrocarbons 
the company retained an environmental consultant who concluded that fuel oil  jet fuel and gasoline additives had migrated in the subsurface of the company s property from an adjacent property 
the company has conducted its own investigations  and the adjacent property owner has conducted its own investigations 
additionally  the company and the adjacent owner have jointly sponsored investigations 
discussions between the parties continue 
the company has completed the construction of the warehouse addition under approval of the colorado department of health 
at this time  the company has not ascertained the future liability  if any  of the above matter 
environmental expenditures directly related to this matter were  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal these costs were included in selling and administrative expenses 
due to the complexity of the environmental laws  rules and policies currently applicable to the company and the uncertainty about future changes in such laws and regulations  the company maintains accounting reserves for future unexpected expenses of the nature and magnitude incurred during the past three years 
effect of inflation management believes that general inflation has not had a material impact on the company s net sales or operating income the last three fiscal years 
the cost of reclaimed paper fiber  which is the principle raw material component utilized in the manufacture of recycled paperboard rose significantly during fiscal years and conversely  the cost of reclaimed fiber decreased substantially during fiscal the company believes these shifts were caused by changes in supply and demand and not general inflation or deflation 
liquidity and capital resources the following is a summary of certain financial statistics related to the liquidity and financial condition of the company for the three fiscal years ended june  in thousands working capital    current ratio cash and cash equivalents  plus investments marketable securities    net cash provided by operating activities    additions to property  plant and equipment    dividends paid    long term debt including current portion   total capital employed    the company s working capital increased million from fiscal to fiscal cash  cash equivalents  investments and marketable securities increased million from to net cash provided by operations increased from million in to million in additions to plant  property and equipment  excluding the acquisitions of the kansas city  missouri and topeka  kansas recycling centers in fiscal and halltown paperboard company  halltown  west virginia in fiscal  were million in  million in and million in fiscal on june   the company purchased substantially all the assets of halltown paperboard company  halltown  west virginia and financed the acquisition by securing million in long term bank financing  which is to be repaid in semiannual installments over the next six years 
at the same time  the company entered into a million revolving credit facility 
to date  no amounts have been borrowed against the credit facility which expires june  management believes that cash and investments  internally generated funds  supplemented as needed by advances under the working capital line of credit  will be sufficient to meet the company s short term working capital requirements 
cash dividends paid to common stockholders were million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal quarterly dividends have historically been paid in the months of september  december  march  and june  but are  in each case  subject to board approval 
the board of directors of the company has approved new budgeted capital expenditures of million for fiscal cash provided by operations and existing cash balances should be sufficient to fund these expenditures
