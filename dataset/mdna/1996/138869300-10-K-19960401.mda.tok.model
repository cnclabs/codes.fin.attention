item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations compared to the company recorded a net loss of million  or per share  on revenues of million in  compared to a net loss of million  or per share  on revenues of million in the results were principally impacted by lower gold production  a provision for final site restoration costs  and the writedown of remaining carrying values at the kendall mine 
active mining of new ore at kendall ceased in january   with production of  ounces realized from continued leaching of all previously mined ore 
as a result  substantially lower revenues of million were realized during  a decrease from the million in revenues during the company sold  ounces of gold and  ounces of silver in at an average realized price of per equivalent gold ounce 
comparable amounts in were  ounces of gold and  ounces of silver at an average price of per equivalent gold ounce 
the new york commodity exchange comex gold prices averaged per ounce in and per ounce in all ounces sold in were at spot prices  in contrast to sales in which included  ounces settled with spot deferred contracts averaging per ounce and  ounces delivered against a gold loan monetized at per ounce 
as a result of the hedging program and gold deliveries in  the company recognized lower revenues of  relative to spot prices in effect on the settlement dates 
cost of sales was million in as compared to million in cost of sales per ounce at kendall in increased to as compared to in due to the lower production levels associated with cessation of mining of new ore 
included in cost of sales for and are all direct and indirect costs of mining  crushing  processing and general and administrative expenses of the mine  including normal provisions for reclamation of million for each year 
in addition  the company recorded a fourth quarter charge for remaining final site restoration at kendall of million as a consequence of reviewing and updating its anticipated scope of work to achieve mine closure 
depreciation  depletion  and amortization was lower during due principally to lower ounces sold from the kendall mine 
effective october   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
concurrent with adoption  the company has determined that its carrying value for property and equipment at the kendall mine is not recoverable  due principally to the maturing life of the mine remaining economic life of one year and the level of site restoration costs anticipated during the next two to three years to achieve mine closure 
as estimated cash outflows exceed estimated cash inflows  the company has reduced the carrying value to zero and recorded a fourth quarter impairment of selling  general and administrative expenses were million in as compared to million in the increase was due primarily to increased corporate activity for business development and to increased diatomite sales and corresponding support levels 
exploration costs expensed  almost entirely foreign related  decreased by million to million in during the current year  the company closed its mendoza  argentina office and focused principally on opportunities in brazil and africa 
abandonments of million in were in the ordinary course of business  and related principally to properties in latin america 
interest income was marginally lower in  as higher yields partially offset the effects of lower investible balances 
interest expense was lower in the current period as a gold loan was not outstanding for the full year 
in addition  interest expense associated with the company s debentures declined due to voluntary conversions of  principal during the year 
there was no current or deferred provision for income taxes during or the company computes deferred taxes according to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas 
sfas requires deferred income taxes to be computed under the asset and liability method and to be adjusted to and maintained thereafter at statutory rates in effect when the taxes are expected to be paid 
sfas also requires that a valuation allowance be provided if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
although the company maintains significant net deferred tax assets  principally in the form of operating loss carry forwards  the company did not record a deferred tax credit in either or due to an assessment of the more likely than not realization criteria required by sfas inflation did not have a material impact on operations in or management of the company does not anticipate that inflation will have a significant impact on continuing operations 
compared to the company recorded a net loss of million  or per share  on revenues of million in  compared to net income of million  or per share  on revenues of million in the results were adversely affected by higher interest expense and exploration costs  as compared to revenues of million were realized from the sale of gold  silver  and diatomite products during  representing a decrease from the million in revenues during the company sold  ounces of gold and  ounces of silver in at an average realized price of per equivalent gold ounce 
the new york commodity exchange comex gold price averaged per ounce in comparable amounts in were  ounces of gold and  ounces of silver at an average realized price of per equivalent gold ounce and a comex average of per ounce 
as a condition of a gold loan secured in may  the company was required to hedge a portion of the kendall mine s future production to ensure adequate cash flow for repayment of the obligation 
accordingly  the company entered into spot deferred contracts totalling  ounces of gold at prices ranging from per ounce to per ounce 
during   ounces were settled at an average price of per ounce 
in addition   ounces were delivered against the gold loan at a monetized price of per ounce 
during  the company settled  ounces at an average price of per ounce and delivered  ounces against the gold loan 
as a result of the hedging programs and gold loan deliveries  the company recognized lower revenues of  and  in and  respectively  relative to spot prices in effect on the settlement dates 
cost of sales was million in as compared to million in cost of sales per ounce at kendall in was as compared to in  representing a increase 
the higher unit costs were due principally to lower ore tons and ounces mined  and therefore lower production levels  and higher strip ratios of the ores mined 
included in cost of sales for and are all direct and indirect costs of mining  crushing  processing  and general and administrative expenses of the mine  including provisions for reclamation of million and million  respectively 
the higher reclamation accrual in was due to a fourth quarter revision to the anticipated cost of final site restoration 
although higher metal prices were realized  lower production levels resulted in a decline of kendall s operating earnings defined as sales less cost of sales to million as compared to million in the prior period 
depreciation  depletion and amortization was higher during than due principally to an increase in the capital base at kendall and the resulting dd a rate to per ounce in from per ounce in other company dd a charges increased marginally in as well  due to current year capital additions 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in as compared to million in the increase was due to a higher corporate costs of million  b increased diatomite sales and corresponding support levels million  and c cost of establishing and maintaining an office in mendoza  argentina to support exploration activities million 
exploration costs expensed in were million as compared to million in and reflect the commencement of a worldwide exploration effort 
foreign activity in totalled million with a focus on exploration opportunities in central and south america  africa and the pacific rim 
us spending was a nominal million in abandonments in resulted in a nominal charge of million as compared to million in the prior year amount related principally to properties in the moccasin and judith mountains in montana 
interest income was higher in due to higher average cash balances 
interest expense was higher in the current period due to a full year of interest expense on the company s million  interest  subordinated convertible debentures which were sold in june during  million of principal was converted to  shares of common stock 
there was no current provision for income taxes in the prior period amount was a credit of  reflecting an adjustment to the company s estimate of its alternative minimum tax liability 
inflation did not have a material impact on operations in or liquidity capital resources summary the company s cash and cash equivalents decreased million during to million at year end 
the decrease was a result of cash outflows from operations of million  million of cash spent on investing activities  and million of cash used in financing activities 
operating activities operations used million of cash in in contrast to providing cash of million and million in and  respectively 
the decreasing trend is principally a result of declining production and sales of gold from the kendall mine  now in its final year of economic life 
investing activities capital expenditures in totaled million 
major components included million at briggs  of which million were financed by drawings under a loan facility  approximately million for the company s share of costs on the mcdonald project  relating principally to permitting  million at the company s diatomite operations  million on foreign exploration properties  with the remaining amount spent on miscellaneous projects

within three years of project completion approximately months beyond construction completion and start up an additional  ounces of recoverable reserves must be identified or of excess cash flow after scheduled repayments will be applied as additional prepayments against the loan amounts 
as a condition of the loan  a portion of the briggs mine s future production was hedged to ensure adequate cash flow for repayment of the obligation 
accordingly  fixed forward contracts totalling  ounces were entered into at prices ranging from per ounce to per ounce 
in addition  put options on  ounces at a strike price of per ounce were purchased 
the put options were financed by the sale of call options on  ounces at a strike price of per ounce

the company has fully accrued the expected reclamation costs as of december  during  the company expects to contribute approximately million to fund its share of expenditures for the mcdonald project  principally relating to ongoing permitting and support activities 
the permitting process will be rigorous and is expected to take a minimum of months from the initial filing of the plan of operations in november the company s overall exploration objectives in will be to seek quality joint venture partners for several of its foreign properties and focus internally on exploring and drilling within and adjacent to the briggs claim block and select foreign properties  particularly in brazil 
these expenditures are expected to total million 
financing on march   the company completed a private placement in the amount of million million net of expenses 
the offering was completed at a price of per unit which included one share of common stock  total shares and one half warrant  total warrants 
each whole warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price equal to per share 
the warrants expire on march  the company intends to file a registration statement under the securities and exchange act of in respect of the common shares  the warrants  and the common shares underlying the warrants and use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective as soon as practical 
in the event that the registration statement does not become effective on or before the th day following the completion of the private placement  each purchaser of units will be issued an additional of one common share and of one warrant for each unit purchased 
the company s planned use of proceeds are for exploring properties within and in proximity to the briggs claim block  continuing to fund its share of expenditures on the mcdonald project  exploration work on select foreign properties  particularly in brazil  and for general corporate purposes 
this financing is expected to adequately capitalize the company for the next two years consistent with its present objectives 
the company engages in an ongoing evaluation of opportunities in the mining business which may require other uses or additions of capital which cannot be predicted at this time 
in addition  the company  upon successful completion of the permitting process at the mcdonald project  will be required to fund its share of construction costs in order to maintain its present ownership level 
the company s share of these costs may exceed million  which will require additional financing from external sources 
gold prices and hedging the company s revenues  earnings and cash flow are strongly influenced by world gold prices  which fluctuate widely and over which the company has no control 
the company s strategy is to provide an acceptable floor price for a portion of its production in order to meet minimum coverage ratios as required by loan facilities while providing participation in potentially higher prices 
production not subject to loan covenants has historically been sold at spot prices 
the company s hedging program for consists of forwards and put options with approximately of estimated total production hedged at an average price of per ounce 
the risks of hedging include opportunity risk by limiting unilateral participation in upward prices  production risk associated with delivering physical ounces against a forward commitment  and credit risk associated with counterparties to the hedged transaction 
the company believes its production risk is minimal  and furthermore has the flexibility to selectively extend maturity dates  thereby postponing delivery against forward commitments 
with regard to credit risk  the company uses only creditworthy counterparties and does not anticipate non performance by such counterparties 
environmental regulation in  the montana state legislature passed legislation which streamlined the permitting process of new industrial projects by reorganizing the several state agencies that had jurisdiction over environmental permitting into one central agency  the new department of environmental quality deq 
this agency will be responsible for acting on an application for a hard rock mining operating permit in connection with a plan of operations filed by the seven up pete joint venture for the mcdonald gold project 
this permit  as well as several other local  state and federal permits  including a joint state and federal environmental impact statement eis  will be required before permits can be issued 
there are no assurances that all permits will be issued nor that  in the event they are issued  such issuances will be timely  nor that conditions contained in the permits will not be so onerous as to preclude construction and operation of the project 
the kendall mine in montana operates under permits granted by the deq 
the deq requires the company to maintain a  reclamation bond to ensure appropriate reclamation 
the company has filed a final closure plan which provides for enhanced measures not contemplated in the original permit 
the reclamation portion of the closure plan has been approved  however  the water quality and monitoring plans are still being reviewed 
release of bonding will only take place once the regulatory agencies are satisfied that all reclamation requirements have been met 
the us bureau of land management blm  inyo county  the california department of conservation  and the lahontan regional water quality control board lahontan have jointly required the company to post a reclamation bond in the amount of  to ensure appropriate reclamation of the briggs mine 
additionally  the company will be required by lahontan to post a  bond to ensure adequate funds to mitigate any foreseeable release of pollutants to state waters at least days prior to initiation of cyanide on the heap leach pads 
both bonds are subject to annual review and adjustment 
based upon current knowledge  the company believes that it is in material compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations as currently promulgated 
however  the exact nature of environmental control problems  if any  which the company may encounter in the future cannot be predicted  primarily because of the increasing number  complexity and changing character of environmental requirements that may be enacted or of the standards being promulgated by federal and state authorities 
federal legislation in  the united states congress passed the california desert protection act cdpa  resolving surface management classifications for large portions of blm managed lands in the desert areas of california 
the passing of the cdpa released lands around the briggs mine for multiple use management  significantly reducing constraints on exploration and mine operations 
no congressional legislation was enacted in to modify the requirements applicable to mining claims on federal lands under the mining law of the timing and exact nature of any mining law changes cannot presently be predicted  however  the company will continue its active role in industry efforts to work with congress to achieve responsible changes to mining law 
the company is also continuing its present efforts to patent the briggs and diatomite claims into private ownership in accordance with the provisions of currently applicable law 
legal actions certain actions are pending with respect to permits issued for the briggs mine in california 
a local environmental group and the timbisha shoshone tribe have  appealed the bureau of land management s decision to approve the final environmental impact statement and plan of operations  petitioned the superior court of inyo county alleging violations of the california environmental quality act and the surface mining and reclamation act  and filed a challenge to the issuance of waste discharge requirements by the lahontan regional water quality board 
the company has vigorously defended its position in each of the proceedings and believes that all claims are without merit  however  there are no assurances regarding the outcome of these actions or the effects those outcomes might have on the company s ability to complete and operate the mine
