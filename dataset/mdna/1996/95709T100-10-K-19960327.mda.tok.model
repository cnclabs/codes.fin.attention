results of operations the following is an explanation of significant variations from prior year results in revenues  operating expenses  other income and deductions  interest charges  and preferred and preference dividend requirements 
the results of operations of the company exclude the activities related to the missouri properties following the sales of those properties in the first quarter of for additional information regarding the sales of the missouri properties and the pending litigation  see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
additional information relating to changes between years is provided in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenues the operating revenues of the company are based on sales volumes and rates authorized by certain state regulatory commissions and the ferc 
future natural gas and electric sales will be affected by weather conditions  competition from other sources of energy  competing fuel sources  customer conservation efforts  and the overall economy of the company s service area 
in march  in connection with the company s acquisition of kge  the kcc approved the elimination of the energy cost adjustment clause eca for most retail customers of the company effective april  the fuel costs are now included in base rates and were established at a level intended by the kcc to equal the projected average cost of fuel through august therefore  if the company wished to recover an increase in fuel cost above the projected average cost it would have to file a request for recovery in a rate filing with the kcc which request could be denied in whole or in part 
the company s fuel costs represented of its total operating expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
any increase in fuel costs from the projected average which the company did not recover through rates would impact the company s earnings 
the degree of any such impact would be affected by a variety of factors  however  and thus cannot now be predicted 
natural gas revenues were reduced as a result of the sales of the missouri properties 
the consolidated statements of income include revenues of million for the portion of the first quarter of prior to the sales of the missouri properties and revenues of million from the missouri properties for following the sales of the missouri properties  no revenues related to the missouri properties are included in the consolidated statements of income see note 
compared to electric revenues increased two percent in as a result of increased sales in all customer classes 
the increase is primarily attributable to a higher demand for air conditioning load during the summer months of compared to the company s service territory experienced normal temperatures during the summer of  but were more than warmer  based on cooling degree days  compared to the summer of the company has filed an electric rate reduction request with the kcc see note natural gas revenues decreased in primarily as a result of the sales of missouri properties in the first quarter of see note 
the company has filed a million rate increase request for its kansas natural gas properties with the kcc see note 
excluding natural gas sales related to the missouri properties  prior to the sales of those properties in the first quarter of  total natural gas revenues remained virtually unchanged in natural gas revenues increased from increased transportation sales and as available sales  but these increases were offset by decreased commercial and industrial sales and a lower unit cost of natural gas which is passed on to customers through the purchased gas adjustment pga 
as available gas is excess natural gas under contract that the company did not require for customer sales or storage that is typically sold to gas marketers 
according to the company s tariff  the nominal margin made on as available gas sales  is returned to customers through the pga and is reflected in wholesale sales of the company 
compared to electric revenues increased two percent during primarily as a result of a four percent increase in commercial and industrial electric sales 
residential electric sales increased one percent despite four percent cooler temperatures during the primary air conditioning load months of june  july  and august 
partially offsetting these increases in electric revenues was a decrease in wholesale and interchange sales as a result of higher than normal sales in to other utilities while their generating units were down due to the flooding of natural gas revenues and sales decreased significantly in as a result of the sales of the missouri properties as previously mentioned above 
also contributing to the decrease in natural gas revenues were reduced natural gas sales for space heating as a result of much warmer temperatures during the winter season of compared to operating expenses compared to total operating expenses decreased four percent in compared to the decrease is largely due to the sales of missouri properties  lower natural gas purchases resulting from lower sales  and lower fuel expense resulting from a lower unit cost of fuel used for generation 
partially offsetting this decrease were expenses related to an early retirement program 
in the second quarter of  million related to early retirement programs was recorded as an expense 
the company has filed a request with the kcc to increase the annual depreciation expense for wolf creek generating station see note 
the company anticipates its operating expenses including fuel expenses will increase in as a result of wolf creek being taken out of service for refueling and maintenance as discussed under fuel mix above 
compared to total operating expenses decreased during primarily as a result of the sales of the missouri properties see note 
also contributing to the decrease were lower fuel costs for electric generation and reduced natural gas purchases as a result of lower sales caused by milder winter temperatures in compared to partially offsetting the decreases in operating expenses was higher income tax expense 
as of december   kansas gas and electric company kge had fully amortized its deferred income tax reserves related to the allowance for borrowed funds used during construction capitalized for wolf creek generating station 
the completion of the amortization of these deferred income tax reserves increased income tax expense and reduced net income by approximately million in other income and deductions other income and deductions  net of taxes  decreased for the twelve months ended december  compared to as a result of the gain on the sales of missouri properties recorded in the first quarter of and additional interest expense on increased corporate owned life insurance coli borrowings 
partially offsetting this decrease was the recognition of income from death benefit proceeds under coli contracts during the fourth quarter of see notes and for discussion of current legislation affecting coli 
other income and deductions  net of taxes  was higher for the twelve months ended december  compared to due to the recognition of the gain on the sales of the missouri properties of approximately million  net of tax see note 
partially offsetting this increase was increased interest expense on coli borrowings 
also partially offsetting the increase was the recognition of income in from death benefit proceeds from coli policies 
interest charges and preferred and preference dividend requirements total interest charges increased three percent for the twelve months ended december   primarily due to higher debt balances and higher interest rates on short term borrowings and variable long term debt 
the company s embedded cost of long term debt increased to at december   compared to and at december  and higher interest rates on variable rate long term debt contributed to the slight increase in the cost of debt in compared to total interest charges decreased in compared to as a result of lower debt balances and the refinancing of higher cost debt  as well as increased coli borrowings  the interest on which is reflected in other income and deductions  on the consolidated statements of income 
partially offsetting these decreases in interest expense were higher interest rates on short term borrowings 
merger implementation in accordance with the kcc merger order  amortization of the acquisition adjustment commenced august the amortization will amount to approximately million pre tax per year for years 
the company can recover the amortization of the acquisition adjustment through cost savings under a sharing mechanism approved by the kcc 
based on the order issued by the kcc  with regard to the recovery of the acquisition premium  the company must achieve a level of savings on an annual basis considering sharing provisions of approximately million in order to recover the entire acquisition premium 
to the extent that the company s actual operations and maintenance expense is lower than the kcc stipulated index  the company will realize merger savings 
the company has calculated  in conformance with the kcc order  annual savings associated with the acquisition to be in excess of million for as management presently expects to continue this level of savings  the amount is expected to be sufficient to allow for the full recovery of the acquisition premium 
other information inflation under the ratemaking procedures prescribed by the regulatory commissions to which the company is subject  only the original cost of plant is recoverable in rates charged to customers 
therefore  because of inflation  present and future depreciation provisions are inadequate for purposes of maintaining the purchasing power invested by common shareholders and the related cash flows are inadequate for replacing property 
the impact of this ratemaking process on common shareholders is mitigated to the extent depreciable property is financed with debt that can be repaid with dollars of less purchasing power 
while the company has experienced relatively low inflation in the recent past  the cumulative effect of inflation on operating costs may require the company to seek regulatory rate relief to recover these higher costs 
environmental the company has taken a proactive position with respect to the potential environmental liability associated with former manufactured gas sites and has an agreement with the kansas department of health and environment to systematically evaluate these sites in kansas see note 
although the company currently has no phase i affected units under the clean air act of  the company has applied for and has been accepted for an early substitution permit to bring the co owned la cygne station under the phase i guidelines 
the oxides of nitrogen and toxic limits  which were not set in the law  were proposed by the epa in january the company is currently evaluating the steps it will need to take in order to comply with the proposed new rules  but is unable to determine its compliance options or related compliance costs until the evaluation is finished later this year 
the company will have three years to comply with the new rules 
see note 
competition as a regulated utility  the company currently has limited direct competition for retail electric service in its certified service area 
however  there is competition  based largely on price  from the generation  or potential generation  of electricity by large commercial and industrial customers  and independent power producers 
the energy policy act act requires increased efficiency of energy usage and has affected the way electricity is marketed 
the act also provides for increased competition in the wholesale electric market by permitting the ferc to order third party access to utilities transmission systems and by liberalizing the rules for ownership of generating facilities 
as part of the merger  the company agreed to open access of its transmission system for wholesale transactions 
during  wholesale electric revenues represented approximately nine percent of the company s total electric revenues 
operating in this competitive environment could place pressure on utility profit margins and credit quality 
wholesale and industrial customers may threaten to pursue cogeneration  self generation  retail wheeling  municipalization or relocation to other service territories in an attempt to obtain reduced energy costs 
increasing competition has resulted in credit rating agencies applying more stringent guidelines when making utility credit rating determinations see note for the effects of competition on statement of financial accounting standards no 

the company is providing competitive electric rates for industrial expansion projects and economic development projects in an effort to maintain and increase electric load 
during  the company will lose a major industrial customer to cogeneration resulting in a reduction to pre tax earnings of approximately to million annually 
this customer s decision to develop its own cogeneration project was based largely on factors other than energy cost 
to capitalize on opportunities in the non regulated natural gas industry  the company  through its wholly owned subsidiary mid continent market center  inc market center  has established a natural gas market center in kansas 
the market center  which began operations on july   provides natural gas transportation  storage  and gathering services  as well as balancing  and title transfer capability 
the company transferred certain natural gas transmission assets having a net book value of approximately million to the market center 
the market center will provide no notice natural gas transportation and storage services to the company under a long term contract
