item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company s common stock price may be subject to significant volatility 
for any given period  a shortfall in the company s announced revenue or earnings from the levels expected by securities analysts could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock 
the company may not learn of  nor be able to confirm  revenue or earnings shortfalls until late in the period or following the end of the period 
in general  the company participates in a very dynamic high technology industry  which can result in significant fluctuations in the company s common stock price at any time 
except for the historical information contained herein and in the annual report of which this form k is a part  the matters discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the form k and the annual report are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and section a of the securities act of  as amended  that involve risks and uncertainties  including the rate of orders for the company s products  the timely availability and acceptance of new products  the impact of competitive products and pricing  the management of growth  the impact of the company s efforts to implement its evolving long term strategy and the other risks detailed below and from time to time in the company s other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 
the actual results that the company achieves may differ materially from any forward looking projections due to such risks and uncertainties 
the company has identified with a preceding asterisk various sentences within this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations which contain such forward looking statements  and words such as believes  anticipates  expects  future  intends and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements 
in addition  the section labeled factors that may affect future results and portions of the annual report  which all have no asterisks for improved readability  consist primarily of forward looking statements 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof 
factors that may affect future results the company s operating results are subject to quarterly and other fluctuations due to a variety of factors  including the volume and timing of orders received  potential cancellation or rescheduling of orders  competitive pricing pressures  availability and cost of component parts and materials from the company s suppliers  the adequate forecasting of the mix of product demand due to production lead times and capacity constraints  the timing of new product announcements and introductions by the company or its competitors  changes in the mix of products sold  research and development expense associated with new product introductions  the timing and level of development costs  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of the company s products  seasonal customer demand  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and economic conditions generally or in various geographic areas 
the company s ability to compete also depends upon the company s ability to develop new product features that enhance uniformity and repeatability  improve process capability and flexibility and reduce cost of ownership 
in addition  because of the relatively high selling prices of the company s products  a significant portion of the company s net sales in any given period is often derived from the sale of a relatively small number of units  and a change  even though minor  in the number of units sold during a quarter can result in a large fluctuation in net sales for that quarter 
in recent quarters  the company has experienced declining net sales and has begun to incur net losses on a quarterly basis as a result of the effects of the semiconductor industry s slowing order rate  continuation of a high level of research and development spending on the company s next generation products and competitive pressures 
the company s ability to reduce the trend of declining net sales  which have started to yield net losses  is dependent on several factors including increased order rates for the company s products  successful and timely development and market acceptance of the company s next generation products and successful competition with the company s competitors on a price and performance basis 
many of these factors are not within the company s control  and if order rates for the company s products fail to increase  if the company s next generation products are not successfully and timely developed and accepted by the company s customers  or if the company cannot successfully compete with its competitors  many of whom have substantially greater resources than the company  the company s net sales will continue to decline and the company would experience further net losses  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in particular  the company expects net sales for the fiscal year ending september  to be lower than the net sales achieved during fiscal due to the semiconductor industry s slowing order rate and competitive pressures 
results of operations the following table sets forth items in the company s consolidated statement of income as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 
years ended september  tau net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations other income expense  net equity in loss of unconsolidated subsidiary income before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income less than percent tau percentages may not total due to rounding fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of percent 
substantially all net sales were derived from rapid thermal processing rtp operations for both periods 
the sales growth in the current fiscal year was primarily due to the increase in unit sales of the company s heatpulse r product and included sales to one customer of million compared to million in fiscal however  sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal declined to million as compared to million in the third quarter of fiscal and million in the fourth quarter of fiscal this decline reflects the semiconductor industry s slowing order rate and competitive pressures 
the average selling price of the heatpulse decreased in fiscal due primarily to an increasing proportion of distributor sales  which generally have lower selling prices than direct sales 
the company expects net sales for fiscal  which will be generated predominantly from the sale of the company s heatpulse and heatpulse products  to be lower than the net sales achieved during fiscal due to the semiconductor industry s slowing order rate and competitive pressures 
the company also believes that unit sales of the company s and series products will stay at a low and constant level of to systems per quarter combined for these two products as they have for fiscal and fiscal sales to distributors were million in fiscal compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
the company utilizes distributors in certain geographic regions 
all of the company s sales in japan are through canon sales co  inc canon  and those in europe and korea are through metron technology metron 
sales to distributors generally result in a lower gross profit  caused by lower selling prices  which are largely offset by reduced selling and marketing expenses 
in fiscal  canon represented of net sales  compared to of net sales in fiscal  and metron represented of net sales  compared to of net sales in fiscal the increase in sales to distributors was primarily due to increased international sales both in terms of actual sales and as a percent of total sales  as most international sales of the company are made through distributors 
domestic sales for the company decreased to million in the current fiscal year from million in fiscal  a decrease of percent 
the decrease in domestic sales is primarily due to the semiconductor industry s slowing order rate and the loss of sales from a major customer to a competitor 
international sales for the company increased to million in the current fiscal year from million in fiscal  an increase of percent 
as a percentage of net sales  international sales increased to for the current fiscal year from in the prior fiscal year 
this increased percentage of international sales results primarily from substantially increased sales in terms of absolute dollars  combined with declining domestic sales in terms of absolute dollars 
the increase in absolute dollars for international sales in fiscal was primarily due to increased sales to europe and asia  including japan 
based upon the geographic locations of semiconductor manufacturers  the company anticipates that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of net sales in fiscal however  the percentage of sales will vary on a quarterly basis depending on the timing of orders and the relative strength of domestic sales 
international sales are typically denominated in united states dollars 
because sales of the company s products are denominated in united states dollars  fluctuations in the value of the dollar could increase or decrease the prices in local currencies of the company s products in foreign markets and make the company s products relatively more or less expensive than competitors products that are denominated in local currencies 
inflation has not had a material impact on the company s net sales or income from operations 
the company s end user customers include most of the world s leading semiconductor manufacturers 
for the year ended september   intel corporation accounted for of total net sales and nec accounted for of total net sales 
for the year ended september   intel corporation accounted for of total net sales  and international business machines corporation accounted for of total net sales 
the company expects that a limited number of end user customers will account for a significant percentage of net sales in fiscal  and there can be no assurance that any significant end user customer will continue to purchase the company s products 
the loss of any significant end user customer  even if replaced by a different significant end user customer  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in this regard  the company notes that intel corporation will be less significant to the company in fiscal than in fiscal gross profit increased to million in fiscal from million in the prior fiscal year  an increase of percent 
however  gross profit for the fourth quarter of fiscal declined to million as compared to million in the third quarter of fiscal and million in the fourth quarter of fiscal this decline reflects the semiconductor industry s slowing order rate and competitive pressures 
gross profit increased from fiscal to fiscal as a result of increased sales volume 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales declined to in the current fiscal year from in fiscal the reduced gross profit percentage resulted primarily from a decline in systems margin as the number of systems sold to distributors increased  an increase in cost incurred on systems sold in europe that required additional customization to meet more stringent european electronics regulatory standards and an increase in overhead costs as a result of the company s move to a new facility 
this decrease in systems margin was partially offset by an improvement in spares margin 
the company expects that the gross profit percentage for fiscal will be lower than in prior years due to the impact of fixed overhead costs on lower expected sales volume 
research and development r d expenses increased to million in the current fiscal year from million in the prior fiscal year  an increase of 
as a percentage of net sales  r d expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal  reflecting the company s commitment to bring new products to market 
during fiscal year  the company introduced its newest product  the heatpulse  which is expected to replace the current model heatpulse during fiscal the heatpulse product is a new rtp system designed for volume production environments  where process repeatability  productivity and cost are critical considerations 
this product was developed to help semiconductor manufacturers improve performance in all three areas for the full range of rtp process applications 
the company is also developing its next generation platform that is being designed to provide previously unavailable rtp capabilities  both in terms of process results and manufacturing performance  for the and micron linewidths 
the next generation products are scheduled for introduction in the second or third quarter of calendar the failure of the company to timely develop this new platform  the failure of this new platform to meet customer expectations regarding performance and cost or the failure of this new platform to achieve market acceptance following product introduction would each have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company continues to believe that significant investment in r d is required to remain competitive  however  it anticipates that such expenses in terms of absolute dollars will decline toward the end of fiscal  although such expenses as a percentage of net sales may fluctuate 
all r d costs are expensed as incurred 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  a decrease of percent 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal  reflecting higher sales in the more recent period 
the decrease in absolute dollars for the current fiscal year was due primarily to increased sales to distributors  which have lower selling and marketing expenses than direct sales  and the company s management of expenses in response to the decline in sales during the second half of fiscal  as well as a reduction in sales commissions as a result of lower sales 
the company anticipates that sg a expenses will decrease in absolute dollars throughout fiscal due to lower sales commissions and the company s continued cost control measures  but will vary as a percentage of net sales 
other income expense  net was  of income in fiscal and  of income in fiscal interest income net of interest expense was  in fiscal  reflecting interest earned on investment of the company s cash and investments 
other income also included commissions on quartz sales of  earned in fiscal equity in loss of unconsolidated subsidiary was million for fiscal this represents the company s share of the losses of ag associates israel ltd 
ag israel during fiscal as compared to  from may through the end of fiscal in may  a percent interest in ag israel was acquired by clal electronics industries ltd 
clal electronics 
the company retains a interest in ag israel and thus has accounted for its investment on the equity method since june  prior to that  ag israel was accounted for as a wholly owned subsidiary of the company and its results of operations were included in the consolidated financial statements of the company 
as of september   the company s investment in ag israel had been reduced to zero 
additional losses from ag israel s operations will be recorded only to the extent of any future investments by the company 
the company is considering a proposal to invest additional amounts in ag israel in conjunction with proposed investments by other investors 
for fiscal  the company recorded income tax expense of million compared to a benefit for income taxes of  in fiscal as a result of the significant increase in profitability during fiscal  the completion of the company s initial public offering and the closing of the ag israel transaction with clal electronics  the company reversed its valuation allowance for deferred income taxes  resulting in a tax benefit for fiscal in fiscal  the effective tax rate of more closely approximates the statutory rates of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
the impact of ag israel losses  which are not deductible on the us federal tax return of the company  were offset in part by the tax benefits received from the company s export sales 
the company anticipates the fiscal effective tax rate to be similar to the rate experienced during fiscal the company s system backlog consisting of product scheduled for delivery within the next twelve months as of september  was approximately million as compared to million at september  the decrease in backlog was a result of the effects of the semiconductor industry s slowing order rates as customers drastically slowed down their expansion plans  as well as competitive pressures 
the company includes in its backlog customer purchase orders that have been accepted and to which shipment dates have been assigned within the next twelve months 
all orders are subject to cancellation with limited or no penalty 
because of possible changes in the delivery schedules and additions or cancellations of orders  the company s backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of percent 
substantially all net sales were derived from rapid thermal processing rtp operations for both periods 
the sales growth in fiscal was primarily due to the increase in unit sales of the company s heatpulse product and included sales to one customer of million versus million in fiscal the average selling price of the heatpulse increased in fiscal due primarily to an increasing proportion of direct sales  which generally have higher selling prices than sales to distributors 
unit sales of the company s other products remained relatively stable from fiscal to fiscal sales to distributors were million in fiscal compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
sales to distributors generally resulted in lower gross profit  caused by lower selling prices  which were largely offset by reduced selling and marketing expenses 
international sales for the company increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of 
as a percentage of net sales  international sales decreased to for the current fiscal year from in the prior fiscal year 
this declining percentage of international sales resulted primarily from us sales rising more rapidly during these periods 
the increase in absolute dollars for international sales in fiscal was primarily due to increased sales to the far east  primarily to japan and taiwan  and partially offset by a decrease in sales by the company s european distributor  principally as a result of increased price competition 
gross profit increased to million in fiscal from million in the prior fiscal year  an increase of 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales improved to in the fiscal from in fiscal the improved gross margin percentage resulted primarily from an increasing proportion of direct sales  which generally have higher gross margins than sales to distributors  and an increase in sales to one manufacturer with specific feature requirements and to customers selecting systems with more complex features 
research and development r d expenses increased to million in fiscal year from million in the prior fiscal year  an increase of 
as a percentage of net sales  r d expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal  reflecting higher sales in the more recent period 
the company continued its efforts to remain competitive through investments in the development of new features for its current products 
the increase in r d expenses in absolute dollars was primarily attributable to the addition of personnel 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal  reflecting higher sales in the more recent period 
the increase in absolute dollars for fiscal was due primarily to the addition of personnel to support the company s growth 
other income expense  net was  of income in fiscal and million of expense in fiscal interest expense decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal due primarily to lower average debt balances and the repayment of all outstanding indebtedness under the line of credit following the company s initial public offering in fiscal interest income was  in fiscal  reflecting interest earned on investment of the proceeds from the company s initial public offering 
other expense in fiscal included a charge of  for the revision of the terms of the investment company of bank hapoalim ltd 
s hapoalim investment co 
minority interest conversion rate  debenture conversion price and warrant price and  related to a financing transaction that was not completed 
equity in loss of unconsolidated subsidiary was  for fiscal this represents the company s share of the losses of ag israel from may of  when a interest in ag israel was acquired by clal electronics  through september  the company retains a interest in ag israel and thus has accounted for its investment on the equity method since june  prior to june   ag israel was accounted for as a wholly owned subsidiary of the company and its results of operations were included in the consolidated financial statements of the company 
for fiscal  the company recorded a benefit for income taxes of  compared to an expense of  in fiscal as a result of the significant increase in profitability during the current fiscal year  the completion of the company s initial public offering and the closing of the ag israel transaction with clal electronics  the company reversed its valuation allowance for deferred income taxes resulting in a tax benefit for fiscal year liquidity and capital resources as of september   the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  compared to million as of september  and million as of september  the decrease of million from fiscal to fiscal was primarily attributable to capital expenditures relating to the company s move to a new facility  an increase in inventory levels and its required million investment in ag israel 
the increase of million from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to the company s initial public offering in may working capital decreased to million at september  from million at september  and a deficiency of million as of september  during fiscal  the company negotiated a million revolving line of credit  which is available through august  the line is collateralized by all assets of the company except intellectual property 
borrowings bear interest at prime plus per annum 
there were no outstanding borrowings at september  the company s operating activities provided cash of  during fiscal net income of million  a decrease in accounts receivable of million and losses from equity in ag israel of million were offset by increases in inventory of million along with decreases in accounts payable of million  accrued liabilities of million and refundable income taxes of million 
the decrease in accounts receivable was due to increased collection activity and declining sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal the increase in inventory was primarily due to increased levels of raw materials in preparation for meeting the company s shipment targets for fiscal  as well as the stocking of offsite spares inventories 
the decrease in payables was primarily due to a decrease in purchases during the second half of fiscal the decrease in accruals was primarily due to reduced commission expense and other payroll accruals and lower level of operations during the second half of cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  as net income of million and an increase in accounts payable of million  due largely to increased purchases of inventory and the growth in operating expenses  were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million  reflecting an increase in net sales  an increase in inventories of million to support higher production volumes and an increase in deferred tax assets of million  principally due to increased profitability resulting in a reversal of the valuation allowance 
cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  as net income of million and an increase in accrued liabilities of million  due to increased commission and payroll accruals  were offset by a decrease in customer advances and deferred revenues 
cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and  in fiscal capital expenditures  purchases of short term investments and a required million equity investment in ag israel were the principal uses of cash in investment activities in fiscal  partially offset by maturities of short term investments 
purchases of short term investments  capital expenditures and an equity investment in ag israel were the principal uses of cash in investment activities in fiscal capital expenditures were approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal and approximately  in fiscal  the company did not enter into any new lease agreements in fiscal  the company leased assets with a cost of  in fiscal and  in fiscal capital expenditures in fiscal were made primarily to support increased personnel levels and facilities upgrades 
the company relocated its entire operations from sunnyvale  california to san jose  california during october the cost of leasehold improvements for this relocation was million 
the company expects that capital expenditures will be approximately million in fiscal  principally to support new product development 
the company is considering a proposal to invest additional amounts in ag israel in conjunction with proposed investments by other investors 
financing activities provided cash of  in fiscal primarily from the sale of common stock to employees and collections of employee notes receivable  partially offset by the reduction in long term lease obligations 
financing activities provided cash of million in fiscal principally from net proceeds of million resulting from the company s initial public offering of common stock and short term borrowings to support the cash used by operating activities during the period partially offset by repayments of short term borrowings 
financing activities used cash of million in fiscal principally reflecting the repayment of short term borrowings  obligations under capital leases and reductions in long term debt 
the company believes that current cash and short term investment balances  together with existing sources of liquidity  will satisfy the company s anticipated liquidity and working capital requirements through the next twelve months 
however  due to the uncertain nature of the industry  competitive market conditions and the strong commitment to developing the company s next generation products  liquidity and working capital are difficult to anticipate beyond the next twelve months 
there can be no assurance that additional financing  when required  will be available  or if available  can be obtained on terms satisfactory to the company 
change in independent auditors effective in june  the company selected deloitte touche llp to replace ernst young llp as independent auditors for the company 
the decision to change auditors was approved by the company s board of directors 
the reports of ernst young llp on the financial statements of the company for the fiscal year ended september  did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty  audit scope or accounting principles 
during the fiscal year ended september  and subsequent interim periods through june  there were no disagreements with the former auditors on any matter of accounting principles or practices  financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure  with disagreements if not resolved to the satisfaction of the former auditors would have caused them to make reference in connection with their report to the subject matter of disagreement
