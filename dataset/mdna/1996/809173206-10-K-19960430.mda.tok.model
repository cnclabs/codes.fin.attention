the increase in classic trading card sales was mainly due to new product releases and the timing of certain product shipments 
the increases in other net sales is due to specialty product sales 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in memorabilia product sales  which declined due to the discontinuation of several entertainment related product categories

the company experienced decreases in both selling and general and administrative expenses 
decreases occurred in commissions due to a higher percentage of hobby sales which are not subject to commissions and in most other selling expenses  such as trade show expenses  appearance fees and advertising costs all of which decreased due to management s conscious efforts to reduce expenditures in these areas

selling expenses decreased  in total 
general and administrative expenses decreased by  primarily in payroll and other administrative expenses as the result of the company s restructuring and staffing reductions

fiscal years ended january  and fiscal year was impacted by a number of issues which affected the results of operations 
the sports trading card market had become saturated with various products which affected sales  inventory levels and product returns  the company had expanded into product lines in prior years which  in retrospect  were not as successful as originally anticipated  the cost structure of the company had out paced the needs of the business  and paul goldin  the company s chairman of the board  chief executive officer and president  died unexpectedly in may in response to these issues  the company closed the operations of classic games  inc in georgia during the summer and fall of and relocated it to new jersey to improve the coordination of product development and to take advantage of cross marketing opportunities 
the cost structure of the entire company was analyzed and substantial personnel reductions were made 
personnel levels at the beginning of fiscal were and were less than at february  product lines were analyzed to determine which ones held long term benefit to the company 
inventories were reviewed as part of this analysis 
the company identified the product lines and inventories which it felt no longer fit within the company s core business 
also  in order to generate cash to reduce bank debt  the company identified certain inventories to be liquidated through alternate channels of distribution 
as a consequence of these actions  the company recorded pre tax charges totaling  to cover associated costs 
the major components of the charge were subsidiary relocation  severance costs  inventory write downs and reserves  other asset write downs and reserves  aside from the charges for restructuring and product line adjustments discussed above  sales and gross profit margins were down when compared to fiscal following is a comparison of sales by major product and distribution channels

the company disposed of approximately  cost value of such inventory through january  and an additional  through march gross profit margins in fiscal were adversely effected compared to fiscal due to reduced sales of the company s draft pick trading card product  which generally has high margins  and the sale of discontinued product at a loss or at no margin after reserves were established 
gross profit margins were also negatively affected by additional inventory reserves and increased reserves for returns and allowances 
selling  general and administrative expenses were generally lower than fiscal  as variable selling expenses were down substantially due to lower sales 
payroll and related expenses were also lower  but most of the reductions did not occur until the second half of the year 
interest expense was higher than the previous year due to generally higher average bank borrowings and interest rate increases 
income tax benefits represent expected refunds offset by adjustment of the net deferred tax assets reported at january  the company did not consider it appropriate to record any deferred tax assets at january  seasonality sales of the company s trading card products are somewhat seasonal  with sales peaks typically following the draft for the sport to which the product relates 
the company has been working to reduce seasonality  to the extent possible  by having more trading card issues in more limited quantities throughout the year 
sales of sports related memorabilia products tend to be more constant  with sales peaks during holiday seasons and the then current sport season 
sales of entertainment related products tend to be less seasonal and are planned  where possible  to counterbalance the seasonality of sport trading card products

these carry forwards can offset future taxable income 
recent fasb pronouncements the financial accounting standards board issued two standards in fiscal which would apply to the company 
sfas is effective for fiscal and requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable
