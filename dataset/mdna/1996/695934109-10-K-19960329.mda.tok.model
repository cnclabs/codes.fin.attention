although future effects of price competition and other competitive pressures inherent in the company s business are uncertain  the company expects to continue to reduce the average sales prices of its higain and other products 
accordingly  the company s ability to maintain or increase revenues will depend in part upon its ability to increase unit sales volumes of existing products and to introduce and sell new products at rates sufficient to compensate for the reduced revenue effect of such continuing reductions in the average sales prices of the company s existing products 
declining average sales prices may also adversely affect gross margins on the company s existing products if the company is unable to fully offset such reductions in average sales prices by reductions in the company s per unit costs 
declining average sales prices had a significant effect on gross margins in as they declined to from in during the company s continuing effort toward cost reduction through engineering design changes  reduced prices for components  increased manufacturing efficiencies  and increases in volume resulted in improved gross margins  which climbed to for the year 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to increase unit sales volumes  introduce and sell new products or further reduce its per unit costs in the future
