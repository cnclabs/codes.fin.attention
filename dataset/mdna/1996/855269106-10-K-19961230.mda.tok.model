although the company currently does not face such issues  during the company s sales were adversely impacted by chassis availability from the oems 
the business tends to be seasonal with stronger sales in march through july and is influenced by a number of factors including atypical weather for any sales region and oem programs affecting the price  supply and delivery of vehicle chassis 
general motors chassis represented of the company s total unit shipments in the company s retail dealers had approximately  units on hand at the end of compared to  at the end of the prior year 
both these levels remain significantly lower than the level of  the lower levels appear to be the result of dealer caution in stocking the newly redesigned general motors fullsize van and the trend of dealers to stock more suvs 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities provided cash of million compared to million in the prior year 
this improvement came principally from a favorable change in working capital 
receivables increased million due to the increase in international receivables which carry longer payment terms 
the increase in accounts payable of million in is attributable to the ramp up of production in september for the increased international business and improved vendor payment terms 
operating cashflows were applied primarily to fund capital expenditures  repurchase the company s common stock and reduce outstanding indebtedness 
at the end of long term debt was zero 
the company maintains a million bank revolving credit line 
in addition to the availability of bank financing  the company has restricted sales agreements with general motors acceptance corporation  chrysler financial corporation and ford motor credit company 
pursuant to these agreements  the company obtains vehicle chassis from the oems for days at nominal rates 
if the company fails to match a chassis with a dealer order within days after delivery of the chassis to the company  carrying charges increase to prime rate plus 
in the board of directors approved the repurchase of up to  shares of the company s outstanding shares of common stock 
during the company repurchased  common shares in the open market for  as of december    common shares have been repurchased under this program 
additional shares may be acquired in if  in the opinion of management  the company s stock continues to be undervalued by the market 
in october  the company finalized its plan to consolidate the operations of the imperial automotive group manufacturing operation  located in elkhart  indiana  into starcraft automotive group s manufacturing complex in goshen  indiana  during december this plan is designed to enhance profitable growth by reducing excess production capacity  personnel count and fixed overhead expenses 
the company estimates that a  pretax restructuring charge in connection with this plant consolidation will be recorded in the first quarter of the charge includes employee termination costs  leasehold asset write offs and the recognition of contractual lease obligations 
the company believes that cash flows from operations  funds available under its bank revolving credit agreement  and the continued use of oem financing arrangements to manage its chassis inventory will be sufficient to satisfy its anticipated operating needs and capital improvements for discussion of forward looking information from time to time  starcraft may make oral or written forward looking statements regarding its anticipated sales  costs  expenses  earnings and matters affecting its condition and operations 
such forward looking statements are subject to a number of material factors which could cause the statements or projections contained therein to be materially inaccurate 
such factors include  without limitation  the following general operating contingencies 
the company may not be able to attract and retain sufficient employees with sufficient skills to conduct its operations efficiently and may from time to time be subject to work slow downs or stoppages 
the company may be adversely affected by delay or unavailability of supply of numerous component parts 
the company will not always be able to satisfy its capital requirements with internally generated funds and may  from time to time  need to rely on bank financing and other third party capital resources 
there is no assurance that such resources will always be available to the company or as to the terms that will apply to any financing 
acquisitions 
the company expects to be engaged in negotiations from time to time regarding prospective acquisitions of van conversion or other businesses 
such acquisitions could be material to the company and  if effected  could have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
there is no assurance as to when or whether the company will be able to effect acquisitions  whether it will be able to generate requisite funding to effect such acquisitions  or as to the terms on which such acquisitions may be effected 
economic conditions 
the van conversion industry is cyclical and is affected by the general trends of the economy and consumer preferences and consumer confidence and trends of the automotive and recreational vehicle industries 
the level of disposable consumer income affects the company s sales because its products are generally considered discretionary expenditures by consumers 
in difficult economic times  consumers tend to spend less of their income on discretionary items 
other economic factors affecting the demand for the company s products include the availability and price of gasoline  the level of interest rates and the availability of consumer financing 
reduced gasoline availability could adversely affect the demand for the company s products 
a significant increase in the price of gasoline could reduce demand for the company s products because it would increase the cost of operating these products 
because many consumers finance their purchase of vehicle conversions  the availability of financing and level of interest rates can affect a consumer s purchasing decision 
a decline in general economic conditions or consumer confidence can be expected to affect starcraft s sales adversely 
supply and financing of vehicle chassis 
the company is dependent upon the oems to supply its requirements for vehicle chassis 
labor stoppages  supply shortages and a variety of other factors that influence oem production can affect the availability or timely delivery of vehicle chassis to the company 
the impact of these factors was significant in if vehicle chassis are unavailable  or if the company must accept delivery earlier or later than it otherwise would prefer  sales could be adversely affected and financing expenses could increase 
the company must also comply with its consignment and restricted sale contracts with the oems pursuant to which the oems impose certain specifications for the company s vehicle conversions  including gross vehicle weight standards 
such contracts also restrict the company s ability to dispose of completed chassis and prohibit the transfer of chassis to unauthorized us and foreign dealers 
all of the company s consignment and restricted sale contracts with chassis suppliers are terminable by either party on short notice without cause 
the availability of the oem financing rates is dependent upon the company s compliance with its oem contracts and its ability to maintain satisfactory credit relationships with the oem s finance subsidiaries 
adverse changes in the company s financial condition or results of operations could cause such financing subsidiaries to seek to change adversely the company s financing terms or to terminate such financing arrangements 
such a change or termination could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
regulation 
the company is subject to various foreign  federal  state and local regulations 
in particular  conversion components produced by the company are required to comply with federal motor vehicle safety standards and similar safety standards imposed in its foreign markets 
promulgation of additional safety standards in the future could require the company to incur additional testing and engineering expenses which could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company s international sales can be adversely affected by changes in foreign import tariffs and taxes and fluctuations in exchange rates 
the company must comply with certain federal and state regulations relating to the disposition of hazardous wastes generated in its production processes 
the company s failure to comply with applicable regulations or changes in current regulations  including the adoption of new safety or environmental standards  could have material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
competition 
the united states vehicle conversion industry is very competitive with several principal nationwide manufacturers and numerous local and regional competitors 
there is no assurance the company will be able to maintain its current competitive position in the vehicle conversion market or that it will be able to expand its sales of custom truck and suv conversions 
potential product liability 
like other automotive manufacturers  the company may be subject to claims that its products caused or contributed to damage or injury sustained in vehicle accidents  lemon law claims or may be required to recall products deemed unsafe 
any such claims in excess of the company s insurance coverage or material product recall expenses could adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations
