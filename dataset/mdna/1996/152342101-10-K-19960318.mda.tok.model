liquidity and capital resources the company has incurred significant operating expenses attempting to develop therapeutic and diagnostic products 
the company s product sales have not produced sufficient revenues to cover the company s operating costs 
consequently  the company has experienced substantial net cash outflows  which have been only partially offset by significant contract revenues received through collaborative alliances with pharmaceutical companies and the company s financing activities 
the company s future financial condition is highly dependent upon the reduction of the company s rate of net cash outflows and  ultimately  upon the achievement of significant and sustained levels of therapeutic product sales 
for the year ended december   sales of the company s products  including reopro and panorex  did not generate sufficient revenue to result in positive cash flow for the year 
under the company s strategy of entering into collaborative alliances with established pharmaceutical companies  the company generally shares sales revenues from products covered by such arrangements with its partners

failure to obtain additional timely fda or other regulatory approvals for the use of reopro and panorex or other product candidates will have a material adverse effect on the company 
until significant and sustained levels of therapeutic product sales are achieved  the company expects that it will need to secure significant additional funding in the future from collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical companies or from the capital markets 
there can be no assurance that sufficient additional funding will be available to the company or that the company can obtain additional collaborations with established pharmaceutical companies and receive payments for product rights and or the achievement of milestones under such collaborative agreements 
even if the company obtains such funding  there can be no assurance that such funding will be sufficient to sustain the company s operations until it generates positive cash flows from operations

the extent and timing of future warrant and option exercises  if any  are primarily dependent upon the market price of the company s common stock and general financial market conditions  as well as the exercise prices and expiration dates of the warrants and options 
the company s total cash  cash equivalents and investments decreased by  from december   principally as a result of cash used for operations  debt repayments  and purchases of fixed assets partially offset by cash received from the exercise of warrants and options as discussed above

the company continually evaluates the future needs for its facilities and equipment
