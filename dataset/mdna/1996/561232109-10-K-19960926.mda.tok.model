critical care products 









pharmaceutical specialties 







human healthcare products are instrumental in the delivery of healthcare services and are sold to hospitals  clinical laboratories  pharmaceutical manufacturers and other customers on a worldwide basis 
human healthcare products are related by a high degree of innovation and technology  by regulation from agencies such as the us food and drug administration fda  industry standards and by markets served 
they are significantly affected by conditions within the healthcare industry  including continuing legislative initiatives and public and private healthcare insurance and reimbursement programs 
an aging population and demand for technologically superior products to improve the quality of life while lowering the cost of care are two major factors fueling growth within the industry 
human healthcare provides advanced  innovative products for radiology  cardiology  nuclear medicine  anesthesiology  critical care and therapeutic pharmaceuticals 
principal products of this industry segment are contrast media for various imaging modalities  radiopharmaceuticals for medical diagnostic procedures  disposable medical devices  instruments and systems for use in surgical procedures and in critical care and alternate site facilities  drug chemicals  high purity process chemicals and peptides 
during  mallinckrodt conducted studies to develop strategies to effectively respond to human healthcare customer needs and compete in a market that is changing rapidly as the result of healthcare reform 
as a result of these efforts  in the fourth quarter mallinckrodt recorded a pre tax charge of million related to the reengineering process 
the key components of the charge included the reorganization of the medical specialty oriented us sales structure into a unified organization divided into geographical districts  reorganization to reduce  centralize and standardize certain non sales related functions and management processes  relocation of the argyle  new york tracheal tube manufacturing operations to existing plants in athlone  ireland and irvine  california  and to a new facility in juarez  mexico  and severance costs related to an associated workforce reduction 
the process of restructuring the us sales force addresses new alliances being created on a market by market basis and the changing dynamics of existing customers decision making processes 
sales organizations for imaging agents and critical care products have been consolidated into one team in order to increase responsiveness to the customer 
the consolidation has also created geographic regions to improve planning and strategy development on a local basis 
emphasis will continue to be placed on contact with the clinical community within its customer base  however  the sales structure provides a single point of contact with each purchasing entity  providing quicker  more efficient and effective customer service 
cash expenditures for this restructuring should approximate the original estimate of million  consisting of million for severance costs for about people at various locations around the world  million for consulting  million for manufacturing rationalization and million for other items 
approximately million of the cash expenditures were incurred through june   the majority of which related to severance associated with the workforce reduction and consulting costs 
the majority of the remaining cash expenditures of approximately million will be paid in and relate to severance for terminated employees 
based on expenditures to date and those anticipated by the original plan  no material adjustment to the reserve balance is expected at this time 
the noncash pre tax portion of the charge should approximate million  primarily relating to asset value adjustments associated with manufacturing rationalization 
the restructuring action is generating annualized pre tax savings at a level approximating million 
management expects incremental benefits in and beyond 
the restructuring will assist mallinckrodt to remain flexible to address future change  reduce costs  remain competitive and sustain a strong market presence in an ever changing healthcare environment

human healthcare years ended june  in millions net sales    operating earnings ongoing operations restructuring charge ongoing operating earnings as a percent of sales excluding restructuring charge vs 
human healthcare s operating earnings for were million  up percent compared to million in net sales increased percent to billion 
productivity programs initiated during the last several years helped earnings improve at a faster rate than sales 
sales for imaging agents were up percent  primarily from the acquisition of liebel flarsheim in january  and improved nuclear medicine sales in europe 
volume gains for contrast media were offset by competitive pricing 
sales of critical care products increased percent primarily from higher volume of respiratory therapy products in japan and europe 
pharmaceutical specialties sales improved percent 
sales volume and pricing for medicinal narcotics were the main contributors to the increase 
sales also benefited from the acquisition of king pharmaceuticals specialty analgesic pharmaceuticals product line in december in january  liebel flarsheim company  a leading manufacturer of contrast media power injector systems for diagnostic imaging procedures and equipment for urology procedures  was acquired 
the acquisition enhanced sales performance but modestly impaired operating earnings 
management believes this operation will be a positive contributor to operating results 
in december  king pharmaceuticals product line of specialty analgesic pharmaceuticals was acquired 
the business is important to our specialty pharmaceutical strategy and is expected to have a positive impact on future periods results 
contributing to operating earnings were restructuring actions begun in which are generating annualized pre tax savings at a level approximating million

the acquisition of j 
t 
baker in february enhanced sales performance  but modestly impaired operating earnings through normal acquisition accounting adjustments 
worldwide strength in the existing catalysts business also contributed to the sales and earnings improvements in the restructuring program was substantially completed during  with the exit of the photochemicals business 
animal health years ended june  in millions net sales operating earnings ongoing operations restructuring charge ongoing operating earnings as a percent of sales excluding restructuring charge vs 
animal health s operating earnings were million  up percent

excluding this charge  operating earnings improved percent 
net sales were million  up million compared to the prior year  despite the exit from certain product lines in latin america 
higher sales volume due to a new distribution agreement and favorable pricing in asia partially offset lower volumes in north america and latin america 
european operations also contributed to improved operating results 
an improved sales mix toward higher margin animal productivity and biological products  improved plant performance and lower expenses as a percentage of sales augmented the improved earnings performance 
although the results in and have substantially improved  the company has concluded that the animal health business will have greater potential and be more successful through alignment with a company that possesses core technology more directly related to the development of animal health products 
therefore  the company has decided to explore all strategic options related to this business 
vs 
animal health s operating earnings were million  up percent  excluding the restructuring charge 
net sales were million  up percent compared to million in sales volume growth was highest in europe due to increases across all major product lines 
sales in asia improved primarily from higher volumes of biological products

corporate matters a strategic change initiative  announced in december  involves the consolidation of operations and administrative staff support at the operating companies with respective corporate staff functions 
several actions have been taken  but the bulk of the effort will be implemented during and beyond 
the increase in corporate expense in the fourth quarter and full year is primarily attributable to these efforts 
the strategic change initiative is expected to have generally negative effects for the first quarter and first half of and accelerating savings for the duration of the year  resulting in a program which is planned to be earnings neutral for all of earnings for tastemaker  the company s flavors joint venture  were million in  and million in  due to strong worldwide sales growth and manufacturing cost improvements 
these results represented annual growth of percent and percent for and  respectively 
since its inception in  tastemaker has enjoyed significant success in its growth and profitability 
now  the company is ready to realize the value that has been gained with its investment in tastemaker 
accordingly  the company is prepared to sell its interest in tastemaker  in cooperation with our joint venture partner  hercules  inc  if an acceptable offer is received 
net interest and other nonoperating expense decreased million in from this decrease related primarily to higher interest income in and the effect of a write down of an investment and hedging losses in mallinckrodt s effective tax rate for continuing operations was percent in  compared with percent in see note of the notes for further discussion of income taxes 
financial condition financial resources currently available to the company are expected to continue to be adequate to support existing businesses  fund the remaining cash expenditures of approximately million for the restructuring programs and fund new opportunities 
any resources generated by the potential strategic actions associated with animal health and tastemaker previously discussed  will be reinvested in new and ongoing growth opportunities  especially in human healthcare 
growth initiatives in specialty chemicals and possible additional share repurchases of the company stock will also be considered

the company s board of directors previously authorized repurchase of a total of million shares of its common stock 
thirty three million shares have been purchased under the previous authorization  million during the year ended june  estimated capital spending for the fiscal year ending june   is approximately million 
environmental matters the company is subject to various environmental protection and occupational safety and health laws and regulations in the united states and foreign countries in which it operates 
in addition  in its current operations and over the years  the company has handled  and will continue to deal in or otherwise handle  materials and wastes classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies 
significant capital expenditures  as well as operating costs  have been incurred to comply with the laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment  occupational safety and health  and the handling of hazardous materials 
there are inherent and unquantifiable risks in handling hazardous or toxic materials and wastes 
on the basis of its best information  the company does not believe the expenditures and risks occasioned by these circumstances have as yet become materially adverse to its financial condition or results of operations  however  no assurance can be given that this will continue to be true 
in particular  the company is unable to predict the extent to which it may be adversely affected by future regulatory developments such as new or changed laws or regulations 
most of the company s environmental related capital expenditures are in response to provisions of the federal clean air act  water pollution control act  resource conservation and recovery act  comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  land use  air and water protection regulations of the various localities and states  and their foreign counterparts 
capital expenditures worldwide relating to air emission control  wastewater purification  land reclamation and solid waste disposal totaled approximately million in and million in the company currently estimates that environmental capital expenditures over the next two years will average about million per year 
during  the company assumed and was compensated for certain costs to remediate various sites in the future 
in addition  the company established additional environmental reserves for discontinued operations 
the company has accruals of million at june  for costs associated with the study and remediation of superfund sites and for the company s current and former operating sites 
claims for recovery have not been netted against the accrued environmental liabilities 
while ongoing litigation may eventually result in recovery of costs expended at certain of the environmental sites  any gain is contingent upon a successful outcome and has not been accrued 
based on information presently available  the company believes any amounts paid in excess of the accrued liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations 
other matters the company operates globally  with manufacturing and distribution facilities in various countries throughout the world and as such is subject to certain opportunities and risks  including currency fluctuations and government actions 
mallinckrodt generates a significant portion of its operating earnings and cash flows outside the united states and is positioned to benefit from its use of approximately functional currencies as currency fluctuations are often offsetting 
operations in each country are monitored to respond to changing economic and political environments quickly and take advantage of changing foreign currencies and interest rates 
the company uses certain derivative financial instruments  principally purchased options  forward contracts and currency swaps  to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rate risk 
additionally  various operational initiatives are employed to help manage business risks 
the net impact of foreign exchange activities was immaterial for  and  including the conversion of certain currencies into functional currencies and the costs of hedging certain transactions and balance sheet exposures 
the company does not consider the present rate of inflation to have a significant impact on the businesses in which it operates 
while future economic events cannot be predicted  the company believes its current operations and future expansion plans will not result in a significantly different risk profile
