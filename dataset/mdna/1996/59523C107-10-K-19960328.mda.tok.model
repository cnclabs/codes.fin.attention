item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation forward looking information all forward looking information contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on management s current knowledge of factors affecting mamsi s business 
mamsi s actual results may differ materially if these assumptions prove invalid 
significant risk factors  while not all inclusive  are the possibility of increasing price competition in the company s market place 
the possibility of state or federal budget related mandates that reduce premiums for medicaid or medicare recipients 
the potential for increased medical expenses due to increased utilization by the company s membership 
inflation of costs in the provider community 
federal or state mandates that increase benefits 
the possibility that the company is not able to expand its service territory as planned due to regulatory delays and or inability to contract with appropriate providers 
general during the three year period ended december   mamsi and its subsidiaries the company have experienced substantial revenue growth due to increased hmo and ppo membership 
the company has achieved its membership growth by expanding its product line  which includes point of service  small group  indemnity health  hybrid products  medicaid and medicare products and through expansion into new geographic markets 
premium rates during this time have remained at or near competitive levels for the company s marketplace 
operating margins have remained positive due to the control of medical expenses and  accordingly  profits and earnings per share have increased 
the company currently anticipates that there may be slight increases in premium rates during and that the company s operating margins will remain stable 
this is a forward looking statement  and the company s actual operating margins may differ from management s current expectation due to risk factors which may affect either the company s revenues or expenses 
see forward looking information above for a description of these risk factors 
the company generally receives a fixed premium amount per member per month while the majority of medical expenses are variable and significantly affected by spontaneous member utilization 
even with managed care controls  unusual medical conditions can occur  such as an outbreak of influenza or a higher than normal incidence of high cost cases such as premature births  complex surgeries  or rare diseases 
as a result  the company s quarterly results can be materially affected and irregular 
however  over the longer business cycle  the company believes that its managed care control systems  underwriting procedures when allowed and network of providers will result in continued strong profitability 
the united states congress recently passed a budget reconciliation package budget package that included provisions reforming the medicare program 
under the budget package  medicare beneficiaries would be offered a variety of new health care options  including the ability to enroll in private plans  such as hmos  ppos  point of service plans  medical savings accounts and provider sponsored organizations 
a traditional fee for service medicare program would  however  continue to be offered through the health care financing administration 
the budget package also amended current laws that prohibit physician self referral  guard against fraud and abuse and eliminate the requirement that hmos participating in the medicare program have membership that is composed of at least percent non government program beneficiaries 
in addition  hmos would be paid a monthly capitation rate that blends local and national costs with greater weight given to the local component 
a floor would be established for payment to rural areas 
the budget package was submitted to president clinton and was vetoed 
accordingly  the ultimate form in which this legislation will take effect and the impact of this legislation on the company s business cannot be predicted 
management believes that a portion of the managed care provisions will be included in the final legislation and that programs similar to the company s medicare program would be favorably impacted by medicare reform 
it may  however  result in an increase in the number of competitors 
the budget package also aimed to modify the medicaid program by converting the existing medicaid program from a federal entitlement into a block grant payment to the states 
in addition  federal standards for nursing homes would be revoked and states would have to establish and maintain their own standards 
as stated above  ultimate passage of this legislation and the impact that this legislation would have on the company s business cannot be predicted 
in recent years  state legislatures in the company s service area have been active in health care reform legislation targeted at the small group market  ie  usually for groups of to employees 
this small group reform is now in place in maryland  virginia  delaware and north carolina  but not in washington  dc or west virginia 
although different in many of the details  this type of legislation generally requires all hmos and insurers that offer small group coverage to accept all small employers who apply for coverage and to guarantee coverage to their employees seeking coverage regardless of their health status 
the legislation also requires renewal of these small group employer plans  limits rate renewal increases  mandates adjusted community rating and eliminates pre existing condition limitations either entirely or within a short period of time  usually six months 
the company believes that the current political environment in which it operates will result in continued legislative scrutiny of health care reform and may lead to additional legislative initiatives 
the company is unable to predict the ultimate impact upon the company of any federal or state restructuring of the health care delivery or health care financing systems  but such changes could have a material adverse impact on the operations and financial condition of the company 
the district of columbia  which has not previously regulated hmos  has proposed and may enact legislation providing for regulatory oversight similar to that currently provided by other states 
the company does not anticipate any significant negative impact on its operations because of possible new regulatory oversight in the district of columbia 
the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  results of operations consolidated net income for the company was  and  in and  respectively  an increase of percent 
earnings per share on net income increased percent from in to in all earnings per share amounts reflect the stock dividend paid to stockholders on august  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the increase in earnings is primarily attributable to an increase in membership  increased investment income from higher invested balances and realized gains  and a reduction in per member per month medical expenses principally due to a reduction in the return of physician withhold  partially offset by a reduction in premiums per enrollee and an increase in administrative expenses principally due to additions to the company s internal sales force  expansion into new geographic territories and the operations of the home health care subsidiaries that were purchased in late revenue in increased percent to million from million in a percent increase in net average hmo and indemnity enrollment resulted in an increase of approximately million in health premium revenue and a percent decrease in average premiums per hmo and indemnity enrollee reduced health premium revenue by approximately million 
health premiums per enrollee have declined due to the combined effects of an increasing relative percentage of virginia medicaid hmo members with lower per enrollee revenues and the volatility of revenues from groups with alternative funding arrangements ie  revenues vary in a more direct way with medical expense coupled with management s plan to price its commercial products competitively see note to the consolidated financial statements 
although health premiums per member declined in the current period as compared to the prior year period  management does not believe that future periods will necessarily follow this pattern 
this is a forward looking statement 
see forward looking information above for a description of the risk factors that may affect health premiums per member 
fee and other revenue increased million or percent primarily due to membership increases in ppo and administrative services only aso products 
total ppo and aso membership grew from  at december  to  at december   an increase of percent 
service revenue from the company s home health care subsidiaries contributed million in revenue in  and the introduction of indemnity life  accidental death and disability products in contributed million in revenue 
the company currently has one of the largest hmo and managed care enrollments in its service area which includes the entire states of maryland and delaware  the district of columbia  most counties and cities in virginia  and certain parts of west virginia and north carolina  and also the largest network of contract providers of medical care 
because of the full range of managed care products  service reputation  strong provider delivery system  trained sales force  and competitive premiums  management believes that the company will continue to increase its membership in management s goal is to increase membership in all products by percent to percent in this is a forward looking statement  and the actual membership may differ from management s current expectation due to risk factors such as increased competition in the company s service area 
see forward looking information above for a description of these risk factors 
in  mamsi invited the national committee for quality assurance ncqa  a private  non profit organization  to evaluate the company s methodologies in an effort to receive ncqa accreditation 
ncqa accreditation is a voluntary process 
the company did not meet certain of ncqa s criteria and  therefore  did not receive ncqa accreditation 
mamsi believes that it has adopted methodologies and programs designed to respond to the concerns and questions raised in ncqa s assessment 
the company currently believes that  based on its success with large group sales since the denial of accreditation  the failure to receive ncqa accreditation has not had a significant adverse effect on its business or financial condition 
it is mamsi s intention to request the ncqa to review its current methodologies sometime in although the company believes that the likelihood of ncqa accreditation is high  there can be no assurance that accreditation will be received or that mamsi will not experience disenrollment if accreditation is not ultimately received 
the company s home health care and home infusion subsidiaries underwent voluntary accreditation review by the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations jcaho during full accreditation status was awarded as a result of this process 
medical expenses as a percentage of premium revenue medical loss ratio increased to percent in as compared to percent in  principally due to a decrease in average premiums per enrollee and also higher than anticipated medical expenses in the company s medicare risk product 
on a per member per month basis  medical expenses declined approximately 
percent over the same period due to a reduction in the return of physician withhold and offset by higher member utilization  particularly in the medicare product 
management does not believe that this necessarily represents a sustainable trend 
total medical costs may increase in future periods due to inflationary pressures  governmentally mandated benefit increases and or the company may experience increased utilization by its membership 
over the past two years  the company has achieved year over year reductions in per member per month medical expenses 
in order to continue to reimburse providers at a fair level in a manner consistent with the current medical environment  the company implemented the medicare resource based relative value scale methodology of provider reimbursement effective july  this methodology  which applies generally to specialist health claims  has resulted in the lowering of some reimbursement levels  mainly those having to do with office and hospital based procedures  while increasing payments for many evaluation and management tasks 
management believes that this change will allow the company to continue to be competitive within its marketplace 
administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue administrative expense ratio increased to percent in as compared to percent in administrative expenses increased percent  from million in to million in the increase in the administrative expense ratio is primarily attributable to expenses of the company s home health care subsidiaries  which were purchased in late  the company s territorial expansion into additional service areas within currently served states as well as into the new states of north carolina approved  south carolina pending  and pennsylvania pending  the continued implementation of its plan to significantly increase its employee sales force and the higher costs of administering the medicaid product  which became a more significant line of business for the company in investment income increased million or percent primarily due to significantly greater invested balances and an increase in realized gains on sales of marketable equity securities 
deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences that  in management s opinion  are more likely than not to be realized in the current or future periods 
the company s history of operating revenue and income growth  and expectation of future operating income  provides strong positive evidence that these deferred tax assets will be realized 
a valuation allowance has been recorded for net operating loss carryforwards generated by certain subsidiaries that are not deductible on a consolidated tax return 
management intends to continue to monitor the realizability of deferred tax assets in light of future circumstances and assess the reasonableness of the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
the net margin rate decreased from percent in to percent in this decrease is primarily due to lower premium rates on certain products and increased administrative expenses 
liquidity and capital resources the company s business is not capital intensive and the majority of the company s expenses are payments to health care providers  which generally vary in direct proportion to the premium revenues received by the company 
although medical utilization rates vary by season  the payments for such expenses lag behind cash inflow from premiums because of the lag in provider billing procedures 
in the past  the company s cash requirements have been met principally from operating cash flow and it is anticipated that this source will continue to be sufficient in the future 
cash and short term investments increased from million at december  to million at december   primarily due to operating profits and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options 
accounts receivable increased from million at december  to million at december   primarily due to the significant increase in membership during and also an increase in medical recoverable receivables related to new products 
effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities statement no 

statement no 
requires that investments in all debt securities plus equity securities with readily determinable fair values be classified into categories  which then establish the appropriate accounting treatment 
at january   the company s entire short term investment portfolio was classified as available for sale and  as a result  the net unrealized gain associated with these securities of million  net of tax  was recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity 
also on the same date  the company s statutory deposits  which consist of investments held in custodial accounts by state regulatory agencies  were classified as held to maturity and will continue to be carried at amortized cost 
short term investments are marked to market at the end of every quarter and the resulting unrealized gain or loss is reflected in the ending stockholders equity balance 
accordingly  stockholders equity at december  reflects an unrealized gain of million  net of tax  on the company s short term investments primarily due to significant gains during the year in national equity markets plus the impact of falling interest rates on the market value of the company s debt securities 
net deferred income taxes decreased from million at december  to million at december   principally due to a change in the tax filing status of certain subsidiary corporations  which impacted the calculation of certain deductible temporary differences  and also the effect of the tax recognized for unrealized gains and losses on the company s short term investments 
medical claims payable increased from million at december  to million at december   primarily due to the significant increase in membership and related claim volume during long term debt decreased from million at december  to 
million at december   primarily due to the payoff of the company s mortgage note payable without prepayment penalty 
the company has access to total revolving credit facilities of million  which is used to provide short term capital resources for routine cash flow fluctuations 
at december   approximately million was drawn against the lines of credit and approximately  was outstanding in letters of credit 
additional paid in capital increased from million at december  to million at december   due to proceeds from the exercise and related tax benefits of stock options 
following is a schedule of the short term capital resources available to the company december in thousands cash and cash equivalents  short term investments   working capital advances to maryland hospitals   total available liquid assets   credit line availability   total short term capital resources   certain mamsi subsidiaries that are subject to regulation by state insurance departments must notify state regulators before the payment of any dividends to mamsi and  in certain circumstances  must receive positive affirmation prior to such payment 
due to the substantial statutory net worth of these subsidiaries  the company does not perceive these requirements to be a significant restriction on its ability to pay future dividends 
the company does not anticipate any adverse impact on future liquidity due to medical malpractice issues because the company carries substantial professional liability insurance 
the company believes that the cash flow generated from operations along with its current liquidity and borrowing capabilities are adequate for both current and planned expanded operations 
in october  mamsi announced the approval of a stock repurchase program 
under this program  mamsi may currently expend up to million including brokerage commissions to repurchase shares of its common stock over a twelve month period at prices not to exceed per share 
at december   no shares of common stock had been repurchased under this program 
this program will be financed through cash flow from the company s operations 
other capital expenditures will be made over the next year to enhance the company s computer systems  to establish additional sales offices and to make necessary improvements to existing administrative offices 
the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  results of operations for the year ended december   the company had  in consolidated net income compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of percent 
the increase in earnings is attributable to an increase in membership and per member per month premiums and a significant reduction in the medical loss ratio over the prior year  partially offset by an increase in the administrative expense ratio 
revenues for increased percent to million from million in an percent increase in average hmo enrollment resulted in approximately a million increase in premium revenue and a percent increase in average premiums per enrollee contributed million in premium revenue 
premiums per enrollee were higher in due to a combination of premium price increases and membership gains in certain higher priced benefit packages 
fee revenues from ppo products and other service fees  including revenue from mamsi s home health care subsidiary that was acquired in october  increased approximately million or percent 
the medical loss ratio for decreased to percent from percent in and  on a per member per month basis  medical expenses decreased 
percent 
this decrease in the medical loss ratio reflects higher premiums  a reduction in membership utilization levels in and the efficacy of managed care controls developed and expanded by the company over the preceding three years 
the administrative expense ratio increased from percent in to percent in the increase in the administrative expense ratio is primarily attributable to increased sales  marketing and advertising expenses and the development of new products and territories 
effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under the new rules  deferred taxes are recognized using the liability method  whereby tax rates are applied to cumulative temporary differences based on when and how they are expected to affect the tax return 
the cumulative effect of the change for the year ended december  reduced net income by approximately  or 
per share 
the net margin rate increased from percent in to percent in this increase is primarily due to medical expenses rising at a lesser rate than premium revenues  partially offset by an increase in administrative expenses
