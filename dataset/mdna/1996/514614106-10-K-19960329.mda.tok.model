accounting matters the company established a disc in in order to defer federal income taxes on its foreign sales 
in late  the internal revenue code the code was amended to limit the benefits of a disc  primarily by imposing an interest charge on the accumulated deferred federal income taxes of a disc 
at the same time  the code was amended to permit the creation of a foreign sales corporation fsc 
under the code  as amended  a portion of a fsc s income is subject to federal income taxes  while a portion is permanently exempt from federal income taxes 
as a result  at some point  the interest charge the company incurs on the deferred federal income taxes of its disc will equal or exceed the taxes it would have incurred had it operated a fsc 
since the company cannot maintain the disc and fsc at the same time under current tax regulations  the company may elect to convert the disc to a fsc sometime in the future 
in the event of such a conversion  the company will be required to provide for federal income taxes on the million of undistributed earnings of the disc  for which federal income taxes had not previously been provided  in the year of conversion 
if the disc had been converted on december  it would have resulted in a reduction of approximately  in the company s net earnings 
the company will be able to pay such federal income taxes over a ten year period  thus the company does not anticipate that payments of such federal income taxes will significantly affect the company s cash from operations

 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the statement  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   requires that an entity evaluate long lived assets and certain other identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss meeting the recognition criteria is to be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount for financial reporting purposes exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the company plans to adopt this statement in and does not expect adoption of the statement to have a material effect  if any  on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which requires adoption of the disclosure provisions no later than fiscal years beginning after december  companies are permitted to continue to account for such transactions under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  but will be required to disclose in a note to the financial statements pro forma net earnings and earnings per share as if the company had applied the new method of accounting  as outlined in sfas no 
although the company has not yet determined the effect the new standard will have on net earnings and earnings per share  should it elect to make such a change  it does not anticipate the implementation of sfas no
