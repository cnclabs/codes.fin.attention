item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following table in millions of dollars summarizes the contribution to consolidated earnings by each of the company s businesses 
years ended december  business electric natural gas distribution 
natural gas transmission construction materials and mining oil and natural gas production earnings on common stock earnings per common share return on average common equity for the months ended earnings information presented in this table and in the following discussion is before the million million after tax cumulative effect of a accounting change 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of this accounting change 
earnings for increased million from the comparable period a year ago 
increased retail sales at the electric business and increased throughput at the natural gas distribution and transmission businesses  increased oil prices and oil and natural gas production at the oil and natural gas production business and benefits derived from favorable rate changes at the natural gas distribution and transmission businesses increased earnings 
the favorable rate change at the natural gas transmission business resulted from a ferc order received in april on a rehearing request relating to a general rate proceeding 
the order allowed for the one time billing to customers for approximately million after tax to recover a portion of the amount previously refunded in july income from a percent interest in hawaiian cement acquired in september also contributed to the earnings increase 
earnings included the benefit of a million gain after tax realized on the sale of an equity investment in general atlantic resources  inc gari 
additionally  the effects of decreased natural gas prices at the natural gas transmission and oil and natural gas production businesses  lower coal sales to the big stone station due to the expiration of a coal contract in august and the resulting closure of the gascoyne mine  and increased costs associated with rainy west coast weather at the construction materials operations  partially offset the earnings increase 
earnings for increased million from the realization of an investment gain related to the sale of an equity investment in gari  which was million after tax more than a corresponding gain realized in  increased earnings 
in addition  higher retail electric sales at the electric business  favorable rate changes at the natural gas distribution and transmission businesses  increased sales at the construction materials operations due to the september acquisition of the oregon construction materials businesses and higher oil revenue due to increased production at the oil and natural gas production business contributed to the earnings increase 
increased electric purchased power demand charges  increased operation and maintenance expenses at the electric and natural gas distribution businesses  lower throughput at the natural gas distribution and transmission businesses  a seasonal first quarter loss experienced at the alaskan construction materials operations which was acquired in april  lower average oil prices at the oil and natural gas production business  partially offset the earnings increase

fidelity oil oil and natural gas production operations years ended december  operating revenues oil natural gas operating expenses operation and maintenance depreciation  depletion and amortization taxes  other than income operating income production s oil barrels    natural gas mcf    average sales price oil per barrel natural gas per mcf amounts presented in the above tables for natural gas operating revenues  purchased natural gas sold and operation and maintenance expenses will not agree with the consolidated statements of income due to the elimination of intercompany transactions between montana dakota s natural gas distribution business and williston basin s natural gas transmission business 
the amounts relating to the elimination of intercompany transactions for natural gas operating revenues  purchased natural gas sold and operation and maintenance expenses were million  million and million  respectively  for  million  million and million  respectively  for  and million  million and million  respectively  for compared to montana dakota electric operations operating income at the electric business increased primarily due to higher retail sales revenues and lower fuel and purchased power costs 
higher average usage by residential and commercial customers  due to more normal weather  contributed to the revenue improvement 
reduced demand by oil producers and refiners  contributed to a decline in industrial sales  which somewhat offset the retail sales revenue improvement 
fuel and purchased power costs decreased due to changes in generation mix between lower and higher cost generating stations 
this decrease was partially offset by higher demand charges 
the increase in demand charges  related to a participation power contract  is the result of the purchase of an additional five megawatts of capacity beginning in may  offset in part by the pass through of periodic maintenance charges during decreased maintenance expenses at the coyote station  due to less scheduled downtime  partially offset by increased turbine  generator and boiler maintenance at the heskett station  also improved operating income 
increased depreciation expense  due to higher depreciable plant balances  and lower sales for resale due to a surplus of low cost hydroelectric energy available from the western area power administration during august through november partially offset the increase in operating income 
earnings for the electric business improved due to the operating income increase  partially offset by higher income taxes 
montana dakota natural gas distribution operations operating income increased at the natural gas distribution business due to the effect of million in general rate increases and improved sales 
the sales improvement resulted from the addition of over  customers and more normal weather than a year ago 
the effects of a wyoming supreme court order granting recovery in of a prior refund made by montana dakota and the pass through of lower average natural gas costs reduced revenues 
the effect of higher volumes transported were largely offset by lower average transportation rates 
higher operation expenses  due primarily to higher benefit related costs somewhat offset by lower sales expenses  partially offset the operating income improvement 
increased depreciation expense  due to higher depreciable plant balances  also partially offset the increase in operating income 
natural gas distribution earnings increased due to the improvement in operating income 
a decreased return recognized on net storage gas inventory and deferred demand costs partially offset the earnings increase 
this return decline of approximately  after tax results from decreases in the net book balance on which the natural gas distribution business is allowed to earn a return 
williston basin natural gas transmission operations operating income increased primarily due to an increase in transportation and storage revenues 
the transportation revenue increase resulted primarily from the benefits of a favorable ferc order received in april on a rehearing request relating to a general rate proceeding 
the order allowed for the one time billing to customers for approximately million million after tax to recover a portion of the amount previously refunded in july in addition  higher demand revenues associated with the storage enhancement project completed in late  and increased volumes transported to storage  somewhat offset by decreased transportation of natural gas held under the repurchase commitment and reduced deferred natural gas contract litigation settlement costs required to be recovered  added to the transportation revenue improvement 
lower operation and maintenance expenses  primarily lower production royalty expenses and reduced deferred natural gas contract litigation settlement costs required to be amortized  and lower taxes other than income  largely lower production taxes  further contributed to the increase in operating income 
a decline in natural gas production revenue  primarily due to a cent per decatherm decline in realized natural gas prices  somewhat reduced by increased volumes produced  partially offset the increase in operating income 
increased depreciation expense  resulting from higher depreciable plant balances  also somewhat reduced the operating income improvement 
earnings for this business improved due primarily to the increase in operating income  higher interest income  lower company production refunds included in other income net and lower interest expense 
higher interest income of  after tax is related to the previously described refund recovery 
the decline in interest expense aggregating  after tax is primarily due to long term debt retirements and lower interest rates 
increased carrying costs on the natural gas repurchase commitment  due to higher average interest rates  partially offset the earnings increase 
knife river construction materials and mining operations construction materials operations construction materials operating income declined  primarily due to higher operation expenses 
operation expenses increased due primarily to additional work required to be subcontracted  due to unusually wet weather  and increased sales volumes 
increased revenues due to higher aggregate sales volumes  increased cement sales volumes at higher prices  increased soil remediation volumes  but at lower prices  higher ready mixed concrete prices  but lower volumes  higher construction and aggregate delivery revenues  and increased steel fabrication sales volumes  partially offset the operating income decline 
lower asphalt sales volumes due to increased competition partially offset the revenue improvement 
coal operations operating income for the coal operations decreased million primarily due to decreased coal revenues  primarily the result of lower sales to the big stone station due to the expiration of the coal contract in august and the resulting closure of the gascoyne mine 
decreased operation expenses  resulting primarily from lower sales volumes  lower depreciation expense and lower taxes other than income  due primarily to the closure of the gascoyne mine  partially offset the decline in operating income 
consolidated earnings decreased due to the decline in coal and construction materials operating income and increased interest expense  due to increased long term debt borrowings 
income from a percent interest in hawaiian cement acquired in september and gains from the sale of equipment relating to the gascoyne mine closure  partially offset the decline in earnings 
these items are reflected in other income net 
fidelity oil oil and natural gas production operations operating income for the oil and natural gas production business increased primarily as a result of higher oil revenues  million of which was due to increased production  and million of which stemmed from higher average oil prices 
also  increased natural gas revenue  million of which was due to higher natural gas volumes produced partially offset by a million revenue decrease resulting from lower natural gas prices  contributed to the operating income improvement 
also adding to operating income was decreased production taxes  stemming largely from the timing of payments in as compared to operation expenses increased  as a result of higher production but were somewhat offset by lower average production costs  partially offsetting the operating income improvement 
also reducing operating income was increased depreciation  depletion and amortization expense largely due to higher production 
earnings for this business declined due to the realization of a million gain after tax related to the sale of an equity investment in gari 
the increase in operating income partially offset the earnings decrease 
compared to montana dakota electric operations the decline in operating income reflects increased fuel and purchased power costs and operation expenses 
fuel and purchased power costs increased principally due to higher demand charges associated with the pass through of periodic maintenance costs and the purchase of an additional five megawatts of firm capacity related to a participation power contract 
operation expenses increased primarily the result of higher payroll and benefit related costs  largely the accrual of sfas no 
costs 
in addition  decreased sales for resale  the result of a delay in water conservation efforts by hydroelectric generators  reduced operating income 
increased retail sales to all major markets  the result of increased demand due to more normal summer weather than that experienced in  partially offset the operating income decline 
earnings for the electric business decreased due to the operating income decline and increased long term debt interest  resulting from lower interest received from williston basin due to the retirement of intercompany debt  partially offset by the retirement of million of percent medium term notes on april  decreased income taxes somewhat offset the earnings decline 
montana dakota natural gas distribution operations operating income decreased at the natural gas distribution business from the corresponding period in due to a million decatherm mmdk weather related decline in sales and decreased transportation volumes  primarily due to two oil refineries bypassing montana dakota s distribution facilities 
in addition  higher operation and maintenance expenses  primarily increased payroll and benefit related costs and increased distribution and sales expenses due to the system expansion into north central south dakota  and increased depreciation expense reduced operating income 
the benefits of general rate increases placed into effect in late and during in north dakota  south dakota  wyoming and montana and the addition of nearly  customers improved operating income 
also contributing to operating income was a wyoming supreme court order granting recovery in of a prior refund 
gas distribution earnings decreased due to the operating income decline and increased interest expense  primarily carrying costs being accrued on natural gas costs refundable through rate adjustments  higher financing costs related to increased capital expenditures and the previously described intercompany debt retirement 
the return earned on the storage gas inventory included in other income net somewhat mitigated the decline in earnings 
williston basin natural gas transmission operations the increase in operating income reflects a january rate change due to a rate stipulation agreement with the ferc and the realization of revenue related to mmdk of natural gas transported to storage 
prior to the implementation of order  these revenues were recognized during the winter months when gas was withdrawn from storage whereas such revenues are now recognized primarily in the summer months when gas is transported to storage 
natural gas production revenues increased due to increased volumes produced  partially offset by a cent per decatherm decline in realized natural gas prices 
in addition  decreased operation and maintenance expenses  depreciation and taxes other than income  primarily due to the sale or transfer of unneeded facilities  further improved operating income 
decreased net throughput  primarily to off system markets and ldc end users  partially offset the operating income increase 
a out of period credit adjustment to take or pay surcharge amortizations also partially offset the improvement in operating income 
earnings for this business increased due to the operating income improvement  decreased long term debt interest  the result of debt refinancing and debt retirements in july  and april  respectively  and increased interest being accrued on gas supply realignment transition costs included in other income net 
partially offsetting the earnings improvement were increased carrying costs associated with the natural gas repurchase commitment  due to higher average rates  and decreased investment income  the result of lower investible funds stemming from a regulatory refund made in mid knife river construction materials and mining operations construction materials operations increased sales due to the september acquisition of the oregon construction materials businesses and improved cement  asphalt and building materials sales at the alaskan operations were the primary contributors to the  increase in construction materials operating income 
somewhat offsetting this improvement were the effects of a seasonal first quarter loss experienced at the alaskan operations which was acquired in april and reduced aggregate and ready mixed concrete sales at these operations due to fewer large commercial construction projects in the area than coal operations operating income for the coal operations decreased  primarily due to increased operation expenses 
higher overburden removal costs at the beulah mine  and increased reclamation expenses and costs associated with an early retirement program stemming from the closing of the gascoyne mine in mid increased operation expenses 
an improvement in coal revenues  primarily increased sales at the gascoyne mine  mainly the result of increased demand by electric generation customers  and increased selling prices at the beulah mine  partially offset the decline in coal operating income 
consolidated earnings decreased due to the decline in coal operating income and reduced investment income  primarily lower investible funds due to the aforementioned acquisitions 
the improvement in construction materials operating income somewhat mitigated the earnings decline 
fidelity oil oil and natural gas production operations operating income for the oil and natural gas production business declined as a result of lower oil revenues  million of which was due to lower average oil prices partially offset by a million increase resulting from higher production 
a volume related increase in operation expenses and depreciation  depletion and amortization also contributed to the decline in operating income 
a natural gas revenue improvement   of which was due to higher natural gas production  partially offset the decline in operating income 
earnings for this business improved due to the realization of an investment gain related to the sale of an equity investment in gari  which was million after tax more than a corresponding gain realized in the decline in operating income partially offset the earnings increase 
prospective information each of the company s businesses is subject to competition  varying in both type and degree 
see items and for a further discussion of the effects these competitive forces have on each of the company s businesses 
the operating results of the company s electric  natural gas distribution  natural gas transmission  and construction materials and mining businesses are  in varying degrees  influenced by the weather as well as by the general economic conditions within their respective market areas 
additionally  the ability to recover costs through the regulatory process affects the operating results of the company s electric  natural gas distribution and natural gas transmission businesses 
knife river continues to seek additional growth opportunities 
these include the acquisition of other surface mining properties  particularly those relating to sand and gravel aggregates and related products such as ready mixed concrete  asphalt and various finished aggregate products 
see items and under knife river for a discussion of an acquisition made during in march  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas no 

sfas no 
imposes stricter criteria for assets  including regulatory assets  by requiring that such assets be probable of future recovery at each balance sheet date 
the company will adopt sfas no 
on january   and the adoption will not have a material affect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
this conclusion may change in the future depending on the extent to which recovery of the company s long lived assets is influenced by an increasingly competitive environment in the electric and natural gas industries 
liquidity and capital commitments the company s construction costs and additional investments in construction materials and mining  and oil and natural gas activities in millions of dollars for through and as anticipated for through are summarized in the following table  which also includes the company s capital needs for the retirement of maturing long term securities 
estimated company description montana dakota electric natural gas distribution williston basin knife river fidelity prairielands retirement of long term debt preferred stock total in reconciling construction expenditures to investing activities per the consolidated statements of cash flows  the construction expenditures for prairielands  which is not considered a major business segment  are not reflected in investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows for  and in addition  the capital expenditures for montana dakota s natural gas distribution business are reflected net of million of storage gas purchased from williston basin while the and williston basin amounts are reflected in the table above net of the sale of storage gas of million and million  respectively 
in the company s regulated businesses operated by montana dakota and williston basin provided all of the funds needed for construction purposes 
the company s capital needs to retire maturing long term securities were million 
it is anticipated that montana dakota will continue to provide all of the funds required for its construction requirements for the years through from internal sources  through the use of its million revolving credit and term loan agreement  million of which was outstanding at december   and through the issuance of long term debt  the amount and timing of which will depend upon the company s needs  internal cash generation and market conditions 
williston basin expects to meet its construction requirements and financing needs for the years through with a combination of internally generated funds  short term lines of credit aggregating million  none of which is outstanding at december   and through the issuance of long term debt  the amount and timing of which will depend upon williston basin s needs  internal cash generation and market conditions 
on april   williston basin borrowed million under a term loan agreement  with the proceeds used solely for the purpose of refinancing purchase money mortgages payable to the company 
at december   million is available and outstanding under the term loan agreement 
knife river s capital needs  including the acquisition of a percent interest in hawaiian cement  were met through funds on hand  funds generated from internal sources  short term lines of credit and a long term revolving credit agreement 
it is anticipated that funds generated from internal sources  short term lines of credit aggregating million  none of which was outstanding at december   and a long term revolving credit agreement of million  million of which was outstanding at december   will continue to meet the needs of this business unit for through  excluding funds which may be required for future acquisitions 
it is anticipated that funds required for future acquisitions will be met primarily through the issuance of a combination of long term debt and equity securities 
fidelity oil s capital needs related to its oil and natural gas acquisition  development and exploration program were met through funds generated from internal sources and long term lines of credit aggregating million  million of which was outstanding at december  it is anticipated that fidelity s through capital needs will be met from internal sources and its long term lines of credit 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of notices of proposed deficiency received from the irs proposing substantial additional income taxes 
the level of funds which could be required as a result of the proposed deficiencies could be significant if the irs position were upheld 
prairielands capital needs were met through funds generated internally and short term lines of credit aggregating million   of which was outstanding at december  it is anticipated that prairielands through capital needs will be met from internal sources and its short term lines of credit 
the company utilizes its short term lines of credit aggregating million and its million revolving credit and term loan agreement to meet its short term financing needs and to take advantage of market conditions when timing the placement of long term or permanent financing 
there were no borrowings outstanding at december   under the short term lines of credit 
the company s issuance of first mortgage debt is subject to certain restrictions imposed under the terms and conditions of its indenture of mortgage 
generally  those restrictions require the company to pledge of unfunded property to the trustee for each dollar of indebtedness incurred under the indenture and that annual earnings pretax and before interest charges  as defined in the indenture  equal at least two times its annualized first mortgage bond interest costs 
under the more restrictive of the two tests  as of december   the company could have issued approximately million of additional first mortgage bonds 
the company s coverage of fixed charges including preferred dividends was and times for and  respectively 
additionally  the company s first mortgage bond interest coverage was times in compared to times in stockholders equity as a percent of total capitalization was and at december  and  respectively 
effects of inflation the company s consolidated financial statements reflect historical costs  thus combining the impact of dollars spent at various times 
such dollars have been affected by inflation  which generally erodes the purchasing power of monetary assets and increases operating costs 
during times of chronic inflation  the loss of purchasing power and increased operating costs could potentially result in inadequate returns to stockholders primarily because of the lag in rate relief granted by regulatory agencies 
further  because the ratemaking process restricts the amount of depreciation expense to historical costs  cash flows from the recovery of such depreciation are inadequate to replace utility plant
