the company s results of operations are highly dependent upon the viewing preferences of television audiences and the company s ability to acquire distribution rights to  or itself produce  television programming that achieves broad and enduring audience acceptance 
the success of the company s programming could be significantly affected by changes in viewer preferences or the unavailability of new programming or talent 
moreover  the amount of revenue derived from the sale of retained advertising time is dependent upon a large number of factors  such as household ratings  the demographic composition of the viewing audience and economic conditions in general and in the advertising business in particular 
due to the success of the shows distributed by the company and in order to mitigate the influence of some of the factors referred to above  the company has been obtaining multi year licenses and license renewals from television stations for its principal distribution properties  extending as far into the future as the broadcast season 
in general  these licenses and renewals have been at rates as favorable or more favorable to the company than the rates applicable to the broadcast season 
all such licenses and renewals are contingent upon the continued production of the series by their respective producers through the broadcast seasons for which the licenses run 
the company believes that the impact of inflation on its operations has not been significant 
comparison of fiscal and fiscal revenues revenues for fiscal increased by approximately compared to fiscal due to the adoption of a change in accounting for revenue recognition on a prospective basis in the fourth quarter of fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
had revenues been recognized in fiscal and the fourth quarter of fiscal on a basis comparable to that of the first nine months of fiscal  revenues in fiscal would have been approximately higher than the prior year  due primarily to increased cash license fees from the oprah winfrey show and  to a lesser extent  an increase in revenues derived from the sale of retained advertising time in wheel of fortune and jeopardy as a result of the retention of one additional second advertising spot per episode commencing with the television season

on a basis of accounting comparable to that employed prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal  producers fees  programming and other direct operating costs would have increased by approximately in fiscal over the prior fiscal year  primarily as a result of the higher level of revenues generated by the oprah winfrey show  wheel of fortune and jeopardy a portion of which is payable to the producers of such series and  to a lesser extent  increased production costs associated with inside edition  american journal and rolonda

absent the accounting change  net income would have been approximately million or higher than fiscal  reflecting higher operating income  higher interest income earned on the company s cash and investments due primarily to an increase in interest rates over the prior year  and a lower effective tax rate for fiscal primary earnings per share  which were 
higher in fiscal compared to fiscal  would have been

liquidity and capital resources the company requires capital resources to fund development  production and promotion costs of independently produced programming  including  in some instances  advances to producers and talent  to produce its own programs and to acquire distribution rights to new programming 
in acquiring distribution rights from independent producers  king world has tried to avoid making significant capital commitments to such producers until it has obtained broadcast commitments from a substantial number of television stations 
as a result of this strategy and the success of its existing syndication properties  to date  king world has funded substantially all programming acquisition  development  production and promotion costs and advances from its operations 
the distribution of television programming is highly competitive and the company may be obliged to offer  among other things  guarantees and cash advances to acquire  renew or extend distribution rights 
under the terms of the company s agreement with harpo  inc harpo  the producer of the oprah winfrey show  the company has the exclusive right  and has agreed  to distribute episodes of the oprah winfrey show produced through the television season  subject to harpo s and ms 
winfrey s right to decline to produce and host the show in any season after the season

in addition  in the season and thereafter  the profit sharing arrangements between harpo and the company currently in effect will terminate and the company will instead receive distribution fees based on a percentage of gross revenues derived from the series 
these arrangements are less favorable to the company than those contained in prior agreements between the company and harpo and  unless offset by significant increases in license fees paid by television stations for the series in forthcoming seasons  increased barter revenues from the series  or both  the company s net profits and cash flow derived from the oprah winfrey show will decline in the coming years 
in fiscal  the company paid harpo a million advance against its minimum participation payments for the broadcast season  all of which was recouped during fiscal in addition  on january   the company paid harpo two advances of million each against its aggregate minimum participation payments for the and broadcast seasons 
based on the license agreements in place for the seasons covered by such advances  the company believes that revenues from the series will be sufficient to enable the company to recoup such advances 
such advances are refundable to the company by harpo and ms 
winfrey if king world terminates the agreement due to harpo s failure to deliver episodes of the series

the recognition of such amounts in the consolidated financial statements of the company in fiscal years subsequent to august  is subject to the satisfaction of several conditions  including  with respect to amounts attributable to the oprah winfrey show  the agreement of the producer and ms
