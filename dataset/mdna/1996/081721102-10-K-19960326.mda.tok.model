item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis provides information that management believes to be relevant to an understanding of the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
financial condition despite a securitization in march of  million of variable rate home equity loans through a trust created as a real estate mortgage investment conduit remic  the company s leverage the ratio of interest bearing debt to total equity increased to times at the end of from times at the end of  with the higher leverage in reflecting a large gain in finance receivables 
the company also completed a million securitization in march  and is planning another substantial home equity loan securitization during the first five months of the company believes sufficient cash resources exist to support its long term growth strategies 
these resources include cash generated by operations including repayments of receivables and the company s ability to obtain additional financing through short term borrowings primarily commercial paper supported by committed bank lines and long term borrowings through both private and public debt offerings 
the company s long term debt is rated a or a and commercial paper by all four major rating agencies 
growth in finance receivables is primarily funded through debt issuance 
total owned finance receivables increased  million  or  in  compared with a gain of  million  or  in similar to  growth was the strongest during the fourth quarter 
from a product line perspective  growth was strongest in private label revolving charge programs marketed to large regional and national retailers by bnb usa  the company s private label credit card bank subsidiary up million or 
reflecting the securitization and consumers preference for fixed rate real estate products  variable rate real estate receivables declined million or in fixed rate real estate receivables increased million or 
this real estate growth mix was in contrast to  when consumers showed a strong preference for variable rate products 
in total  unsecured loan portfolios represented of beneficial s total outstandings at year end  versus at the end of and at the end of total managed receivables increased  million  or  compared with a gain of  million or in the comparable period 
slower growth this year in real estate secured products  which grew million in compared with million in  accounted for the unfavorable comparison 
total loans owned delinquent two months and greater on a contractual basis increased to at the end of from at the end of this increase reflects both a greater proportion of  and higher delinquency in  the credit card and unsecured portfolios 
on a loans managed basis  delinquency similarly increased to at the end of from at the end of excluding the charges in both years related to the company s german liquidating loan portfolio  discussed further in the results of operations that follow  net chargeoffs were million versus million in as a percentage of average owned receivables  net chargeoffs increased to from in including the german liquidating loan charges  net chargeoffs were million  or of average receivables in  versus million  or of average receivables in at year end  the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of finance receivables was  compared with at the end of at this level  the allowance covers full year chargeoffs excluding german liquidating loan charges times  compared with times in investment securities increased million  or  in  largely related to annuity sales 
annuity sales for were million  up from million in as discussed in results of operations  the company decided to exit the annuity business in the fourth quarter of following this decision  and given the one time reclassification allowed temporarily under a guide to implementation of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the company transferred million of debt securities from the held to maturity category to the available for sale category in december accordingly  the separate component of equity was increased by million for net aftertax unrealized gains on the transferred securities 
see note to the financial statements for more information on investment securities 
results of operations net income fell to million from million in and million in  as this year s earnings suffered from a large refund anticipation loan ral loss provision in the first quarter 
for the year  consolidated results included a pretax loss of million or million aftertax from the ral business  versus pretax earnings of million or million aftertax in the ral business was severely impacted this year when the internal revenue service irs  released payment of the earned income tax credit eitc portion on thousands of refunds directly to the taxpayers who had already received these refunds through the ral program  rather than to the company s banking subsidiary to repay the loan as directed by the taxpayer 
as announced in december  the company decided to remain in the ral business in  as the company believed that the irs had made efforts during the off season to improve the methods for processing refunds through the electronic filing system 
further  during the season  the company s proprietary credit screens and other traditional underwriting methods proved to be an effective replacement for determining the eligibility of ral customers following the treasury department s decision to discontinue access to the direct deposit indicator 
for the season  the company s subsidiary  beneficial national bank bnb  will not be lending on the eitc portion of any refunds and the majority of the volume will be with prior customers 
based on the review of very early season trends  ral volume is running approximately below the comparable period in  and initial delinquency levels indicate that payments to bnb from the irs are not being delayed or interrupted 
bnb will offer rals to eligible h r block block customers in of block company owned offices in prior to december  when the agreement with block was revised to give bnb exclusivity to of block s offices  bnb serviced only of block s locations 
the revised agreement extends through the tax season and gives bnb the right of first refusal to continue to serve these additional offices through the year the prior bnb agreement involving the original of block s offices continues through under terms of the most recent agreement  block and their satellite franchisees will receive from bnb a license fee of for each ral approved for a block customer during  and for the license fee for the tax season was in december  the company announced its intent to sell its german consumer banking subsidiary  bfk bank ag bfk 
simultaneously  the company recorded a million  or per share  charge to reflect potential credit losses and related expenses at bfk on a block of loans granted to finance the purchase of campground sites by german consumers from fundus grundstuecks gmbh fundus  a financial services company in luedinghausen  germany 
after fundus filed for bankruptcy  it became apparent that the relationship between fundus and many of the consumers was not as represented to bfk 
following the bankruptcy  and the publicity surrounding alleged fraud by fundus  a high proportion of the campground customers ceased paying  which led to the charge in december continuing negotiations and other work out efforts relating to the fundus loans  both apart from and in conjunction with the possible bfk sale  did not progress as anticipated in the original loss estimates 
as a result  in december  the company recorded a million  or per share  charge for additional potential losses relating to the fundus portfolio 
this charge reflects management s best estimate of collateral value after carrying costs and legal fees  and writes down the carrying value of the fundus portfolio to million at year end the company is pursuing a number of alternatives for the liquidation of its interest in the fundus loans and  if necessary  the underlying real estate in which bfk has a collateral interest 
in december  the company announced the decision to retain bfk as no acceptable offers for the bank were received 
following a thorough analysis of bfk s entire loan portfolio and the supporting collateral  which was performed after the decision to retain the operation  the company recorded a million  or per share  provision for loan losses related to other non fundus commercial loans 
none of the above mentioned german charges have a tax offset due to bfk s net operating loss position 
during the fourth quarter  as part of the company s expense reduction efforts  the company instituted a headcount reduction of  principally within headquarters operations 
the program resulted in a million pretax restructuring charge  chiefly representing early retirement and severance expense corresponding to the work force reduction in the fourth quarter 
on an aftertax basis  this charge reduced net income by million  or per share 
also during the fourth quarter  the company made the decision to exit the insurance group s annuity business either through a sale or a managed liquidation 
employee severance resulting from this decision is reflected in the above charge 
the company is in the final stages of negotiations with prospective purchasers of the annuity business 
however  a sale is not expected to have a significant impact on net income 
the annuity line contributed million  million  and million to pretax profits in   and  respectively 
excluding the impact of the ral program  the german losses and restructuring charges  results reflected a increase in average owned receivables during the year  and a widening of interest margins from the preceding two years 
these favorable trends were mitigated by an increase in net chargeoffs  which reflected the expected continuing maturing of the bnb usa private label portfolio  as well as a noticeable increase in the loan office unsecured portfolio chargeoffs 
was also marked by strong loan growth  as average outstandings increased from however  unlike  results also benefited from an improvement in credit quality from the preceding year 
earnings also included a marked improvement in bnb usa contribution  as pretax earnings increased to million from million in this improvement reflected wider interest margins and the operating leverage resulting from the receivables growth over the past two years 
lending spread income increased from the preceding year by in both and  with the increases largely attributable to higher average owned receivables 
as a percentage of average receivables  the lending spread was  compared to in and in reflecting the previously discussed portfolio mix changes  the yield on the average receivables portfolio was in  compared with in and in over the same periods  interest expense as a percentage of average receivables was in versus in and in in north america  the fixed rate real estate secured loans originated in were written at an average yield of  compared with in and in  while variable rate real estate secured loans were written at a spread over prime of approximately basis points in  compared with approximately and basis points during the prior two years 
in  the average yield on unsecured personal loans written in north america was  compared with and in and  respectively 
the yield on the credit card portfolio was in  up from in interest expense increased million and million from the preceding year in and  respectively 
worldwide average borrowing costs increased to from in  in contrast to a decline during from s 
higher borrowing levels added million and million in interest costs from the preceding year in and  while the corresponding fluctuations resulting from interest rate changes were an increase of million in and a decrease of million in the company minimizes its exposure to interest rate risk by closely managing the gap between its interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
at the year end  beneficial was in an essentially matched position compared to a slightly asset sensitive position at the end of the company utilizes interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements to moderate its exposure to interest rate fluctuations

the beneficial insurance group reported pretax income of million in  versus and million in and  respectively 
however  earnings benefited from million related to the acquisition of wesco insurance company  which resulted in adjustments to previous estimates of accrued contingent commission and unearned commission reserves to reflect actual amounts 
excluding the favorable wesco related adjustment  the earnings improvement in both years resulted from higher volume and reduced loss ratios in the beneficial related business 
harbour island inc  the company s real estate subsidiary in tampa  florida  recorded a pretax loss  on a fully debtfunded basis  of million in  up from million in  and million in nearly all of the losses in recent years represent imputed interest costs computed at the company s overall melded cost of funds rate and depreciation charges 
the pretax loss relating to harbour island inc is likely to continue at current levels  unless substantial portions of the real estate on harbour island are sold 
other revenues were essentially flat  decreasing from the preceding year in  following an increase of in in both years  the previously discussed fluctuations from the ral business were largely offset by increased servicing revenue and gains from the aforementioned securitizations 
the provision for credit losses  excluding the german charges  increased million  or  in compared with an increase of million  or  in the increase in reflects higher chargeoffs  as well as additions to the allowance for credit losses corresponding to increased unsecured receivables growth 
the increase in was entirely driven by a higher level of unsecured lending as the company has consistently provided an immediate provision for credit losses on net receivable growth 
including the german liquidating loan charges  the provision increased million  or  in and million  or  in as a percentage of average owned receivables  the provision was in  compared with in including the german liquidating loan charges in both years  the provision for credit losses was and of average receivables in and salaries and other operating expenses  combined  were up in and in over the prior years  generally reflecting normal increases attributable to growth in receivables 
as a percentage of average managed receivables  salaries and other operating expenses were  and in   and  respectively 
the fourth quarter restructuring was an effort to improve operating efficiencies and is expected to save approximately million in annual expenses 
although the statutory rate was for all years  the effective tax rates on income before extraordinary items were in  in and in the effective tax rate was substantially higher in and than in the prior year because of the german charges  which were not offset by tax benefits 
in general  taxes are higher than the us federal statutory rate because of state income taxes and higher tax rates on foreign operations 
due to the company s earnings level  no valuation allowance except for a valuation allowance for foreign tax credit carryforwards related to net deferred tax assets of approximately million has been recorded 
management has determined  based on the company s history of prior operating earnings and its expectations for future earnings  that it is likely that operating income of the company will be sufficient to recognize fully these deferred tax assets 
see note to the financial statements for further discussion 
in  the irs completed its examination of the company s federal income tax returns for through and proposed certain adjustments that relate principally to activities of the company s former subsidiary  american centennial insurance company  prior to its sale in although prepayments were made thereon in  the company is in the process of contesting the proposed adjustments within the administrative appeals process of the irs and is prepared to litigate if necessary 
management does not expect the ultimate resolution of these issues to have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of continuing operations or liquidity 
see note to the financial statements for further discussion of the assessment 
changes in cash flow and liquidity the principal sources of cash are collections of finance receivables  proceeds from the issuance of short and long term debt  and cash provided from operations including maturities and repayments of its receivables 
the monthly collections of cash principal as a percentage of average receivables were in and in also  from time to time  subsidiaries of the company sell receivables through securitizations in the capital markets 
substantial additional liquidity is available through committed bank credit lines that the company maintains in support of its commercial paper borrowings 
during the fourth quarter of  the company entered into a billion  five year syndicated revolving credit agreement  which replaced the various one and three year bilateral agreements  totaling billion  that the company had previously maintained 
this syndicated revolving credit agreement has a billion net worth test 
at year end  total standby lines of credit were billion  of which billion was unused 
one of the company s financial strengths is its ability to raise long term debt in a wide variety of domestic and international markets 
including medium term notes  long term debt represented of the company s funding base at the end of  compared with at the end of in  beneficial issued billion in variable rate medium term notes at an all in cost roughly equivalent to the company s cost of commercial paper borrowings 
the average maturity was years 
fixed rate medium term note issuances totaled 
billion  at an average coupon of and an average maturity of years 
in addition  the company had available under shelf registrations with the securities and exchange commission billion of unissued debt securities at year end the company hedges the majority of its investment in foreign subsidiaries by selling at the money spot call options and buying out of the money spot put options on canadian dollars  british sterling and german marks 
with the exception of the strike rates  all terms of the call and put are identical 
the notional amount of each option is an amount that will generally produce offsetting gains or losses on an aftertax basis to the gains or losses produced by the underlying investment 
the combination of these instruments a no cost collar is effectively a partial hedge  as hedging gains or losses occur only when the spot rates fluctuate outside the range of the respective strike rates 
these option transactions generally have a maturity of three to six months 
foreign currency forward exchange agreements are also utilized to hedge a portion of the company s investment in foreign subsidiaries 
the company monitors the effectiveness of its hedging program through a quarterly analysis comparing the foreign exchange gains and losses on the investments in foreign operations to hedge gains and losses due to currency fluctuations 
hedge gains and losses are calculated by comparing the option strike rate to the spot exchange rate on each financial statement date as though the option were exercised at that time 
there were no amounts recognized in net income during the three years ended december  prospectively  gains and losses in excess of the amount needed to offset gains or losses on investments in foreign subsidiaries due to currency fluctuations are not likely given the above hedging strategy

the company minimizes all off balance sheet credit risk exposure by limiting the counterparties to major international banks and financial institutions 
the company has never experienced nonperformance by any counterparty 
recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board has issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  the company expects to disclose the pro forma charge to earnings in for the valuation of the nonqualified stock option plan which is described in note to the financial statements 
recent developments in february  the company announced that sunamerica life insurance company signed a definitive agreement to purchase the million annuity portfolio of the central national life insurance company of omaha  a subsidiary of the beneficial insurance group 
the closing date has been set for march   pending regulatory approvals 
the sale will not have a material impact on net income 
as the company announced in early march  it appears that the preliminary full year pretax profits from the ral business may significantly exceed the peak of million 
the number of rals issued may approach the million of last year 
in addition  collections of previously charged off amounts are much higher than expected and delinquency is well within the company s expectation 
accordingly  the company expects that results of operations for the first quarter of will be significantly impacted by ral 
as also announced in early march  bnb usa is scheduled to begin a private label credit card pilot program with kmart corporation on march  upon successful completion of the pilot in kmart stores  the two companies plan to expand the program in to all of the more than  kmart locations in the us and canada 
although longterm profitability is expected from this merchant relationship  the roll out will result in considerable start up losses in  which will impact results of operations
