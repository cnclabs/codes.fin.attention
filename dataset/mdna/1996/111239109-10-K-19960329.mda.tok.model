rate volume analysis of net interest income the effect of changes in average balance and rate from the corresponding prior period on interest income  interest expense and net interest income for the years ended december  and is set forth below 
the effect of a change in average balance has been determined by applying the average rate for the earlier period to the change in average balance for the later period  as compared with the earlier period 
the effect of a change in the average rate has been determined by applying the average balance for the earlier period to the change in average rate for the later period  as compared with the earlier period

an increase of  in the average balance of loans combined with an increase of basis points in the average rate earned on loans to result in an increase of  in interest income earned on loans 
similarly  an increase of  in the average balance of investment securities combined with a basis point increase in the average rate earned on investment securities to result in an increase of  in interest income earned on investment securities 
interest income earned on federal funds sold increased  primarily as the result of an increase of basis points in the average rate earned on federal funds sold  which increase was partially offset by a decrease of  in the average balance of federal funds sold 
total interest expense of  for was  or higher than the increase in interest expense is primarily attributable to an increase in the average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  and to a lesser extent due to the change in the mix of interest bearing liabilities 
the average rate paid for interest bearing liabilities during was basis points higher than  with the largest increase in rates reflected in time deposits and short term borrowings 
in addition to the increase in average rates  the average balance of relatively higher costing time deposits and short term borrowings increased during average rates on time deposits under  were basis points higher for as compared to  while average rates on time deposits over  were basis points higher for than for the average rate on short term borrowings for was basis points higher than the increase in the average rate paid on all interest bearing liabilities was responsible for an increase of  in total interest expense 
additionally  increases in the average balance of time deposits and short term borrowings contributed to an additional  increase in total interest expense for as compared to tax equivalent net interest income for increased  or from  and the net interest margin for was basis points higher than that for the increase is primarily attributable to the fact that average rates earned on interest earning assets increased more quickly than rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
during  total interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  increased  or compared to the mix of average interest earning assets remained relatively unchanged for as compared to average federal funds sold  investment securities and loans represented  and  respectively  of average interest earning assets for  as compared to  and  respectively  of average interest earning assets for the increase of  in total interest income for as compared to is primarily attributable to an increase of  in total average interest earning assets  and to a lesser extent  an increase of basis points in the average rate earned on total interest earning assets 
an increase of  in the average balance of loans was partially offset by a decline of basis points in the average rate earned on loans  resulting in a net increase of  in interest income earned on loans 
an increase of  in the average balance of investment securities combined with a basis point increase in the average rate earned on investment securities to result in an increase of  in interest income earned on investment securities 
interest income on federal funds sold increased  primarily as the result of an increase of basis points in the average rate earned on federal funds sold  and to a lesser extent  an increase of  in the average balance of federal funds sold 
total interest expense of  for was  or lower than the composition of interest bearing liabilities changed slightly during as compared to  with relatively lower yielding savings  imma and now deposits comprising of total interest bearing liabilities for as compared to of interest bearing liabilities for conversely  certificates of deposit as a percentage of average interest bearing liabilities declined to for as compared to for the  decrease in interest expense for as compared to is primarily attributable to a decline of basis points in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  which offset an increase of  in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities 
the most significant component of the decline in interest expense for is represented by certificates of deposit under  for which a  decline in the average balance combined with a basis point decline in the average rate paid  to result in a total decrease of  in interest expense for certificates of deposit under  while the volume and rate of certificates of deposit under  declined for  the average balance of certificates of deposit over  increased  and the average rate paid on these deposits increased basis points  resulting in an increase of  in interest expense 
on a combined basis  interest expense for certificates of deposit decreased  for as compared to the average balance of savings and interest bearing demand deposits increased  for as compared to however  the average rate paid on these deposits declined basis points  resulting in an overall decrease of  in interest expense for these categories of deposits for net interest income for increased  or from the company attributes most of this increase to the increase in the balance of average interest earning assets as well as the decline in the average rate paid for interest bearing liabilities 
provision for possible loan losses in determining the provision for possible loan losses management considers historical loan loss experience  changes in composition and volume of the portfolio  the level and composition of non performing loans  the adequacy of the allowance for possible loan losses  and prevailing economic conditions 
the provision for possible loan losses was  and  for  and  respectively 
actual net loan charge offs were  or

non interest income and non interest expenses total non interest income increased  or for as compared to the most significant changes were represented by investment security and loan sale transactions 
during  the company recorded a gain of  from the sale of securities available for sale 
this gain represented an improvement of  over the loss of  recorded from the sale of securities available for sale in additionally  during the company recorded gains of  from the sale of residential mortgages 
these gains represented an improvement of  over the loss of  realized from the sale of residential mortgages during increases of  in atm fee income and  in credit card fees represented the larger components of the  increase in other income 
total non interest income declined  or for as compared to service charges on deposit accounts  which represents the largest component of non interest income  increased  or in as compared to as the result of increased volume and increased fees 
however  this increase was offset by a decline of  in income generated from investment security and loan sale transactions 
the loss of  on the sale of securities mortgages included a loss of  from the sale of securities available for sale and a loss of  from the sale of residential mortgages 
the company had realized a gain of  from the sale of securities during there were no sales of residential mortgages during total non interest expenses of  for are  or lower than salaries and wages are  or higher than those for this increase is attributable in part to an increase of approximately  in incentive salary programs as well as payments of approximately  to selected employees who qualified for and elected to participate in an early retirement program 
the remaining increase is primarily attributable to merit increases 
employee benefits expenses increased  or during as compared to the most significant component of this increase was additional pension expense of  related to the early retirement program for selected employees 
legal fees of  represent an increase of  over legal fees  however  legal fees were reduced by a one time recovery of  resulting from the settlement of an insurance claim 
fdic and occ assessments are  lower in than as the result of the reduction of the fdic assessment during the largest component of the decrease in other expenses are declines in expenses associated with a data processing conversion that occurred during in october  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  which is effective beginning in sfas allows companies either to continue to account for stock based employee compensation plans under existing accounting standards or adopt a fair value based method of accounting for stock options as compensation expense over the service period  as defined in the new standard 
sfas requires that if a company continues to account for stock options under apb it must provide pro forma net income and earnings per share information as if the new fair value approach had been adopted 
the company will continue to follow the existing accounting standards for these plans and will make the required disclosures in total non interest expenses of  for were  or higher than salaries and wages were  or higher than as the result of merit increases for officers and employees  an increase in the management bonus plan for and the accrual of severance pay for a small reduction in force resulting from management s efforts to improve efficiency and reduce costs for future periods 
data processing fees of  for represented an increase of  or over in addition to computer fees  data processing fees also include item processing expenses paid to a third party resulting from the company s outsourcing of its item processing operations in august of these item processing fees were  for the full twelve months of as compared to  for the last four months of the decline in legal fees was primarily due to the recovery of  of legal expenses in in conjunction with the previously announced settlement of certain claims made under the company s insurance policy 
other real estate expense of  for was  or lower than primarily as the result of the reduction in the provision for possible losses on other real estate owned from  for to  for advertising expenses were  or higher than the prior year period due to advertising campaigns to reinforce the bank s image in the communities in which it serves  as well as a campaign to promote its consumer lending products 
the largest component of the increase in other non interest expenses were temporary help and related expenses as the result of additional resources used by the company to assist with a data processing conversion during income taxes in  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which became effective for financial reporting periods beginning after december  effective january   the company adopted sfas  and has reported  as the cumulative effect of that change in the method of accounting for income taxes in the december  consolidated statement of income 
the effective tax rate was in  in and in the decrease in the effective rate to for was primarily due to the recognition of tax benefits resulting from the adjustment of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of december  was  the net change in the total valuation allowance for was a decrease of  which was the result of the accelerated recognition of temporary differences related to the sale of non performing loans in and improvement in the bank s core earnings 
income tax expense was reduced  as a result of the change in the valuation allowance 
financial condition loans total gross loans of  at december  were relatively unchanged from the december  balance of  for  average loans of  represented of total average interest earning assets as compared to of total average interest earning assets for the following table shows the classification of loans by major category  at december  for each of the past five years

the majority of the bank s construction loans consist of loans secured by single or multi family dwellings located in the bank s primary market area 
residential mortgage loans include mortgages for the purchase or refinancing of residential properties and are secured by first liens on those properties 
this category also includes home equity loans which are secured by either a first or second lien on real estate 
commercial mortgages include mortgages on owner occupied buildings and investment properties  secured by first mortgages on these properties

commercial loans primarily represent loans to commercial borrowers for working capital and other short term needs and term loans for the acquisition of assets 
the terms of such loans generally range from one to five years 
installment loans are granted primarily to individuals on an installment basis  may be secured by liens on personally held assets or may be unsecured  and include auto loans  home improvement loans  student loans  revolving credit plans and personal loans

the company s home equity loan portfolio which is included in real estate mortgages in the table above and a substantial portion of its commercial loan portfolio have interest rates that reprice with changes in the prime rate 
allowance for possible loan losses the allowance for possible loan losses is maintained at an amount considered adequate by management and the board of directors to provide for potential credit losses based upon a periodic evaluation of the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio 
management and the board of directors of the company review the allowance for possible loan losses on a regular basis 
management and the board evaluate a number of factors in determining the appropriate level of the allowance for possible loan losses 
weakening credits are evaluated individually and factors such as the creditworthiness of the borrower  the adequacy of underlying collateral and the probable impact of business and economic conditions upon the borrower are examined 
the review process also takes into consideration the possibility that there may be losses in the loan portfolio which cannot currently be identified  and the degree of risk inherent in the composition of the loan portfolio 
the volume of non performing and other classified loans and their relationship to the loan portfolio  as well as historical charge off experience  are also examined 
the following table summarizes the activity in the allowance for possible loan losses over each of the past five years 
also presented are certain key ratios regarding the allowance

the allowance for possible loan losses includes an allocation for all loans classified as special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss see asset quality below for definitions of such classifications 
after allocating the allowance for classified loans  an allocation is made for all non classified loans 
the allocation for non classified loans is made by loan category  based upon the historical loss experience for each loan category as well as perceived risk of loss for each loan category 
the amount of the allowance applicable to non classified loans was  and  at december  and december   respectively 
since these factors are subject to change  the allocation of the allowance for possible loan losses should not be interpreted as an indication that such amounts or proportions will continue or indicate future trends 
the specific amount of the allowance in any particular category may prove excessive or inadequate and consequently may be reallocated in the future to reflect current conditions 
accordingly  the company considers the entire reserve to be available to absorb losses in any category 
asset quality various degrees of credit risk are associated with substantially all investing activities 
management believes that the lending function  however  carries the greatest risk of loss 
the bank s credit due diligence begins at the time a borrower and the bank begin to discuss the origination of a loan 
documentation including a borrower s credit history  materials establishing the value and liquidity of potential collateral  the purpose of the loan  the source and timing of the repayment of the loan and other factors are analyzed before a loan is submitted for approval 
the company attempts to minimize overall credit risk through loan diversification 
the company s loan portfolio is varied  with no undue concentration in any single industry  although most of the loans in the company s loan portfolio have been made to borrowers in new jersey 
individual loan officers are assigned to monitor non installment and non residential mortgage loans and are responsible for the periodic updating of their reviews of such loans 
loan officers are actively encouraged to identify potential deteriorating loan situations through a self reporting system 
installment and residential mortgage loans are primarily monitored through an analysis of their payment status 
classified loan reports are prepared and reviewed regularly by the problem loan committee 
classified loans are categorized into one of several categories  depending upon the condition of the borrower and the strength and amount of collateral 
classifications consist of other loans especially mentioned  defined as loans with only modest deficiencies in documentation and with potentially weakening credit features  substandard loans  defined as loans that have a well defined credit weakness  doubtful loans  defined as loans that have a significantly higher probability of loss than substandard loans  and loss loans which are charged off when they are deemed uncollectible 
non performing assets consist of i non performing loans  which include non accrual loans and loans past due days or more as to interest or principal payments but not placed on non accrual status  ii loans that have been restructured due to a weakening in the financial position of the borrower restructured loans and iii other real estate owned oreo  net of reserves

income on non accrual loans is recognized only in the period in which it is collected 
in addition to the non performing loans as of december  and  the company had classified an additional  and  respectively  as substandard loans 
also  at december  the company had classified a  letter of credit as substandard 
a loan loss reserve has been allocated to such loans and letter of credit in accordance with the company s policies 
in the course of resolving non performing loans  the bank may restructure the contractual terms of its loans with its borrowers 
if  prior to such restructuring  the loan was classified as non accrual  it is the bank s policy to continue to carry these restructured loans on non accrual status for a period of time typically six months before management considers their return to accrual status 
at december   loans aggregating  were categorized as restructured 
these loans are currently performing in accordance with their modified terms 
the level of non performing assets is heavily dependent upon local economic conditions

effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas 
the financial impact of the adoption was  net of tax  which was recorded as an increase to shareholders equity 
sfas requires companies to divide their securities holdings among three categories held to maturity  available for sale  and trading securities 
the accounting standard provides a different accounting treatment for each category 
the company does not have trading securities  but does differentiate between held to maturity securities and available for sale securities 
management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the time of purchase 
if management has the positive intent and the company has the ability at the time of purchase to hold securities until maturity  they are classified as held to maturity securities 
such securities are stated at amortized cost  adjusted for unamortized purchase premiums and discounts 
securities in the available for sale category are those for which the company does not have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity 
available for sale securities are reported at fair value 
any unrealized appreciation or depreciation in the available for sale securities  net of tax effects  is reported as a separate component of equity capital 
at december  and  the company reported net unrealized securities gains losses of  and  respectively  in the shareholders equity section of the consolidated statement of condition 
on november   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a special report  a guide to implementation of statement on accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
the guidance in this special report became effective november  included within the special report is guidance that permitted banking organizations to perform a one time assessment to determine the appropriateness of the designations of all securities currently held 
any resulting redesignations were to be made in conjunction with the guidance allowed banking organizations to transfer debt securities from the held to maturity portfolio before year end  without calling into question their intent to hold other debt securities to maturity 
in accordance with the guidance contained within the special report  effective december   the company transferred securities with a book value of  from held to maturity to available for sale

deposits the bank s deposit base is its primary source of funds 
the bank offers a broad range of deposit products  including non interest bearing demand deposits  now accounts  savings accounts  immas and certificates of deposit 
the december  total deposit balance of  represents an increase of  or from the december  balance of  the most significant portion of this increase is represented by time deposits which were  or higher at december  than at december  this increase resulted primarily from the bank s effort during the first half of to offer more competitive rates in order to increase its deposit base and reduce its short term borrowings which it had relied upon during the first quarter of the following table shows a breakdown of the average balances and average rates paid on the following deposit categories for each of the past three years year ended december  average average average average average average balance rate balance rate balance rate dollars in thousands demand deposits    savings  and interest bearing demand deposits    time deposits    total average deposits    the following is a breakdown of the maturity of time certificates of deposit and other time deposits in excess of  as of december  and december   respectively dec

 dollars in thousands under three months   three to six months   six to twelve months   over twelve months   total   short term borrowings short term borrowings represent federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  which are used to supplement the bank s deposit base as a source of funding 
the majority of these instruments have terms ranging from one to thirty days 
these balances increased  to  at december  from  at december  additionally  the average balance of short term borrowings was  during  as the bank drew down certain of its lines of credit for repurchase agreements to supplement its liquidity management program during the first quarter of the maximum balance outstanding also occurred during the first quarter of the increase in the outstanding balance coupled with the increased cost of borrowed funds contributed to an increase of  in interest expense on short term borrowings for as compared to information regarding the levels of short term borrowings for each of the past three years is as follows december  dollars in thousands balance  end of year maximum outstanding during the year at any month end  average interest rate  end of year average outstanding during the year  average interest rate for the year the average amounts outstanding were computed from daily averages and the average interest rates for the period were computed by dividing the respective interest expense by the average balance outstanding 
liquidity of the bank the bank actively monitors its liquidity position to insure that it has sufficient funds to provide for cash outflows without incurring losses from the premature liquidation of assets or the unexpected acquisition of costly liabilities 
the bank s cash outflows encompass interest paid to depositors and other creditors  deposit withdrawals  and disbursements to acquire assets and pay general operating costs 
the bank obtains cash from customers in the form of interest and principal payments on loans  fees paid for services  and from new deposits 
investment maturities also provide a source of cash 
many different measurements of liquidity are used in the banking industry 
the ratios of cash and cash equivalents including federal funds sold and short term securities to total assets and net loans to total deposits are among some of the more commonly used indicators 
these measurements are set forth below as of december  and dec 
 dec 
 cash and cash equivalents and securities maturing in one year to total assets net loans to total deposits the increase in the ratio of cash and cash equivalents and securities maturing in one year to total assets is primarily attributable to the increase in federal funds sold at december  as compared to december  contributing to this increase in short term investible funds was an increase of approximately  in now account balances at december  as compared to december  included in savings and interest bearing demand deposits on the consolidated statement of condition which due to their volatile  short term nature  are invested in federal funds sold 
an additional  was invested in federal funds sold at december  pending the settlement in january of securities purchased in december to assist in the management of its liquidity  the bank had available  in lines of credit with correspondent banks  which lines were not in use at december  managing the bank s liquidity position involves a significant degree of analytical estimation and other objective factors 
although customer demand for funds  in the form of loans or deposit withdrawals  is largely dependent on general economic factors outside of the bank s control  management believes that its present liquidity structure is adequate to meet such needs 
liquidity of bancorporation bancorporation s ability to meet its cash requirements  including dividend payments  is generally dependent upon the declaration and payment of dividends by the bank to bancorporation 
under federal law  the approval of the comptroller of the currency is required for the payment of dividends in any calendar year by broad national bank to broad national bancorporation if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year exceeds the net income for that year combined with the retained net income for the preceding two calendar years 
as of december  retained earnings of the bank of  are available for payment of dividends to the parent company without regulatory approval 
additionally  at december   bancorporation had available  of cash for the purpose of paying future dividends and operating costs 
however  a change in circumstances  such as changes in regulatory requirements or in the bank s financial condition  could result in bancorporation being required by regulatory authorities to utilize its funds to increase the bank s capital 
in such event  bancorporation may not have sufficient cash for operations or to make dividend payments and may be required to seek other sources of capital and liquidity  if available 
interest rate sensitivity management of interest rate sensitivity involves matching the maturity and repricing dates of interest earning assets with those of interest bearing liabilities in an effort to manage the impact of fluctuating net interest rates on net interest margins 
the company s asset liability committee the committee meets at least monthly to establish  communicate  coordinate and control asset liability management procedures 
the purpose of the committee is to monitor the volume and mix of the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities consistent with the company s overall liquidity  capital  growth  risk and profitability goals 
interest rate sensitivity is measured as the difference between the percentage of assets and liabilities in the company s existing portfolio that are subject to repricing within specified time periods 
these differences  known as interest sensitivity gaps  are usually calculated cumulatively for blocks of time 
companies that are asset sensitive a positive gap have more assets than liabilities subject to repricing within specified time periods and these companies are likely to benefit in periods of rising interest rates  but suffer as rates decrease 
companies that are liability sensitive a negative gap are likely to benefit in periods of declining rates  but suffer as rates increase 
an interest sensitivity table is not a complete picture of the possible effect of interest rate changes on net interest income 
first  changes in the general level of interest rates will not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously 
second  the table represents a one day position variations occur daily as the company adjusts its interest sensitivity throughout the year 
third  the repricing distribution of interest sensitive assets may not be indicative of the liquidity of those assets 
finally  since this table is based on contractual maturities  it does not include required principal payments or estimates of early principal payments on residential mortgages  installment loans and investment securities

the federal reserve board measures capital adequacy for bank holding companies by using a risk based capital framework and by monitoring compliance with minimum leverage guidelines 
effective december   bank holding companies were required to maintain a ratio of at least between capital and risk weighted assets  of which approximately one half must be in tier capital 
in addition  the federal reserve board has established minimum leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies 
these guidelines provide for a minimum leverage ratio tier capital to quarterly average total assets less goodwill of for bank holding companies that meet certain criteria  including that they maintain the highest regulatory rating 
all other bank holding companies are required to maintain a leverage ratio of plus an additional cushion of at least to basis points
