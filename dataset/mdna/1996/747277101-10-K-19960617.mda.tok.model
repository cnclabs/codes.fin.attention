operating income the company s results for the twelve month period ended march  were adversely impacted in the first half of the year by the loss of sales to seagate technology  inc also during the fiscal year  one large oem decreased purchases of one older product at a much faster rate than purchases increased for its replacement product 
these events reduced the company s gross profits for fiscal year operating income for the year ended march  decreased million from the year ended april  the lower operating income for the year ended march  was associated with gross profit as a percentage of sales decreasing by percent compared to the prior year 
a partially offsetting factor was a decrease in operating expense of million from the prior fiscal year

both the semiconductor and the computer peripherals industries are highly competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards 
all of the company s products compete with products available from numerous companies  many of which have substantially greater research and development  marketing and financial resources  manufacturing capability  customer support organizations and brand recognition than those of the company 
there can be no assurance that the company s scsi products will be able to compete successfully with other scsi products offered presently or in the future by other scsi vendors 
although the company believes that it provides an adequate allowance for sales returns  there can be no assurance that future sales returns will not exceed the company s allowance in any particular fiscal quarter  and therefore  could have a material adverse effect on operating results 
the company provides its major distributors and certain volume purchasers with price protection in the event that the company reduces the price of its products 
although the company believes that it has provided an adequate allowance for price protection  there can be no assurance that the impact of future price reductions by the company will not exceed the company s allowance in any specific fiscal period 
any price protection in excess of recorded allowances could result in a material adverse effect on operating results 
a significant portion of the company s revenue in each fiscal quarter results from orders booked in that quarter 
a significant percentage of the company s bookings and sales to major customers on a quarterly basis historically has occurred during the last month of the quarter and have typically been concentrated in the latter half of that month 
orders placed by major customers are typically based upon the customers forecasted sales level for company products and inventory levels of company products desired to be maintained by the major distribution customers at the time of the orders 
major distribution customers sometimes receive negotiated cash rebates  market development funds  and extended payment terms from the company for incentive purposes  in accordance with  or in some cases  above and beyond standard industry practice 
changes in purchasing patterns by one or more of the company s major customers  customer policies pertaining to desired inventory levels of company products  negotiations of rebate and market development funds  as well as changes in the ability of the company to anticipate in advance the mix of customer orders or to ship large quantities of products near the end of a fiscal quarter  could result in material fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
these factors could also increase the inventory levels maintained by the company and adversely affect the inventory reserves required to be maintained by the company 
the company s revenue during the fourth quarter of fiscal resulted primarily from the company s oem business 
in the company s oem business  backlog is a significant source of subsequent period revenue and profits 
the company s backlog at march  was approximately million  a million increase from the end of the prior fiscal year 
the company believes that there is a desire among certain major distribution customers and volume purchasers to reduce their on hand inventory levels of computer products  including the company s products 
this could have a significant adverse impact on the company s operating results during the future period or periods that such customers initiate such inventory reductions 
the timing of new product announcements and introductions by the company or significant product returns by major distribution customers to the company could also result in material fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
in addition to the factors described above that could adversely affect the company s business and results of operations  and  therefore  the market valuation of its common stock  the company s future results of operations may be impacted by various trends and uncertainties that are beyond the company s control  including adverse changes in general economic conditions  government regulations and foreign currency fluctuations 
other characteristics of the company and the computer software and hardware industry may adversely impact the company 
as the company s products become more complex  the company could experience delays in product development that are common in the computer industry 
significant delays in product development and release would adversely affect the company s results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will respond effectively to technological changes or new product announcements by other companies or that the company s research and development efforts will be successful 
furthermore  introduction of new products  moving production of existing products to different suppliers  and customers extended use of mature products involves substantial business risks because of the possibility of product bugs or performance problems  in which event the company could experience significant product returns  warranty expenses and expedite charges  in addition to lower sales and lower profits 
as a result of the foregoing factors  past performance trends by the company may not be indicative of future operating results and should not be used by investors in predicting or anticipating future results 
the market price of the company s common stock has been  and may continue to be  volatile 
factors identified above  along with other factors that may arise in the future  quarterly fluctuations in the company s operating results and general conditions or perceptions of securities analysts relating to technology stocks in general or to the company specifically  may have a significant impact on the market price of the company s common stock and could cause substantial market price fluctuations over short periods
