for the year ended september  fiscal  the company recorded net earnings of  or per share  all from the continuing operations of its investment management business  compared to a net loss for the fiscal year ended september  fiscal of million or per share  of which  or per share  was from the continuing operations of the newly acquired investment management business   from the loss on operations of the discontinued mortgage business  and million from the loss on the discontinuance of its remaining mortgage banking operations 
the net loss for fiscal compares to a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended september  fiscal  all of which was from the discontinued mortgage banking operations 
the company commenced its investment management operations on april   when it consummated the acquisition of certain investment management assets 
on february   the company announced the discontinuance of its remaining mortgage banking operations see item business general 
fiscal net earnings include a million income tax benefit recognized in the fourth quarter 
the company recorded this tax benefit because the company believes that it is more likely than not that it will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to allow for the realization of the recorded benefit 
as of september  the company had net operating loss carryforwards of million  which expire between the fiscal year ending september  and the fiscal year ending september  regulations promulgated by internal revenue code irc section substantially restrict the ability of the company to use its net operating loss carryforwards to offset future income upon a change of control 
generally  a change of control is deemed to occur if the cumulative percentage of ownership change of a company s common shares is greater than percent during a prescribed measurement period 
for purposes of irc section  the company s cumulative change of control  as of september   was approximately percent 
due to the acquisition and the discontinuance of its mortgage banking operations in fiscal  the company does not believe that results of operations for fiscal and fiscal are comparable to the results of operations for the same periods in fiscal accordingly  the results of continuing operations are discussed herein separately from the results of the company s discontinued operations 
furthermore  because fiscal represented the first full year of the company s investment management operations  changes in the financial results of continuing operations from fiscal to fiscal are primarily attributable to the increased period of operations in fiscal one year compared to approximately six months of operations in fiscal  except where otherwise discussed below 
investment management continuing operations year ended september  compared to year ended september  revenues for fiscal totaled million  an increase of million over fiscal revenues  all of which were realized after april  the major components of the company s revenues from continuing operations are management and administrative fees and distribution fees 
management and administrative fees for fiscal  net of subadvisory fees of  see item business general  were million  an increase of million over fiscal which were net of subadvisory fees of  these fees are based on the average net assets of the funds plus any borrowings of pilgrim america prime rate trust in aggregate  assets see item business pilgrim america funds 
assets of the funds totaled billion at september  versus billion at september   an increase of million 
distribution fees were million for fiscal  an increase of  over fiscal distribution fees are based on the average net assets of the company s open end funds  which totaled million as of september  compared to million at september   an increase of million 
the increase of million in assets under management during fiscal resulted primarily from a million increase in the market value of managed assets and an increase in pilgrim america prime rate trust borrowings of million  substantially all of which occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal additionally  direct sales of open end funds accounted for million of the increase  while redemptions including exchanges into a money market fund for which the company acts as servicing agent totaled million and distributions paid in cash to shareholders of both open end and closed end funds totaled million 
for fiscal  assets increased by million between the acquisition date and september  this increase resulted primarily from a million increase in the market value of managed assets 
direct sales of mutual funds were million for the period  while redemptions totaled million and distributions paid in cash to shareholders totaled million 
additionally  the company invested million in order to seed three funds introduced during the period 
the company s operating expenses of million for fiscal  an increase of million over fiscal  include general and administrative expense  selling expense and amortization 
general and administrative expense  which totaled million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  include compensation and related expenses  occupancy and other operating expenses related to the company s investment management operations and general corporate operations 
additionally  pursuant to agreements between the company and certain of the funds  the company has agreed to limit certain expense ratios of such funds  and reimburses the funds for amounts that exceed specified ratios 
during fiscal and fiscal  such reimbursements totaled  and  respectively  and are included in general and administrative expense 
selling expenses are related to the distribution of the open end funds  and include salaries of sales and marketing personnel  costs related to the production of marketing materials  and commissions and fees paid to various authorized dealers in connection with the sale of fund shares 
selling expenses were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase is due to a full year of operations in fiscal compared to approximately six months in fiscal as well as an increase in sales and marketing efforts during fiscal  as the company continued to develop its emphasis on marketing its open end funds 
amortization and depreciation of in fiscal  an increase of million over fiscal  was primarily due to amortization of costs of management contracts acquired in connection with the acquisition  depreciation of furniture  fixtures and equipment and amortization of commissions paid to authorized dealers in connection with the sale of class b share sales see item business distribution of open end fund shares 
mortgage banking discontinued operations the company announced the discontinuance of its mortgage banking operations on february  the announcement date 
the activities of the company s mortgage banking operations for fiscal and fiscal through the announcement date therefore have been reflected as loss from operations of discontinued mortgage business in the company s consolidated statements of operations for the respective periods 
as of the announcement date  the company also recorded a provision of  for the estimated net loss from the discontinuance of its mortgage banking operations 
the provision included the anticipated mortgage banking revenues and expenses  including severance expense and all other costs  that the company estimated would be incurred to phase out these operations 
subsequent to the announcement date  during fiscal the company increased the provision to million  reflected as loss on discontinuance of mortgage operations in the company s consolidated statement of operations  based on reevaluation of its allowances for discontinued operations  including an accrual of million for estimated legal costs relating to legal proceedings see item legal proceedings 
based on continued evaluation of the allowances  management believes that no additional provision was required for fiscal year ended september  compared to year ended september  the company recorded a loss of  from discontinued operations in fiscal  compared to a loss of million in fiscal total revenues from the mortgage banking operations decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease resulted primarily from i the sale of substantially all of the company s loan servicing portfolio on september   ii a decrease in loan origination volume which reduced loan origination income  iii a reduction in the level of sales of servicing rights relating to loans originated by the company  iv the discontinuation of the mortgage banking operations on february   resulting in the inclusion of only five months of operating results for fiscal  and v losses incurred on the sale of originated loans 
total expenses of the company s discontinued operations were million in fiscal compared to million for fiscal the decline in all items of expense was attributable primarily to the sale of the company s servicing portfolio and the volume decline in its originations prior to the discontinuance of those operations  as well as the inclusion of only five months of mortgage banking operating results in fiscal the company also recorded an income tax benefit  related to the mortgage banking operations  of million in fiscal  which is included in the loss from discontinued operations  compared with a million tax provision in fiscal the benefit resulted primarily from the utilization of a net operating loss carry back to offset a previously recorded tax liability 
in fiscal  the company had also recorded an extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt of million 
liquidity and capital resources on september   the company sold substantially all of its mortgage loan servicing assets the servicing sale  realizing cash proceeds of million and a five year note in the amount of million 
the company used million of such proceeds to repay term debt related to the servicing assets 
the remainder of the proceeds of million was applied to temporarily reduce borrowings under the company s revolving warehouse line of credit 
on april   the company redeployed a substantial portion of the assets from the servicing sale to complete the acquisition see item business general 
as of september  and september   the company owned mortgage loans and foreclosed real estate with principal balances aggregating approximately million and million  respectively 
the company s investments in these loans and real estate are funded with the company s working capital and with borrowings under a warehousing credit agreement see discussion below until they are sold 
the company also had an allowance of million and million to provide  at september  and september   respectively  for estimated losses to be incurred upon repurchase and resale of loans originated and indemnified by the company 
an increase in repurchase activity beyond that forecasted by the company may have an adverse effect on the company s liquidity 
on january   the company and its lender entered into a warehousing credit agreement the warehousing agreement  whereby the lender has agreed to provide the company with up to million in financing to repurchase certain mortgage loans relating to the company s discontinued mortgage banking business 
under the terms of the warehousing agreement  the company may borrow up to of the lesser of i the repurchase price of the related mortgage loan  ii the remaining principal balance of the mortgage loan  and iii the fair market value of the mortgage loan 
borrowings are collateralized by the related mortgage instruments and certain other of the company s assets 
as of september  the company has borrowed million under the warehousing agreement 
the borrowings are included in net liabilities of discontinued operations in the company s consolidated balance sheet as of september  on april   the company and its lender entered into a credit agreement as amended  the pilgrim america credit agreement or agreement to finance the company s fund management operations 
under the pilgrim america credit agreement  the lender agreed to provide the company with million of term loans term loans and up to million of loans to finance the sale of fund shares subject to a contingent deferred sales charge 
on july   the company and its lender amended and restated the pilgrim america credit agreement 
the restated agreement allows pag to borrow up to million to be used for various purposes including i general corporate purposes  ii acquisition of investment management contracts  and iii financing of commissions paid by the company in connection with sales of fund shares subject to a contingent deferred sales charge 
the agreement contains restrictive covenants which require pag and the company to maintain certain financial ratios and prohibits restricted payments including dividends and other payments from pag to the company 
borrowings under the agreement are collateralized by assets of pag  pas and pai  and guaranteed by the company 
loans may be drawn down until july  and are repayable quarterly beginning on september  and ending on september  additionally  the company is obligated to pay a monthly commitment fee of  annualized  of any unused borrowing availability 
as of september  the company had borrowed million under the agreement 
there were no borrowings under the agreement at september  between november and january  the company repurchased  shares of its common stock at a total purchase price of million 
these purchases were made in open market transactions pursuant to a previously announced authorization by the company s board of directors to repurchase up to  shares of common stock based upon market conditions 
on september   the company repurchased  shares of its common stock from two institutional stockholders at a price of per share for a total of million 
these purchases were funded with borrowings under the agreement  of which was borrowed on september  and the balance  million  borrowed on october  during fiscal and  the company redeemed  and  shares  respectively  of its series a preferred stock at the liquidation value of per share  for an aggregate redemption price of  and  respectively 
as of september  there were  such shares issued and outstanding 
the remaining shares were redeemed at their liquidation value on march  as discussed in item legal proceedings  the company and certain of its current and former officers are named as defendants in a complaint filed by the rtc alleging violations relating to the company s acquisition of wesav mortgage corporation in although the company believes that its officers acted properly and that it has strong meritorious defenses  an unfavorable determination by the court may have a material adverse effect on the company s operations and liquidity 
economic factors economic changes  including changes in inflation  interest rates  and financial market conditions  may cause investors to decide against purchasing  or to redeem investments in  certain types of mutual funds  including those offered by the company 
to the extent investors refrain from purchasing the shares of the company s funds  or redeem significant amounts from the funds  the company s revenues  and growth in such revenues which are derived from assets under management  may be adversely affected 
additionally  the company relies on borrowings to finance the payment of commissions on sales of shares sold with a contingent deferred sales charge b shares 
to the extent interest rates increase substantially or the company is not able to secure adequate financing  sales of b shares  and related revenues therefrom  may be adversely affected 
the investment management business is not generally capital intensive 
except for the effect on revenues as described above  the financial results of continuing operations would not be significantly affected by inflation and price changes 
newly adopted accounting standards in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that long lived assets and certain identified intangibles to be disposed of be reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
sfas no 
must be adopted for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  the impact on the company of adopting sfas no 
is not expected to be material 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  issued by the fasb in october  applies to all transactions in which an entity acquires goods or services by issuing equity instruments or by incurring liabilities where the payment amounts are based on the entity s common stock price  except for employee stock ownership plans esops 
a new method of accounting for stock based compensation arrangements with employees is established by the statement 
the new method is a fair value based method rather than the intrinsic value based method that is contained in apb opinion no 
opinion 
sfas no 
fair value based method will result in higher compensation costs than the opinion intrinsic value based method for fixed stock option compensation plans and will result in a different compensation cost for variable stock option compensation plans 
also  many employee stock purchase plans that are considered noncompensatory under opinion will be compensatory and result in the recognition of compensation costs under the fair value based method 
sfas no 
does not require an entity to adopt the new fair value based method for purposes of preparing its basic financial statements 
entities are allowed i to continue to use the opinion method or ii to adopt the statement no 
fair value based method 
the company is intending to use the former method upon implementation of sfas  with the attendant disclosures required by the statement 
the financial statement disclosures required under sfas no 
are to be adopted for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  the impact on the company of adopting sfas no 
is not expected to be material 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
sfas provides accounting and reporting standards for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
these standards are based on consistent application of a financial components approach that focuses on control 
under that approach  after a transfer of financial assets  an entity recognizes the financial and servicing assets it controls and the liabilities it has incurred  derecognizes financial assets when control has been surrendered and derecognizes liabilities when extinguished 
sfas provides consistent standards for distinguishing transfers of financial assets that are sales from transfers that are secured borrowings 
sfas requires that liabilities and derivatives incurred or obtained by transferors as part of a transfer of financial assets be initially measured at fair value  if practicable 
it also requires that servicing assets and other retained interests in the transferred assets be measured by allocating the previous carrying amount between the assets sold  if any  and retained interest  if any  based on their relative fair values at the date of the transfers 
sfas includes specific provisions to deal with servicing assets or liabilities 
sfas will be effective for transactions occurring after december  it is not anticipated that the financial impact of this statement will have a material effect on the company
