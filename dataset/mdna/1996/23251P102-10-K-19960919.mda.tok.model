summary cyberonics was founded in to design  develop and bring to market medical devices which provide a novel therapy  vagus nerve stimulation  for the treatment of epilepsy and other debilitating neurological disorders 
clinical trials of the company s investigational neurocybernetic prosthesis ncp r system began with the first patient implant in november under an ide from the fda 
the company has been unprofitable to date  has had minimal revenues and expects to incur operating losses through the next several years due to continuing requirements for research and development activities including product and process development and clinical trials and related regulatory activities  sales and marketing activities and manufacturing start up

cyberonics is continuing the clinical testing of the ncp system under its ide from the fda 
in january  the company announced that its amended pma application was accepted for filing by the fda 
while the amended pma application has been accepted for filing  the fda further informed the company that  based on its initial scientific review of the amended pma application  there were significant deficiencies in the submission and that an amendment containing certain additional clinical and technical information must be provided before the regulatory review process could continue 
in response to further discussions with the fda  the company announced in july that it would initiate an additional confirmatory us clinical trial for the ncp system 
based on these discussions with the fda  this study is an additional requirement of the fda s regulatory approval process for the ncp system for the treatment of epilepsy patients experiencing refractory partial seizures 
in january  the company announced that it had received permission to begin enrolling patients into its additional confirmatory trial  under which an additional patients were targeted for enrollment at major investigational centers in the united states 
approximately to patients are expected to complete the confirmatory trial 
completion of the trial and submission of the data is expected to take place by the end of calendar  although it may take longer 
there can be no assurance that the company will adequately address the concerns raised by the fda  or that additional concerns will not be raised by the fda in the future 
the timing of the pma approval process is unpredictable and there can be no assurance as to when or whether the company will receive pre market approval 
the company is currently clinically testing the ncp system under an ide from the fda and cannot commence marketing or commercial sales of the ncp system in the united states until it receives pre market approval from the fda 
the company s business  financial condition and results of operations are critically dependent upon receiving fda approval of the company s pma application 
cyberonics is pursuing government and third party reimbursement approvals for the ncp system in the united states and in international markets 
the company believes that such approvals will be critical to market acceptance of the ncp system when and if regulatory approvals are obtained 
there can be no assurance that third party reimbursement will be available to enable the company to successfully market the ncp system in the united states when and if the company s pma is approved or  if available  that the level of reimbursement will be sufficient to enable the company to sell the ncp system on a profitable basis 
the health care industry in the united states is undergoing substantial change  and there is substantial uncertainty and turmoil surrounding the issues of funding  reimbursement and regulatory approval 
while the company believes that the ncp system will be favorably viewed in the context of the changing health care industry  there can be no assurances that the pending health care reforms will not adversely affect regulatory or reimbursement approvals for the ncp system 
the company does not expect to achieve significant sales unless and until both regulatory and reimbursement approvals are obtained for the ncp system and even if such approvals are obtained  there can be no assurance the company will achieve significant sales 
in june  the company was granted regulatory approval to market the ncp system in the original twelve member countries of the european union after having obtained ce marking  the designation of market approval now universally accepted by all european union member countries 
the company has obtained government and third party reimbursement approval in certain of the european union member countries and is continuing to pursue full reimbursement approval for substantially all of the remaining european union member countries 
the company does not believe that significant sales volume can be generated without full reimbursement approval 
there can be no assurances as to when or whether such reimbursement will be obtained in any of these european union member countries or  if obtained  whether the levels of reimbursement will be sufficient to enable the company to sell the ncp system on a profitable basis 
the company believes that existing and future antiepileptic drug compounds will be the primary competition for its ncp system  although the company could also face competition from other medical devices 
three new antiepileptic drugs  felbamate  gabapentin and lamotrigine recently received fda approval 
no other major antiepileptic drugs have been introduced in the united states since in august  the manufacturer of felbamate announced that  in conjunction with recommendations from the fda  it was advising that patients be withdrawn from the drug based on reports of serious complications 
there can be no assurance that the ncp system will achieve market acceptance for the treatment of epilepsy or any other indication 
the company relies upon sole source suppliers for certain of the key components and materials used in its products 
the company routinely experiences discontinuation or unavailability of components and materials requiring qualification of alternative sources or  if no such alternative sources are identified  product design changes 
qualifying alternative sources and redesigning products can be time consuming 
in addition  such changes generally require regulatory submissions and approvals 
specifically  the company is aware of future product design changes that will be required to incorporate a new battery and microprocessor into the ncp generators circuitry 
although the company believes that these changes will be made without disruption  any extended delays in or inability to secure alternate sources for these or other components and materials could result in product supply and manufacturing interruptions which could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to manufacture its products and therefore on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources from inception through february the company financed its operations primarily through private placements of its securities and had raised approximately million in net proceeds 
in february  the company completed an initial public offering of  shares of its common stock  generating net proceeds to the company of approximately million 
additionally  through june   the company has funded approximately  of its equipment needs with proceeds from an equipment lease agreement 
as further described below  in july the company raised an additional million net of offering costs in a sale of  shares of its common stock to st 
jude medical  inc the company has no short or long term borrowings outstanding at june   and has no credit facilities available at this time 
the company expects to incur substantial additional costs related to clinical trials and regulatory activities  expansion of manufacturing capabilities  sales and marketing activities associated with preparation for united states and international market entry and product and process development 
in addition  if regulatory and reimbursement approvals are obtained  the company will incur substantial marketing and distribution expenses 
the amount and timing of anticipated expenditures will depend upon numerous factors both within and outside of the company s control 
factors within the company s control include the nature and timing of additional clinical trials for partial seizures and for other indications  and the nature and timing of marketing and sales activities 
factors affecting the amount and timing of expenditures which are largely beyond the company s control include the clinical trial and regulatory activities associated with the company s effort to obtain fda approval of its pma application for partial seizures 
moreover  even if the company obtains pma approval for the ncp system for partial seizures  the company s ability to generate income from operations will be dependent upon obtaining reimbursement approval from government and third party payors as well as receiving market acceptance for the ncp system 
therefore  while the company believes that its current resources will be sufficient to fund its operations at least through its current fiscal year ending june   the company will require additional funds after that date 
on april   the company and st 
jude medical  inc st 
jude entered into an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement and a common stock purchase agreement the stock purchase agreement 
pursuant to the stock purchase agreement  upon approval of the merger agreement by holders of a majority of the company s outstanding common stock  st 
jude agreed to purchase  shares of the company s newly issued common stock at per share  representing a cash investment in the company of million before deducting commissions and other offering costs 
on july   cyberonics shareholders approved the merger agreement and the stock purchase agreement  the stock purchase was completed  and st 
jude provided the company with cash proceeds totaling million 
the company believes that the proceeds from this investment will be sufficient to fund its operations as an independent entity through at least june  the availability of financing at that time will depend upon a number of important factors  including the state of the united states capital markets and economy in general and the health care and medical device segments in particular  the status of the company s international sales activities and the status of the company s clinical and regulatory activities 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to raise such capital when needed or that the terms upon which capital will be available will be favorable to the company 
in addition to providing the company with million of additional capital  the merger agreement further gives st 
jude the right  but not the obligation  to acquire the company on or before october  in a merger pursuant to which the holders of company common stock other than st 
jude will receive cash totaling approximately million 
the company s liquidity will continue to be reduced as amounts are expended for continuing clinical trials and related regulatory affairs  manufacturing start up  product and process development  and expansion of sales and marketing activities 
while not currently anticipated  the company s liquidity could also be substantially reduced if significant amounts were expended for additional facilities and equipment 
results of operations net sales 
cyberonics has been granted regulatory approval to market and sell the ncp system internationally in the original twelve member countries of the european union the united kingdom  germany  the netherlands  france  spain  italy  belgium  denmark  greece  portugal  ireland and luxembourg and has permission to sell in certain other international markets including sweden  norway  finland  switzerland  israel  australia  south africa  hong kong and china 
cyberonics is engaged in obtaining reimbursement approvals from the various health care provider systems that exist in these countries and has received partial or complete reimbursement approvals in a number of these markets 
during the year ending june   the company expects that the substantial majority of its net sales will be generated from its international markets  the extent of which will depend  in part  on the success of future efforts to obtain broader international reimbursement approval and additional countries regulatory approvals 
in the united states  the company has permission from the fda to sell the ncp systems used in clinical trials for up to  per system 
given the experimental nature of the device  the company believes that widespread reimbursement from government and third party payors is unlikely in connection with its clinical studies 
therefore  the company has not aggressively sought to sell the ncp systems used in the clinical studies 
the company does not expect to achieve significant sales unless and until both regulatory and reimbursement approvals are obtained for the ncp system 
net sales for the year ended june  totaled  compared to  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
domestic sales depend entirely upon the company conducting clinical trial activities under arrangements with certain investigational centers  some of which receive research funding from the company 
domestic sales made in connection with such clinical studies have been limited to date and are expected to decline in the future as the company is not presently seeking reimbursement for implants associated with its current united states clinical trial 
arrangements with certain investigational centers employ risk sharing provisions 
domestic sales made under risk sharing arrangements are deferred until cyberonics receives payment from the centers and the centers in turn receive third party reimbursement or satisfy other terms set forth in their respective arrangements 
sales  net of risk sharing provisions  for the year ended june   consisted of  from international markets and  from domestic risk sharing arrangements 
gross profit 
in determining gross profit  cost of sales is calculated primarily to include the acquisition cost of raw materials and components  direct labor and allocated manufacturing overhead 
direct labor and overhead constitute a substantial majority of cost of sales 
the company is obligated to pay royalties ranging from to on the first million in net sales  and from to thereafter 
minimum royalty obligations under the company s license agreements totaled  during each of the years ended june   and  and will continue at or above this level in future years 
royalties up to the minimum amount are presently classified as research and development expenses while amounts exceeding this minimum are included as a component of the company s cost of sales 
the company s gross margin percentage was for the year ended june  compared to and for fiscal and  respectively 
the fiscal increase is attributable primarily to a shift in international sales mix toward markets where the company sells its products directly  resulting in higher average selling prices and consequently  higher gross margins 
continued fluctuations in gross margin percentages can be expected prior to the company achieving commercial levels of production volume  particularly if the company continues to experience period to period changes in unit production 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses are comprised of both expenses related to the company s product and process development efforts and expenses associated with conducting clinical trials and certain related regulatory activities 
research and development expenses totaled   and  during the years ended june   and  respectively 
the increased level of research and development expenditures is due primarily to the costs associated with the company s confirmatory clinical trial which was at its peak level of activity during fiscal the company expects research and development spending to decrease during fiscal as the company s confirmatory clinical trial is completed 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses totaled   and  during the years ended june   and  respectively 
the continued increases from year to year were primarily due to expanded international market development and marketing activities 
the company expects to incur higher selling  general and administrative expenses in developing its international market and in anticipation of regulatory and reimbursement approvals for the ncp system  and expects these expenses to increase significantly when and if such approvals are obtained 
interest income  net 
net interest income totaled   and  during the years ended june   and  respectively 
due to the july equity investment totaling net proceeds of million from st

for each of these years  other income expense consisted of net gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions 
income taxes 
at june   the company had net operating loss carry forwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million which expire during the years through  and tax credit carryforwards of approximately million for federal income tax purposes which expire during the years through due to its net operating loss history  to date the company has incurred no income tax expense for financial reporting purposes 
current federal income tax regulations with respect to changes in ownership could limit the utilization of the company s net operating loss carryforwards
