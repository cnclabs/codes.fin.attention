item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following commentary should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to financial statements 
compared to overview the company reported net earnings of million  or per share  in compared to net earnings of million  or per share  in net earnings from continuing operations before extraordinary item were million  or per share  in  reflecting increases of and  respectively  over the comparable results in excluding the gain on the sale of eastern s united states filter corporation us filter investment and the provision for environmental expenses from results  earnings and earnings per share from continuing operations increased by approximately and  respectively  over the prior year  which was adjusted to exclude the gain on the sale of a barge construction and repair facility 
earnings from discontinued operations in reflect the net earnings of waterpro which was sold in and the after tax gain realized on the settlement of eastern s lawsuit relating to its purchase of ionpure see note 
in the fourth quarter of  eastern accrued a pretax charge of million to increase its accrual  first recorded in  for the estimated undiscounted liability for health care and death benefit premiums imposed by the coal industry retiree health benefit act of coal act  primarily due to a subsequent assignment to eastern of additional miners and their beneficiaries 
as described in note  this charge has been reported as an extraordinary item of million or 
per share 
change in millions revenues boston gas midland total the increase in consolidated revenues from to primarily reflects significant increases in midland s rates for transporting non coal commodities 
change in millions operating earnings boston gas midland headquarters total k the increase in operating earnings from to primarily reflects increased non coal transportation rates and ideal operating conditions at midland  partially offset by the impact of demand related factors and warmer weather as well as costs associated with early retirement and severance programs at boston gas and higher unallocated headquarters expense 
other income in includes a million gain on the sale of eastern s us filter investment and increased interest income on higher cash balances  partly offset by a million provision for environmental expenses  as described in notes and other income for includes a million gain on the sale of midland s barge construction and repair facility in louisiana 
the effective tax rate in was lower than in  principally because the gain on the sale of the us filter investment was offset by a realized tax loss on the sale of waterpro which had been written down in boston gas revenues in decreased by million as increased sales to new and existing firm customers were more than offset by demand related factors involving a reduction in weather adjusted gas consumption 
weather for was of normal  which was warmer than increased revenues from non firm sales and transportation were partially offsetting 
operating earnings decreased million from sales to new firm customers and the recognition of lost margins associated with conservation programs increased operating earnings  partly offsetting the impact of reduced demand and warmer weather 
higher operating costs  primarily reflecting non recurring charges associated with early retirement and severance programs for both management and union employees were partially offset by the related reduction in labor costs and reduced weather related workload during the first half of the year 
these reductions were part of boston gas ongoing reengineering program focused on improving customer service and lowering operating costs 
midland enterprises revenues and operating earnings increased by million and million  respectively  in over  primarily reflecting higher transportation rates 
partially offsetting were reduced revenues resulting from contractual rate reductions on long term utility coal contracts 
operating earnings benefited from continued productivity improvements and excellent operating conditions 
ton miles increased to a new record level  although total tonnage transported declined  due to significantly longer trip lengths 
coal tonnage declined  with coal shipments under long term contracts increasing and spot coal tonnage declining  reflecting a weak second half market 
non coal ton miles increased although tonnage was essentially unchanged from midland s focus on longer haul  higher margin non coal commodities more than offset the weakness in the spot coal market 
as a result  grain tonnage increased with ores and steel tonnage up over as compared to operating results from terminal and support operations were relatively unchanged from levels 
k compared to change in millions revenues boston gas midland total the increase in consolidated revenues from to primarily reflects the impact of boston gas november rate increase and significantly increased tonnages transported by midland  partly offset by lower freight rates and the absence of revenues from its liquid barge business  which was sold in december change in millions operating earnings boston gas midland headquarters total the improvement in operating earnings from to primarily reflects the impact of boston gas rate increase  partially offset by higher depreciation and property taxes  and at midland  the effect of cost reduction and productivity improvement programs and better operating conditions  partially offset by lower contracted rates for coal transportation 
a seventeen week work stoppage at boston gas  record flooding in the midwest and the umw strike decreased operating earnings in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased to million in from million in  primarily reflecting the increase in operating earnings described above  with higher interest expense and lower interest income offset by higher other income  as described in note the increase in interest expense reflects additional borrowings at boston gas and higher dividends paid on its preferred stock 
the repurchase of shares in the fourth quarter of reduced funds available for investment in  resulting in lower interest income in the effective tax rate in was higher than in because of the additional deferred tax requirements resulting from the increase in the federal tax rate  effective january  the net loss in included the effects of three substantial charges totaling million  net of tax  or per share  relating to an extraordinary provision for coal miners retiree health care obligations million  net of tax  or per share  a write down of waterpro s goodwill million  with no tax benefit  or per share and the loss on the sale of ionpure million  net of tax  or 
per share 
see notes and for discussion of these matters 
the latter two charges are included in the loss from discontinued operations for boston gas a million annualized rate increase  which took effect november   increased revenues by million 
although temperatures varied widely relative to normal over the course of  they averaged warmer than in and colder than normal in operating earnings increased by million as the benefit of the rate increase  stable labor conditions and sales of gas to new firm customers were partially offset by higher depreciation  property taxes and bad debts 
in total  the weather decreased operating earnings by about million  reflecting higher workload related labor and operating costs associated with the unusually cold weather in the first quarter  partially offset by additional gross margins attributable to the weather 
k midland enterprises revenues and operating earnings increased million and million  respectively  in over due to significant increases in dry cargo transportation  reduced operating and administrative expenses achieved through ongoing cost reduction and productivity programs  as well as the absence of increased costs associated with inefficiencies caused by the mississippi river flooding and the umw strike in partially offsetting were contractual and market rate reductions negotiated early in  the absence of the liquid barge business  which contributed and of revenues and operating earnings  respectively  and higher operating expenses associated with flooding and severe winter icing conditions early in reflecting improved market and operating conditions  revenues and operating earnings for the second half of increased by and  respectively  over the comparable period in tonnage and ton miles increased and  respectively  in as increased shipments of coal  aggregates  ores and towing for others more than offset the sale of midland s liquid barge business  which accounted for approximately of ton miles in coal tonnage increased from  reflecting a significant increase in spot shipments and increased demand for utility coal under long term contracts 
excluding the liquid barge business  non coal tonnage increased over  despite a reduction in grain tonnage  primarily as a result of increased shipments of aggregates  steel  scrap and ores 
the reduction in grain tonnage reflected management s decision to de emphasize its commitment to the grain market and to concentrate on other business areas  principally on the ohio and the lower mississippi rivers 
in june midland recognized a pretax gain of million on the sale of its barge construction and repair facility in louisiana 
midland had recorded a million reserve in december for the shutdown costs and carrying charges associated with this facility 
as mentioned earlier  in december midland sold its liquid barge business at a pretax gain of million 
these transactions are included in other income 
liquidity and capital resources management believes that projected cash flow from operations  in combination with currently available resources  is more than sufficient to meet eastern s capital expenditure and working capital requirements  potential funding of its coal act and environmental liabilities  normal debt repayments and anticipated dividends to shareholders 
in addition to cash and short term investments of million at december   eastern maintains a million long term credit agreement plus other lines  all of which are available for general corporate purposes 
at december  there were no borrowings outstanding under any of these facilities 
consolidated capital expenditures for are budgeted at approximately million  about of which are for boston gas and the balance for midland 
eastern s capital structure is depicted in the chart below 
the decrease in equity in reflects the impact of non cash charges associated with the provision for coal miners retiree health care  the write down of waterpro goodwill  the loss on the sale of ionpure and substantial share repurchases 
through a combination of increased equity and debt  eastern expects to continue its policy of capitalizing boston gas and midland with approximately equal amounts of equity and long term debt 
both subsidiaries maintain a ratings with the major rating agencies 
in june boston gas filed a shelf registration for the issuance through december of up to million of medium term notes for the funding of future capital expenditures and the refinancing of currently outstanding indebtedness 
in the fourth quarter of boston gas issued million of medium term notes  series c  with a weighted average maturity of years and coupon of 
as described in note  the proceeds from this issuance were used to complete an in substance defeasance which will reduce future interest expense by more than million annually 
k in april eastern sold waterpro for million in cash 
in addition  in november eastern sold its investment in us filter common stock for million in cash 
to meet working capital requirements which reflect the seasonal nature of the gas distribution business  boston gas had notes outstanding of million at december   a decrease of million from the prior year  primarily reflecting lower balances for deferred gas costs 
boston gas also maintains a bank credit agreement which supports the issuance of up to million of commercial paper to fund its inventory of gas supplies 
at december  boston gas had million of commercial paper outstanding for this purpose 
eastern repurchased   and  shares of its common stock for million  million and million  respectively  in  and year end common shares outstanding in millions

equity debt total k other matters eastern may have or share responsibility for environmental remediation and or ongoing maintenance of certain non utility sites associated with former operations  the most significant of which is a former coal tar processing facility  as described in note eastern has accrued a reserve of approximately million in total at december  to cover the remediation and maintenance of these sites 
however  eastern does not possess at this time sufficient information to reasonably determine or estimate the ultimate cost to it of such remediation and maintenance 
boston gas may have or share responsibility for environmental remediation of certain former manufactured gas plant mgp sites  as described in note a subsidiary of new england electric system has assumed responsibility for remediating of the such sites owned by boston gas  subject to a limited contribution by the latter 
a regulatory settlement agreement provides for recovery by boston gas of environmental costs associated with mgp sites over separate  seven year amortization periods without a return on the unamortized balance 
eastern does not possess at this time sufficient information to reasonably determine the ultimate cost to boston gas of such remediation  and no assurance can be given with respect to the future recoverability of such costs 
however  particularly in light of the factors discussed  eastern currently believes that it is not probable that such costs will materially affect its financial condition or results of operations 
eastern has accrued pretax charges of million for its estimated undiscounted liability for health care and death benefit premiums under the coal act 
as discussed in note  its obligations for these premiums could range from zero to more than million
