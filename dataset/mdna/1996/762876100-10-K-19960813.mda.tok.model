item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations of the company for the three years ended april   and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and related notes therein 
reference is made to note of the consolidated financial statements of the company included herein for a discussion of the material differences between generally accepted accounting principles in canada and the united states  and their effect on the company s financial statements 
as described above under item  pursuant to an agreement of merger effective october   the company acquired the balance of waste reduction systems operations which it did not previously own by merger of two of its partners into its third partner  the company s wholly owned subsidiary rcri 
this reorganization of the companies has resulted in the waste reduction systems partnership being owned by rcri 
the acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method and  accordingly  the financial statements for all periods presented have been retroactively restated to include the financial position and results of operations and cash flows of waste reduction systems 
deficits previously reported at may   and have been increased by   and decreased by  respectively  to reflect the retroactive change in the company s method of accounting for its investment in waste reduction systems 
prior to the merger of the partners effective october   the company reported its share of the net loss of the partnership as an adjustment of investment in the partnership 
as a result of the merger  the company owns of the former partnership  consequently all the assets  liabilities and income and expense of that entity are included in the consolidated financial statements with effect from the commencement of business of waste reduction systems in august the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with canadian generally accepted accounting principles and all figures are in canadian dollars 
canadian generally accepted accounting principles differ in certain respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the significant differences and the approximate related effect on the financial statements are set forth in note of the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations overview to the date of this annual report  the company s business has been speculative 
cash flow from the company s operations has not  and does not at present  satisfy all operational requirements and cash commitments 
the company has been dependent and continues to rely upon the sale of equity and debt securities in order to fund its development activities and operations and its ability to continue operations is dependent on the ability of the company to continue to obtain financing 
the company received minimal revenues from its oil and gas properties to april  due to continuing low prices in the oil and gas industry worldwide 
as at april   the company sold all of its oil and gas wells 
as the company received no revenue from mining activities to april   inflation and fluctuations in metal prices had no significant effect on operations 
as at april   the company disposed of its mineral properties 
there is no assurance that the company s acquisition of waste reduction systems will provide cash flows sufficient to make the company a successful operating enterprise 
if waste reduction systems does not generate sufficient levels of cash flow from operations additional financial support will be required 
without such funding there could be doubt as to the company s ability to continue to operate in the normal course of business 
fiscal years ended april   and revenues for the past several years  the company has been in the development stage and therefore has not generated any significant revenues 
during the three years ended april   the company received limited revenues from operations of its oil and gas wells 
after deduction from the revenues of production costs  depletion and write downs  the company incurred a net gain of  for versus a loss of  for as at april   the company had sold all of its oil and gas wells 
shareholder relations in the year ended april   a charge of  was made whereas in year it was  and in year it was  travel costs travel costs were  in   in and  in the major portion of this amount in was to negotiate the waste reduction systems general partnership  conduct due diligence as necessary on the project  keep the costa rican property in good standing and search for financing for wrs 
audit  accounting and legal an increase was recorded in audit  accounting and legal fees to  in from  in increased costs were incurred during fiscal because of the need to set up accounting and coordination between the company and waste reduction systems and time was spent with tax accountants and auditors to determine the best possible means of structuring the waste reduction systems partnership 
the company expects this category of professional expenses may rise in the next fiscal year because of attempts to seek debt or equity funding 
audit  accounting and legal expenses for were substantially less than the  incurred in as the company realized the benefits of computerized accounting systems 
the amount also reflects professional expenses incurred in connection with the company s investment in the wrs partnership 
management fees and consulting costs in this category decreased from  in to  in and fell to  in the costs were higher in because of the need to retain engineers to review the waste reduction systems project  write business plans  make financial projections etc  all with a view to ensuring that the company would be conducting its proper due diligence with respect to the advisability of an investment in the waste reduction systems project 
subsequent to year end  the board of directors authorized the issuance of  shares in lieu of cash compensation for past services rendered on behalf of waste reduction systems by certain officers and directors 
such services were valued at  us 
the issuance is subject to shareholder approval for an increase in the number of shares available and registration of these shares with the securities and exchange commission 
merger costs there were increased costs in fiscal to acquire the remaining position of wrs and in connection with the associated restructuring 
these are also reflected in the increased audit  accounting and legal fees for which totalled  compared to  in exchange translation loss for the year ended april   a gain of  was experienced versus a loss of  for and a loss of  for the year ended april  the large amount in is attributed to the significant timing difference on the purchase of the mineral distillation unit from gap minerals  inc and the subsequent settlement of the price as eventually approved by the vancouver stock exchange 
transfer  listing and filing fees these fees increased from approximately  in to  in and decreased to  in plant and equipment the company s mineral distillation unit was originally purchased for use on a proposed joint venture project in the development of the gongora property in costa rica 
unfortunately  the price of sulphur dropped making the development of the project uneconomical and the company has since disposed of its interest in the gongora property 
the company searched for an alternate use of the unit and has found that it can probably be used for soil remediation for such things as oil pits polluted with hydrocarbons 
preliminary tests indicate the system is capable of removing soil contaminants to a level that is acceptable to the federal epa and the state of california 
however  more development is required 
liquidity and capital resources to date the company has not generated sufficient revenue to fund its operations 
since its inception  the company financed its exploration and development costs and its investment in waste reduction systems primarily from the sale of equity securities 
as at april   the company had cash on hand of  and accounts receivable of  subsequent to year end  the company received a loan of us  which is being used for working capital 
in exchange for the loan the company issued a us  convertible debenture due january  and warrants to purchase  common shares at us per share 
the debenture is convertible to common shares at the rate of us per share at the holder s option 
during the year ended april   a total of  shares of the company were issued on the exercise of employee and director stock options at an average price of  netting the company a total of  during the year ended april    shares of the company were issued pursuant to private placements  netting the company  to finance its acquisition of the plant and processing facility from mobil oil corporation  the company completed a us  secured senior debt financing with one private investor 
this loan is evidenced by a senior secured note due january   bearing interest at per annum 
the note is secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
pursuant to the loan agreement the company issued to the investor warrants exercisable to purchase  common shares at a price of us per share and granted certain rights to have the shares registered for public sale 
the loan agreement requires the company to comply with certain covenants customary in loans of this type concerning matters including  but not limited to  net worth and revenues  and restricts certain transactions  and grants the investor a right of first refusal to purchase securities issued by the company other than those issued pursuant to plans approved by the note holder 
other than as set out above  the company is free of long and short term debt 
the company does not have any material commitments or anticipated material capital expenditures to third parties for the coming year  however  the company will seek funds through the private sale of equity or debt instruments in order to facilitate the expansion of its acre terminal site 
the company presently has no firm commitments for such financing and there can be no assurance that adequate financing will be available in a timely manner or on favorable terms or at all 
other considerations cash flow from the company s operations has not and does not at present satisfy all operational requirements and cash commitments 
in the past  the company has relied on sales of equity to meet its capital requirements 
there can be no assurance that cash flow from operations will be sufficient in the future to satisfy operational requirements and cash commitments 
while the company has in the past earned minimal revenues from the production of oil and gas  they ceased at year end as the interests in the wells were sold 
the company is currently operating at a loss 
if the company should be unable to continue as a going concern  realization of assets and settlement of liabilities in other than the normal course of business may be at amounts significantly different from those in the financial statements included in this annual report 
the company has historically incurred losses as evidenced by the consolidated statements of operation contained herein 
as at april   the company had a deficit of  the company operates in a highly competitive industry and may compete with organizations having greater financial and technical resources and larger marketing organizations available to them 
the environmental and reclamation industry is growing very rapidly  and the company expects that competition will increase significantly as more firms enter the industry 
wrs s revenue plans are based on the development of an effective sales  marketing and operations organization 
the success of wrs will be highly dependent on the ability of management to attract competent personnel and implement the required organization in a timely manner
