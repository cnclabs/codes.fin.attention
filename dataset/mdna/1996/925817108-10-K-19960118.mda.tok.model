restaurant sales decreased in versus the company operated approximately fewer restaurants in compared to due to restaurant closures and dispositions 
a comparable same store sales decline of also contributed to the overall decrease in sales 
the bakers square division registered the majority of the decrease which was affected by a menu price reduction of approximately put into place in the middle of this action of reducing prices was taken to reverse a four year decline in customer counts in that division 
compared to the prior year  same store customer counts for bakers square decreased in prior to the price reduction  but only decreased thereafter 
restaurant sales decreased in compared to  despite the addition of six new restaurants in and full year inclusion of eleven restaurants opened in contributing to the sales decrease was an extra week of operations in however  the principal reason for the decline was a decrease in comparable same store restaurant sales of resulting primarily from lower customer counts 
the customer count decreases were most predominant in the company s bakers square concept 
these declines were the result of various operational  demographic and competitive issues and led to substantial organizational changes during the disruptive effects of these changes further contributed to the sales declines in menu price changes had no appreciable effect on sales in restaurant operating profit decreased in versus bakers square s restaurant operating profit decreased significantly due to the menu price reductions  lower comparable sales in relationship to fixed costs  and investments in food  labor and certain other restaurant related items in order to improve customer counts 
village inn s restaurant operating results were essentially unchanged from the prior year  but improved as a percentage of sales 
the closure of unprofitable restaurants and reduced advertising and insurance costs were largely offset by higher labor costs from increased staffing 
angel s  the company s experimental concept  recorded a restaurant operating loss in due to preopening costs and a higher than expected cost structure 
the decision on whether angel s is a viable concept for expansion will be made in restaurant operating profit decreased in compared to the inability to correspondingly decrease the fixed portion of labor costs and other fixed costs in relationship to declines in comparable restaurant sales was principally responsible for this decline 
partially offsetting this decline were incremental profits from operating new units  reduced insurance expense and lower marketing costs for bakers square 
general and administrative expense decreased in compared to as the result of administrative office consolidations  staff reductions  reduced incentive and legal expenses and a  sign up bonus for the company s president paid in general and administrative expense increased in compared with due primarily to the sign up bonus  litigation costs and lower capitalization of overhead as a result of a slowdown in construction activity 
other income expense in included  of income related to settlement of litigation against certain of the company s insurance carriers 
in  the company recorded a  charge related primarily to a plan to close and dispose of underperforming restaurants and discontinue a portion of the company s manufacturing and distribution activities 
also  included were charges to impair the carrying values on four properties and to accrue for administrative restructuring costs 
as of october   of the restaurants scheduled for disposition had been closed 
the remaining four locations are expected to close in fiscal of the closures  have been disposed through sale  lease termination  or sublease 
the company does not anticipate that disposition proceeds or costs will materially affect the company s liquidity 
the following table details sales and operating results of the closure restaurants bakers square sales    restaurant operating profit loss    village inn sales    restaurant operating profit loss    angel s sales   restaurant operating profit loss   total sales    restaurant operating profit loss    in  the company discontinued internal warehousing and distribution of grocery products for its restaurants 
the company does not anticipate significant changes in delivered product costs as a result of the change  however  food inventories were reduced 
also in  the company closed its bakery facility in phoenix  arizona 
in  the company recorded a  charge related to the decision to close its matteson  illinois regional office and combine the functions performed there with similar functions at its denver  colorado headquarters 
the charge consisted primarily of severance and moving expenses 
the reorganization was completed during the effective income tax rates used for financial reporting were in  in and in the and rates were affected by the fica tipped income tax credit that took effect january  the lower effective tax rate for was due to the increase in the top federal rate from to enacted in august of  which increased the company s net deferred tax asset  and reduced income tax expense accordingly 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal source of funds is cash provided by operations 
cash flow from operations decreased both in and due primarily to lower operating income and changes in working capital from contraction of the company s business 
operating cash flow in was supplemented by the collection of an insurance receivable 
the company s working capital is generally in a deficit position because  like most restaurant businesses  substantially all sales are for cash  while credit is received from trade suppliers 
furthermore  the company has not maintained large excess cash balances  but rather has utilized available cash for capital spending  repayment of borrowings or the repurchase of its common stock 
the company supplements cash provided by operations with bank borrowings and occasional lease financing 
during fiscal  the company borrowed an additional  under its bank credit facility as operating cash flows were insufficient to fund capital expenditures and stock repurchases 
at october   the company had  of outstanding borrowings under its bank credit facility  with approximately  available for additional direct advances 
the company s current bank agreement expires on june  when it converts to a term facility payable in eight equal quarterly installments through june  the company is currently pursuing a new revolving facility with certain lenders and is optimistic that a new facility will be in place prior to the current revolving facility s expiration 
the company is also exploring other debt financing sources 
over the last three years   shares of the company s common stock were repurchased for  under authorizations approved by the board of directors 
at october   authorization to repurchase an additional  common shares was available 
future purchases with respect to this authorization may be made from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and will be dependent upon various business and financial considerations 
capital expenditures in totaled  and consisted of  to purchase two previously franchised locations and a land site   for improvements to existing restaurants  and  for other support related projects 
capital expenditures of  are expected for no new restaurants are planned during cash flow from operations  funds available under a bank credit facility  or other financing sources are expected to be adequate for planned capital projects and any repurchases of common stock authorized by the board 
at october   the company had  of net deferred tax assets  the majority of which relates to federal net operating loss carryforwards totaling  the company has established a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty that the full amount of the operating loss carryforwards will be applied against future taxable income 
while a continuation of the company s taxable income level is not sufficient to realize the portion of the net deferred tax asset related to the operating loss carryforwards before the expiration periods  the company feels that its operating results are not indicative of future performance 
historically  the company had taxable income in excess of the amount necessary for realization and believes it will do so again in future years 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
cumulative taxable income of approximately  through will be necessary to realize the net deferred tax asset before expiration of a majority of the net operating loss carryforwards 
management outlook the mid scale segment of the restaurant industry remains extremely competitive 
the company has discontinued opening new restaurants until existing operations improve which affects its overall competitiveness 
improvements in future operating performance will be dependent upon the company s ability to reverse negative comparable sales trends  especially given the significant profit impact associated with incremental sales at existing restaurants 
cost controls will also play a significant factor in future profit growth 
in addition  numerous external factors could have a significant impact on future performance  not limited to food commodity costs  labor availability  site availability  the economy  the weather and government initiatives such as minimum wage rates  mandated benefits and taxes 
historically  the company has mitigated the effects of inflation through cost controls and periodic price increases 
management believes it will be able to minimize the effects of future inflation through similar measures  although such price increases will be subject to competitive constraints and other business considerations 
new accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the sfas  which would be effective for the company s fiscal  recommends a fair value based method of accounting for an employee stock option 
however  companies may choose to continue to account for stock options using the intrinsic value based method as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and provide proforma disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if the fair value based method had been applied 
the company anticipates it will continue to account for stock options using the intrinsic value based method  and thus sfas no 
will not have any impact on its reported results
