governmental activity congress enacted legislation effective january  the omnibus budget reconciliation act of that assesses financial penalties against manufacturers if cigarettes produced in the united states do not contain at least by weight domestically grown flue cured and burley tobaccos 
in december  congress enacted the uruguay round agreements act to replace this domestic content requirement with a tariff rate quota system that keys tariffs to import volumes 
the tariff rate quotas have been established by the united states with overseas tobacco producers and became effective on september  domestic content requirements and tariff rate quotas increased raw material costs slightly in but these costs were down slightly in during the period when the domestic content requirement was not applicable 
in february  the commissioner of the us food and drug administration the fda  which historically has refrained from asserting jurisdiction over cigarette products  stated that he intended to cause the fda to work with the us congress to resolve the regulatory status of cigarettes under the food  drug and cosmetic act 
during the second quarter of  hearings were held in this regard  and rjrt and other members of the united states cigarette industry were asked to provide voluntarily certain documents and other information to congress 
in august  the commissioner of the fda  with the support of the clinton administration  announced that he was asserting jurisdiction over cigarettes and certain other tobacco products and issued a notice and request for comments on proposed regulations 
the proposed regulations would prohibit or impose stringent limits on a broad range of sales and marketing practices  including bans on sampling  sponsorship by brand name  and distribution of non tobacco items carrying brand names 
the fda s proposed rule would also limit advertising in print and on billboards to black and white text  impose new labeling language  and require cigarette manufacturers to fund a million a year campaign to discourage minors from using tobacco products 
rjrt and other cigarette manufacturers have submitted responses to the proposed rules 
the purported purpose of the fda s assertion of jurisdiction was to curb the use of tobacco products by underage youth 
rjrt believes that the assertion of jurisdiction and the scope of the proposed rules would materially restrict the availability of cigarettes and rjrt s ability to market its cigarette products to adult smokers 
rjrt  together with the other four major domestic cigarette manufacturers and an advertising agency  filed suit on the day of the commissioner s announcement in the us district court for the middle district of north carolina seeking to enjoin the fda s assertion of jurisdiction coyne beahm v 
united states food drug administration 
similar suits have been filed in the same court by manufacturers of smokeless tobacco products  by operators of retail stores and by advertising interests 
rjrt is unable to predict whether the fda will adopt final rules asserting jurisdiction over cigarettes or the scope of such final rules  if adopted 
it is also unable to predict the outcome of the litigation seeking to enjoin the fda s rulemaking 
in march  the us occupational safety and health administration osha announced proposed regulations that would restrict smoking in the workplace to designated smoking rooms that are separately exhausted to the outside 
although rjrt cannot predict the form or timing of any regulations that may be finally adopted by osha  if the proposed regulations are adopted  rjrt expects that many employers who have not already done so would prohibit smoking in the workplace rather than make expenditures necessary to establish designated smoking areas to accommodate smokers 
rjrt submitted comments on the proposed regulations during the comment period which closed in february  because many employers currently do not permit smoking in the workplace  rjrt cannot predict the effect of any regulations that may be adopted  but incremental restrictions on smokers could have an adverse effect on cigarette sales and rjrt 
in july  an amendment to a florida statute became effective which allows the state of florida to bring an action in its own name against the tobacco industry to recover amounts paid by the state under its medicaid program to treat illnesses statistically associated with cigarette smoking 
the amended statute does not require the state to identify the individual who received medical care  permits a lawsuit to be filed as a class action and eliminates the comparative negligence and assumption of risk defenses 
the florida statute is being challenged on state and federal constitutional grounds in a lawsuit brought by philip morris companies inc  associated industries of florida  publix supermarkets  and national association of convenience stores in june on june   the trial court judge granted in part the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment finding portions of the act unconstitutional 
both plaintiffs and defendants appealed this decision which the florida supreme court accepted for direct appeal 
oral argument was heard on november  the florida house and senate passed a bill that would repeal the florida statute retroactively which was vetoed by the governor 
the florida house and senate have indicated that they are considering action to override that veto 
similar legislation  without florida s elimination of defenses  has been introduced in the massachusetts and new jersey legislatures 
rjrt is unable to predict whether other states will enact similar legislation and whether lawsuits will be filed under these statutes or their outcome  if filed 
a suit against the tobacco industry under the florida statute was filed on february  various states and local jurisdictions have enacted legislation imposing restrictions on public smoking  increasing excise taxes and designating a portion of the increased cigarette excise taxes to fund anti smoking programs  health care programs or cancer research 
many employers have also initiated programs restricting or eliminating smoking in the workplace 
it is not possible to determine what additional federal  state or local legislation or regulations relating to smoking or cigarettes will be enacted or to predict any resulting effect thereof on rjrt  reynolds international or the cigarette industry generally  but such legislation or regulations could have an adverse effect on rjrt  reynolds international or the cigarette industry generally
