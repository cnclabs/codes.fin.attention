item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain income statement items related to the company s operations as percentages of total revenues and certain other homebuilding data year ended october revenues costs and expenses land and housing construction selling  general and administrative interest total costs and expenses operating income number of homes closed    fiscal compared to fiscal revenues for fiscal of million exceeded those of by million or 
this increase was primarily the result of the greater number of homes delivered in which was principally due to the higher backlog at the beginning of fiscal as compared to the backlog at the beginning of fiscal  the greater number of contracts that were signed in compared to and to a greater number of communities delivering homes in as compared to in addition  the average price per home increased due to a change in product mix to larger homes  a shift in location of homes closed to more expensive locations and increases in selling prices 
as of october   the backlog of homes under contract amounted to million  homes  an increase over the backlog as of october  in fiscal  the company signed new contracts of million  homes  as compared to million  homes in fiscal the increase in new contracts in over was primarily due to the increase in the number of communities in which the company was offering homes for sale  a shift in location of the communities to more expensive areas  an increase in the size of the homes that our customers purchased and increases in selling prices 
the increase was partially offset by a decline in the number of homes sold per community 
land and housing construction costs amounted to million of revenues in as compared to million of revenues in as a percentage of revenues  land and land development costs  job overhead costs and write offs of inventory and previously capitalized costs that the company no longer considered realizable  were lower in than in the percentage decrease was partially offset by increased material and subcontractor costs 
the company provided for write offs of inventory and previously capitalized costs that it no longer considered realizable of million in and million in selling  general and administrative expenses sg a in and amounted to million of revenues and million of revenues  respectively 
the increased spending in was the result of an increase in selling expense due to the larger number of communities in which the company was offering homes for sale in as compared to and an increase in general and administrative expenses  primarily payroll and payroll related costs  due to the overall growth and increased profitability of the company 
the decline in sg a  as a percentage of revenues  was due to revenue increasing at a faster rate than sg a spending 
interest expense is determined on a specific house by house basis and will vary depending on many factors including the period of time that the land was owned  the period of time that the house was under construction  and the interest rates and the amount of debt carried by the company in proportion to the amount of its inventory during those periods 
as a percentage of revenues  interest expense was lower in as compared to the decline was principally the result of an increase in the average price of homes closed in over while capitalized interest per home closed in only increased 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues for fiscal of million exceeded those of fiscal by approximately million or 
this increase was principally due to the greater number of homes closed during the year and the increase in the average selling price of those homes 
the increase in the number of homes closed was due to the substantially larger backlog of homes at the beginning of fiscal as compared to the beginning of fiscal and the greater number of contracts signed in fiscal as compared to the increase in the average selling price in over that of was principally the result of a shift in the location of homes closed to more expensive communities  a change in product mix to larger homes and increases in selling prices 
as of october   the backlog of homes under contract amounted to million  homes  approximately higher than the million homes backlog the company had as of october  the aggregate sales value of new contracts signed in fiscal amounted to million  homes  an increase of approximately over the million  homes of contracts signed in fiscal the company believes that the increase in backlog and the increase in contracts signed were the result of a the company s expansion through a greater penetration of its existing markets  such as connecticut and virginia  and its entry into new markets such as new york state and california  b a shift in the location of homes sold to higher priced communities  as well as increases in the selling prices in existing communities  c pent up demand for new homes due to poor economic conditions in the early s which resulted in a decline in housing demand and a resulting decline in construction  and d diminished competition due to the aforementioned poor economic conditions 
the average selling price per home settled will vary from year to year based upon the community and product mix of homes closed  as well as changes in selling price and the value of options selected by homebuyers 
land and construction costs as a percentage of revenues increased in as compared to due principally to a an increase in the cost of materials  b an increase in costs due to the severe weather conditions the company experienced in the first half of fiscal which resulted in increased spending and reduced construction activity causing an increase in per home overhead  and c higher provisions in fiscal over the amounts provided in fiscal for inventory writedowns consisting of provisions for a reduction to net realizable value and the expensing of previously capitalized costs which the company no longer considered realizable 
the company provided approximately million in for writedowns as compared to million in the increases were partially offset by lower land and land development costs 
selling  general and administrative expense sg a in fiscal amounted to million or of revenues as compared to million or of revenues for the decline in sg a as a percentage of revenues in as compared to was principally the result of revenue increasing at a greater rate than spending 
the million increase in spending was principally due to the increased selling costs related to the greater number of homes closed in over  the increase in the number of communities in which the company was offering homes for sale  and the increase in payroll and payroll related costs due to the growth of the company 
interest expense was lower both as a percentage of revenues and on a per home closed basis in as compared to on average  land and land development costs associated with the homes closed in remained in inventory for a shorter period of time than those closed in fiscal in addition  the amount of interest incurred declined as a percentage of inventory due to lower interest rates and the decline in the amount of debt carried by the company in proportion to the amount of its inventory 
accordingly  less capitalized interest was accumulated  on average  on the homes closed in than those closed in income taxes income taxes for fiscal   and were provided at effective rates of   and  respectively 
effective november   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement requires a liability approach for measuring deferred taxes based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities existing at each balance sheet date using enacted tax rates for years in which taxes are expected to be recovered or paid 
the cumulative effect of this change in accounting for income taxes of  was included in the consolidated statement of income for extraordinary loss during fiscal  the company redeemed  at prices above par  all of its outstanding subordinated debt which resulted in a loss  net of income tax  of  the loss represents the redemption premium and a write off of unamortized discount and deferred issuance costs 
capital resources and liquidity funding for the company s residential development activities is principally provided by cash flows from operations  public debt and equity markets  and unsecured bank borrowings 
cash flow from operations  before inventory additions  improved as operating results improved and the company anticipates that the cash flow from operations will continue to improve as a result of an increase in revenues from the delivery of homes from the existing backlog as well as from new sales agreements 
the company has used the cash flow from operations and borrowings under its revolving credit facility to acquire additional land for new communities  to fund additional expenditures for land development and construction costs needed to meet the requirements of the increased backlog and the continuing expansion of the number of communities in which the company is offering homes for sale and to reduce debt 
the company expects that inventories will continue to increase and is currently negotiating and searching for additional opportunities to obtain control of land for future communities 
the company has a million unsecured revolving credit facility with fourteen banks which extends through june the facility reduces by in june unless extended as provided for in the agreement 
as of october   the company had million of loans and approximately million of letters of credit outstanding under the facility 
the company believes that it will be able to fund its activities through a combination of operating cash flow and existing sources of credit 
inflation the long term impact of inflation on the company is manifested in increased land  land development  construction and overhead costs  as well as in increased sales prices 
for several years prior to fiscal  the company was able to raise sales prices by amounts at least equal to its cost increases 
from fiscal through february   however  sales prices either declined slightly or remained steady  and since then have risen only modestly 
since fiscal  the company s costs generally have increased except for land acquisition costs  which have generally decreased 
the company generally contracts for land significantly before development and sales efforts begin and  accordingly  to the extent land acquisition costs are fixed  increases or decreases in the sales prices of homes may affect the company s profits 
since the sales prices of homes are fixed at the time of sale and the company generally sells its homes prior to commencement of construction  any inflation of costs in excess of those anticipated may result in lower gross margins 
the company generally attempts to minimize that effect by entering into fixed price contracts with its subcontractors and material suppliers for specified periods of time  which generally do not exceed one year 
housing demand  in general  is adversely affected by increases in interest costs  as well as in housing costs 
interest rates  the length of time that land remains in inventory and the proportion of inventory that is financed affect the company s interest costs 
if the company is unable to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs  which had generally been the condition during prior years  or if mortgage interest rates increased significantly  affecting prospective buyers ability to adequately finance a home purchase  the company s revenues  gross margins and net income would be adversely affected 
increases in sales prices  whether the result of inflation or demand  may affect the ability of prospective buyers to afford a new home
