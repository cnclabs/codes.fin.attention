in the sale agreement  the company agreed to indemnify the purchaser for a period of two years for certain breaches of the agreement 
approximately million of the decrease in total revenues in fiscal was attributable to the sale of the research products business in fiscal collaborative program revenues decreased by approximately million or in fiscal largely due to a reduction in revenue under the collaboration agreement with hoechst marion roussel  inc hmri as compared to the total revenue in the prior year s periods from marion merrell dow inc mmdi  hoechst roussel pharmaceuticals  inc 
hoechst roussel and hoechst ag hoechst as well as a reduction in the funding under the becton dickinson collaboration due to a narrowing of scope in that program 
the balance of the decrease represents changes in the timing and amount of grant awards 
the decrease in total revenues of  in fiscal compared to fiscal was attributable to decreases of  in research product revenues due to the sale of the research products business in august and  in certain grant programs 
the decreases in research product sales and certain grant programs  were offset by increases in collaborative program revenues 
these revenues increased by approximately  or in fiscal due to the commencement of a research program with hoechst in april  the expansion and extension of the collaborative research program with wyeth in march and increases in revenues under the pfizer collaboration with respect to anti cancer drugs 
these increases were offset by decreased funding from pfizer associated with the termination of pfizer s participation in the tgf logo oral mucositis program in order to focus exclusively on its collaborative programs with the company related to the research and development of small molecule anti cancer drugs 
previously  pfizer had funded the company s tgf logo oral mucositis program in addition to its anti cancer program 
under a collaborative agreement with ciba entered into in april  the company will fund the development of tgf logo for oral mucositis through the end of phase i clinical trials and ciba will fund its subsequent clinical development

expenses research and development expenses increased by approximately  or in fiscal compared to fiscal and increased by approximately million or in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in fiscal was due to an increase in expenditures in the company s joint venture with biochem pharma  and its technology development programs as well as additional amortization expense on the newly acquired mycosearch assets 
these increases were partially offset by reductions in expenditures in the collaborative programs  primarily with hmri 
the increase in fiscal was due principally to the start during of the new research program with hoechst  the expansion and extension of the wyeth program and the increase in activities related to the company s proprietary programs in the area of medicinal and natural products chemistry and clinical development of tgf logo for oral mucositis 
production expenses decreased approximately  and  for fiscal and fiscal respectively  reflecting the sale of the research products business

amortization of intangibles in fiscal   and represents amortization of patents and goodwill that resulted from the acquisition of the cancer diagnostics business of applied biotechnology 
the decrease in amortization expense in fiscal is due to the portion of goodwill which was expensed in connection with the sale of the research products business 
other income and expense net investment income increased approximately  or for fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was largely due to investment of the proceeds from the company s public offering of common stock in april net proceeds from the offering along with the concurrent sale of  shares directly to biochem pharma were approximately million 
net investment income decreased approximately  or for fiscal compared to fiscal interest income earned in fiscal was higher than in fiscal despite a lower average principal balance in fiscal due to increased interest rates 
however  this was offset in part by a net realized loss on the sale of certain investments

the company is aware that hmri is conducting a review of all its research and development programs 
the company and hmri have jointly announced that they have entered into an agreement in principle to continue their collaborative programs under one overall agreement through december  in accordance with the agreement in principle  hmri is expected to provide up to million in research funding over the term of the renewal period 
the company will receive royalties on the sale of drugs derived from the collaboration  if any 
hmri and the company have not yet executed a new definitive overall agreement 
the company has been pursuing serum and tissue based cancer diagnostic products in collaboration with becton under a collaborative program started in october after an earlier collaboration from to 
during  the company and becton agreed that becton would narrow its focus in the program exclusively to tissue based diagnostic tests including immunohistochemistry and the company would continue its development program in serum based cancer diagnostics 
accordingly  becton reduced its funding under this program in fiscal  and provided no further funding for this program after it ended on its scheduled expiration date of september  the company is continuing the development of serum based cancer diagnostic products and is in negotiations with a possible collaborative partner in this area 
the company s collaboration with wyeth will be concluded on december  in accordance with the collaborative research agreement

in april  the company purchased mycosearch  inc  owner of a collection of fungi and actinomycetes  for approximately million in cash and million in common stock and warrants 
on september   the company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of aston molecules limited 
aston  a privately held united kingdom company

the company believes that with the funding from its collaborative research programs  government research grants  interest income  and cash balances  the company s financial resources are adequate for its operations for the foreseeable future 
however  the company s capital requirements may vary as a result of a number of factors  including competitive and technological developments  funds required for expansion of the company s technology platform  including possible joint ventures  collaborations and acquisitions  the time and expense required to obtain governmental approval of products  and any potential indemnification payments to the purchaser of the research products business  some of which factors are beyond the company s control 
the company intends to substantially increase its expenditures and capital investment over the next several years to enhance its drug discovery technologies  pursue internal proprietary drug discovery programs  and to commit resources to new collaborative ventures  such as the new programs with anaderm and biochem pharma 
there can be no assurance that scheduled payments will be made by third parties  that current agreements will not be canceled  that government research grants will continue to be received at current levels or that unanticipated events requiring the expenditure of funds will not occur 
further  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain any additional required funds  or  if such funds are available  that such funds will be available on favorable terms 
failure to obtain additional funds when required would have a material adverse effect on the company s business financial condition and result of operations

an example of this is the discussion in this item describing the company s expectations with regard to renewal of its collaborative research programs with hmri 
factors that may arise in the future that prevent the execution of a definitive overall agreement covering the company s collaborative programs with hmri include possible technological developments by competitors that render the compounds being pursued by hmri and the company less commercially viable  shifts in strategic direction on the part of hmri that would de emphasize the therapeutic areas or technologies in which the company is involved  and negative results in the company s current programs with hmri 
the forward looking statement described above  as well as all other discussions contained herein that deal with potential future circumstances and developments  are also subject generally to other risks and uncertainties that are described from time to time in the company s reports and registration statements filed with the securities and exchange commission
