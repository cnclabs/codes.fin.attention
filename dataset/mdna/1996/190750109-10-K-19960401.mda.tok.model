financial reporting and changing prices although inflation can have a significant effect on the financial condition and operating results of banks  it is difficult to measure the impact as neither the timing nor the magnitude of interest rate changes necessarily coincide with changes in the consumer price index or any other index of inflation 
inflation can impact the growth of total assets and result in a need to increase capital at a faster than normal rate in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
this can result in a smaller proportion of earnings paid out in the form of dividends 
the results of operations can also be affected by the impact of inflation on current interest rates 
intermediate to long term interest rates tend to increase in an inflationary environment  thereby affecting the market value of long term fixed rate assets 
higher short term rates tend to increase funding costs 
in addition  noninterest expenses are more directly impacted by current inflation rates
