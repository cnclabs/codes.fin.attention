item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the following table sets forth the company s net sales by product line for each of the years in the three year period ended june  fiscal year ended in thousands june july july electronic warfare    radar and telecommunications    wireless  new sales historically associated with particular product lines may not be indicative of future trends because of the relative size of individual orders and changes in the company s emphasis on specific product lines 
see business company products and business backlog 
during fiscal the company changed its accounting period from a week fiscal year to a twelve month fiscal year ending june references herein to the current fiscal year are for the twelve month period ended june  fiscal and fiscal ended on july  and july   respectively 
fiscal was a week period  while fiscal was a week period 
the impact of this change on reported results was insignificant 
to better serve its emerging commercial markets  the company reorganized  during the first quarter of fiscal into three internal business units 
these business units are electronic warfare  radar and telecommunications and wireless 
products in the electronic warfare business unit consist of the company s line of military products  which include digital frequency discriminators dfd s  digital rf memories drfm s  esm receivers and military microwave integrated circuit components mic s 
radar and telecommunications products consist of signal distribution networks for phase array antennas and customized commercial multilayer components such as butler matrices and beamforming networks for commercial telecommunication satellites 
wireless products are microwave components and assemblies for use in building cellular base station equipment 
these products are a forward evolution of the old military microwave components and are significantly smaller and lighter  while providing better performance 
each business unit is composed of an independent engineering and marketing sales team whose purpose is to develop  market and deliver product to its customers 
this action was taken to optimize responsiveness to customer needs and to provide extended fiscal accountability downward throughout the organization 
fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated results of operations for fiscal showed a loss of slightly less than million resulting from poor sales performance by the company s english subsidiary and the decision by the company to close this european repair facility at anaren microwave  ltd 
and liquidate its electronic warfare ew simulator manufacturing operation headquartered there 
net sales for fiscal were  down from fiscal sales levels  while the net loss for fiscal was  compared to a net loss of  for the prior year 
included in the fiscal loss was an  third quarter restructuring charge against earnings related to the divestiture of the company s ew simulator manufacturing operation in the united kingdom 
during the year ended june   sales in the radar and telecommunications group rose  or over fiscal levels  while shipments for the company s new wireless group rose  to  compared to only  in fiscal during this same period sales of electronic warfare products fell approximately  compared to the previous fiscal year  resulting in an overall sales decline of  in fiscal sales of radar and telecommunication products  which consist of customized commercial multilayer components such as butler matrices and beamforming networks for commercial satellites  increased  to  in fiscal compared to approximately  in fiscal this increase is attributable to over  in shipments in fiscal under the army ground based radar program gbr and over  in shipments of satellite beamforming networks under a  production contract with raytheon company for the iridium project 
these two programs accounted for approximately  in shipments in fiscal the iridium program represents approximately  in firm backlog at june  and is expected to ship at the rate of approximately  to  per quarter in fiscal new orders for radar and telecommunications products total  during fiscal and included initial engineering funding for development of antenna beamforming networks for satellite telecommunications systems being developed by trw  martin marietta overseas corp 
and space systems loral 
at june  firm backlog for radar and telecommunication products was  all of which is expected to ship in fiscal subsequent to the end of fiscal  the company received a firm fixed price contract in excess of  for the design and production of satellite antenna beamforming networks from martin marietta overseas corp 
for the asia cellular satellite system aces 
the aces system is a space based cellular communications system to serve asia via two geosynchronous satellites 
this contract is expected to be performed over a seventeen month period beginning in august sales of wireless products  which consist of components for use in building cellular base station equipment  rose from  in fiscal to almost  in fiscal these sales consisted mainly of catalog microwave components and pilot production runs of custom components for base station equipment manufacturers 
the wireless business unit received significant production orders totaling over  from nortel and motorola  inc during fiscal for custom base station components 
these orders began initial low level production runs in the latter part of the fourth quarter of fiscal and are expected to reach full production in the second quarter of fiscal firm backlog for wireless products was approximately  at june   all of which is expected to ship in fiscal sales of electronic warfare products fell  to  in fiscal  compared to sales of approximately  in fiscal shipments in this business area  which include digital frequency discriminators dfd s  digital rf memories drfm s  esm receivers  military simulators and microwave integrated circuit components mic s has been steadily declining over the past three fiscal years due to the decline in the overall worldwide defense market 
the drop in sales in fiscal was spread over all of the above mentioned product areas  except for mic s and drfm s due to the completion of a number of large dfd programs in the latter part of fiscal and early fiscal  and a drop off in new orders for esm receivers in fiscal 
during fiscal  the company received a number of new orders in the electronic warfare business area totaling over  the most significant of these was from the aspj joint venture team of itt avionics and northrop grumman for foreign sales of the airborne self protection jammer 
these orders should serve to stabilize shipments in this business unit over the next two years 
firm backlog in this product area at june  was  of which approximately  is expected to ship in fiscal  approximately  in fiscal  and the remainder in fiscal during  the company has booked new orders totaling approximately  compared to new orders of approximately  for all of fiscal present firm backlog for all business lines as of june  stands at  a increase over firm backlog of  at the end of fiscal due to lead times and customer delivery requirements  this increase in backlog will not have a significant impact on quarterly shipment levels until the second quarter of fiscal the loss for fiscal was  compared to a loss of  for fiscal the current year loss consists of a  operating loss caused by the low level of sales and margins at the company s european subsidiary and an  non recurring restructuring charge against earnings recorded in the third quarter required to recognize the divestiture of the company s electronic warfare ew simulator manufacturing operation in the united kingdom 
this restructuring charge  which included provisions for the write down of ew simulator assets to realizable value  legal and professional fees and costs to complete an existing ew simulator contract in excess of expected revenue  reduced earnings for both the three months ended march  and the year end june  these actions were necessitated by the severe downsizing of the military budgets in europe which resulted in a substantial reduction in new orders for ew simulators during the past two years and has resulted in ongoing losses from operations at anaren microwave  ltd 
including a  operating loss for fiscal this divestiture will allow the company to focus its efforts on its growing domestic operations 
gross margin on sales for fiscal was compared to in fiscal this substantial improvement was the result of higher sales volume at the company s us manufacturing facility which allowed for better absorption of fixed overhead costs and personnel reductions made in the second quarter of fiscal which were specifically targeted at reducing manufacturing overhead and engineering costs 
additional  during fiscal  approximately  of costs incurred in building products for shipment during this period were charged against the allowance for contract losses established in fiscal and these expenses represent cost overruns incurred on products shipped in the first three quarters of fiscal which had previously been identified and provided for when the allowance was established 
the company expects that gross margins will continue at fiscal levels or improve with the closing of its ew simulator facility and with higher shipment levels expected in fiscal research and development expense was  for fiscal  up from  for the same period in fiscal this increase represents the continuing rise in the prototype development efforts for the company s new wireless commercial product line 
current development efforts are being targeted on adapting existing company technologies to produce new component products which fit a specific customer s requirements 
future research and development expenditures are expected to fluctuate based on sales levels and identified market opportunities 
marketing expense fell in fiscal compared to the previous fiscal year 
this decrease was due mainly to the reassignment of marketing personnel to other functions with the company due to the business group realignment undertaken in the first quarter of the current year 
marketing expense is expected to rise during fiscal as the company adds personnel and expenses in order to meet the demands of the wireless marketplace 
general and administrative expenses rose in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase represents normal period to period fluctuation in expenditures 
current levels of general and administrative spending reflect the same level or lower of that experienced by the company in fiscal general and administrative expense is expected to remain at current levels or increase slightly during fiscal interest expense fell in fiscal compared to the same period in fiscal the decline in interest expense reflects the continuing reduction in long term debt over the past year 
during this same period  other income fell due to lower investable cash balances during the current year compared to the previous fiscal year 
consolidated income tax expense was in fiscal versus an expected tax benefit of approximately  based on of the loss before income taxes 
the primary difference between the actual tax expense recognized in the financial statements and the expected tax benefit calculated on the loss incurred was due to the company s equity in the operating loss of its english subsidiary which is not subject to us taxation and offset by a decrease in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance required by the new tax accounting rules fas no 
adopted by the company at the beginning of fiscal under the new tax accounting rules the company must assess the realizability of deferred tax assets  considering whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets  considering whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in the period in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management of the company has considered the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income in making the assessment of the realizability of the deferred tax asset balances at june  based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods which the deferred tax assets are deductible  the company believes it is more likely than not that it will realize the benefit of these deductible differences  net of the existing valuation allowances at june  fiscal compared to fiscal results of operations for fiscal continued to reflect the overall decline in the worldwide defense market and the production problems with the ground based radar program suffered by the company during the first half of the year 
net sales for fiscal were  down from fiscal  while the net loss for fiscal was  compared to a net loss in the previous year of  the loss in fiscal included a one time charge against earnings of  to recognize the cumulative effect of adopting statement of financial accounting standards no 
employers accounting for post retirement benefits other than pensions 
the decline in fiscal sales revenue was due to a decrease in shipments of electronic warfare products 
during this same period  shipments of radar and telecommunications products rose and sales revenue from new wireless products introduced in this fiscal year totaled over  the decline in electronic warfare sales revenue in fiscal was due to a decrease in shipments of dfd products and a drop in sales of drfm products 
during this same period  shipments of mic and component products rose and sales of esm receivers and special project products rose  including a increase in shipments of anaren microwave  ltd  offsetting a large portion of the decrease in the dfd and drfm products 
shipments of dfd products fell  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was due to lower unit volume on a number of both domestic and foreign defense programs in this product area 
these programs  which include the northrop alq program  the loral federal systems star program a deutche german jammer program and the raytheon slq and lamps programs  represented approximately  worth of shipments in fiscal compared to  in shipments during fiscal new orders for dfd products totaled  in fiscal  down from  in fiscal this decline in new dfd orders reflected the continuing decline in us government defense spending and the lack of any new programs or significant upgrades to us air force or navy airborne electronic warfare capabilities for which the company s dfd products would be applicable 
firm backlog for dfd products was  at july   down from  at july  drfm sales fell  or in fiscal versus sales volume due to the low level of backlog in this product area at the beginning of fiscal   compared with firm backlog of  at the beginning of fiscal although customer interest in both the us and foreign defense market for drfm technology remains high  new orders for drfm products totaled only  in fiscal firm backlog for drfm products was  at july  shipments of esm receivers and special project products  which includes the sales of anaren microwave  ltd  rose in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase reflected both a substantial increase in the number of esm receiver systems shipped in fiscal and a rise in shipments by anaren microwave  ltd 
the increase in anaren ltd 
sales was due to a  rise in simulator sales in fiscal resulting from billings on a  simulator contract with the dutch air force  which had been previously delayed in fiscal sales were further augmented by a large order for spare esm receiver parts totaling  and a  increase in european sales of off the self catalog component parts 
firm backlog for anaren microwave  ltd 
at july  was  compared to  at july  fiscal sales of esm receiver systems rose  over fiscal sales levels due to a tripling of the number of systems shipped in the fiscal  to three  compared to only one system shipped in fiscal each of these systems  which are deployed for ship defense  sells for approximately  firm backlog in this product area at july  was approximately  which represented one esm receiver and orders for various spare parts 
shipments of mic and component products rose approximately  in fiscal due primarily to a small increase in off the shelf catalog component sales and the receipt of  in funding for parts for the ec military airborne surveillance program which began shipping in the second six months of fiscal shipments of radar and telecommunications products rose  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to a  increase in third and fourth quarter fiscal revenues in this product area versus the same six months in fiscal this increase was a result of bringing the us army ground based radar program  which the company produced for raytheon company under a  contract  into full factory production at the end of january shipments under this contract were severely limited in the first six months of fiscal due to difficulties in meeting the customers technical specifications and manufacturing process problems 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company received some technical relief from the customer and during january many of the manufacturing process problems were resolved allowing for a six fold increase in shipment volume on this program during the last five months of fiscal sales of radar and telecommunication products were further augmented in the second half of fiscal by the shipment of fifteen preproduction beamforming networks for the iridium satellite spacebased telephone system program valued at over  during fiscal  the company booked over  in new orders for this business unit  including  in additional funding from raytheon company for production of antenna feed networks for the iridium project 
at july  the firm backlog for this product area was approximately  the wireless business unit was a new product area for the company in late fiscal created to serve the wireless cellular telephone base station equipment marketplace 
sales for fiscal were approximately  and consisted mainly of newly developed surface mount components sold on tape and reel for high volume manufacturing applications 
these newly developed products generated approximately  in new orders during fiscal and at july  the company had approximately  in firm backlog 
consolidated total orders received during fiscal were approximately  down from  in fiscal  and continued to reflect the decline in the worldwide defense market 
firm backlog for all product lines was  at july  down from  at july  the net loss for fiscal was  compared to a net loss for fiscal  before the cumulative effect of the accounting change for fas no 
 of  this drop in earnings was a direct result of the declining sales levels  smaller margins caused by production problems  rising research and development expenses and the recording of provisions for both severance costs and additional contract losses amounting to  and  respectively  during the year 
during fiscal the company recorded a net charge against earnings of  which reflected additional net provisions for projected losses on fixed price contracts 
this net provision consisted of a  charge against earnings in the second quarter of fiscal to provide for expected additional cost overruns on production contracts  which was subsequently reduced by a  credit in the fourth quarter to reflect the successful recovery of a portion of the cost overruns from a customer 
principal among these contracts is the army ground based radar program which represented over  in fiscal and  in fiscal revenues 
this contract  which was produced for the raytheon company  was previously identified as being in a loss position at the end of fiscal and anticipated cost overruns were recorded at that time as part of a  loss provision 
the additional  loss provision record in the second quarter of fiscal was necessary due to production process problems identified during that quarter which required significant additional engineering expenditures and resulted in increased estimates for labor  material and scrap costs to complete the contract 
during the third quarter and subsequent to recording this additional provision for losses  the company submitted a claim for added scope work under this program and was successful  in july  in negotiating a settlement for  in additional funding 
this additional revenue was recorded as a reduction in the loss provision in the fourth quarter of fiscal  increasing net earnings in that quarter and reducing the net loss for the year by that same amount 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a  restructuring charge against earnings  which represented severance and outplacement costs for reductions in engineering and overhead personnel 
these personnel reductions were made to better position the company  competitively  in the new wireless defense business environment and consisted primarily of personnel assigned to product areas associated with the declining military defense business 
gross margin on sales was in fiscal  a decline over gross margins of in fiscal this small drop in gross margin was caused by higher fixed overhead costs per sales dollar due to the significant decline in shipments during fiscal compared to the prior year and by increases in manufacturing production process costs required to set up automated production facilities for the company s new commercial wireless products 
during fiscal  approximately  of costs incurred in building products for shipment were charged against the allowance for contract losses established at the end of fiscal and increased by  during the second quarter of fiscal these expenses represented cost overruns incurred on units shipped during fiscal  which had been previously identified and provided for when the loss provision allowance was established 
research and development expense was  in fiscal up over  in fiscal this increase reflects a significant rise in the second half of fiscal in the volume of prototype development for the company s new wireless cellular base station products 
development efforts were being concentrated on adapting existing company technologies to produce products which are targeted at existing potential customer base station applications and present both improved performance and significant cost savings compared to the products currently being used by potential customers 
marketing expense rose  or in fiscal compared to fiscal  due mainly to the increased resources required to penetrate the wireless commercial marketplace 
during fiscal year the company added sales personnel dedicated to the wireless market and increased its advertising and travel expenditures by and  respectively  in order to serve this new marketplace and expanded customer base 
general and administrative expenses fell in fiscal versus fiscal this reduction was the result of lower travel and professional service expenses and continuing reductions in personnel through attrition and reassignments 
interest expense fell in fiscal compared to fiscal  while other income decreased during this same period 
the drop in interest expense mirrored the decline in the level of debt outstanding during the current year  which more than offset the general rise in interest rates experienced in fiscal other income  which is primarily interest income  fell  in fiscal although investable cash balances and interest rates were comparable in fiscal and  during the company sold an idle fixed asset resulting in a one time profit of approximately  no such comparable sale of assets occurred in fiscal despite a increase in sales volume in fiscal  the company s foreign subsidiary  anaren microwave  ltd  recorded an operating loss of  compared to an operating loss of  in fiscal the loss incurred was due to delays in delivery and cost overruns on a  simulator contract for the dutch air force 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange had no material effect on the results of operation for anaren microwave  ltd  as the exchange rate for the british pound varied little during fiscal consolidated income tax benefit was  in fiscal versus an expected tax benefit of  based on of the loss before income taxes and the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
the majority of the difference between the actual tax benefit recognized and the expected tax benefit calculated on the loss incurred was due to the company s equity in the operating loss of its english subsidiary which is not subject to us taxation and an increase in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance required by the new tax accounting rules fas no 
adopted by the company at the beginning of fiscal under the new tax accounting rules the company must assess the realizability of deferred tax assets  considering whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in the period in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management of the company has considered the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income in making the assessment of the realizability of the deferred tax asset balances at july  based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods which the deferred tax assets are deductible  the company believes it is more likely than not that it will realize the benefit of these deductible differences  net of the existing valuation allowances at july  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources at june   the company had net working capital of  which included  in cash and cash equivalents  compared to working capital at june  of  which included  in cash and cash equivalents 
net cash used was  in fiscal compared to cash used of  in fiscal cash flow was negative in both fiscal and fiscal due principally to the net losses incurred in both years  continuing reductions in long term debt  acquisitions of capital equipment and  in fiscal  the repurchase of approximately  of the company s common stock 
long term liabilities  which consist of the company s unfunded liability for post retirement health care costs under fas no 
and long term debt in the form of various capitalized lease obligations  decreased  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
the decline in both fiscal year and represents scheduled repayment of debt as the company  presently  has no plans to fund the long term liability recognized under fas no 
no new long term debt was taken on during this two year period as the company s cash balances were more than adequate to fund both long and short term cash needs 
capital equipment additions in fiscal amounted to  and consisted primarily of equipment needed to further automate production for the company s new wireless telecommunications component products which were under development in fiscal the additions were funded entirely by cash generated by operations 
capital equipment expenditures for fiscal have been budgeted at approximately  and will consist primarily  of additional automated high volume production equipment to further expand production capacity of the new wireless products 
these additions will continue to be funded by cash generated from operations and currently existing cash balances as management believe that these cash resources will be more than adequate to meet these financing needs 
in fiscal  the company maintained a revolving line of credit with a bank which provided for principal drawings of up to  this credit agreement carried interest on outstanding borrowings at the prime rate plus and was secured by all assets of the company which were not otherwise pledged under other agreements 
this credit facility expired at december  in august  the company secured a commitment for a new credit facility from a bank providing for a  working capital revolving line of credit bearing interest at prime maturing on november   and a  term loan payable in semi annual installments of  through may   bearing interest at prime plus 
the proceeds of the term loan will be used to refinance the existing loans of the company other than capitalized lease obligations  while the revolving credit facility will be used to supplement short term working capital needs brought about by the expected growth in production and sales volume 
borrowings under the new credit facility will be secured by substantially all assets of the company 
the company believes that its cash requirements for the foreseeable future will be satisfied by currently invested cash balances  expected cash flow from operations and funds available under its credit facilities
