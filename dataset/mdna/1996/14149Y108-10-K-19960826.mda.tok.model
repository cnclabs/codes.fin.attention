the discussion and analysis presented below should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
results of operations net revenues 
net revenues in fiscal increased compared with fiscal primarily due to the internal revenue growth from pharmaceutical wholesaling activities  including the addition of new customers  increased sales to existing customers and price increases 
the increase in net revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to internal business growth of  primarily in pharmaceutical wholesaling activities  the acquisition of humiston keeling  inc in july  and the merger transaction with behrens inc in july see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the internal business growth in fiscal resulted primarily from the addition of new customers partially as a result of expanded sales territories  increased sales to existing customers  and price increases 
gross margin 
as a percentage of net revenues  gross margin increased to for fiscal from in fiscal this increase is primarily due to the gross margin generated from the acquisition of pharmacy management operations in fiscal see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
pharmacy management operations generally provide a higher gross margin than pharmaceutical wholesaling activities 
the gross margin ratio in fiscal decreased from in fiscal primarily due to decreases in pharmaceutical selling margin rates  reflecting a more competitive market and a greater mix of high volume customers  offset by a slight increase in purchasing gains associated with pharmaceutical price inflation 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in the selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues in fiscal is due to the inclusion of pharmacy management services in current year operations see gross margin above 
this increase was partially offset by economies associated with the company s revenue growth from pharmaceutical wholesaling activities  as well as productivity gains resulting in part from warehouse consolidations and management information system enhancements 
the decrease in the selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues in fiscal from in fiscal is due to economies associated with the company s revenue growth as well as consolidating distribution centers and administrative functions  and selectively automating facilities

if additional costs are incurred  such items will be expensed in subsequent periods 
in fiscal  the company recorded a charge to reflect whitmire merger costs of approximately million million net of tax 
these costs included approximately million for investment banking  legal  accounting  and other related transaction fees and costs associated with the combination  million for corporate integration and distribution rationalization  million for integration of information systems  and million for restructuring whitmire s revolving credit agreement 
at june   the company had disbursed all amounts related to these liabilities  with the actual amounts paid approximating the original amounts recorded 
these items are considered unusual in nature in that the costs would generally not have been incurred in the absence of the business combinations 
interest expense 
the increase in interest expense of million in fiscal compared to fiscal is due to the company s issuance of million  notes due  in a public offering in january the increase in interest expense of million in fiscal compared to fiscal is due to higher average short term borrowings resulting from increased working capital requirements associated with the company s growth

the increases in inventories and accounts payable are due to the company s revenue growth  the procurement of pharmaceutical inventory relative to an anticipated increase in business with a large mass merchandising customer  and pharmaceutical price increases 
the increase in cash and equivalents  and marketable securities available for sale reflect the timing of inventory purchases and payments noted above and a partial use of proceeds from the company s million note offering see interest expense  above 
the increase in trade receivables was due primarily to increased sales see net revenues  above 
the increase in the current portion of long term debt is due to the company s million notes which are due march liabilities incurred in connection with the fiscal business combinations were the primary cause of the increase in the other accrued liabilities 
property and equipment  at cost increased by million in fiscal the property acquired included increased investment in management information systems and customer support systems  as well as the construction and automation of distribution facilities 
goodwill and other intangibles increased by approximately million to million due to purchase business combinations completed in the current year  primarily related to the company s point of use pharmacy systems and pharmacy management services see note of notes to consolidated financial statements

other pending business combination 
on july   the company announced that it had entered into a definitive merger agreement with pci services  inc pci pursuant to which pci will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the company in a stock for stock merger expected to be accounted for as a pooling of interests for financial reporting purposes 
in connection with the merger  the company estimates that it will issue approximately million common shares 
under the terms of the merger agreement  shareholders of pci will receive common shares for each share of pci that they own at the time the transaction is consummated  subject to adjustment under specified circumstances 
in addition  pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement  options for pci common stock will be converted into equivalent options for approximately  common shares  based upon the exchange ratio 
upon consummation of the merger  the company will record a one time charge to reflect transaction and other costs incurred as a result of the merger 
the merger is expected to be completed in the fall of  subject to satisfaction of certain conditions  including approval by shareholders of pci 
the company s trend with regard to acquisitions in fiscal  and continuing with the pending pci transaction described above  has been to expand its role as a health care service provider 
this trend has resulted in diversification into health care services which a complement the company s core pharmaceutical distribution business  b provide opportunities for the company to develop synergies with  and thus strengthen  the acquired business  and c generally generate higher gross margins as a percentage of net revenues than pharmaceutical distribution 
as the health care industry continues to consolidate  the company expects to continually evaluate acquisition candidates in both pharmaceutical distribution as well as other opportunities that would expand its role as a health care service provider  however  there can be no assurance that it will be able to successfully pursue any such opportunity or consummate any such transaction
