legislative and regulatory action has resulted in continuing change in the medicare and medicaid reimbursement programs which has adversely impacted the company 
the changes have limited  and are expected to continue to limit  payment increases under these programs 
also  the timing of payments made under the medicare and medicaid programs is subject to regulatory action and governmental budgetary constraints  in recent years  the time period between submission of claims and payment has increased 
implementation of the company s strategy to expand specialty medical services to independent providers should reduce the impact of changes in the medicare and medicaid reimbursement programs on the company as a whole 
within the statutory framework of the medicare and medicaid programs  there are substantial areas subject to administrative rulings and interpretations which may further affect payments made under those programs 
further  the federal and state governments may reduce the funds available under those programs in the future or require more stringent utilization and quality reviews of eldercare centers

seasonality the company s earnings generally fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
this seasonality is related to a combination of factors which include the timing of medicaid rate increases  seasonal census cycles  and the number of calendar days in a given quarter 
impact of inflation the healthcare industry is labor intensive 
wages and other labor costs are especially sensitive to inflation and marketplace labor shortages 
to date  the company has offset its increased operating costs by increasing charges for its services and expanding its services 
genesis has also implemented cost control measures to limit increases in operating costs and expenses but cannot predict its ability to control such operating cost increases in the future
