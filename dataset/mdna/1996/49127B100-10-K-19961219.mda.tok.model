the company s primary ongoing cash requirements are for the payment of retainage on project  which expanded the company s casting  rolling  and finishing capacity  and on the ladle metallurgy project  which is expanding the melting capacity 
the two sources for the company s liquidity are internally generated funds and its million bank credit facility 
the company had million in borrowings outstanding as of september  under that facility

impact of inflation and changing prices while the company has not experienced any material long term adverse effects on operations in recent years because of inflation  margins have been affected by inflationary conditions 
the company s primary cost components are steel scrap  labor  and energy  all of which are susceptible to domestic inflationary pressures 
scrap prices are frequently influenced by supply and demand factors as well as general economic conditions 
in contrast  finished product prices are influenced by nationwide economic trends and manufacturing capacity within the steel industry 
while the company has generally been successful in passing on cost increases through price increases  the effect of steel imports  market price competition and under utilized industry capacity has in the past  and could in the future  limit the company s ability to increase prices
