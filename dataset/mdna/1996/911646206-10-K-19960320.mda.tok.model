the company  in january  following the december meeting of the oncologic drug advisory committee of the fda which withheld recommendation for the us approval of ethyol  went through an internal restructuring and downsizing in an effort to reduce expenditures so as to preserve financial resources for its research  product development and commercial objectives 
this restructuring resulted in a reduction in the company s staffing levels and expenditures and a re prioritization of research efforts focusing on near term projects  which management believes may be capable of providing additional revenues 
a one time restructuring charge of approximately  principally to cover severance payments  was charged to earnings in the first quarter of the company s principal research activity in centered on the regulatory approval of ethyol by the fda

as a percentage of sales  cost of sales in the year ended december   increased to from in the prior year period due principally to the sale of ethyol to scherico at approximately cost of manufacture 
sales of ethyol to scherico will generate positive returns to the company if and when the product achieves profitability as defined in the company s agreement with scherico 
selling  general and administrative costs for the year ended december  increased to  an increase of  over the expenditure of  the increase is principally due to the accrual of million for the company s share of operating losses resulting from the launch of ethyol in europe by scherico and the accrual of a one time million charge related to ethyol us launch expenses as part of the company s co promotion arrangement with alza 
these expenses were partly off set by reductions in us marketing costs for neutrexin of million  lower facility costs of  and reduced legal and consulting expenses of  research and development costs for the year ended december  were  as compared to  in the million reduction is principally due to the capitalization of manufacturing expenses with the start of commercial production at the company s manufacturing plant in the netherlands of  lower personnel costs of  reduced professional and outside services expenses of  and reductions in travel costs of  in addition  lower clinical and product development expenditures of  resulted from the completion and scale down of several development programs

liquidity and capital resources since its inception in  the company has financed operations principally through the sale of equity capital  issuance of secured and unsecured debt  investment income  sales of its two drug products  hexalen and neutrexin  and revenues received through distribution and sublicense agreements for its drugs 
as of december   the company s cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled  the company s investment portfolio consists of securities issued by the us government or its agencies and investment grade corporate debt instruments 
during  net cash used in operations amounted to  principally due to the factors discussed above under results of operations and an increase in inventory levels 
as noted above  the company  in december raised approximately million in a private placement of common stock and unsecured convertible debentures 
the company also obtained secured debt financing totaling approximately million during  see notes to consolidated financial statements and until such time as one or more of the company s currently approved products achieves significant sales or other revenue and currently approved products receive regulatory approval to expanded indications currently under development which result in increased revenues  the company s cash position will continue to be reduced due principally to expenditures in research  product development  marketing  and selling and administrative activities 
failure to obtain additional regulatory approvals on products currently in development and to achieve significant sales  will have a material adverse effect on the company 
additionally  the level of future product sales will also depend on several factors  including product acceptance  market penetration  competitive products  the performance of the company s licensees and distributors  and the healthcare system existing in each market where the company s products are or may become commercially available 
the company s net capital expenditures were  in and total  since inception 
in april  the company purchased a sterile products production facility in the netherlands 
validation work and pilot production on this new facility were completed in the facility received regulatory approval for product manufacture and distribution from the dutch regulatory authority in june to manufacture the company s products for distribution in the european community  and the facility was approved by the fda to manufacture neutrexin for the us market in may a mortgage loan of approximately  relating to this facility was obtained in may the purchase price for this facility was  and  in capital improvements have been made since its purchase to make the facility operational and expand its production capacity 
further capital expenditures  estimated at  are planned in the funds raised in the private placement million  net and the distribution fees from alza million have provided the company with approximately million in working capital  which the company believes will be sufficient to cover operating expenses at current levels for the foreseeable future 
the company is hopeful that its products will  in the near future  generate sufficient sales to provide meaningful cash resources  although no assurance can be given that they will do so 
the company is also hopeful that the company will in the future receive further regulatory approvals and that such approvals will increase sales 
however  no assurance can be given that further regulatory approvals will be obtained in a timely manner  if ever  or that the company will have adequate financial resources to commercialize its products when approved or that product sales will be sufficient to cover operating expenses 
although the company will from time to time explore additional sources of financing  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining such financing on terms acceptable to the company 
the company s future liquidity and capital requirements are dependent upon several factors  including  but not limited to  its success in generating significant revenues from sales  the performance of its sublicensees and distributors under sublicense and distribution arrangements for sales of its products  the time and cost required to manufacture and market its products  the time and cost required to obtain regulatory approvals  including expanded labelling for its products which are already commercially available  obtaining the rights to additional commercially viable compounds  competitive technological developments  additional governmental imposed regulation and control  and changes in healthcare systems which affect reimbursement  pricing or availability of drugs and market acceptance of drugs 
the above factors may also affect realization of certain asset currently held by the company  principally investments in plant  equipment and inventory 
to extend its current financial resources  the company has instituted programs to reduce expenditures 
as noted above  the company initiated an internal restructuring in january in an effort to reduce expenditures and has reduced its staff from individuals at january  to at december  however  no assurance can be given that these measures will continue to be successful in reducing expenditures to the degree necessary to allow the company to reach its regulatory and commercial objectives and eventual profitability 
in  scherico  the company s european distributor for its cytoprotective agent  ethyol  launched ethyol in several european markets where regulatory approvals have been received 
under the terms of its agreement with scherico  the company shares in operating profits losses generated from marketing and sales of ethyol in germany  united kingdom  spain  italy and france the major markets for a period of up to two years from november   the date of approval of ethyol in the united kingdom 
the company s share of operating losses  generated from the major markets was approximately million in the limit on operating losses  if any  attributable to the major markets is limited to approximately million for based on an operating plan for the company will share in operating profits  if any  generated from sales of ethyol in the other countries in the european territories outside the major markets in which ethyol is launched by scherico  but is not exposed to operating losses  if any  generated in such countries 
profits or losses under the agreement with scherico are affected by the same uncertainties noted in the preceding paragraphs 
the company is hopeful that the commercialization of its drug product ethyol will be financially successful in europe 
however  no assurance can be given that the company will achieve meaningful revenues under this agreement 
the company has been unprofitable since its inception and expects to incur additional operating losses until such time as substantial sales are realized and further regulatory approvals are obtained  although the distribution fees from alza corporation did bring the company close to a break even position for the company s losses may increase as the company continues its commercialization  research and development activities  and such losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
there can be no assurance that the company will ever achieve significant revenues or profitable operations 
for the period from may  inception through december   the company had an accumulated deficit of  impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements in march  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  which requires impairment losses to be recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amount 
statement no 
also addresses the accounting for long lived assets that are expected to be disposed of 
the company will adopt statement no 
in the first quarter of and  based on current circumstances  does not believe the effect of the adoption will be material 
statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  statement no 
provides companies with a choice to follow the provisions of statement no 
in determination of stock based compensation expense or to continue with the provisions of apb  accounting for stock issued to employees 
the company will continue to follow apb and will provide proforma disclosures as required by statement no 
in the december  notes to the consolidated financial statements
