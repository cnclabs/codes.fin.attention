item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management s discussion and analysis cipsco incorporated is a holding company incorporated under the laws of illinois 
its principal subsidiary is central illinois public service company cips  an electric and natural gas utility 
another subsidiary  cipsco investment company cic  has subsidiaries engaged in non utility investing activities 
material changes in the consolidated financial condition and results of operations are primarily attributable to cips operations  except where noted 
ameren corporation on august   cipsco entered into an agreement and plan of merger providing for a business combination with union electric company ue of st 
louis  missouri  subject to the approval of shareholders of both companies and various regulatory agencies 
as a result of the proposed business combination  a newly formed holding company ameren corporation will become the parent of cips  ue  and cic 
the holding company will be registered under the public utility holding company act 
when the merger is completed  each outstanding share of cipsco common stock will be converted into shares of ameren common stock and each outstanding share of ue common stock will be converted into one share of ameren common stock 
the transaction is expected to be tax free to shareholders for federal income tax purposes and to be accounted for as a pooling of interests 
shareholders of both companies approved the merger agreement on december  following regulatory approvals  the merger is expected to be effective early in see notes and to consolidated financial statements 
cipsco incorporated the fundamental financial position of cipsco and its subsidiaries remained strong in cipsco s business activities are conducted by cips and cic 
a discussion of the financial condition of cips and cic follows in the sections below 
cipsco may become involved in additional businesses or investments directly  through a subsidiary or through the formation of one or more additional subsidiaries 
the sources of capital to finance these activities will depend on the nature of the investment and market conditions 
the total number of shares of common stock authorized under cipsco s articles is million 
at year end  a total of  shares of common stock was outstanding which was unchanged from year end no underwritten offerings of common stock are planned 
dividends paid to common stock shareholders for the months ended december  resulted in payout ratios of percent of consolidated earnings and percent of net cash provided by operating activities 
cipsco is authorized to issue million shares of preferred stock  none of which has been issued 
there are no constraints in the cipsco articles of incorporation as to the amount of debt which may be issued 
however  cipsco has no debt outstanding 
at year end  cipsco had million of temporary investments and no short term borrowings 
cipsco investment company at year end there were million of non utility investments managed by cic and its subsidiaries 
one of those subsidiaries  cipsco securities company  manages marketable securities 
at year end it had invested approximately million in hedged portfolios of preferred and common stocks and other marketable securities 
another subsidiary  cipsco leasing company  invests in long term leveraged lease transactions 
at year end  million was invested in leased assets consisting of a commercial jet aircraft  an interest in a natural gas liquids plant  natural gas processing equipment and retail department store properties 
a third subsidiary  cipsco energy company cec  seeks energy related investment opportunities 
through  it had purchased existing leases  or interests in such leases  for nine combustion turbine generating units leased to five investor owned utilities in the united states 
in cec purchased a percent interest in appomattox cogeneration limited partnership  which owns a power sales agreement for electricity produced at a megawatt cogeneration plant at hopewell  virginia 
at year end cec had a total of million invested 
a fourth subsidiary  cipsco venture company cvc  was established primarily to invest within the cips service territory 
cvc s initial investment in consisted of 
million for the construction of a building which is leased to a manufacturing firm 
cvc made no additional investments in the long term goal of cic s investment policy is to earn returns that exceed the allowed return in the regulated utility business 
cic may become involved in additional non utility activities directly  through a subsidiary or through the formation of one or more additional subsidiaries 
the sources of capital to finance these activities will depend on the nature of the investment and market conditions 
at year end  cic had million of temporary investments and no short term borrowings 
central illinois public service company financial condition 
the utility s financial position remained fundamentally strong during in recent years a strong capital structure and ample cash flows have minimized the need to access capital markets  other than for refinancings 
neither cipsco nor cips has had to raise additional capital through the sale of common stock to the general public since the long range financial objectives for the capital structure of the utility subsidiary are a debt ratio of no more than percent  a common equity ratio of no less than percent  and a preferred equity ratio of no more than percent 
at december   the capitalization at cips consisted of percent long term debt  percent common equity and percent preferred stock 
at year end   shares of cips common stock were outstanding  all of which were held by cipsco incorporated 
capital and financing requirements 
construction expenditures were million in of that amount  million and million related to improvements and replacements to the electric and natural gas systems  respectively 
for the months ended december   percent of cips total capital requirements was provided from internal sources 
construction expenditures are expected to be about million in of that amount  million is scheduled for electric facilities  while gas system expenditures are estimated at million 
for the five year period  construction expenditures are estimated at million 
this is million less than was spent in the preceding five years 
the projected five year amounts include about million for environmental compliance including compliance with the clean air act amendments of in addition to construction funds  projected capital requirements for the period include million for scheduled debt retirements 
capital requirements for the period are expected to be met primarily through internally generated funds 
external financing to fund scheduled debt retirements will be required 
in addition  up to million of external financing is expected to be required to fund the construction program 
such financing could consist of funds from the parent  including the issuance of cips common stock to the parent  the issuance of short term debt  long term debt or preferred stock  or any combination of the four 
refinancings to lower the costs of capital may also occur  depending on market conditions 
cips currently has authority from the illinois commerce commission to issue up to million of first mortgage bonds  medium term notes and or preferred stock through december  in cips issued million of first mortgage bonds  medium term note series  due june  the proceeds of this issue  together with other funds  were used for general corporate purposes and to replace funds used to retire maturing debt 
capital and financing requirements may be affected by such factors as availability and cost of capital  load growth  changes in construction expenditures  fuel strategies  regulatory developments  changes in environmental regulations and other governmental activities 
cips is evaluating alternatives for reducing fuel costs and other expenses while maintaining environmental compliance 
depending on the alternative selected  construction expenditures could increase the five year forecast by as much as million over the period 
in addition  adoption of certain alternatives in fuel and or environmental strategies could result in substantial increases in other capital requirements in the period from the amounts shown above 
these potential additional capital requirements would also need to be financed with external sources of funds 
see fuel strategies below 
financing flexibility and liquidity 
the utility s ability to finance the construction program at reasonable cost and to provide for other capital needs is dependent upon its ability to earn a fair return on capital 
financing flexibility is enhanced by providing a high percentage of total capital requirements from internal sources and having the ability  if necessary  to issue long term securities and to obtain short term credit 
flexibility also is provided by the parent corporation which is capable of providing additional capital if circumstances warrant 
security issues by the utility are subject to regulatory approvals 
the utility s mortgage indenture limits the amount of first mortgage bonds which may be issued 
at december   cips could have issued about million of additional first mortgage bonds under the indenture  assuming an annual interest rate of percent 
cips articles of incorporation limit amounts of preferred stock which may be issued 
assuming a preferred dividend rate of percent  the utility could have issued all million of authorized but unissued preferred stock remaining as of year end 
at year end  cips had no temporary investments and million of short term borrowings 
consolidated results of operations earnings 
net income and earnings per share declined percent in to million and  respectively  following declines of percent in the return on average common equity for was compared with in and in the declines in net income  earnings per share and return on average common equity in resulted from costs related to a workforce reduction and merger related expenses  which reduced earnings cents per common share in the declines in net income  earnings per share and return on average common equity in were in line with expectations  since increases in were primarily attributable to unusually high interchange sales by cips to other utilities caused by hot weather  a coal miners strike and midwest flooding 
contributing to the declines in were higher operating expenses primarily attributable to labor settlement costs and higher maintenance costs 
investment revenues 
investment revenues are comprised of income from temporary investments  long term marketable securities  leveraged leases and partnership income 
investment revenues increased in due to additional investments and increased earnings from marketable securities 
investment revenues declined million in due principally to reduced revenue from leasing investment transactions 
electric operations 
retail electric kilowatthour sales increased percent in cooling degree days for were percent higher than in and percent above average 
total electric kilowatthour sales declined percent in due principally to a decline in wholesale kilowatthour sales and two industrial customers who ceased operations 
the capacity participation agreement with one of cips wholesale customers called for a megawatt reduction for the customer starting in this scheduled contract reduction reduced wholesale power supply participation revenues for cips by million in electric kilowatthour sales  including interchange sales  declined percent in cooling degree days for were percent lower than in and percent lower than average 
the electric margins for the three years ended december  were electric margin in millions electric revenues less revenue taxes fuel purchased power electric margin the electric margin improved primarily because hotter weather during july and august increased residential and commercial sales and provided opportunities for interchange sales 
the electric margin was favorably impacted by sales growth to commercial and industrial customers and by higher margins on interchange sales to other utilities 
fuel costs were per million btu in  per million btu in and per million btu in purchased power amounts fluctuated between years according to system requirements and sales opportunities 
gas operations 
therm sold and transported increased percent in due principally to colder weather in compared with heating degree days for were percent higher than in and percent above average 
the gas margins for the three years ended december  were gas margin in millions gas revenues less revenue taxes gas costs gas margin the gas margin was favorably impacted by colder weather in the gas margin was negatively impacted by mild weather as heating degree days were percent below average in gas costs fluctuated according to system requirements in each year 
the average price paid for gas from suppliers declined more than three and one half cents per therm in and two and one half cents per therm in operating expenses 
other operation expenses increased percent in over primarily due to unusual charges related to the voluntary separation program of million see note to consolidated financial statements and merger related write offs of million involving previously deferred system development costs 
the following table shows other operation expenses for the years ended december  adjusted for the unusual items 
other operation in millions other operation voluntary separation costs write off of system costs other operation adjusted other operation expenses declined percent in  due principally to a reduction in post retirement medical costs and deferral of certain litigation expenses involved with an environmental matter 
consistent with the ratemaking treatment for environmental remediation site costs  million expensed in was credited to expense and deferred in maintenance expense changes between years are due to normal planning and scheduling of major power plant maintenance outages 
depreciation and amortization expense increases are primarily due to property additions 
taxes other than income taxes change in relation to changes in retail revenues 
interest on long term debt decreased from levels due to retirement of debt in and refinancing of long term debt in at lower interest rates 
miscellaneous  net  reflects million of merger transaction costs in such costs are not tax deductible 
income tax expense reflects the changes in pre tax income between years 
changes in consolidated balance sheet accounts 
significant changes in the balance sheet accounts at december   compared to balances at december  are fuel for electric generation  at average cost  increased percent during due primarily to the additional purchase of coal to cover anticipated contract shortages which did not occur  gas stored underground  at average cost  declined percent in due to both lower prices and net volumes of gas injected into storage  other current assets increased due principally to higher required deposits for self insured programs  leveraged leases and energy investments increased percent in primarily due to additional energy related investments made during the year  and  short term borrowings increased primarily due to increases in construction expenditures and in fuel for electric generation  together with the decline in earnings 
clean air act 
cips current compliance strategy for phases i and ii of the clean air act amendments of is to switch to lower sulfur coal at some generating units along with increased scrubbing at newton unit the estimated capital costs of compliance based on the current strategy are included in the five year construction forecast 
fuel strategies 
in order to reduce fuel costs and other expenses while remaining in compliance with environmental requirements  cips is evaluating various alternatives 
these alternatives involve one or more of the following renegotiation of existing fuel contracts  buyout  buydown  replacement or termination of fuel contracts  switching to other coal suppliers  switching to lower sulfur coal  discontinuance of  or renovation and continued operation of  the scrubber at newton unit certain of the alternatives would require increased expenditures for capital improvements such as for modifications to precipitators  new coal handling equipment and purchase of rail cars 
in addition to increased construction expenditures  adoption of certain alternatives  and the rate making treatment of such actions  could have a significant effect on operation and maintenance expense  fuel expense and financing needs 
the study of these alternatives is not complete and no decision has been made as to whether the fuel and environmental compliance strategies will change 
see capital and financing requirements above and note to consolidated financial statements 
regulation and competition 
the electric utility industry is becoming more competitive due to market forces and a changing regulatory and legislative environment 
to maintain market position in this environment and to take advantage of opportunities presented through increased competition  cips may  from time to time  consider various business strategies including the restructuring of wholesale and retail business operations 
due to competition  certain future sales may be at lower than historical margins 
the national energy policy act of nepa contains provisions designed to promote competition in the wholesale and generation segments of the electric utility industry 
among other provisions  nepa gave the federal energy regulatory commission ferc the authority to order electric utilities to provide wholesale transmission line access wholesale wheeling to independent power producers and to other utilities 
although nepa prohibits ferc from ordering retail wheeling the use of a utility s transmission and distribution facilities by others to deliver power to retail customers  it does not prevent state public utility commissions from doing so 
public utilities not voluntarily providing access to their transmission systems at agreed upon rates may be ordered to deliver power at rates to be established by ferc 
in july  legislation was passed in illinois authorizing the illinois commerce commission illinois commission  after hearings  to approve a public utility s petition to operate under alternative forms of regulation 
the illinois commission can now consider  on a trial basis  alternatives to rate of return regulation which could reward or penalize utilities based on performance 
cips plans to make an alternative regulation filing after completing the merger with ue  to establish a mechanism for sharing merger related and other savings between ratepayers and shareholders 
also in  as a result of legislative debate on competition and retail wheeling  the illinois general assembly formed the joint committee on electric utility reform joint committee 
the joint committee is to submit a final legislative recommendation to the illinois general assembly by november cips has presented a proposal to an advisory group of the joint committee that would introduce greater competition in illinois in two phases beginning january  although the final design or impact of the federal and state regulatory policies relating to wholesale and retail wheeling are not known  cips is actively planning the transition to a competitive environment 
increased competition could also force utilities to change accounting methods 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for effects of certain types of regulation  applies to regulated entities whose rates are designed to recover costs of providing service to customers through the ratemaking process 
changes in regulation or in the competitive environment for regulated services could cause a utility to no longer be eligible to apply sfas no 
to established regulatory assets 
cips has evaluated the possibility that sfas no 
would no longer apply to it and currently believes that there would be no material adverse effect on financial position  results of operations or liquidity of the company or cips 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  is not expected to have a material impact on the financial position  results of operations or liquidity of the company or cips 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
environmental remediation costs 
the utility has identified former manufactured gas plant sites environmental remediation sites which contain potentially harmful materials 
in  one site was added to the united states environmental protection agency usepa superfund list 
the utility is implementing an approved long term remedial plan for the site 
costs and associated legal expenses related to studies and remediation work have been incurred and estimated at other sites 
since  the estimated incurred costs related to studies and remediation at these sites and associated legal expenses and certain carrying charges are being accrued and deferred rather than expensed currently  pending recovery either from rates  from insurance carriers or from other parties 
costs prudently incurred in connection with the sites that have not been or are not recovered from insurance carriers or other parties will be recovered through approved environmental rate riders 
accordingly  management believes that costs incurred in connection with these sites will not have a material adverse effect on financial position  results of operations or liquidity of the company or cips 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
labor issues 
cips collective bargaining agreements  covering approximately percent of its workforce  will expire on june  discussions to reach new labor agreements are under way 
the international union of operating engineers local and the international brotherhood of electrical workers local each filed unfair labor practice charges in with the national labor relations board nlrb relating to the legality of a lockout by cips of both unions during the peoria regional office of the nlrb has issued complaints against cips concerning its lockout of both unions 
the unions seek  among other things  back pay and other benefits for the period of the lockout 
cips estimates the amount of back pay and other benefits for both unions to be less than million 
management believes the lockout was both lawful and reasonable and that the final resolution of the disputes will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position  results of operations or liquidity of the company or cips 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
ferc order during  ferc issued order no 
this and successor orders have resulted in substantial restructuring of the service obligations of interstate pipeline suppliers 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
other matters 
customer usage of electricity and natural gas varies with weather conditions  general business conditions  the state of the economy and the cost of energy services 
the level of sales also is impacted by conditions in the interchange market 
further  certain large gas customers can purchase gas from alternative suppliers or bypass the utility system by switching to other fuels or by connecting directly to pipelines 
rates for retail electric and gas service are regulated by the illinois commission 
non retail electric rates are regulated by ferc 
the utility s rates are designed to recover operating costs including depreciation and capital costs on utility plant investment 
changes in the cost of fuel for electric generation and gas costs generally are reflected in billings to customers on a timely basis through fuel and purchased gas adjustment clauses 
inflation continues to be a factor affecting operations  earnings  shareholders equity and financial performance
