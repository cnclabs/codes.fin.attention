financial condition cash generation cash generation usage was as follows in millions year ended december  funds provided by operations changes in operating assets and liabilities net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities cash generation usage the increase in funds provided by operations in was primarily due to lower operating profit in the petroleum segment in resulting from the state royalty oil settlement 
see comments under results of operations on page for additional information regarding segment operating results 
the negative impact of the changes in operating assets and liabilities of million in primarily resulted from the decrease in litigation reserves and taxes payable as a result of the state royalty oil settlement 
capital expenditures and acquisitions in were million  of which million was for capital items necessary to maintain existing operations 
capital expenditures and acquisitions in were million  of which million was for capital items necessary to maintain existing operations 
capital expenditures in included million for the expansion of the rocky mountain pipeline system  million for capital improvements at the memphis refinery  million related to the expansion of the martiki mine  million for the acquisition of retail gasoline convenience stores in the nashville  tennessee  market area and million for environmental projects 
capital expenditures in included million for the acquisition of the assets of emro propane company emro and million for environmental projects 
financing activities in included a net increase in short term borrowings of million used primarily for capital expenditures  the payment of million of medium term notes  the payment of million of dividends and the repurchase of  shares of mapco common stock for million pursuant to mapco s authorized stock repurchase program 
financing activities in included a net increase in short term borrowings of million used primarily for the acquisition of the assets of emro and payment of the state royalty oil settlement 
other financing activities in included payment of an million scheduled maturity of a medium term note  payment of million of dividends and the repurchase of  shares of mapco common stock for million pursuant to the company s stock repurchase program 
capitalization capitalization  which includes long term debt excluding current maturities and stockholders equity  increased from  million at december   to  million at december  the increase represents the favorable impact of operating results on stockholders equity and the net increase in short term debt  partially offset by the repurchase of mapco common stock and the payment of dividends 
mapco s long term debt as a percentage of capitalization increased from at december   to at december  various loan agreements contain restrictive covenants which  among other things  limit the payment of advances or dividends by two of natural gas liquids subsidiaries to mapco 
at december   million of net assets were restricted by such provisions 
liquidity and capital resources mapco s primary sources of liquidity are its cash and cash equivalents  internal cash generation and external financing 
at december   mapco s cash and cash equivalents were million compared to million at december mapco s external financing sources include its bank credit agreements and its ability to issue public or private debt  including commercial paper 
mapco s bank credit agreements represent a total committed line of credit of million 
the commitment under the first bank credit agreement is for million and reduces in quarterly amounts of million commencing june  in december  mapco obtained an additional million commitment under a bank credit agreement which matures in december both agreements serve as a back up for outstanding commercial paper and for borrowings against bank money market lines 
as of december   no borrowings were outstanding under the bank credit agreements 
in  mapco filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission providing for the issuance of up to million of debt securities 
as of december   mapco had outstanding million of medium term notes issued pursuant to this registration 
mapco has the authorization to issue up to an additional million of medium term notes 
the proceeds from any debt issued under the shelf registration statement have been and will continue to be used for general corporate purposes  including working capital  capital expenditures  reduction of other debt and acquisitions 
in january  mapco announced that it had signed a letter of intent with the beacon group energy investment fund lp beacon to form a limited liability company which will own substantially all of the net assets of the coal segment see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this issue 
the transaction will provide mapco with approximately million of proceeds with the potential to receive up to an additional million from the development of certain coal reserves 
also in january  the company signed an agreement to sell its thermogas iowa propane and liquid fertilizer assets to cenex inc the transaction also involves the sale to cenex inc of the remaining thermogas liquid fertilizer assets in arkansas  illinois  indiana  minnesota  ohio and wisconsin see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this issue 
in connection with this transaction  the company expects to receive approximately million in cash plus working capital 
mapco anticipates the majority of the proceeds from these transactions will be used for capital expenditures  share repurchases and or debt reduction 
on september   mapco completed the acquisition of the assets of emro which included the transfer to emro marketing company of mapco florida inc s retail convenience store assets in florida 
the cash payment for this acquisition has been reflected in the capital expenditures for mapco financed this acquisition primarily through the issuance of commercial paper and bank money market lines 
mapco s existing debt and credit agreements contain covenants which limit the amount of additional indebtedness the company can incur 
management believes  however  that mapco has sufficient capacity to fund its anticipated needs 
capital expenditures in  exclusive of the above mentioned transactions  are currently expected to be about million  of which million will be for expansion projects and million for environmental projects 
mapco expects to utilize cash from operations  short term funding sources and proceeds from the sale of assets  as needed  to meet anticipated capital expenditures 
mapco s long term liquidity is expected to increase since cash from operations is anticipated to exceed currently projected capital expenditures  environmental projects  debt service and dividends 
mapco anticipates that future excess internal cash generation will be used primarily for debt reduction and to fund new capital projects 
inflation during the past five years  mapco has benefitted from the relatively low rates of inflation experienced in the united states 
mapco s operating costs are influenced to a greater extent by specific price changes in oil and gas and related industries than by changes in general inflation 
crude  refined product and natural gas liquids ngl prices are particularly sensitive to opec production levels and or the attitudes of traders concerning the supply and demand balance in the near future 
these costs could increase with a possible adverse effect on mapco s profitability 
although every effort will be made to do so  it is possible that mapco  like many other companies  may not be able to adjust its sales prices to maintain parity with inflation driven operating costs 
the company attempts to minimize the impact of inflation on operating costs through on going productivity improvements and cost reduction programs 
significant volumes of mapco coal s production are sold pursuant to long term contracts that provide for cost adjustments which are generally inflation related 
mapco petroleum uses the last in  first out method of inventory valuation for crude oil  refined petroleum products and retail merchandise inventories 
this method of inventory valuation results in cost of sales which more closely represent current costs 
other the financial accounting standards board has issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which encourages  but does not require  employers to adopt a fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation  and which requires certain disclosures about costs associated with stock based employee compensation plans 
mapco will not adopt the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation but will continue to follow accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
mapco will adopt the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
in  which will have no effect on the company s financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
mapco maintains property and liability insurance at limits believed to be sufficient to cover estimated potential risks 
losses up to deductible amounts of the various coverages would not have a material effect on mapco s financial position  liquidity or results of operations

higher average refined petroleum product sales prices in the mid south region  increased demand for diesel fuel and naphtha on the west coast and in the asian markets and increased petroleum trading activities were the principal reasons for the increase in petroleum segment sales 
petroleum trading activities  other than for refinery supply and risk management purposes  were discontinued during the third quarter 
natural gas liquids sales and operating revenues increased million primarily because of increased propane and appliance sales and higher westpan revenues 
these increases were partially offset by lower ngl trading and transportation revenues 
propane and appliance sales increased significantly over because of additional sales volumes from operating the retail plants acquired from emro 
westpan revenues increased over primarily because of higher prices and condensate volumes which more than offset the impact of lower ngl volumes 
ngl trading revenues decreased in primarily because of unusually heavy trading activity in december transportation revenues decreased in principally because deliveries of demethanized mix to the gulf coast markets were significantly curtailed 
low ethane prices throughout prompted producers in the rocky mountain region to leave ethane in the gas stream and sell the product as natural gas 
increased volumes from new plant connections and plant expansions partially offset the impact of lower demethanized mix shipments to the gulf coast 
the million increase in coal sales and operating revenues was primarily attributable to higher production and sales volumes at the martiki and pontiki mines and increased brokerage sales volumes 
these increases were partially offset by lower sales volumes from the retiki mine which was closed in january production increased at the martiki mine because of lower overburden stripping ratios which resulted from moving mining operations to a new reserve area during and from the installation of new equipment 
pontiki s productivity increase reflects the installation of new mining equipment and improved employee morale 
brokerage volumes increased primarily because of a new brokerage arrangement with a large customer and from supplying big rivers electric corporation big rivers with brokerage tons in lieu of amounts previously supplied from the retiki mine 
outside purchases and operating expenses by segment are provided below in millions year ended december  outside operating outside operating purchases expenses purchases expenses natural gas liquids petroleum   coal outside purchases in increased million from the million increase in outside purchases by natural gas liquids reflects increased purchases of propane and appliances attributable to the emro operations  which were partially offset by lower trading activity

this increase is due primarily to a a million charge for surplus and obsolete assets at the memphis refinery written off after completion of a scheduled four year turnaround in  b high maintenance costs at the memphis refinery during the four months prior to the start of the turnaround  c higher utility costs at the north pole refinery and d increased retail marketing labor and advertising costs 
coal s operating expenses decreased million due to decreased expenses from closing the retiki mine and lower costs associated with the productivity improvements at the martiki and pontiki mines 
selling  general and administrative expense was million higher in primarily because of a increases in outside services associated with various reengineering efforts  b higher payroll and payroll related expenses and c relocation charges during in the petroleum segment 
depreciation  depletion and amortization was million in and million in the increase in these expenses was primarily attributable to depreciation and amortization charges associated with the emro assets acquired in  and increased units of production depreciation charges associated with the higher production volumes and capital additions at the martiki and pontiki mines 
interest and debt expense was million in compared to million in higher debt levels  resulting from the emro acquisition  the payment of the state royalty oil settlement and capital projects in  and higher interest rates were the principal reasons for the increase

average common shares outstanding were million in both and sales and operating revenues were as follows in millions year ended december  natural gas liquids petroleum   coal eliminations the million increase in sales and operating revenues was due principally to a change in strategies associated with trading activities in the petroleum segment 
natural gas liquids sales and operating revenues increased million due to additional propane sales volumes resulting from the september   emro acquisition and higher transportation revenues 
these increases were partially offset by decreased trading activities 
the increase in transportation revenues resulted from a increased deliveries of demethanized mix as higher gulf coast ethane prices prompted increased ethane recovery by producers  b additional throughput volumes from new plant connections and c a new long term contract with a major customer 
petroleum segment sales and operating revenues increased million over trading strategies employed in involved the purchase and sale of actual product in contrast to when trading was conducted primarily on the new york mercantile exchange where physical ownership of wet barrels is not required 
the million increase in coal sales and operating revenues was primarily attributable to higher production and sales volumes at the mettiki mine and higher brokerage sales volumes 
coal revenues also benefitted from index driven contract price increases and two new long term sales contracts 
outside purchases and operating expenses by segment are provided below in millions year ended december  outside operating outside operating purchases expenses purchases expenses natural gas liquids petroleum   coal outside purchases in increased million from natural gas liquids outside purchases decreased million despite additional purchases added by the emro operations 
the decrease in non emro purchases was attributable to lower propane prices  decreased trading purchases and reduced volumes from operating fewer retail stores 
petroleum s outside purchases increased million reflecting significantly higher petroleum trading activities 
the million increase in coal s outside purchases reflects higher brokerage volumes 
operating expenses in were million higher than natural gas liquids operating expenses increased million principally due to a the incremental operating costs associated with the emro operations  b refurbishing a portion of pipeline in connection with a new long term contract  c costs associated with the buy out of a gas supply contract and d higher product storage costs 
operating expenses in petroleum increased million  of which million is attributable to the state royalty oil settlement 
excluding the state royalty oil settlement and million of unusual items million received relative to a north pole refinery contract settlement and million received from a north pole refinery environmental claim which reduced operating expenses  expenses were million less than in primarily due to lower fuel costs at the north pole refinery 
coal s operating expenses increased million primarily as a result of higher operating levels and increased overburden removal costs at the martiki mine  higher production levels at the mettiki mine and reduced productivity at the pontiki  dotiki and pattiki mines 
depreciation  depletion and amortization was million in and million in the increase was primarily attributable to a depreciation and amortization associated with the emro assets acquired in  b a full year of depreciation for the seminole pipeline expansion and c additional costs associated with the phasing out of conventional mining equipment in conjunction with the conversion to continuous mining equipment at the dotiki and pattiki mines

thermogas operating profit increased million over  however  excluding a million reorganization charge in  thermogas profits increased million over incremental profits from the emro operations  acquired in september  accounted for most of the million increase 
westpan s profits increased million over as higher prices and a increase in condensate volumes more than offset a ngl volume decrease 
ngl and condensate prices increased and per barrel  respectively  and subsidy costs were lower 
transportation s operating profit decreased million from due to a decrease in revenues coupled with higher operating expenses 
excluding reorganization charges of million in  transportation s operating profit was comparable to transportation revenues were million lower in principally because of lower demethanized mix shipments to the gulf coast caused by decreased ethane recoveries 
transportation expenses increased million due to higher depreciation and employee benefit costs and a million reorganization charge  however  these costs were largely offset by decreased power and other expenses 
petroleum segment results petroleum segment operating profit increased million over  however  excluding a million charge in related to the state royalty oil settlement and an million favorable crude pricing settlement in  operating profit decreased million 
the decrease in operating profit was primarily attributable to lower margins and higher expenses at both the memphis and north pole refineries and lower retail marketing profits 
margins decreased per barrel at the memphis refinery primarily because higher crude costs more than offset the increases in refined product sales prices 
the lower memphis margins accounted for million of the million operating profit decrease 
expenses at the memphis refinery increased million because of a a million charge to write off surplus and obsolete equipment following the turnaround in  b a million charge to relocate tulsa based employees to memphis and c higher than normal maintenance expense during the four months prior to the start of the turnaround 
margins at the north pole refinery decreased per barrel because average crude costs increased during while product sales prices averaged close to amounts 
excluding the charge in related to the state royalty oil settlement and the positive impact of the crude pricing settlement in  expenses at the north pole refinery increased million primarily due to higher utility costs 
retail marketing s operating profit decreased million primarily due to higher labor and advertising costs 
coal segment results coal segment operating profit decreased million  however  excluding the million charge associated with applying sfas no 
 coal s operating profit increased million over the improvement reflects increased sales volumes and reduced costs at the martiki and pontiki mines 
production increased at the martiki mine because of lower overburden stripping ratios which resulted from moving mining operations to a new reserve area during and from the installation of new equipment 
pontiki s productivity increase reflects the installation of new mining equipment and improved employee morale 
the productivity improvements at martiki and pontiki were the principal reasons for the decrease in costs at both mines 
results compared to operating profit by segment was as follows in millions year ended december  natural gas liquids petroleum coal natural gas liquids segment results the million increase in operating profit is primarily attributable to million contributed by the emro operations which were acquired in and an increase in transportation operating profit 
transportation operating profit improved because revenue increases exceeded higher operating costs 
increases in transportation s revenues and operating expenses are described in the income statement section on page 
excluding the incremental operating profit from emro  retail propane operating profit decreased million as a result of warmer weather and operating fewer stores 
petroleum segment results petroleum segment operating profit decreased million 
a million charge related to the state royalty oil settlement accounted for most of the change 
the remaining million decrease was primarily attributable to lower refinery margins at the north pole refinery 
increased competition and a weaker alaska market were the principal reasons for the lower north pole refined product margins 
coal segment results coal segment operating profit decreased million primarily due to higher production costs at the dotiki  pattiki  pontiki and martiki mines 
these higher costs were partially offset by the positive impact on operating profit of higher production and sales volumes at the mettiki mine  higher average sales prices in which resulted from index driven contract price increases and two new sales contracts 
numerous equipment failures contributed to higher production costs at pontiki 
martiki s higher costs were attributable to increased overburden removal costs associated with higher stripping ratios during dotiki s and pattiki s higher production costs were primarily due to increased depreciation and reduced productivity 
environmental issues estimated liabilities for environmental costs  primarily in the petroleum segment  were determined independently of any potential claims for recovery 
estimated liabilities for environmental matters were million and million at december   and  respectively 
receivables recorded in connection with laws permitting reimbursement by the states of certain expenses associated with underground storage tank containment problems and repairs were million and million at december   and  respectively 
other issues natural gas liquids segment in response to new plant connections and increased shipper demands  mapco natural gas liquids constructed an million loop of its four corners pipeline 
the mile  inch pipeline extends from the four corners area in northwest new mexico to hobbs  new mexico  and was completed in december the new pipeline has a capacity of thousand barrels per day 
in november  juarez pipeline company a subsidiary of mid america pipeline company  amoco rio grande pipeline company and navajo southern inc announced the formation of a joint venture under the name  rio grande pipeline company rio grande 
rio grande will transport ngls from mid america pipeline s hobbs station in texas and other mid america pipeline origins to the pemex gas y petroquimica basica pemex mendez terminal in ciudad juarez  mexico 
the mexican customer purchasing the ngls will be pmi trading company 
the joint venture will connect with the thousand mile mid america pipeline ngl system by purchasing an existing inch line from navajo pipeline company running from west of odessa  texas  to near el paso  texas  then construct a new inch pipeline connecting it to the pemex terminal in ciudad juarez 
the joint venture will also construct additional facilities at the terminal to efficiently receive incoming shipments 
rio grande will be operated by mid america pipeline company and first shipments on the new pipeline system are planned for late in january  thermogas company  a wholly owned subsidiary of mapco natural gas liquids inc  announced that it had signed an agreement to sell its iowa propane and liquid fertilizer assets to cenex inc the transaction  which is expected to be completed by march   also involves the sale to cenex inc of the remaining thermogas liquid fertilizer assets in arkansas  illinois  indiana  minnesota  ohio and wisconsin 
sales and operating revenues for the assets involved in this transaction were million  million and million in  and  respectively  and operating profit was estimated to be million for each of the years  and this transaction is discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements 
since  mapco s west panhandle field gas supplier has taken more than its percentage ownership share of the field s production 
the cumulative effect of this acceleration in gas taken has resulted in the westpan operations having a billion cubic feet and million over take position 
this imbalance will be offset by limiting gas taken from future field production 
mapco anticipates that its gas supplier s allocation of natural gas will be severely curtailed after which will negatively impact mapco s ngl production from the west panhandle field 
mapco uses the sales method of accounting for its gas balancing arrangements which allows recognition of all revenues on ngls sold 
the acceleration in gas taken contributed an estimated million  million  and million to mapco s consolidated operating profit in  and  respectively 
on april   a liquefied petroleum gas explosion occurred near an underground salt dome storage facility near brenham  texas and owned by an affiliate of the company  seminole pipeline company 
the matter was investigated by the national transportation safety board and the texas railroad commission 
a discussion of this matter and its effect on mapco is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
petroleum segment during  certain capital improvements were made to the memphis refinery 
these improvements are expected to increase margins and operating profit by million to million per year through an increase in jet production combined with other enhancements 
since  mapco alaska petroleum inc and or its predecessor has had long term agreements with the state of alaska the state to purchase royalty oil from the state at prices linked to amounts payable by north slope oil producers in satisfaction of their royalty obligations to the state 
in  the state commenced suit against the producers in an action entitled state of alaska v 
amerada hess  et al 
alleging that the producers incorrectly calculated their royalty payments 
after a successful settlement with the producers  the state then claimed monies due from mapco alaska petroleum 
mapco alaska petroleum settled this dispute with the state in a discussion of the settlement is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
coal segment in january  mapco announced that it had signed a letter of intent with beacon to form a limited liability company which will own substantially all of the net assets of mapco s coal segment 
beacon will own percent of the new company and mapco will own percent 
the transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this matter 
in january  mettiki coal corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of mapco coal inc  finalized negotiations on a new coal supply contract with virginia electric and power company vepco  a major customer of the mettiki mine 
the year agreement to provide million annual tons begins in january and will replace the current contract with vepco to supply million annual tons which expires at the end of the coal segment has significant long term contracts at sales prices above current spot market prices 
in addition to the vepco contract discussed above  a long term contract for million annual tons expired in and contracts for and million annual tons will expire in and  respectively 
in  million annual tons will be subject to market price adjustments 
mapco coal s wholly owned subsidiary  webster county coal corporation webster county  owned and operated the retiki coal mine 
the retiki mine has always operated under a cost plus management fee contract with big rivers whereby the production from the retiki mine was sold exclusively to big rivers 
webster county s contract with big rivers was scheduled to expire in january in january  webster county entered into a partial settlement agreement agreement with big rivers that closed the retiki mine 
under the terms of the agreement  mapco coal delivered from alternative sources the tons that would have been delivered from retiki during the remaining term of the cost plus management fee contract 
webster county and big rivers have litigated the payment responsibility for certain costs associated with the operation of the retiki mine  which big rivers has disputed 
the trial was conducted in october and november of  with a verdict expected from the presiding judge late in or the first half of management believes that webster county will prevail in this litigation and that all  or substantially all  of the net receivable associated with the disputed costs will be collected 
operations at the retiki mine contributed less than of mapco s consolidated operating profit during and the clean air act is expected to alter the pattern of united states coal consumption resulting in a general decrease in demand for high sulfur coals and an increase in demand for low sulfur coals 
legislation of this type is not expected to materially impact the coal segment s future operating profits primarily because most of mapco coal s higher sulfur coals are sold to customers with scrubbers or to customers that have indicated an intention to install scrubbers 
additionally  mapco coal s management believes the anticipated strength of the low sulfur and compliance coal markets should offset any financial impact to mapco related to the clean air act
