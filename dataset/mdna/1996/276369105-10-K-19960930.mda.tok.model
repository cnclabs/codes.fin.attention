new management has increased the company s focus on growth and expansion through strategic acquisitions within the eastern united states 
management is focused on furthering the company s transition to a solid waste management company and believes that the company s resources will best be utilized in that capacity 
the company s goal is to expand its current disposal facilities and its long haul transportation operations and landfill and hauling operations through acquisitions 
the company s landfill revenues are comprised primarily of disposal fees charged directly to third parties or through the company s hauling operations 
the company s revenues from its hauling operations consist of transportation and disposal fees from residential  commercial and industrial customers 
cost of revenues consist primarily of direct labor and the related taxes and benefits  fuel  maintenance and repairs of equipment and facilities  subcontracted transportation and equipment rental charges  tipping fees paid to third party landfills  landfill fees and taxes  amortization of capitalized direct landfill development costs and accruals for future landfill closure and post closure costs

the following table presents the percentage each item in the consolidated statements of income bears to total revenues relating to continuing operations 
fiscal years ended june revenues cost of revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating loss other expense income loss before income taxes from continuing operations income taxes benefit net loss from continuing operations depreciation and amortization included in above costs revenues revenues decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the most significant factor affecting the decrease in revenues was the closure at june  of the company s unprofitable collection operation in beaufort county  south carolina which resulted in a decrease in revenue of  as compared to the prior year 
additionally  revenue increases of  or at the company s west virginia landfill were offset by declines in revenues of  or   or  and  or  respectively  at the company s south carolina landfill  kentucky landfill  and the company s long haul transportation operations 
no revenues have been generated by the illinois landfill 
the decrease in the south carolina landfill s revenues reflects an increase of in disposal revenues  offset by decreased subcontracted hauling services with improved sales integration with the company s long haul transportation operations and continued growth in the landfill based roll off collection operations 
this disposal revenue volume growth included a increase in construction and demolition debris volumes partially offset by a and decrease in acceptance of asbestos and paper products  respectively  in fiscal the disposal revenue increase at this facility  especially within the construction and demolition debris waste stream  reflects an increase in marketing and sales efforts with contractors and directly with waste generators 
the company s west virginia landfill s revenues included a  or increase in municipal solid waste msw revenues  an decline in asbestos revenues  and a near increase in construction and demolition debris  contaminated soils  sludges and other industrial waste streams 
the increase in msw relates directly to a increase in volume reflective of the increase in availability of msw as certain privately and municipally owned landfills continue to close as a result of an inability for these facilities to comply with the federal subtitle d regulations and state regulations requiring more sophisticated liner systems and an increase in msw disposal rates and the company s efforts in transfer station operations 
the west virginia public service commission psc approved a new tariff relating to msw fees pursuant to a rate case filed by the company which on july  allowed for an increase in the msw rate the company may charge from per ton to per ton which was consistent for fiscal and the increase in contaminated soils and sludges and other industrial waste streams is directly related to an aggressive marketing and sales campaign to attract waste streams which the landfill was not allowed to accept prior to installing the more sophisticated liner system which commenced accepting waste on july  management expects continued landfill closures in its market territory during fiscal revenue growth at the west virginia landfill and disposal revenue growth at the south carolina landfill was offset by a or  decline in revenues at the company s kentucky landfill 
as a result  monthly revenues at the company s kentucky facility have been reduced in several incremental steps since january   to the fiscal level of approximately  per month 
as of june   the company ceased placing waste in the disposal area and commenced operations of a newly permitted transfer station 
the transfer station attempted to assure that the municipal solid waste disposal needs of the local communities served under the company s ten year waste disposal franchise would continue to be satisfied on a monthly basis until the expansion permit could be secured and the first disposal cell constructed 
the company operated the transfer station at a revenue level of approximately  per month thus assuming continued operating losses at this facility through june  a draft permit from the kentucky natural resources and environmental protection cabinet was received on may  to construct the kentucky landfill s expansion area 
this draft permit is currently under adjudicatory appeal 
on july   the company ceased operating the transfer station to minimize operating losses and in cooperation with local authorities directed the waste streams under the pulaski grading  kentucky franchise agreement to a non affiliated waste company placing the company waste disposal franchise in abeyance until the company receives its final permit and constructs its initial disposal cell 
revenues from the company s long haul transportation operations decreased by  or to  in the decrease in revenues in the company s long haul transportation operations were impacted by the severe weather conditions in the third quarter ended march   but partially offset by increased involvement in hauling soils and lead contaminated construction and demolition debris which typically carries a more favorable profit margin than other waste hauling services 
the company generated revenues of  in hauling and disposal of lead contaminated construction and demolition debris as compared to  in the prior year 
management is currently focusing on temporarily utilizing non affiliated landfills for disposal of waste as management focuses on acquisitions of additional disposal facilities which geographically compliment the company s long haul transportation markets and on hauling certain freight commodities to minimize empty miles  increase market share  gross revenues and overall profitability 
total revenues increased  or from to this overall increase was the result of increased revenues of  or at the company s south carolina landfill offset by declines in revenues of  or   or  and  or  respectively  at the company s west virginia landfill  kentucky landfill  and the company s hauling operations 
the noted increases in south carolina were directly related to improved sales and marketing efforts 
the decrease in revenues at the company s kentucky landfill was directly related to the self imposed volume limitations discussed above 
cost of revenues and gross profit cost of revenues in fiscal decreased from fiscal by approximately  or to  cost of revenues as a percent of revenues increased from in to in this increase is largely the result of several unusual charges including an additional operating charge of  to accrue for certain closure and post closure monitoring costs relating to the kentucky landfill see further discussions below 
excluding the above noted unusual items in fiscal and the below noted unusual items in fiscal  cost of revenues as a percent of revenues decreased from in to in this percentage decrease was due primarily to the closure at june  of the company s unprofitable hauling operations in beaufort county  south carolina  a decrease in labor costs at the west virginia landfill with the reduction in asbestos handling and cost efficiencies of increased integration of the south carolina landfill with the company s long haul transportation company 
these positive developments were partially offset by relatively fixed operating costs with current average waste acceptances of approximately of allowable waste acceptance volume in fiscal and increased leachate management costs due to the severe weather in the third quarter at the company s west virginia landfill 
increased waste disposal costs to non affiliated landfills were also incurred to increase logistic efficiencies at the company s long haul transportation company 
during fiscal  the board of directors of the company made a decision to exit the beaufort county  south carolina local waste collection business as a result of limited integration with the company s landfill and continued operating losses resulting from significant competitive pressures 
this business was sold in fiscal through several asset sale transactions with certain assets transferred to the company s south carolina landfill

income taxes the company s effective income tax rate  including both federal and state taxes  was for fiscal with no tax benefit recorded in the current year 
the effective tax rate for the prior year is less than the federal and state statutory rates primarily due to a valuation allowance recorded reducing the current and prior year tax benefit of net operating loss carryforwards due to a lack of certainty of realization of these loss carryforwards in future years as a result of recent historic reported operating losses 
liquidity and capital resources at june   current liabilities of  exceeded current assets of  which includes cash and cash equivalents of  the company recorded a  net reduction in short and long term debt  realized  of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock  and increased accounts payable and accrued expenses by  largely as a result of accrued costs relating to the company s change in control 
a significant portion of working capital expended during the period  approximately  was used to fund the acquisition of property and equipment  including  related to the permitting and development of landfill space and  for the purchase of operating equipment

on the date of closing  a portion of this facility was utilized to refinance the remaining balance of the first union term loan and the corestates revolving credit facility 
at the company s option  the interest rate on any loan under the revolving credit facility will be based on an adjusted prime rate or eurodollar rate  as defined in the agreement

the company will have material financial obligations related to closure and post closure costs at its landfills 
while the exact amount of these future obligations cannot be determined  the company estimates that the costs for final closure of the currently permitted areas at the west virginia and kentucky landfills  if all acreage is used  will be approximately  of which  has been accrued as of june  the company estimates that the costs of post closure monitoring of groundwater  methane gas and other required procedures for the currently permitted areas will approximate  to  per year for years after closure at each of its kentucky and west virginia sites 
as of june   the company has accrued  for post closure obligations representing of the present value of such future estimated cash outlay 
the company recognizes these costs either on the unit of production method based on consumed airspace as the landfills are filled or as a function of time  depending on the circumstances under which the permitted landfill is permitted to operate 
the company recently initiated the accrual of closure and post closure costs for its south carolina landfill on a similar basis as for its other landfills as a result of recently proposed state regulations

the amounts are approximated at  for closure and  for post closure 
proposed changes to the current kentucky post closure financial assurance regulations are pending and the post closure requirements could increase to  under the current financial assurance program  incremental posting of financial assurance over the life of the facility as disposal cells are constructed and certified for acceptance of waste is allowed 
the company s inability to continue to obtain bonds or letters of credit in sufficient amounts or at acceptable rates would have a material adverse impact on the company s business and may preclude it from obtaining or retaining landfill operating permits 
inflation  seasonality and prevailing economic conditions inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operations to date 
since the company has few long term fixed price contracts  the company believes it should be able to continue to pass through to its customers most cost increases resulting from inflation 
the level of renovation  construction and demolition activity affects the company s operations and is typically higher in the spring and summer months 
the company s municipal solid waste operations are less influenced by seasonality and these operations have grown as a percentage of the company s business during and as the company expands and its waste streams continue to diversify  the company expects the seasonality of its revenues to diminish
