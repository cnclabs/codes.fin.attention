important factors that may cause the company s actual results to differ from such forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below 
the company s future results are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties 
the company s business and results of operations depend in significant part upon capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors  which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products incorporating semiconductors 
historically  the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of over supply  which often have had a severe effect on the semiconductor industry s demand for capital expenditures  including systems manufactured and marketed by the company 
the company believes that the markets for newer generations of semiconductors will also be subject to similar fluctuations 
also  the recent high rate of technical innovation and resulting improvements in the performance and price of semiconductor devices  which have driven much of the demand for the company s products  could slow  or encounter limits  in the future 
in addition  any other factor adversely affecting the semiconductor industry or particular segments within the semiconductor industry may adversely effect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
additional risks and uncertainties include competitive pressures on selling prices  inventory management  including suppliers ability meet the company s needs in a timely manner  the timing and cancellation of customer orders  changes in product mix  the company s ability to introduce new products and technologies on a timely basis  the company s ability to increase its manufacturing capacity to meet increased demand while maintaining satisfactory levels of product quality  service levels  and timeliness of deliveries  rapid technological change and introduction of products and technologies by the company s competitors  market acceptance of the company s and its competitors products  the level of orders received which can be shipped in a quarter  and the timing of investments in engineering and development 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  the company may experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect its business  financial condition  operating results and stock price
