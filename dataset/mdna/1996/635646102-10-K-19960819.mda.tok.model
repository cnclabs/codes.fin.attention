liquidity and capital resources the company s tangible assets are highly liquid  but subject to market price fluctuation  with more than consisting of cash or assets readily convertible into cash principally firm securities positions  receivables from brokers and cash 
the company s operations have generally been financed by internally generated funds and capital contributions 
in addition  margin account borrowings are available to the company from its clearing brokers 
the company s broker dealer subsidiaries  sherwood securities  ndb and equitrade  are subject to the minimum net capital requirement of the sec which is designed to measure the general financial soundness and liquidity of brokers 
as of may   sherwood securities  ndb and equitrade had approximately   and  in excess of the minimum required net capital requirements  respectively  representing increases of  for sherwood securities   for ndb and  for equitrade from the prior year 
the net capital rule imposes financial restrictions upon sherwood securities  ndb s and equitrade s businesses which are more severe than those imposed on most other businesses 
cash flows from operations vary on a daily basis as the company s portfolio of marketable securities changes 
the company s ability to convert marketable securities owned is determined by the depth of the market and the size of the company s security positions in relation to the market as a whole 
the portfolio mix also affects the regulatory capital requirements imposed on sherwood securities  ndb and equitrade which directly affects the amount of funds available for operating  investing and financing activities

larkin company  inc  a minority owned broker dealer

larkin company  inc in december  the company announced it would buy back up to  shares of the company s common stock from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 
through may    shares had been repurchased  of which  were repurchased during fiscal the source of funds for these purchases was internally generated 
sherwood securities  ndb s and equitrade s excess net capital are deemed adequate by management for their present operations and currently anticipated future expansion 
effects of inflation the company s assets are not significantly affected by inflation because they are primarily monetary in nature 
management believes that replacement costs of furniture  equipment and leasehold improvements will not materially affect operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects the company s principal expenses such as employee benefits and compensation  rent and communication  which may not be readily recoverable from increased revenues 
due to market forces and competitive conditions in the securities industry  a broker dealer may be unable to unilaterally increase spreads and commissions in order to recover increased costs related to inflation 
consequently  the company must rely on increased volume for this purpose 
however  the company has significant cash balances on deposit with its principal clearing broker which  in the event there are higher interest rates  would offset some of the costs
