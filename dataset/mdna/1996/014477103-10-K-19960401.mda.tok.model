item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general most of the company s processing consists of aluminum  magnesium and zinc tolled for its customers 
to a lesser extent  the company also purchases scrap metal and dross for processing and resale 
both the company s tolling fees and the selling price of metal it buys  recycles and sells for its own account are included in sales revenue 
accordingly  tolling business produces a lower amount of revenues and cost of sales than does the buy sell business 
variations in the mix of these two businesses can cause revenues to change significantly from period to period while not significantly affecting gross profit  because both types of transactions generally have the same gross profit per pound of metal processed 
as a result  the company considers processing volume to be a more important determinant of performance than revenues 
during the early s there was an excess of primary aluminum produced worldwide  and aluminum inventories on the worldwide commodity exchanges were at record levels  peaking in january this glut of aluminum was primarily responsible for causing aluminum prices to decline throughout this time period  and prices in january were at inflation adjusted historical lows 
this situation impacted the profitability of the major aluminum producers who are some of the company s largest customers 
this environment of low profitability for the company s customers also had a negative impact on the company s gross margin  as it had been unable to pass cost increases through to its customers 
in early  worldwide inventories began falling for a number of reasons  including an increase in demand for aluminum  particularly in the united states  and prices for aluminum began to rise 
this increase in pricing for aluminum had a positive effect on the company in both in its buy sell business where the company received increased prices for the aluminum it owned  and in its tolling business where certain increases in price for tolling services provided by the company were obtained 
during  worldwide aluminum prices declined from their levels  particularly in the fourth quarter 
for the year ended december   this decline was more than offset by increased processing volumes 
however  in the first quarter of  the combination of higher energy costs  lower aluminum prices and weather related disruptions which affected volumes processed  negatively impacted the company s results 
it is not possible to predict the future price of aluminum or the level of worldwide inventories of aluminum and whether  or to what extent  such factors will affect the company s future business 
the following table shows the total pounds of material processed aluminum  magnesium and zinc  the percentage of total pounds processed represented by tolled aluminum  purchased aluminum  magnesium and zinc  total revenues  total gross profits and gross profit percentages in thousands  except percentages pounds processed    percent of total pounds processed tolled aluminum purchased aluminum magnesium zinc revenues    gross profit    gross profit less than percent results of operations fiscal year vs 
fiscal year the company processed billion pounds of metal in which represented an increase of over the billion pounds processed in increases from the bedford and metal mark plants acquired late in  and the loudon plant which was acquired in september of and expanded in  along with increased volume from all plant locations  accounted for the favorable variances 
revenues in were  which represented an increase of over s revenue of  the percentage increase in revenues was greater than the increase in volumes processed because the amount of buy sell business was greater in compared to assuming that metal mark maintains its approximate one to one historical ratio of tolling to buy sell business  the company s revenues are projected to continue to outpace the relative gains in processing volumes in because of the full year s effect of the metal mark business 
gross profit of  was above the  reported in most of this resulted from the increased pounds processed 
selling  general and administrative costs increased to  compared to the  reported in this increase occurred because of the addition of key personnel required to manage the company s rapid growth and because of selling  general and administrative costs associated with acquisitions carried out during the year 
interest expense was about the same in as it was in  while interest income rose to  compared to  in this increase was due to larger amounts of cash invested 
the company s income before taxes of  rose compared to in the company recorded nonrecurring litigation expense related to a lawsuit which reduced s income before taxes by  excluding this item  s increase would have been about or very similar to the increases recorded in volume processed and gross profits 
the company s increased income before tax and higher tax rates caused income tax expense to rise to  compared to  in the effective tax rate was about in compared to in fiscal year vs 
fiscal year the company processed billion pounds in  a increase over the million pounds of material it processed in most of this increase was due to increased processing at the uhrichsville plant  which reached full capacity during mid year and was expanded by in september processing from the corona plant acquired in december and loudon which was acquired in september of also were significant contributors to the increased volume of metal processed in in addition  all of the company s other plants processed more metal in than they did in revenues of  were higher than revenues of  the percentage increase in revenues was somewhat higher than the percentage increase in processing pounds  mostly because aluminum prices in were higher than in  which resulted in higher revenues from the company s buy sell business 
gross profit of  increased over s amount of  more than of this increase was due to greater volumes of material processed 
the remainder of the gross profit increase in compared to was a result of increases in revenue exceeding increases in costs 
the revenue increase was largely a result of increases in the buy sell business which  as noted above  benefited from rising aluminum prices in the increased costs were mostly concentrated in workers compensation  medical  and refuse disposal costs 
selling  general and administrative costs increased above s amount to  most of the increase is attributed to additional employees required by the company s growth  and improvements to the operating information system  which improved efficiency  also increased the costs in this category 
as reported during  the company incurred nonrecurring litigation costs of  which represented the cost of settling certain litigation and associated legal costs related to a partnership which owned shares of the company s stock 
the company agreed to the settlement without admitting liability in order to avoid prolonged and costly litigation 
the plaintiffs released all claims against the company and its subsidiaries  and the company received the preferred stock of a subsidiary whose ownership had been disputed 
interest expense of  was about higher than s amount 
most of this difference was due to interest on the additional borrowings related to the acquisition of loudon 
interest income of  decreased over compared to lower levels of cash to invest  principally because of capital spending and acquisitions  are the reasons for this result 
income before taxes of  increased above s level of  the effective tax rate rose to in compared with in increased state income tax amounts in and an increase in federal tax rates from to caused by reaching a threshold level of income requiring this increase were the reasons for the increase in the rate 
liquidity and capital resources operations provided cash of  in  compared with  of cash provided by operations in increased earnings as previously discussed and increases in other noncash charges such as depreciation and deferred taxes along with a reduction in working capital excluding that attributed to acquisitions in compared to an increase in were the factors leading to the increase in cash provided from operations 
working capital excluding that attributed to acquisitions decreased  in which represented a source of cash while it increased  in the decrease in was principally the result of reductions in accounts receivable which had increased in at december   the company s current ratio of was similar to the december  ratio of 
the company s working capital requirements may increase in due to an anticipated higher level of processing pounds 
capital spending  excluding acquisitions  amounted to  in and  in the new salt cake processing facility and new landfill both at the morgantown facility accounted for the largest items in spending in was largely related to the expansion of the uhrichsville plant 
the acquisition of bedford and metal mark required  in while the acquisition of loudon required approximately  in in order to take advantage of expansion opportunities and in connection with the acquisition of bedford and metal mark  the company borrowed  in september under terms it had previously negotiated with a commercial lending institution 
this variable rate converting revolving loan has an amortization of five years and bears interest at a fluctuating rate  currently set at 
in addition  in november the company borrowed  of unsecured debt which represents half of the commitment the company received from a private placement of notes 
the remaining half  or  is anticipated to be issued in the second quarter of to fund the company s investment in the vaw imco venture 
the notes issued in have a fixed interest rate set at per annum and require mandatory annual prepayments of  beginning in the notes to be issued in will have their interest rate set when they are issued 
in the company also borrowed  under a five year term note the term note to fund the repayment of certain debt assumed in connection with the loudon acquisition 
also in  the company increased its borrowing limit up to  under a restated revolving credit facility the revolving facility 
under the revolving facility  the company has a subfacility for the issuance of standby letters of credit  the amount available for borrowing is based on the company s working capital as defined 
at year end  and at march   the company had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving facility 
capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment in are currently estimated to total approximately  the company believes that its cash on hand  the resources available under the terms of its credit facilities and anticipated cash from operations should provide the financial resources necessary to fund its current needs and to meet its obligations in and for the foreseeable future
