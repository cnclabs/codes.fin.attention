item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations fiscal years   and compared general fiscal marked a significant change in the operations of qms and represented a turnaround year for the company 
net income of million on net sales of million was achieved for fiscal compared to a net loss of million in fiscal and net income of million in fiscal on net sales of million and million  respectively 
the fiscal results validated the effectiveness of business strategies implemented at the beginning of the year and should position the company for continued revenue and earnings growth and improved stockholder value 
the first element of the company s fiscal strategy was to refinance its short and long term debt 
during the first quarter  the company completed the transactions associated with the divestiture of its operations in europe  australia  and japan 
the proceeds from the international restructuring were used to reduce overall debt levels and allowed the company to enter into an agreement with foothill capital corporation which provides the company with up to million through a four year credit facility 
the proceeds from this new credit facility were used to repay in full all amounts owed by the company under its previous revolving credit agreement and also to repay portions of other long term debt that existed at the end of fiscal although the divested subsidiary operations are no longer reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the company  qms recognizes substantial benefits from the ongoing relationships with the new owners of these operations 
agreements are in place whereby the company sells printer controllers and components at cost to these international distributors and then receives a commission from their sales of qms products 
as a result  the company realizes an income stream from these international operations without the burden of carrying their fixed costs 
the second phase of the company s strategy for fiscal was to reduce overall costs and bring them in line with revenues 
this was accomplished through several avenues including divestitures  reductions in work force  restructuring employee benefit programs  executive salary reductions  and aggressive cost management 
total operating expenses for fiscal decreased to million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal million  or of net sales  excluding restructuring charges and million  or of net sales  in fiscal with this reduced cost structure in place  the company was able to achieve profitability based on significantly lower revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal years and the third part of the company s strategy for fiscal was to return the company to sustainable revenue and earnings growth 
achievement of this goal was demonstrated by the company reporting net income during all four quarters of fiscal in addition  the company introduced several significant new products during fiscal  including the qms r print system  a page per minute monochrome printer with an available copier option  the qms magicolor r wx  a color laser workgroup printer for windows r environments  and the qms magicolor cx  a color laser printer which delivers dpi photographic quality images  document control  and network features 
in october  the company introduced the qms hammerhead r  a page per minute monochrome printer with graphic arts capabilities 
these new products  combined with a new sales and marketing management team which was brought on board beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  should allow the company to effectively compete in domestic and international markets 
with a lowered cost structure in place  adequate borrowing capacity available under the foothill credit facility  and the above new product introductions  as well as the implementation of strategies for entering the graphic arts and digital imaging markets  the company s strategic plan for fiscal is to continue innovative product introductions  concentrate on business fundamentals including further reductions of debt and operating expenses  focus on core competencies  and enter into and grow new markets and businesses 
the net result of this plan is to improve stockholder value 
net sales table of net sales comparisons for key channels year to year net sales increases decreases in thousands us direct      us service      us reseller     europe australia      japan     qms canada      qms circuits    all other     total      total sales declined by million  or  during fiscal compared to a decline of million  or  during fiscal the primary reason for the significant decline in total sales in fiscal is that sales of million during fiscal attributable to divested subsidiaries and sales of million during fiscal relating to the color thermal transfer consumables business which was sold at the end of fiscal were no longer available to the company in fiscal the us direct sales channel sells the higher end of the company s product offerings and consumables to major corporate accounts 
generally  product gross margins and the cost of distribution are higher in this channel than in the reseller channel 
during fiscal  the us direct sales operations resulted in a net sales decrease of  which compares to a net sales decrease of during fiscal during fiscal  million  or  of net sales in this channel was attributable to sales of color thermal transfer consumables which are no longer available to the company 
excluding this effect  the net sales decline during fiscal would have been 
turnover in sales and marketing personnel during fiscal and the first nine months of fiscal contributed to the sales declines in both years 
the company has addressed this issue with the addition of a new sales and marketing management team which joined the company beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal the principal members of this new management team have extensive experience in the non impact printing and digital imaging industry  several of whom were previously employed by the company and have rejoined qms bringing knowledge of qms products  markets  and distribution channels 
revenue improvements in the direct sales channel are anticipated with this new sales and marketing team in place combined with an emphasis in introducing new high end  value added products into this market  such as the qms magicolor cx and the qms ex print systems  which were introduced during fiscal  and the recent introduction of the qms hammerhead printer  which facilitates the company s penetration into the graphic arts market 
the us service channel supports the sale of qms products through a nationwide field service organization 
service contracts are generally written for the higher end of the company s product offerings  which are sold through the us direct sales channel  however  in addition to qms products  the service organization services products sold by other manufacturers 
the us service business realized a net sales gain of in fiscal compared to a gain of in fiscal this decrease in year to year improvement is directly related to the sales decline in the us direct sales channel from fiscal to  however  the decline resulting from that channel was more than offset by increases in service revenues from non qms manufactured products 
the us reseller channel is responsible for attracting and qualifying resellers of the lower end of the company s product line 
generally  gross margins and distribution costs are lower in this sales channel than in the direct sales channel 
the us reseller channel net sales for fiscal increased only slightly from fiscal and declined nearly for fiscal from fiscal during fiscal  million  or  of net sales in this channel was attributable to sales of color thermal transfer consumables which are no longer available to the company 
excluding the effect of these revenues  reseller sales would have increased during fiscal by 
during fiscal  sales volumes in this channel declined because of the turnover in sales and marketing management as discussed above and extreme competitive pressures 
qms europe bv and qms australia pty ltd 
were sold to jalak investment bv  effective the beginning of fiscal the company continues to sell controller boards and components to the new owner of these businesses at cost and then realizes a commission on their sales of qms products to third parties 
as a result of this change in business operations  net sales through these channels are significantly lower in fiscal  with sales to the new qms europe bv of million  compared to sales of million and million by the wholly owned subsidiaries qms europe bv and qms australia pty ltd 
in fiscal years and  respectively 
although the net third party sales of qms europe bv and qms australia pty ltd 
are no longer included in the consolidated financial statements  the entire operating expense structure of these businesses has also been eliminated 
the assets of qms japan kk were divested at the beginning of fiscal the company continues to sell controller boards and components to the new owner of the business at cost and then realizes a commission on their sales of qms products to third parties 
for the same reasons described above for qms europe australia  there are significantly lower net sales through this channel in fiscal  with sales to the new qms japan kk of million  compared to sales of million and million by the wholly owned subsidiary qms japan in fiscal years and  respectively 
qms canada  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary with principal operations in toronto and montreal  sells the entire line of company products  including service and accessories  directly to end users and through resellers 
net sales for qms canada declined by in fiscal and by in fiscal during fiscal  million  or  of net sales for qms canada was attributable to sales of color thermal transfer consumables which are no longer available to the company 
excluding the effect of these revenues  the net sales decline in fiscal would have been 
other reasons for the sales declines in fiscal years and are the same as noted for the us direct channel  as discussed above 
qms circuits  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary based in fort walton beach  florida  manufactures and markets printed circuit boards for the company and for third party sales 
during fiscal years   and  the company also sold magnum r controller boards  controller level products to original equipment manufacturers  and printer products into latin america 
gross profit gross profit dollars decreased by in fiscal  principally due to the lower sales volumes as previously discussed  however  as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased to in fiscal from in fiscal or excluding the effect of special charges totaling million 
gross profit dollars in fiscal included million attributable to the color thermal transfer consumables business for which the revenues are no longer available to the company 
excluding the effect of these revenues  gross profit dollars would have increased by during fiscal this improvement reflects a change in the product mix to an increased percentage of high margin service and consumables revenues and also the effects of manufacturing cost improvements that were implemented in fiscal the significant decline in gross profit dollars in fiscal is comprised of three main components special charges totaling million related to inventory obsolescence and write off of certain software costs  significant volume declines in the us direct and us reseller channels  and volume decreases in qms japan and qms canada 
operating expenses total operating expenses declined by million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal million  or  excluding restructuring charges and as a percentage of net sales declined to from excluding restructuring charges for the same periods 
these improvements are a direct result of eliminating the operating expense structure of the divested business operations and the effective cost reduction measures which were implemented as part of the restructuring which began during fiscal and continued throughout fiscal during fiscal  operating expenses increased million  or 
excluding restructuring charges  operating expenses decreased by million but  as a percentage of net sales  increased from in fiscal to in fiscal research and development expenses decreased by in fiscal compared to an increase of in fiscal the decrease in fiscal is the result of aggressive expense management and cost controls 
capitalized software costs totaled million  million  and million in fiscal years   and  respectively 
management believes that investment in product research and development is critical to the company s growth and competitive position in the marketplace and is directly related to the continued timely development of new  innovative  and value added products 
other income expense interest expense decreased in fiscal compared to a increase in fiscal the reduction in fiscal is directly related to the overall reduction in short and long term debt of million  or  during fiscal the increase in fiscal was the result of higher borrowing needs because of the operating losses that were experienced 
interest income increased in fiscal and is attributable to interest earned on the notes receivable from qms europe bv and qms japan kk

the company did not enter into any material foreign exchange contracts during fiscal years   or income taxes for fiscal  a benefit of of pretax income was recognized 
this benefit resulted from the carryback of losses in japan relating to the divestiture of business operations in that country 
no benefit or provision for income taxes was recognized for fiscal  and a provision of of pretax income was recognized for fiscal at september   the company had domestic operating loss carryovers and general business credit carryovers of approximately million and million  respectively  which expire in periods ranging from to see note recent audits by tax authorities in japan  the netherlands  canada  and the united states were all resolved with no adverse tax consequences 
fiscal years and forward are still subject to review 
factors which may affect future results the company s products include components primarily microprocessors and dynamic random access memory devices which  from time to time  are sensitive to market conditions that may result in limited availability and or price fluctuations 
an interruption in the supply of or significant changes in price for these components could have an adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company purchases print engine mechanisms and consumables from japanese suppliers 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will affect the prices of these products 
the company attempts to mitigate possible negative impacts through yen sharing arrangements with suppliers  foreign exchange contracts  and price negotiations  however  material price increases resulting from exchange rate fluctuations could develop which would adversely affect operating results 
because the company competes in an industry of rapid technological advancement  it is important that the company be able to develop innovative new technologies and leading edge print systems in a timely  cost effective manner 
the company has invested significantly in its crown r advanced document processing technology which  in addition to providing significantly improved functionality  is intended to reduce the time it takes to develop products 
the company has also invested significantly in digital imaging technology which manifests itself in the crownimage tm products  a suite of document imaging and document software which complements the qms line of monochrome and color laser printers 
new product introduction delays could  however  have an adverse impact on operating results 
these factors  including increasingly competitive pressures in the company s markets  along with others that may affect operating results  mean that past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance 
investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
in addition  the company participates in a highly dynamic industry  which can result in significant volatility of the company s common stock price 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were million at september  compared to million and million at the end of fiscal years and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal is a result of the cash management process with foothill  which includes direct application of cash receipts to pay down outstanding borrowings and a simple method of reborrowing cash to meet working capital requirements 
cash flow from operations was million for fiscal compared to million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
the company s financing for fiscal years   and came principally from cash flows from operations and borrowings under revolving credit agreements 
in addition  during fiscal  cash flows of million came from the divestiture of the business operations in europe and japan 
during fiscal  cash flows of million came from the sale of the color thermal transfer consumables business and million from short term bank borrowings 
the company s working capital was million at september   down from million and million at the end of fiscal years and  respectively 
the reduction of million during fiscal is principally the result of million less cash and cash equivalents due to the reasons described above  reductions in trade receivables of million  and reductions in inventories of million 
these reductions in current assets along with the increase in current liabilities principally the result of the reclassification of the revolving credit agreement and the senior secured notes payable  which totaled million at september  from long term debt to short term debt caused the decrease in working capital for fiscal these reclassifications were made to comply with issue no 
balance sheet classifications of borrowings outstanding under revolving credit agreements that include both a subjective acceleration clause and a lock box arrangement which was issued by the fasb emerging issues task force in november during fiscal  the company reduced its borrowings under revolving credit agreements and senior secured notes payable by million 
these reductions were directly related to using the cash proceeds received from the divestiture of business operations in europe and japan combined with the direct flow of cash receipts to foothill to pay down amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement 
total liabilities were reduced from million at the end of fiscal to million at the end of fiscal  representing a reduction of million  or 
at september   the company was not in compliance with certain covenants contained in the senior secured notes payable 
although the company has not received a waiver of the non compliance  the holder of these notes has not taken steps to accelerate repayment of this debt and it is management s belief that the status of this debt is unlikely to change 
the company has adequate borrowing capacity under the foothill credit facility under the second term loan to repay the senior secured notes in the unlikely event that repayment of the notes is accelerated 
the availability of this second term loan will expire on december  and  if not extended  management believes that adequate borrowing capacity will be available under the foothill credit facility to repay the amount outstanding under the senior secured notes payable 
management believes that the company s fiscal working capital and capital expenditure needs  as well as funding for research and development  will be met by cash flow from operations and by the foothill credit facility 
recently issued accounting standards as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company will be required to adopt statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of  for which management does not expect a material impact on the company s results of operations in the near future  and sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation  for which the only impact will be expanded disclosure requirements in fiscal inflation inflationary factors have not had a significant effect on the company s operations in the past three years 
a significant increase in inflation would adversely affect the company s operations
