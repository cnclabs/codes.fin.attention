item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  incorporated by reference in this report 
customers for the years ended september     and  revenues from agencies of the us federal government accounted for    and  respectively  of total revenues 
due to the amount of pass through costs see contracts below that may be incurred on construction and maintenance projects  it is not unusual for a client in the private sector to account for more than of revenues in any given year 
for the year ended september   two clients in the private sector accounted for and  respectively  of total revenues 
a different client accounted for and of total revenues in and  respectively 
no single client in the private sector accounted for or more of total revenues in or foreign operations for the years ended september     and  revenues from projects outside of north america were approximately    and  respectively  of total revenues 
for the year ended september   substantially all such revenues related to the company s offices in ireland 
beginning with the year ended september   such revenues relate primarily to the company s offices in the uk and ireland 
as discussed above  during fiscal  the company acquired a equity interest in the serete group headquartered in france 
the serete group has operations throughout europe  and executes projects for commercial clients in the chemicals  pharmaceuticals and semiconductor industries  as well as buildings and infrastructure projects for both commercial and governmental clients 
the company also has operations in india through its interest in an engineering and design firm specializing in projects for clients in the chemical  pharmaceuticals and petroleum refining markets 
the company has executed contracts jointly with the indian company  and expects to expand this activity in the future 
the company accounts for the indian company using the equity method 
contracts while there is considerable variation in the pricing provisions of the contracts undertaken by the company  they can generally be grouped into three broad categories cost reimbursable  guaranteed maximum price and fixed price 
the following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by these types of contracts during each of the five years ended september  cost reimbursable guaranteed maximum price fixed price in accordance with industry practice  most of the company s contracts are subject to termination at the discretion of the client 
contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of such termination 
when the company is directly responsible for engineering  design  procurement and construction of a project or the maintenance of a process plant  the company reflects the cost of materials  equipment and subcontracts in both revenues and costs 
on other projects  where the client elects to pay for such items directly  these amounts are not reflected in either revenues or costs 
the approximate amounts of such costs included in revenues for the years ended september     and totaled million  million  million   million and  million  respectively 
page cost reimbursable contracts cost reimbursable contracts provide for reimbursement of costs incurred by the company plus a predetermined fee  or a fee based on a percentage of the costs incurred 
the company prefers this type of contract since it believes that the primary basis for its selection should be its technical expertise and professional qualifications rather than price considerations 
guaranteed maximum price contracts guaranteed maximum price contracts are performed in the same manner as cost reimbursable contracts  however  the total actual cost plus the fee cannot exceed the guaranteed price negotiated with the client 
if the total actual cost of the contract exceeds the guaranteed maximum price  then the company will bear all or a portion of the excess 
in those cases where the total actual cost and fee are less than the guaranteed price  the company will often share the savings on a predetermined basis with the client 
fixed price contracts fixed price contracts include both negotiated fixed price contracts and lump sum bid contracts 
under a negotiated fixed price contract  the company is first selected as the contractor  and then the contract price is negotiated 
negotiated fixed price contracts frequently exist in single responsibility arrangements where the company has the opportunity to perform engineering and design work before negotiating the total price of the project 
under lump sum bid contracts  the company must bid against other contractors based upon specifications furnished by the client 
this type of pricing presents certain inherent risks  including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications  problems with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period  that are reduced by the negotiation process 
thus  although both types of contracts involve a firm price for the client  the lump sum bid contract provides the greater degree of risk to the company 
however  because of economies that may be realized during the contract term  both negotiated fixed price and lump sum bid contracts may offer greater profit potential than the other types of contracts 
competition the company is engaged in a highly competitive business 
some of its competitors are larger than the company  or are subsidiaries of larger companies  and may possess greater resources than the company 
furthermore  because the engineering aspect of the business does not usually require large amounts of capital  there is relative ease of market entry for a new potential entrant possessing acceptable professional qualifications 
accordingly  the company competes with both national and international firms in sizes ranging from very large to a wide variety of small  regional and specialty firms 
the extent of the company s competition varies according to the industries and markets it serves  as well as the regions in which the company is located 
the company s largest competitors for engineering  construction and maintenance services for process plants include such well known companies as bechtel group  inc  fluor corporation  foster wheeler corp  raytheon engineers  mw kellogg  parsons co  brown root  inc  and john brown 
in the semiconductor industry  the company s principal competitor is industrial design corporation
