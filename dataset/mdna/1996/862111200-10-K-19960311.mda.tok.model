item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain statements in the following discussions regarding the company s future product and business plans  financial results  performance and events are forward looking statements and are based on current expectations 
actual results may differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties  including the risks detailed below in risk factors that may affect future results 
general the company reported a net loss for the year ended december   of million on revenue of billion  compared to net income for the year ended december   of million on revenue of billion and a net loss for the year ended december   of million on revenue of billion 
the company s results include restructuring and other charges of million in  million in  and million in a million benefit was also recognized in from the cumulative effect of a change in the method of accounting for income taxes 
as more fully discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the company  through a wholly owned subsidiary  completed a merger with network systems corporation network systems on march  the merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests and  accordingly  the consolidated financial statements were restated for all periods prior to the merger to include the operations of network systems  adjusted to conform with storagetek s accounting policies and presentation 
revenue increased in compared to  primarily due to incremental sales revenue from the timberline timberline r track cartridge subsystem and the iceberg virtual storage facility iceberg r 
these increases were largely offset by a significant decline in revenue from midrange products  as well as lesser declines in revenue from older generation library and tape products and networking products 
the significant decline in revenue from midrange products was primarily due to the sale of substantially all of the company s midrange lease assets and midrange service business in the second and third quarter of  respectively 
as anticipated  revenue from older generation nearline r products  including the track tape cartridge subsystem  silverton track tape cartridge subsystem silverton  and automated cartridge system acs library  decreased in the decline in revenue from networking products reflects slower than expected market acceptance of the enterprise routing switch ers tm and other new internetworking products  coupled with declines in older mainframe channel extension networking products 
while revenue from iceberg increased for compared to  the rate of growth fell short of the company s expectations primarily due to continued price competition in the online marketplace  and slower than expected market acceptance 
revenue increased in compared to  primarily due to increased sales of silverton  iceberg  and the powderhorn powderhorn r  an acs library 
sales of the company s first generation acs library and track tape cartridge system declined in  as did sales of midrange products 
page page improvements in revenue and operating results during are significantly dependent upon successfully addressing development and distribution issues associated with the company s networking products  as well as the effective implementation of significant business restructuring activities initiated during the fourth quarter of in all parts of the company s business 
risk factors that may affect future results also include the continuing success of timberline  iceberg  silverton and powderhorn  successfully gaining market acceptance for the redwood sd redwood tm and the kodiak scalable storage facility kodiak tm  the successful introduction of planned technological improvements to these products  intense competition and pricing pressure in the online marketplace  and the introduction of new products by competitors  among others 
see risk factors that may affect future results  below 
the company s cash balances increased million during as cash generated from operations of was partially offset by net repayments of debt of million  and investments in property  plant and equipment of million 
the company s cash balances decreased million during primarily as a result of significant investments associated with new products and increased million during primarily as a result of proceeds from a preferred stock offering

the company also recognized incremental sales from timberline during the fourth quarter of sales of the acs library and track cartridge subsystem declined during incremental sales associated with timberline and redwood are expected to offset future declines in revenue from earlier generation nearline products 
redwood currently provides small computer system interface scsi support for multiple computing platforms 
future revenue contribution from redwood is significantly dependent upon the company s ability to deliver a version of the product which allows for the use of higher capacity tape cartridges 
while the company believes issues associated with the design and manufacture of higher capacity tape cartridges for redwood were resolved during the fourth quarter of  there can be no assurance that all redwood development issues have been successfully addressed or that the product will gain market acceptance in the future 
online products revenue from online products increased in compared to  primarily due to incremental sales of iceberg  which became available during the second quarter of while iceberg sales revenue increased during  the rate of revenue growth fell short of the company s expectations  primarily due to the rapid rate of price erosion in the online marketplace  and slower than expected customer acceptance of iceberg 
the company announced the commencement of initial shipments of kodiak in the third quarter of  however  the company received no significant revenue contribution from kodiak in revenue from online products increased in compared to  due to incremental sales of iceberg 
iceberg sales fell short of the company s expectations in  primarily as a result of lower than anticipated unit sales volume  smaller configuration sizes  price competition  as well as longer than anticipated customer evaluation and acceptance periods 
future revenue contribution from online products is significantly dependent upon successfully increasing production volumes of kodiak without significant engineering  design or manufacturing difficulties  as well as the timely introduction of additional functions and features for both iceberg and kodiak in the highly competitive online marketplace 
while the company believes the introduction and production schedules for these additional functions and features are achievable  there can be no assurance that the schedules will be met  or that these page page functions and features will result in additional market acceptance for iceberg and kodiak 
future revenue contribution from online products is also significantly dependent upon the rate of future price declines in the marketplace 
while worldwide demand for online storage capacity in the enterprise marketplace increased significantly in  this increase was largely offset by declines in the price per megabyte for storage 
networking products revenue from networking products decreased in compared to this decrease reflects anticipated declines in older mainframe channel extension networking products  coupled with slower than expected market acceptance of ers and other internetworking products which support communication between networks 
revenue and operating results associated with networking products were adversely affected by difficulties encountered with the integration of network systems  and delays in the development of asynchronous transfer mode atm support for ers 
revenue from networking products increased in compared to  due to incremental revenue contribution from purchase acquisitions made during by network systems 
as part of its restructuring  the company initiated efforts during the fourth quarter of to accelerate the integration of network systems  increase focus on core networking products for the information storage and retrieval marketplace  discontinue the development of future network hub products  modify the distribution structure for networking products  and reduce operating expenses 
improvements in revenue and operating results with respect to networking products are significantly dependent upon the successful implementation of these restructuring actions  the introduction of atm support for ers  and the introduction of enhancements for other networking products 
the development of atm support for ers is completely dependent upon the success of the company s joint development agreement with northern telecom  inc the company does not anticipate atm support for ers will become available until there can be no assurance that the company s joint development agreement with northern telecom  inc will be successful  or that the company s networking product line will generate any significant future profits 
midrange and other products revenue from midrange and other products decreased in compared to this decline is primarily the result of the company s sale of its net investment in sales type leases associated with its midrange business during the second quarter of and the sale of substantially all of the midrange service business during the third quarter of no material gain or loss resulted from the sale of the midrange lease assets as the gain on the lease asset sale was largely offset by transaction and integration costs 
a one time gain of approximately million was recognized in connection with the sale of the midrange service business 
as a result of the sale of the midrange lease assets and midrange service business  revenue from the midrange product line is expected to be significantly reduced in future periods 
revenue from midrange subsystems and other products decreased in compared to midrange revenue and operating results during were adversely affected by a steep price erosion in the midrange online marketplace 
a restructuring plan adopted by the page page company in the third quarter of resulted in further reductions in midrange revenue as the company redirected its marketing efforts to a segment of the midrange marketplace 
gross profit gross profit on product sales of in was unchanged  compared to gross profit improvements were obtained from product cost improvements  principally from iceberg  and cost savings associated with the increased manufacturing volumes during for online and nearline products 
product sales margins also benefited from reduced sales revenue contribution from lower margin midrange products as a result of the sale of the midrange lease assets 
these improvements were offset by the continuation of price declines in the online marketplace  and a significant decrease in margin contribution from networking products 
gross profit on product sales increased to in  compared to in  primarily as a result of a favorable product mix which included increased revenue contribution from higher margin products sold during  such as iceberg  silverton  and powderhorn  and reduced revenue contribution from lower margin midrange products 
gross profit on service and rental revenue was unchanged at in  as compared to gross profit on service and rental revenue increased slightly to in  compared to in the company s ability to sustain or improve product sales margins during is significantly dependent upon the rate of the price declines in the online marketplace  achieving satisfactory manufacturing volumes associated with networking products to offset fixed costs  and achieving cost savings associated with the manufacture of its online and networking products 
product sales margins also may be adversely affected by inventory writedowns as a result of more rapid than anticipated technological changes 
service margins also may be affected in the future due to increased price competition 
research and product development research and product development expenditures decreased in compared to  and declined as a percentage of revenue from in to in while the company continued to invest in the development of new products and enhancements to existing products  these decreases reflect the completion of several major product development programs in and the implementation of cost control measures directed at achieving targeted expense ratios 
research and product development increased in compared to  primarily due to costs incurred in connection with the continued development of timberline  redwood  iceberg and networking products 
marketing  general  administrative and other marketing  general  administrative and other income and expense mg a and other increased in compared to and remained relatively unchanged as a percent of revenue at for both and the increase in mg a and other in is due primarily to increased marketing expenses resulting from higher sales volumes  and a charge of million incurred as a result of activities indirectly related to the company s restructuring 
also included within mg a and other for is a one time gain of million realized on the page page sale of substantially all of the company s midrange service business 
gains and losses associated with foreign currency transactions and translation adjustments  net of associated hedging results  are included in mg a and other and aggregated a net loss of million for  compared to a net loss of million in mg a and other increased in compared to  primarily due to an increase in operating expenses as a result of higher sales volumes and costs incurred in connection with the introduction of new products 
these increases were partially offset by lower marketing expenses related to the midrange business and reduced foreign currency losses in  compared to gains and losses associated with foreign currency transactions and translation adjustments  net of associated hedging results  aggregated a net loss of million for  compared to a net loss of million in see international operations and hedging activities  below  for further discussion of the foreign exchange risks associated with the company s international operations and the related foreign currency hedging activities 
restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges consist of the following in thousands of dollars year ended december  december  december  restructuring charges    litigation settlement  merger and consolidation charges   acquired research and development  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the million charge associated with the settlement of litigation in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the million charge associated with the merger with network systems in and the million charge associated with the merger with amperif corporation in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  also  for a discussion of the million charge incurred in connection with network systems acquisition of bytex corporation in page page the following table summarizes the activity in the company s restructuring reserves during the last three years in thousands of dollars employee asset lease other severance writedowns abandonments exit costs total balances  december      restructuring charges      cash payments    asset writedowns   reclassifications to other restructuring charges   balances  december      restructuring charges     cash payments    asset writedowns   balances  december      restructuring charges      cash payments     asset writedowns   balances  december      restructuring as more fully discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a restructuring charge of million related to the adoption by the company of a formal action plan for restructuring its enterprise and networking businesses 
the restructuring was adopted in an effort to establish a more competitive cost structure in response to slower revenue growth and increasing price competition  particularly in the online marketplace 
in connection with the restructuring  the company plans to focus on core businesses and outsource non strategic activities  rearchitect its distribution processes and accelerate the integration of network systems  which was acquired in march the majority of the company s restructuring actions were either completed in the fourth quarter of or are expected to be completed during as of december   the remaining accrual associated with this restructuring was approximately million 
this accrual consisted of estimated future employee severance obligations of approximately million  estimated future rent obligations associated with excess lease space of approximately million  and accruals for other exit costs associated with the restructuring of approximately million 
while the majority of these remaining accruals are expected to result in future cash outflows  these outflows are not expected to have a material affect on the company s liquidity 
page page the restructuring is expected to yield expense reductions on an annual basis through the elimination of recurring costs as follows in thousands of dollars employee cost savings  depreciation and amortization savings  lease abandonments and other cost savings  total estimated annual savings  the company does not expect to realize the full benefit of the expense reductions until the second half of when all associated restructuring activities are expected to be completed 
while the company is currently evaluating various outsourcing and automation projects in order to gain further improvements in operating efficiencies  the company does not anticipate that any material incremental costs have been or will be incurred as part of the restructuring which would offset the anticipated expense reductions described above 
the company believes that its restructuring programs over the past several years have eliminated certain non essential functions and excess costs 
based on current short and long term forecasts  the company believes that such cost reductions will benefit future operations 
while the company does not currently foresee any significant additional restructuring charges in the near future  the successful implementation of the action plans associated with the company s restructuring during and is critical to achieving improved operating results in future periods 
there can be no assurance that the anticipated expense reductions will be achieved  or that the company s restructuring activities will otherwise be successful or sufficient to allow the company to generate improved operating results in future periods 
it is possible that changes in the company s business or in its industry may necessitate future restructuring charges  which may be significant 
restructuring as more fully discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  during the fourth quarter of  network systems recorded a restructuring charge of million in connection with an expense reduction plan 
as of december   substantially all actions associated with the restructuring have been completed and the remaining accrual associated with this restructuring of approximately million related principally to future rent obligations associated with excess lease space 
no material cash outflows are anticipated to result from this restructuring in the future

as a result of the exchange  interest expense will increase and the obligation to pay preferred stock dividends will be eliminated 
as more fully discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the company announced on february   that it intends to sell substantially all of its net investment in sales type leases 
in connection with this sale  the company intends to repay its outstanding nonrecourse borrowings and senior secured notes 
the completion of this proposed transaction would result in further reductions in interest income and expense during income taxes as further discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  effective as of the beginning of the fiscal year  the company was required to change its method of accounting for income taxes from statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
to sfas no 
a one time benefit of million was recognized in the first quarter of as a result of the adoption of the new income tax accounting standard on a prospective basis 
the adoption of sfas no 
had no cash flow impact 
sfas no 
requires that deferred income tax assets be recognized to the extent realization of such assets is more likely than not 
the company evaluates a variety of factors in determining the amount of the deferred income tax assets to be recognized pursuant to sfas no 
 including the number of years the company s operating losses and tax credits can be carried forward  the existence of taxable temporary differences  the company s earnings history  and the company s near term earnings expectations 
based on the currently available information  management has determined that the company will more likely than not realize million of net deferred income tax assets as of december  page page the company s provision for income taxes relates primarily to us state taxes and taxable earnings associated with its international operations in certain foreign countries 
the company s effective tax rate can be subject to significant fluctuations due to dynamics associated with the mix of its us and international taxable earnings 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information with respect to the current status of the internal revenue service examinations 
liquidity and capital resources working capital the company s cash balances increased million and short term investments decreased million from december   to december  the increase in cash during primarily resulted from cash generated from operations of million  offset by net repayments of debt of million and investments in property  plant and equipment of million 
net cash provided by operations was million for compared to million for and million for net cash provided by operations for includes cash generated from the sale of midrange lease assets and midrange service business of approximately million and refunds from the internal revenue service of million  offset by a one time payment associated with the settlement of shareholder litigation of approximately million 
the net repayment of debt for of million was primarily due to the repayment of borrowings associated with the sale of midrange lease assets 
the decrease of million in cash balances during primarily resulted from investments in equipment held for sale or lease of million  and in property  plant and equipment of million  offset by income tax refunds received by network systems of million 
the increase of million in cash balances during reflects the net proceeds of million from the preferred stock offering  coupled with the net cash generated by operating activities of million  partially offset by investments in property  plant and equipment of million  and net repayments of debt of million 
the current ratio decreased to as of december   from as of december  accounts receivable increased from million as of december   to million as of december   primarily due to an increase in end user sales in relation to sales type leases 
inventories decreased from million as of december   to million as of december   principally as a result of the sale of substantially all of the company s midrange business  as well as strong year end demand for nearline products in available financing lines the company has a million secured multicurrency credit agreement with a group of us and international banks the revolver which expires on march  the interest rates available under the revolver depend on the type of advance selected  however  the primary advance rate is the agent bank s prime lending rate at december  
the total amount available under the revolver is limited to a monthly borrowing base determined as a percentage of the company s eligible accounts receivable  lease assets primarily net investments in sales type leases not previously utilized for other secured borrowings  and equipment awaiting revenue recognition 
to obtain funds under the revolver  the company is page page required to comply with certain financial and other covenants  including restrictions on the payment of cash dividends on its common stock 
as of december   the company had no outstanding advances under the revolver and had approximately million of available credit under the revolver 
the company expects to negotiate a new multicurrency credit agreement prior to the expiration of the revolver on march  there can be no assurances  however  that the company will be able to complete a new credit agreement on terms acceptable to the company 
the company has historically provided lease financing to its customers and  to the extent not funded with nonrecourse or other borrowings  utilized its lease assets as a source of liquidity 
as more fully discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the company announced on february   that it intends to sell its net investment in sales type leases and enter into a worldwide lease financing alliance 
the company expects to close the proposed transaction by the end of the first quarter of  and anticipates an extraordinary gain if the transaction is completed 
in connection with the sale of its net investment in sales type leases  the company intends to repay its outstanding nonrecourse borrowings and its senior secured notes 
the completion of this transaction is expected to provide a significant one time source of cash at the time of closing  however  the company would no longer have lease assets as a source of liquidity on a going forward basis 
as more fully discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  on january   the company entered into a one year agreement with a bank which provides for the sale of certain us and foreign based accounts receivable on a recourse basis 
this agreement allows for receivable sales of up to million at any one time and storagetek s obligations under the agreement will be secured by a letter of credit for the amount of the receivables sold 
the selling price of the receivables will be partially determined based upon foreign currency exchange rates and any gains or losses on the sales will be recognized within mg a and other in the consolidated statement of operations at the time the receivables are sold 
as of february   the company had committed to future cumulative sales of approximately million 
gains and losses associated with the receivable sales are not expected to have a material affect on the company s reported financial results after taking into consideration other transactions associated with the company s international operations 
after consideration of the factors noted above which potentially affect the company s future liquidity  the company believes it has adequate working capital and financing capabilities to meet its anticipated operating and capital requirements for the next months  including new product offerings 
over the longer term  the company intends to continue to commit substantial amounts of its resources to research and development projects and may  from time to time  as market and business conditions warrant  invest in or acquire complementary businesses  products or technologies 
the company may seek to fund these activities or possible transactions through the issuance of additional equity or debt 
the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to the company s stockholders 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing  if required  can be completed on terms acceptable to the company 
page page long term debt to total capitalization the company s long term debt to total capitalization ratio increased to as of december   from as of december  this increase resulted from the exchange of million of convertible subordinated debentures for all of the company s outstanding preferred stock on december   and reductions in stockholders equity resulting from the restructuring and other charges of million incurred during repayment obligations and conversion features pursuant to the indenture related to the company s convertible subordinated debentures due convertible debentures  the company is required to make semiannual interest payments on the million principal amount of the convertible debentures outstanding

as of december   the company held convertible debentures in the principal amount of million available for sinking fund payments 
in connection with the company s senior secured notes due august  the notes  the company is required to make semiannual interest payments on the million principal amount outstanding 
all principal amounts are due and payable on august  the notes are redeemable at the option of the company  in whole or in part  at a premium which is determined based on current interest rates and the time remaining until maturity 
as further discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company intends to prepay the notes in march in connection with the sale of its net investment in sales type leases 
on december   the company exercised its right to exchange convertible subordinated debentures due convertible debentures for all of its outstanding shares of convertible exchangeable preferred stock  
par value preferred stock 
the preferred stock was exchanged at a rate of principal amount of convertible debentures for each share of preferred stock

international operations and hedging activities in  approximately of the company s revenue was generated by its international operations 
the majority of the company s international operations involve transactions denominated in the local currencies of countries within western europe  principally germany  france and the united kingdom  japan  canada and australia 
an increase in the exchange value of the us dollar reduces the value of revenue and profits generated by the company s international operations 
as a result  the company s operations and financial results can be materially affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in an attempt to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations  the company employs a hedging program which takes into account operating and financing activities to reduce exposures and utilizes foreign currency options and forward exchange contracts 
the company utilizes foreign currency options  generally with maturities of less than one year  to hedge a portion of its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations in connection with anticipated revenue from its international operations 
gains and losses on the options are deferred and recognized as an adjustment to the hedged revenue 
the company also utilizes forward exchange contracts  generally with maturities of less than two months  to hedge its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations in connection with net monetary assets held in foreign currencies 
the forward contracts are marked to market each month with any gains or losses recognized within mg a and other as an adjustment to the foreign exchange gains and losses on the translation of net monetary assets 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information with respect to the company s foreign currency hedging activities  including an assessment of the market and credit risks associated with these activities 
see risk factors that may affect future results international sales and operations  below  for further discussion of other factors which may affect the company s international operations 
risk factors that may affect future results new products and technological change the company believes that the successful and timely development of new products  software applications and enhancements will play a key role in determining its results of operations and competitive strength in the future 
during the past several years  the company has introduced many key products including iceberg  kodiak  timberline  redwood  and powderhorn  and has plans to introduce new products and enhancements that it believes will be key to its financial strength and competitiveness 
in the past  the company has encountered defects which have delayed the introduction of new products and product enhancements  and the manufacture of existing products 
these delays have  from time to time  adversely affected the company s financial results and competitive position in the market 
there can be no assurances that the page page company will not encounter product delays in the future  or that despite intensive testing by the company  flaws in design or production will not occur  which could result in the company experiencing a rate of failure in its products that delay the sale of its products  trigger substantial repair or replacement costs  excessive warranty claims and damage to the company s reputation and have a material adverse affect upon the company s financial results 
the market for the company s products is characterized by rapid technological advances which necessitate frequent product introductions and enhancements  and can result in unpredictable product transitions  significant price erosion  and shortened product life cycles 
to be successful in this market  the company must make significant investments in research and product development and introduce competitive new products and enhancements to existing products on a timely basis 
delays associated with development and introduction of new products have resulted  from time to time  in the company incurring significant accounting charges to reflect the impaired values of associated business acquisitions  inventory  and other product line specific assets 
there can be no assurance that new products developed by the company will be accepted in the marketplace 
moreover  certain components of the company s products operate near the present limits of electronic and physical performance capabilities and are designed and manufactured with relatively small tolerances 
dependence on ibm systems many of the company s products are designed to be compatible with certain ibm operating systems and many of its products function like ibm equipment due to the significance of the ibm computer operating environments 
future revenue from products and services is therefore dependent on the marketplace s continued widespread acceptance of and ibm s continued support of these products 
while the company believes that customers will continue to use  and ibm will continue to support  these operating systems and products  there can be no assurances of such continued use and support 
a significant shift away from the mainframe environment or modifications in the design or configuration of ibm computers may have a material adverse affect on the company s business 
the company is adapting its product offerings to address the client server market through the development of network attached storage products  however  most of these products are only in the engineering phase of development 
there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in timely developing and marketing products to address the rapidly expanding client server market 
intense competition  pricing pressures the company competes with a number of large multinational companies that have substantially greater resources than the company s  including ibm  fujitsu ltd  and hitachi  ltd  as well as similarly sized companies  including amdahl corporation and emc corporation 
industry estimates currently show that while demand for online storage capacity in the enterprise marketplace is expected to increase in  price erosion is expected to more than offset this growth in demand 
competition could be affected by cooperative alliances and relationships with competitors and prospective customers that may emerge and rapidly acquire market share  which may have a material adverse affect on the company s business and financial results 
the company competes with a number of networking companies that have a greater presence in the networking marketplace  including com  cisco systems  inc  cabletron systems  inc 
and bay networks  inc 
the operating results of the company s networking product line did not meet its expectations in due to difficulties encountered with the integration of network systems  and delays in the development of atm support for ers 
the development of atm support for page page ers is completely dependent upon the success of the company s joint development agreement with northern telecom  inc the company does not anticipate atm support for ers will become available until there can be no assurance that the company s joint development agreement with northern telecom  inc will be successful  or that the company s networking product line will generate any significant future profits 
the company s inability to successfully and timely develop and introduce new network products and product enhancements  expand its market penetration through new distribution channels and improve the margins on its network products through effective cost controls could have a material adverse affect on the company s future business and financial results 
the company is adapting its product offerings for  and intensifying its activities in  the client server arena in response to the migration toward shared data storage 
the company anticipates that its ability to compete in the client server systems market will depend on a number of factors within and outside its control  including the timely introduction and performance of products for the client server market introduced by the company and its competitors 
intellectual property the company s competitive strength is affected by its ability to protect its proprietary information 
storagetek protects its intellectual property rights through a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  confidentiality procedures  trade secret laws and licensing arrangements 
the company s policy is to apply for patents  or other appropriate proprietary or statutory protection when it develops new or improved technology that is important to its business 
such protection  however  may not preclude competitors from developing products similar to the company s products 
in addition  competitors may attempt to restrict the company s ability to compete by advancing various intellectual property law theories which could  if enforced by the courts  restrict the company s ability to develop and manufacture interoperable products 
also  the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect the company s intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
the company also relies on certain technology that is licensed from others 
the company is unable to predict whether these license arrangements can be renewed on terms acceptable to the company 
the company s intellectual property rights are material to the company s business 
the failure to successfully protect its intellectual property rights or obtain licenses from others as needed could have a material adverse affect on the company s business and financial results 
the high technology industry is characterized by vigorous pursuit and protection of intellectual property rights or positions  which in some instances has resulted in significant litigation and is often protracted and expensive 
litigation by or against the company could result in significant expense and divert the efforts of the company s technical and management personnel  whether or not such litigation results in any determination unfavorable to the company 
in the event of an adverse result in any such litigation  the company could be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  discontinue the use of certain processes  enter into royalty arrangements  or obtain licenses to the infringing technology
