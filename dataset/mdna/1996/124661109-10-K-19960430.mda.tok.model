item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations impact of economy and shift in customer demand during fiscal improved economic conditions resulted in higher demand for the company s standby power products 
in the telecommunications market  the continuing shift in customer demand from the flooded battery products was reflected in the growth in sales of liberty  a premium valve regulated battery 
the company s motive power sales continued to grow  however  the growth rate was less than the growth in the overall market due to selective pricing 
raw material pricing and productivity lead  steel  copper  plastics and electronic components are the major raw materials used in the manufacture of the company s industrial batteries and  accordingly  represent a significant portion of the company s materials costs 
during fiscal  and  north american producer prices of lead have been rising  averaging  
and 
lb  respectively 
the price of lead is currently at its highest level since fiscal the company has undertaken a long term cost containment program to maximize manufacturing efficiency and continues as a matter of course to allocate a significant amount of its normal annual capital expenditures to cost containment and productivity improvement projects 
inflation the company s costs of manufacturing materials and labor and most other operating costs are affected by inflationary pressures 
the company s ability to pass along inflationary cost increases through higher prices may be limited during periods of stable or declining lead prices because of industry pricing practices that tend to link product prices and lead prices 
the company believes that  over recent years  it generally has been able to offset inflationary cost increases by effective raw materials purchasing programs  price increases of its products  increases in labor productivity and improvements in overall manufacturing efficiency 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected items in the company s consolidated statements of income as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated

the combined sales of the company s international power systems  inc subsidiary ips which was formed early in fiscal to acquire certain assets of itt powersystems corporation the ips acquisition and the switching power supply division of basler electric company purchased as of january  rose percent over fiscal approximately percent of this increase was related to the business acquired from the basler electric company 
on a company wide basis  domestic and international sales of standby power products and power supplies to the telecommunications market increased percent over fiscal sales of motive power products were up percent over the prior year due to slightly higher volumes and prices 
gross profit for fiscal increased  or percent to  from  in the prior fiscal year  resulting in a gross margin of percent versus percent in the prior year 
gross margins increased primarily as a result of higher sales volumes and continued improvements in operating efficiencies partially offset by higher material costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to percent of sales in fiscal from percent in the prior year as a result of operating leverage generated from the higher sales volume 
research and development expenses remained proportional to sales as a relative percentage for both fiscal and fiscal interest expense  net  decreased percent from fiscal to fiscal due to lower debt balances  offset by slightly higher effective rates 
other expense  net  increased  primarily due to a full year s amortization of capitalized debt cost versus a partial year in fiscal and lower nonoperating income in fiscal  partially offset by a lower exchange loss in the current year 
as a result of the above  for fiscal  income before income taxes increased  or percent from fiscal and net income rose percent from fiscal to  or per share 
fiscal compared to fiscal sales for fiscal increased to  from  in fiscal sales of standby power products increased over fiscal resulting almost exclusively from higher unit volumes  as unit prices decreased slightly versus fiscal unit growth in the standby power segment emanated from several factors 
the telecommunications industry as a whole continued to grow  and the company successfully increased its penetration of this industry resulting in sales growth to this sector in excess of the sector s overall growth 
sales of the liberty series almost doubled versus fiscal the company s sales growth was in part offset by two factors which reduced sales by approximately  the completion of the puerto rico electric power authority project in fiscal  and significant reduction in round cell sales to a single customer the company expects round cell sales will continue to diminish in significance as the company s business grows over time 
adjusting for these two factors  the company s standby power sales grew approximately over fiscal motive power sales of both batteries and chargers increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal with higher unit volumes more than offsetting lower prices  as customers motive power needs increased due to overall economic growth in this sector 
in addition  sales increased over fiscal as a result of the first quarter acquisition of ips  which increased sales  over the previous year 
gross profit for fiscal increased  to  from  in fiscal  with a gross margin of  down from in the prior year 
gross profit increases were due primarily to the aforementioned sales increases 
the reduction in gross margin results in part from i the acquisition of ips and the related integration expenses  ii overhead absorption and volume related issues emanating from the aforementioned reduction in round cell sales to a single customer  and iii fluctuations in the company s product mix 
gross margins were negatively impacted in the latter part of fiscal by the overall rise in material prices 
this resulted in the company instituting price increases in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal sg a expenses as a percentage of sales declined to in fiscal from in fiscal selling expense as a percentage of sales was in fiscal  versus in fiscal this reduction was due in part to the lower commission structure attributable to ips sales and to the operating leverage attributable to the increased direct sales generated by the company s captive sales personnel versus commission sales by the independent manufacturer representatives

research and development expenses increased  to  in fiscal due primarily to r d expenditures at ips 
operating income increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal as a result of the aggregate of the aforementioned factors 
interest expense  net  increased to  due to higher effective interest rates 
other expense  net  decreased to  due to lower financial services cost  lower foreign exchange expense and higher miscellaneous nonoperating income 
income tax expense increased  due to higher operating income partially offset by a decrease in the deferred tax valuation allowance

net income increased  due primarily to the increase in operating income and the acquisition of ips 
liquidity and capital resources net cash flows provided by operating activities increased to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal this increase was primarily due to higher current year net income and payables partially offset by increased inventories and a smaller increase in accounts receivables than the prior year
