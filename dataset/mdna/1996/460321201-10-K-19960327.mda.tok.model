signatures part i item business general the company  through its subsidiaries  operates a diversified fleet of u 
s 
and international flag vessels that provide international and domestic maritime transportation services to commercial customers and agencies of the united states government primarily under medium to long term charters or contracts 
the company s fleet consists of ocean going vessels  towboats  river barges  special purpose barges  approximately  lash barges and related shoreside handling facilities 
the company s strategy is to i identify customers with marine transportation needs requiring specialized vessels or operating techniques  ii seek medium to long term charters or contracts with those customers and  if necessary  modify  acquire or construct vessels to meet the requirements of those charters or contracts and  iii secure financing for the vessels predicated primarily on those charter or contract arrangements 
the company believes that this strategy has produced valuable long term relationships with its customers and stable operating cash flows 
the company is the only significant operator of the lash lighter aboard ship system  which it pioneered in the company s lash fleet includes ten large lash vessels  four lash feeder vessels and approximately  lash barges 
in its liner services  the company uses the lash system primarily to gather cargo on rivers  in island chains and in harbors that are too shallow for traditional vessels and to transport to and from those areas large items  such as forest products  natural rubber and steel  that cannot be transported efficiently in containerized vessels 
in addition  the lash system enables barges to be rapidly loaded onto and unloaded from the large lash vessels without shoreside support facilities while minimizing the number of times that the cargo is handled 
because the company s lash barges are used primarily to transport large items  the company s lash fleet often has a competitive advantage over containerized vessels 
additionally  because containerized and breakbulk vessels cannot operate in certain of the areas where the company s lash system operates  the company often has a competitive advantage over such vessels 
the company s diversified ocean going fleet also includes the following i two international flag and two us flag pure car carriers specially designed to transport automobiles  ii two us flag ice strengthened multi purpose vessels  iii three roll on roll off vessels that permit rapid deployment of rolling stock  munitions and other military cargoes requiring special handling  iv one international flag cape size bulk carrier  v one us flag semi submersible barge  vi one us flag molten sulphur carrier  which is used to carry molten sulphur from louisiana and or texas to a processing plant on the florida gulf coast  vii two international flag float on float off special purpose vessels  which  together with special purpose barges  are used to provide ocean transportation of supplies for the indonesian operations of a major copper and gold mining company  viii and one us flag conveyor equipped self unloading coal carrier which  under a long term charter  carries coal in the coastwise and near sea trade 
the company also operates inland waterway towboats and super jumbo river barges that transport coal from indiana to florida for an electric utility via shoreside unloading facilities owned and operated by the company 
through its principal operating subsidiaries  central gulf lines  inc central gulf  lci shipholdings  inc 
lci  forest lines inc forest lines and waterman steamship corporation waterman  the company engages primarily in five types of services i international flag lash liner service between u 
s 
gulf and east coast ports and ports in northern europe  and a subsidized u

flag lash liner service between u 
s 
gulf and east coast ports and ports in south asia  the middle east and northern africa  ii time charters to and other contracts with the military sealift command msc for use in its military prepositioning program and to service scientific operations in the arctic and antarctic  iii time charters to transport toyota and honda automobiles from japan to the united states and hyundai automobiles from korea primarily to the united states and europe  iv a contract with a major copper and gold mining company to provide ocean transportation of its supplies for its mining operations in indonesia and  v domestic transportation services  primarily involving its coal and sulphur contracts and its ownership of an inter modal transfer and warehouse facility in memphis  tennessee 
the company currently has time charters or contracts to carry cargoes for commercial customers that include international paper company  freeport mcmoran resource partners  p 
t 
freeport indonesia company  the goodyear tire and rubber company  toyota motor corporation  honda motor co  ltd  hyundai motor company and new england power co 
the company operates eight vessels for the msc under charters or contracts that typically contain options permitting msc to extend the charter or contract on similar terms and conditions for one or more extension periods 
in most cases  the msc has exercised its renewal options on the company s charters or contracts  and the company generally has been successful in winning charter or contract renewals when they are rebid 
the company s business historically has generated stable cash flows because most of its medium to long term charters provide for a daily charter rate that is owed whether or not the charterer utilizes the vessel unless the vessel is unavailable for the charterer s use and most of its medium to long term contracts guarantee a minimum amount of cargo for transportation 
the company is partially insulated from increases in certain operating expenses because time charters generally require the charterer to pay certain voyage costs  including fuel  port and stevedoring expenses  and often include cost escalation features covering certain of the expenses paid by the company 
history central gulf was founded in by the late niels f 
johnsen and his sons  niels w 
johnsen  the company s current chairman  and erik f 
johnsen  its current president 
central gulf was privately held until when it was acquired by trans union corporation 
in  the company was formed to act as a holding company for central gulf  lci and other affiliated companies in connection with the spin off by trans union of the company s common stock to trans union s stockholders 
in  the company acquired the assets of forest lines  and  in  the company acquired the stock of waterman 
since its spin off from trans union  the company has continued to act solely as a holding company  and its only significant assets consist of the capital stock of its subsidiaries 
liner services contracts of affreightment international flag 
under the name forest lines  the company operates two international flag lash vessels and a self propelled  semi submersible feeder vessel on a scheduled liner service 
forest lines normally makes round trip sailings per lash vessel per year between u 
s 
gulf and east coast ports and ports in northern europe 
approximately one half of the aggregate eastbound cargo space is reserved for international paper company under a long term contract of affreightment 
the remaining space is provided on a voyage affreightment basis to commercial shippers 
historically  approximately has been used by other paper manufacturers 
the remaining has been used by various commercial shippers to carry general cargo 
since  when the lash liner service commenced operation  the vessels generally have been fully utilized on their eastbound voyages 
the company has had ocean transportation contracts with international paper since when the company had two lash ships built to accommodate international paper s trade 
the company s contract of affreightment with international paper is for the carriage of wood pulp  liner board and other forest products  the characteristics of which are well suited for transportation by lash vessels 
the lash system minimizes damage to such cargo by reducing the number of times that the cargo is handled 
in addition  the lash system permits the company to load and unload these products at the shipper s and the receiver s facilities  which are generally located on river systems that container and breakbulk vessels do not serve 
the company s current contract with international paper is for a ten year term ending in over the years  the company has established a base of commercial shippers to which it provides space on the westbound forest lines service 
the principal cargoes carried westbound are high grade paper products  aluminum slabs  steel products and other general cargo 
over the last five years  the westbound utilization rate for these vessels averaged approximately per year 
u

flag 
waterman is a party to an operating differential subsidy agreement with the u 
s 
maritime administration  an agency of the department of transportation marad  that permits the company to operate u 
s 
flag vessels on designated international trade routes and receive subsidy payments from the united states government approximating the excess of certain vessel expenses  primarily wages  over comparable costs of the company s principal foreign flag competitors on the same trade routes 
under the subsidy agreement  the company operates a scheduled liner service that makes approximately round trip voyages per year four per vessel between u 
s 
gulf and atlantic ports and ports in the red sea  persian gulf and indian ocean trade route no 
and ports in indonesia  malaysia and singapore trade route no 

the subsidy agreement also permits the company to make up to calls per year at egyptian ports on the mediterranean and up to calls per year to south and east african ports 
the company also operates flash vessels as feeder vessels in this service in southeast asia 
in  the company received approximately million under its subsidy agreement 
the company s subsidy agreement with marad expires on december   and it is unlikely that it will be renewed in its current form  if at all 
see item business regulation for a discussion of the subsidy program 
on the eastbound portion of this service  a significant part of each vessel s cargo traditionally has been shipped to lesser developed countries under the public law program  pursuant to which the united states government sells or donates surplus food products for export to developing countries 
of this cargo is reserved for carriage by us flag vessels  if they are available at reasonable rates 
awards under the public law program are made on a voyage to voyage basis through periodic competitive bidding 
the remaining eastbound cargo consists of general cargo  including some military equipment 
over the last five years  these vessels generally have been fully utilized on their eastbound voyages 
on the westbound portion of this service  the company provides a significant portion of its cargo space to goodyear for the transportation of natural rubber under a contract of affreightment expiring in december space is also provided on a voyage to voyage basis to other importers of natural rubber  including uniroyal goodrich tire co  bridgestone firestone  inc and certain members of the rubber trade association 
the company has had a continuing relationship with such companies and the association since the early s 
the company s lash barges are ideally suited for large shipments of natural rubber because damage to rubber due to compression is minimal as compared to the damage that can occur when shipments are made in traditional breakbulk vessels 
as a result  waterman is the largest us flag carrier of natural rubber from southeast asia to the united states 
the remaining westbound cargo generally consists of coffee  jute  guar  piece goods and other general cargo 
over the last five years  these vessels generally have been fully utilized on their westbound voyages 
military sealift command general 
the company has had contracts with the msc or its predecessor almost continuously for several decades 
at the present time  the company s subsidiaries have eight vessels under contract to the msc 
these vessels are employed in the msc s prepositioning programs  which strategically place military cargo throughout the world  or are chartered to the msc to service long term scientific operations 
the company believes that the demand for military prepositioning vessels will at least remain steady during the near term  notwithstanding planned reductions in overall military spending  because these vessels are vital to the military s ability to respond quickly to international incidents throughout the world without incurring the significant costs of operating foreign bases  some of which also may not be available because of changing political situations 
msc charters and contracts are awarded through competitive bidding  for fixed terms with options allowing the msc to extend the charters or contracts for additional periods 
in most cases  the msc has always exercised its extension options  and the company generally has been successful in winning renewals when the charters and contracts are rebid 
all charters and contracts require the msc to pay certain voyage costs  including fuel  port and stevedoring expenses  and certain charters and contracts include cost escalation features covering certain of the expenses paid by the company 
lash vessels 
the company charters four u 
s 
flag lash vessels to the msc under time charters 
one of these charters expires in july  and provides the msc with an option to renew the contract for two additional month periods 
the other three charters expire in april  may  and march  respectively 
after these charters expire  it is anticipated that the msc will invite rebidding for these contracts 
the company has generally been successful in winning renewals when contracts are rebid 
in the event msc does not invite rebids  or the company is unsuccessful in winning renewals  these vessels will most likely be placed in commercial service 
the fourth charter expires in july  and provides the msc with an option to renew the contract for two additional month periods 
these vessels are in the msc s prepositioning force stationed in the indian ocean area 
ice strengthened multi purpose vessels 
the company owns and operates the only two us flag ice strengthened multi purpose vessels 
these vessels are capable of transporting containerized and breakbulk cargo 
one of the vessels is being operated under a charter with the msc that will expire in august and may be extended for an additional month period at the option of the msc 
the vessel is being used by the msc to resupply pacific rim military bases and to supply scientific projects in the arctic and antarctic 
the other vessel was operated under a charter with msc until that charter expired in late the msc did not exercise its option to renew the charter for an additional month period  and the vessel is now being operated in the open market on a cargo offered basis 
roll on roll off vessels 
in  waterman was awarded a contract to operate three u 
s 
flag roll on roll off vessels under time charters to the msc for use by the united states navy in its maritime prepositioning ship mps program 
these vessels represent three of the four mps vessels currently in the msc s atlantic fleet  which provides support for the u 
s 
marine corps 
these ships are designed primarily to carry rolling stock and containers  and can each carry support equipment for  military personnel 
waterman sold the three vessels to unaffiliated corporations shortly after being awarded the contract  but retained the right to operate the vessels under operating agreements 
the msc time charters commenced in late and early for initial five year periods and were renewable at the msc s option for additional five year periods up to a maximum of twenty five years 
in  the company reached an agreement with msc to make certain reductions in future charter hire payments in consideration of fixing the period of these charters for the full twenty five years 
the charters will now terminate in the years and the operating agreements are for corresponding periods and are renewed as the charters are renewed 
semi submersible barge 
in late  the company acquired and commenced operation of a u 
s 
flag semi submersible barge  the caps express 
the caps express was initially deployed under a charter to the msc and was used extensively in operation desert shield desert storm 
the charter expired in april  and the msc did not exercise its renewal option 
since that time  the caps express has been operated in the commercial market 
pure car carriers u 
s 
flag 
in  the company entered into multi year charters to carry toyota and honda automobiles from japan to the united states 
to service these charters  the company had constructed two u 
s 
flag pure car carriers specially designed to carry  and  automobiles  respectively 
both vessels were built in japan  but are registered under the us flag  making them two of only four us flag pure car carriers in the japanese trade 
to be competitive with foreign flag vessels operated by foreign crews  the company worked in close cooperation with the unions representing the company s us citizen shipboard personnel 
service under these charters commenced in the fourth quarter of these charters have since been renewed for additional multi year terms 
international flag 
since  the company has transported hyundai automobiles from korea primarily to the united states and europe under two long term charters 
to service these charters  the company had two new pure car carriers constructed by a shipyard affiliated with hyundai 
each of the vessels has a carrying capacity of  automobiles 
under each of the car carrier charters  the charterers are responsible for voyage costs including fuel  port and stevedoring expenses while the company is responsible for normal operating expenses including crew wages  repairs and insurance 
the hyundai charters also include escalation features covering certain of the expenses paid by the company 
during the terms of these charters  the company is entitled to its full fee irrespective of the number of voyages completed or the number of cars carried per voyage 
bulk carrier in  the company acquired a  dwt cape size dry bulk carrier 
the vessel has since been fully employed under various charters in specific trading areas where bulk cargoes move on a regular basis 
float on float off special purpose vessels during  the company entered into a long term contract to provide ocean transportation services to a major mining company producing copper concentrates at its mine in west irian jaya  indonesia 
the company acquired two semi submersible barge carrying vessels and had cargo barges constructed by shipyards in the orient to be used with the aforementioned vessels 
the company also charters a small container vessel in order to fulfill the requirements of the contract  which commenced in late see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
domestic water transportation services coal 
in  the company entered into a year contract expiring in with a florida based rural electric generation and transmission cooperative for the transportation of coal from mt 
vernon  indiana to gulf county  florida 
under this contract  which was awarded pursuant to competitive bidding  the company is annually guaranteed a minimum of million tons of coal to be transported by inland waterways through its operation of chartered towboats  chartered super jumbo river barges and three such barges that it owns 
under this contract  the company typically has transported three million tons of coal per year 
to protect both parties against cost variations  the contract contains escalation and de escalation clauses designed to adjust the contract price for fluctuations in fuel costs  wages and other operating expenses 
the company is also responsible for unloading the barges at the discharge point in gulf county  florida and transferring the coal into railcars 
to facilitate this process  the company owns and operates an automated terminal facility 
the terminal can be operated by relatively few employees and is capable of loading and unloading three times the amount of coal currently transported through the facility under the contract 
in late  the company purchased an existing us flag self unloading coal carrier which it concurrently chartered to a new england based electric utility company under a year contract to carry coal in the coastwise and near sea trade 
the ship will also be used  from time to time during this charter period  to carry coal and other bulk commodities for account of other major charterers

s 
gulf and atlantic coast ports and south asia ports under the waterman house flag 
the company advertises its service in trade publications in the united states and abroad 
insurance the company maintains protection and indemnity p i insurance to cover liabilities arising out of the ownership or operation of vessels with assuranceforeningen gard and the standard steamship owners protection indemnity association bermuda ltd  which are mutual shipowners insurance organizations commonly referred to as p i clubs 
both clubs are participants in and subject to the rules of their respective international group of p i associations 
the premium terms and conditions of the p i coverage provided to the company are governed by the rules of each club 
the company maintains hull and machinery insurance policies on each of its vessels in amounts related to the value of each vessel 
this insurance coverage  which includes increased value  freight and time charter hire  is maintained with a syndicate of hull underwriters from the united states  british  french and scandinavian insurance markets 
the company maintains war risk insurance on each of the company s vessels in an amount equal to each vessel s total insured hull value 
war risk insurance is placed through us  british  french and scandinavian insurance markets and covers physical damage to the vessels and p i risks for which coverage would be excluded by reason of war exclusions under either the hull policies or the rules of the applicable p i club 
the company also maintains loss of hire insurance with us  british  french and scandinavian markets to cover its loss of revenue in the event that a vessel is unable to operate for a certain period of time due to loss or damage arising from the perils covered by the hull and machinery policy 
insurance coverage for shoreside property  shipboard consumables and inventory  spare parts  workers compensation  office contents  and general liability risks are maintained with underwriters in the united states and british markets 
the company also carries insurance to meet certain liabilities that could arise from the discharge of oil or hazardous substances in us  international and foreign waters 
insurance premiums for the coverage described above vary from year to year depending upon the company s loss record and market conditions 
in order to reduce premiums  the company maintains certain deductible and co insurance provisions that it believes are prudent and generally consistent with those maintained by other shipping companies and in recent years has increased the self retention portion under its insurance program 
regulation the company s operations between the united states and foreign countries are subject to the shipping act of the shipping act  which is administered by the federal maritime commission  and certain provisions of the federal water pollution control act  the oil pollution act of and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act  all of which are administered by the u 
s 
coast guard  and certain other international  federal  state and local laws and regulations  including international conventions and laws and regulations of the flag nations of its vessels 
pursuant to the requirements of the shipping act  the company has on file with the federal maritime commission tariffs reflecting the outbound and inbound rates currently charged by the company to transport cargo between the united states and foreign countries as a common carrier 
these tariffs are filed by the company either individually or in connection with its participation as a member of rate or conference agreements  which are agreements that upon becoming effective following filing with the federal maritime commission permit the members to agree concertedly upon rates and practices relating to the carriage of goods in u 
s 
and foreign ocean commerce 
tariffs filed by a company unilaterally or collectively under rate or conference agreements are subject to federal maritime commission approval 
once a rate or conference agreement is filed  rates may be changed in response to market conditions on days notice  with respect to a rate increase  and one day s notice  with respect to a rate decrease 
the merchant marine act of  as amended the merchant marine act  authorizes the federal government to pay an operating differential subsidy to u 
s 
flag vessels employed in the foreign trade of the united states 
under the subsidy program  marad is authorized to pay qualified us flag operators i the differential between u 
s 
and foreign crew wage costs and ii the differential between us and foreign costs of protection and indemnity insurance  hull and machinery insurance  and maintenance and repairs not compensated by insurance  so that us ships can compete on an equal footing with their lower cost foreign competitors 
to qualify for the subsidy  vessels must be built in the united states  documented under the us flag and be at least owned by us citizens 
under subsidy contracts  which are typically years in length  operators provide service on essential trade routes as determined by marad 
the typical subsidized operator is required to employ its vessels between a stated minimum and maximum number of sailings each year 
currently  four liner operators  including waterman  and bulk carrier operators hold subsidy contracts for a total of liner and bulk ships 
total us governmental subsidy appropriations for the fiscal year ended september   were million  and million has been appropriated for the fiscal year ending september  approximately of the aggregate subsidy is paid to offset crew wage differentials 
since  the federal government has entered into no new subsidy contracts 
in  the bush administration announced that current contracts would be honored  but no new subsidy contracts would be entered into as the old contracts expire 
the clinton administration has continued this policy 
waterman s subsidy contract expires on december   and all other subsidy agreements with us flag liner operators expire by december  this year  the clinton administration proposed legislation that would implement a new subsidy program  the maritime security program 
if enacted  this program would authorize funding for approximately us flag ships for up to ten years 
legislation to authorize the maritime security program has passed the us house of representatives and is pending in the us senate 
funding for the first year of this program is likewise pending in congress 
both waterman and central gulf would intend to apply for participation in this new program 
there can be no assurance that the maritime security program will be adopted and funded by congress  that if adopted it will be signed by the president  or that if enacted into law  it will provide funding to all or some of the waterman and central gulf vessels 
therefore  it is possible that the existing program will be terminated  that no replacement program will be enacted  or that a replacement program will provide substantially less funding than the current program 
alternative steps are under consideration so as to continue the company s competitive position 
seven of the company s us flag lash vessels were constructed with the aid of construction differential subsidies and title xi loan guarantees administered by marad  the receipt of which obligates the company to comply with various dividend and other financial restrictions 
vessels constructed with the aid of construction differential subsidies may not be operated in domestic coastwise trade or domestic trade with hawaii  puerto rico or alaska without the permission of marad and without repayment of the construction differential subsidy under a formula established by law 
recipients of title xi loan guarantees must pay an annual fee of up to of the loan amount 
under the merchant marine act  us flag vessels are subject to requisition or charter by the united states whenever the president declares that the national security requires such action 
the owners of any such vessels must receive just compensation as provided in the merchant marine act  but there is no assurance that lost profits  if any  will be fully recovered 
in addition  during any extension period under each msc charter or contract  the msc has the right to terminate the charter or contract on days notice 
however  the msc has never exercised such termination right with respect to the company 
certain of the company s operations  including its subsidized us flag lash liner service and its carriage of us foreign aid cargoes  as well as the company s coal and molten sulphur transportation contracts and its title xi financing arrangements  require the company to be as much as owned by us citizens 
the company monitors its stock ownership to verify its continuing compliance with these requirements and has never had more than of its common stock held of record by non us citizens 
the company s charter and stock transfer procedures do not prohibit the acquisition of its common stock by non us citizens  although the board of directors has proposed an amendment to the charter to do so  and that amendment will be voted on by the company s stockholders at the company s annual meeting to be held in april see the information contained under the caption proposed amendment to certificate of incorporation on pages   and of the company s definitive proxy statement dated march   filed pursuant to section a of the securities exchange act of  which information is incorporated herein by reference 
the company is required by various governmental and quasi governmental agencies to obtain permits  licenses and certificates with respect to its vessels 
the kinds of permits  licenses and certificates required depend upon such factors as the country of registry  the commodity transported  the waters in which the vessel operates  the nationality of the vessel s crew  the age of the vessel and the status of the company as owner or charterer 
the company believes that it has or can readily obtain all permits  licenses and certificates necessary to permit its vessels to operate 
competition the shipping industry is intensely competitive and is influenced by events largely outside the control of shipping companies 
varying economic factors can cause wide swings in freight rates and sudden shifts in traffic patterns 
vessel redeployments and new vessel construction can lead to an overcapacity of vessels offering the same service or operating in the same market 
changes in the political or regulatory environment can also create competition that is not necessarily based on normal considerations of profit and loss 
the company s strategy is to reduce competitive pressures and the effects of cyclical market conditions by operating specialized vessels in identifiable market segments and deploying a substantial number of its vessels under medium to long term charters or contracts and on trade routes where it has established market shares 
the company also seeks to compete effectively in the traditional areas of price  reliability and timeliness of service 
competition principally comes from numerous breakbulk vessels and  occasionally  containerized vessels 
much of the company s revenue is generated by contracts with the msc and contracts to transport public law us government sponsored cargo  a cargo preference program requiring that of all foreign aid food for peace cargo must be transported on us flag vessels  if they are available at reasonable rates 
the company competes with all us flag companies  including overseas shipholding group  inc  omi corporation  marine transport lines  inc  farrell lines  inc  lykes brothers steamship company  sea land service  inc and american president lines  inc 
for the msc work and the public law cargo 
additionally  the company s principal foreign competitors include hoegh lines  star shipping  wilhelmsen lines  and the shipping corporation of india 
the company s international flag lash liner service faces competition from foreign flag liner operators and  to a lesser degree  from u 
s 
flag liner operators  including those receiving operating differential subsidies 
in addition  during periods in which the company participates in conference agreements or rate agreements  competition includes not only the other participants obligated to charge the same rates  but also non participants charging lower rates 
because the company s lash barges are used primarily to transport large items  such as forest products  natural rubber and steel  that cannot be transported as efficiently in containerized vessels  the company s lash fleet often has a competitive advantage over these vessels for this type of cargo 
in addition  the company believes that the ability of its lash system to operate in shallow harbors and river systems and its specialized knowledge of these harbors and river systems give it a competitive advantage over operators of containerized and breakbulk vessels  which are too large to operate in these areas 
the company s pure car carriers operate worldwide in markets where foreign flag vessels with foreign crews predominate 
the company believes that its us flag pure car carriers can continue to compete effectively if it continues to receive the cooperation of its unions in controlling costs 
employees the company employs approximately shipboard personnel and shoreside personnel 
the company considers relations with its employees to be excellent 
all of the company s us shipboard personnel and certain shoreside personnel are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
central gulf  waterman and other us shipping companies are subject to collective bargaining agreements for shipboard personnel in which the shipping companies servicing us gulf and east coast ports also must make contributions to pension plans for dockside workers 
the employee retirement income security act of  as amended  provides for liabilities for withdrawal from a multi employer pension plan if an employer reduces its operations below a minimum level 
it is possible that the failure or withdrawal of any shipping company employer may cause other employers such as the company to increase their plan contributions or result in additional potential liability 
the company has experienced no strikes or other significant labor problems during the last ten years 
item properties vessels 
of the ocean going vessels in the company s fleet  are owned by the company and three are operated under operating contracts 
of the approximately  lash barges operated in conjunction with the company s lash and flash vessels  the company owns approximately  barges and leases barges under leases with year terms expiring in late and early the company also owns approximately additional lash barges  which are not required for current vessel operations 
all of the company s barges are registered under the us flag 
the company time charters in super jumbo river barges and owns three such barges and towboats specially built to meet the requirements of the company s coal transportation contract 
the company also owns standard river barges chartered to unaffiliated companies on a short term basis and one towboat currently operated on the spot market 
until may  the river barges were bareboat chartered in from affiliates of the company 
upon the expiration of these bareboat charters  the company purchased the barges from these affiliates for million in the aggregate 
except for the approximately lash barges that are not required for the company s operations  all of the vessels owned  operated or leased by the company are in good condition 
since  the company has completed life extension work on six lash vessels  completed the refurbishment of approximately  related barges and acquired lash barges
