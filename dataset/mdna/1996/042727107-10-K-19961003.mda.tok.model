item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto 
all forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis and elsewhere in this report are qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statement appearing at the end of this discussion and analysis 
management s plan and subsequent event during the first quarter of fiscal  after completing an evaluation of the company s historical operating results  sales forecast and cost structure  the board of directors of the company approved a plan to restructure its operations by closing its santa maria  california production facility and transferring its manufacturing operations formerly conducted at that facility to the morrilton  arkansas plant 
as a result  a million restructuring charge will be recorded in the first quarter of fiscal of the total charge   relates to termination benefits for displacement of its employee workforce and  relates to closing of the facility 
the action was taken to enhance profit margins by streamlining the company s productive capacity to better match its production requirements 
in addition to recording the restructuring charge  the company anticipates that during fiscal it will incur non recurring period costs relating to the restructuring estimated to range from to million 
these costs relate to ongoing operations and include such costs as the shipment of inventory and equipment  employee relocation and anticipated initial labor and production inefficiencies as a result of the consolidation of production operations from three to two plant facilities 
the consolidation of manufacturing operations is consistent with the company s efforts begun in fiscal to streamline its operations 
in fiscal  product line consolidations were completed as well as the consolidation of the customer service function 
in fiscal  customer billing and vendor payment functions will also be centralized 
these actions are being taken to enhance operating efficiencies and the financial performance of the company 
results of operations the company incurred net losses of  and  for the respective fiscal years ended june  and june  for the fiscal year ended june   the company earned net income of  fiscal net income included an extraordinary charge of  net of a tax benefit of  relating to the refinancing of the company s bank debt 
sales net sales for fiscal weeks declined million or to  from net sales for fiscal weeks 
this compares with a decrease in net sales of million  or in fiscal from fiscal and an increase in net sales of million  or in fiscal from fiscal unit sales for fiscal declined from fiscal this compares with unit sales declines of in fiscal from fiscal and in fiscal from fiscal the decline in net sales in fiscal is attributable to several factors 
in recent years  consolidations and mergers have been common within the distribution sector of the industry as it continues its turbulent evolution 
this activity has generated excess inventory levels in the distribution sector of the industry  negatively impacting the company s unit sales and resulting in increased product returns 
during fiscal  the company sustained a higher level of customer deductions for product returns than in previous years 
these returns  which are deductions in calculating net sales  are for re usable cores our basic raw material  warranty and stock adjustments received in the normal course of business 
while over longer periods of time the relationship of returns to sales remains relatively constant  occasional fluctuations do occur 
due to the consolidation merger activity noted above  many of our customers found themselves with excess inventories 
to rectify their inventory surplus these businesses returned as much of the excess inventory as possible to their vendors 
the adverse impact of the lower unit sales volume and the high level of customer returns was mitigated somewhat by a favorable mix of products sold and a price increase implemented in fiscal furthermore  new business acquisitions during fiscal mitigated the impact of customer accounts lost in fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal the decline in net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal occurred primarily in the latter half of the year 
the most significant factor was the mild winter weather pattern experienced throughout most of the country in fiscal which resulted in fewer part failures and reduced the demand for many of the company s products 
in addition  the company lost several customer accounts during fiscal  as noted above 
the increase in net sales in fiscal over fiscal was due primarily to the mix of products sold  as the company experienced increased demand for its higher priced  late model electrical products 
changing prices management is conscious of the impact of inflation and  when possible  will compensate by increasing selling prices 
retail outlets have become a significant factor in the distribution of automotive parts  while at the same time most traditional warehouse distributors have joined large buying groups 
these power buyers have dramatically increased pricing pressures at a time when over capacity of manufacturers and distributors throughout the industry remains prevalent 
price increases on the company s products in the last several years have been limited due to the competitive pricing pressures of the automotive aftermarket 
in spite of these pressures the company s average selling price in fiscal increased over fiscal this increase was primarily due to the mix of products sold reflecting higher proportionate sales of electrical products  which typically have a higher average selling price than the mechanical product offering 
also  the company implemented an overall price increase in its electrical product offering in the first quarter of fiscal the company refrained from passing on all of the increased costs in fiscal and fiscal through pricing because of the competitive climate 
in both fiscal and  the overall average gross price of products sold increased over the respective prior fiscal years due primarily to the mix of products sold 
cost of goods sold net sales generated a gross margin of in fiscal  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal several factors contributed to the decline in the gross margin in fiscal beginning in the second quarter of fiscal  the company started the process of consolidating the production of certain product lines to specific manufacturing facilities  changing the previous practice of manufacturing most product lines at all manufacturing facilities 
this consolidation process resulted in temporary labor inefficiencies as each product line was moved 
four product lines were consolidated between the second and fourth quarters of fiscal in the third quarter  increased expenses resulted from start up costs incurred to service a new customer which was anticipated to provide additional annualized volume approximating of the company s total sales 
increased material sourcing expenses were incurred to properly service the large initial orders of this new business 
freight expenses increased as initial shipments for this new west coast business were supplemented by shipments from the company s other manufacturing facilities 
further  it was necessary to add a second shift at the company s west coast manufacturing facility 
the second shift represented a increase in that location s labor requirements  which resulted in temporary labor inefficiencies and additional costs during the training period 
throughout the current fiscal year  labor efficiency and the ability to absorb overhead costs were adversely impacted by swings in sales volume 
a sudden downturn in sales volume occurred in the second quarter  specifically october and november 
the company believes that cautious inventory management practices were applied by our customers and their customers  in order to avoid investing heavily in a large winter season inventory and then repeating the fiscal experience of having inventory surpluses due to the low sales caused by a mild winter 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  sales volume dropped again 
the decline in sales was largely due to reduced orders from the customer newly acquired in the third quarter of the current year 
because purchases by this customer were substantially less than anticipated and future demand could not be reasonably predicted  the company terminated the second shift at its west coast production facility that had been added to support this customer in the fourth quarter of fiscal throughout most of the year  the company experienced additional costs due to down time and inefficient output from certain new manufacturing related equipment and the necessity of running parallel systems 
the start up issues related to this equipment concluded in the third quarter of the fiscal year 
as previously mentioned  the company experienced higher than usual levels of customer product returns throughout most of fiscal in addition  the company was inefficient in the recovery of good product from product returns and returning them to finished goods inventory 
recovery of returned product is an integral part of remanufacturing and significantly mitigates the negative financial impact of product returns 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the recovery departments at all manufacturing locations were expanded to maximize the recovery of product returns 
finally  the company realized a increase in the cost to provide medical benefits to its employees in fiscal compared to fiscal  of which approximately  or  was reported as increased cost of goods sold 
the gross margin percentage declined to in fiscal from in fiscal a change in the mix of products sold contributed to the margin decline 
customer sales migrated to the company s lance product lines  which generate lower margins than the company s traditional premium lines 
also  the company s mix of products sold reflected proportionately more unit sales in newer vehicle applications 
while generating higher sales dollars  these newer vehicle applications provided lower gross margins due to the higher costs to produce a product in the early stage of its product cycle 
during fiscal  the product mix was impacted by the decline in the sales of certain products which tend to have higher failure rates in severe winter weather 
these products on average generate a gross profit margin percentage that exceeds the company s average gross profit margin percentage 
finally  in fiscal  the company experienced increases in the cost of certain basic raw materials eg  copper  aluminum and linerboard products  increased unit costs due to lower plant utilization caused by the decline in sales volume and inefficiencies incurred during the installation of the new raw material cleaning systems mandated by environmental laws and regulations 
impact of inflation the company follows the lifo method of determining inventory costs to better match current costs with current revenues 
in fiscal  the impact of deflation and operating factors  primarily improved material sourcing and usage  decreased cost of goods sold over the prior year by  in fiscal and  the impact of inflation and operating factors increased cost of goods sold over the respective prior years by  and  charges to operations for depreciation represent the allocation of historical cost incurred in prior years and are significantly less than if they were based on current or replacement cost of the company s production capacity 
in the normal course of business  the company will replace its productive capacity over an extended period of time 
decisions concerning such replacements will be made in light of economic  regulatory and competitive conditions existing from time to time 
these new assets will result in additional depreciation charges 
in many cases  however  there will be offsetting cost savings from technological advances 
selling  administrative and general expenses selling  administrative and general expenses as a percentage of sales were  and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
spending in these areas of  declined million in the current year compared to fiscal in comparison  spending in these areas increased  in fiscal over fiscal and  in fiscal over fiscal the company s business acquisition costs in fiscal were million less than similar expenses incurred in fiscal further  in fiscal  the company incurred approximately  to develop marketing programs 
these expenses were not repeated in fiscal the company has implemented various cost reduction measures that have contributed to the reduced expenses in the current fiscal year 
these measures included the discontinuation of certain administrative functions and a reduction in administrative staff  as well as strict controls over discretionary spending 
beginning late in fiscal and continuing into the first three quarters of fiscal  the company incurred increased business acquisition costs 
such costs incurred in fiscal exceeded similar costs in fiscal by  also during fiscal  the company invested in the development of new marketing programs which resulted in additional expense of approximately  net interest expense net interest expense in fiscal of  increased  or  over fiscal net interest expense increased  or  in fiscal over fiscal fiscal net interest expense decreased  or  compared to fiscal in both fiscal years and  higher borrowing levels and higher interest rates resulted in the additional net interest expense 
the reduction in net interest expense in fiscal year in comparison to fiscal was due primarily to the lower interest rates available under replacement financing obtained in the third quarter of fiscal income taxes the company recorded a tax benefit in and which represented and of the pretax loss in and  respectively 
in  the company recorded a tax provision at an effective tax rate of 
the effective tax rate used to determine the tax benefit was lower than the effective tax rate due to the effect of certain nondeductible items in liquidity and capital resources the company had cash and cash equivalents of  as of june   with a corresponding balance of  as of june  working capital was reduced to million from million as of those same dates and cash provided by operations was reduced to  during fiscal from  during fiscal the decrease in cash generated from operating activities in fiscal compared to fiscal is attributable to net operating losses in fiscal  coupled with increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
accounts receivable increased as a result of higher sales late in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year 
inventories increased primarily at the company s west coast manufacturing facility and at its canadian distribution facility in anticipation of increased demand 
cash used for investing activities for fiscal was  and was used primarily to purchase property  plant and equipment 
capital expenditures were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the company continues to invest in capital improvements and other long term assets to enhance operations so as to maintain the highest standards of overall quality 
during fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million and consisted of advances under a revolving line of credit 
repayments of long term debt and capital lease obligations in fiscal were million 
the company has a revolving line of credit with a commercial bank which permits the company to borrow up to million  outstanding at june  
the company s availability under this line of credit is based upon a formula applied to the balance of the company s inventory and accounts receivable 
in addition  the company has a term loan with an outstanding balance of  with the same commercial bank 
the company s obligations under the line of credit and the term loan are secured by substantially all of its assets 
the financing agreement contains certain provisions and covenants which  among other things restrict future indebtedness  cash dividends and capital expenditures  and require the company to maintain specified levels of tangible net worth  operating performance and debt service and liabilities to worth ratios 
compliance with the debt service covenant of this financing agreement was waived during the second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal such that the loss sustained by the company during those periods did not result in a default under the agreement 
compliance with the liabilities to worth covenant and limitations on capital expenditures under this financing agreement were also waived during the fourth quarter of fiscal the revolving line of credit expires on june  effective june   the revolving line of credit was amended such that the interest rate borne on a given date will change depending upon the achieved debt service ratio 
the rate charged can range from 
over the lender s base rate to over such base rate 
if the company achieves specified debt service ratios  a lending rate becomes available at above the eurodollar rate 
similarly  the term loan  which had outstanding borrowings as of june   of  was also amended such that the interest rate borne on a given date will change depending upon the debt service ratio achieved by the company 
the rate charged can range from over the lender s base rate to over such base rate 
at specific debt service levels  a lending rate is available above the eurodollar rate 
all of the foregoing rates are adjusted quarterly based on the company s debt service ratio 
the company believes that existing cash balances  cash generated from operations  and borrowing ability under the company s financing agreements will be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements for operations for the next twelve months and to complete the planned restructuring efforts 
outlook arrow automotive industries business objective is to be the leader in supplying a broad line of quality remanufactured automotive products to the automotive aftermarket 
the company announced  subsequent to the year ended june   a restructuring plan that it believes will result in a stronger foundation for profitable growth 
the plan is to consolidate the company s manufacturing facilities from three to two  providing a more streamlined and efficient production capability 
this restructuring is consistent with the consolidation of certain administrative functions and the consolidation of the production of certain product lines that have occurred within the company throughout the year 
these changes will help the company compete in today s highly competitive automotive aftermarket 
during the last two fiscal years  the company has experienced large swings in its quarterly sales volume 
furthermore  the timing of a customer s product return which will reduce reported net sales is beyond the control of the company 
these factors make revenue forecasting unpredictable  and could subject the company to fluctuations in both revenues and earnings 
while over longer periods of time the relationship of returns to sales remains relatively constant  occasional fluctuations do occur 
fluctuations in channel mix retail versus traditional warehouse distributors  for example and product mix in product sales can also be significant 
all of these factors can have a significant impact on gross margins as a percentage of revenue and therefore earnings per share 
management believes that the streamlining of its manufacturing operations will position the company competitively in the marketplace 
management believes that the industry will become increasingly competitive  creating downward pressures on gross margins  including those of the company 
the company s goal is to offset this trend by decreasing unit costs  focusing on profitable business relationships and being the industry leader in providing a broad line of quality products with superior service to our customers
