domestic cellular    international cellular paging customers all domestic    the wireless communications businesses are a significant contributor to bellsouth s operations  primarily due to the continued expansion of the customer base for cellular communications services 
domestic cellular customers increased by  since december  while the rate of increase has declined since  the overall penetration rate number of customers as a percentage of the total population in the service territory increased from at december  to at december  total minutes of use have also continued to increase  although average minutes of use per cellular customer declined due to the trend of increased penetration into lower usage market segments 
since december   the number of international cellular customers increased by  to  growth in total minutes of use for international cellular properties remained strong due to demand stimulated by competitive programs  enhanced services and underdeveloped land line service 
paging customers increased by  since december  due primarily to the continued success of the retail distribution program

intrastate access revenues result from the provision of access services to interexchange carriers which provide telecommunications services between latas within a state 
in  intrastate access revenues decreased compared to an increase of in the decrease was due primarily to net rate reductions of  partially offset by growth in minutes of use 
for  the increase was attributable to growth in minutes of use and the reclassification beginning in of independent telephone company settlements in certain states  which would have previously reduced revenues  to operating expenses 
the increase was partially offset by the impact of rate reductions  primarily in alabama and florida 
toll revenues are received from the provision of long distance services within but not between latas 
these services include intralata service beyond the local calling area  wide area telecommunications service wats or services for customers with highly concentrated demand  and special services  such as transport of voice  data and video 
toll revenues decreased in compared to a decrease of in in  the decrease was due primarily to a decline in toll messages of 
the decline in toll messages reflects the expansion of local area calling plans and increased competition from interexchange carriers 
the decrease was primarily attributable to several settlements with independent companies  the reclassification of certain settlements to intrastate access revenue  net rate reductions since december  and the impact of optional extended area calling plans 
the decrease was partially offset by growth in toll message volumes  reflecting improvements related in part to optional calling plans 
the overall decline in toll revenues is expected to continue over the long term 
wireless communications revenues include the revenues from consolidated wireless communications businesses primarily cellular and paging within bellsouth enterprises as well as revenues from interconnections by unaffiliated cellular carriers with bellsouth telecommunications network 
bellsouth s interests in the net income or loss of the unconsolidated wireless businesses within bellsouth enterprises  which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting  are recorded in other income 
wireless communications revenues increased in compared to an increase of in the increases for both years resulted primarily from continued growth of the customer base for wireless services in domestic and international markets 
as discussed in note c to the consolidated financial statements  bellsouth sold its domestic paging subsidiary in january revenues from such paging services  included as a component of wireless communications revenues  were  and in  and  respectively 
consistent with anticipated growth in the overall cellular industry  bellsouth s revenues from cellular services are expected to continue to increase 
however  the rate of growth of such revenues could be adversely affected by competitive pressures on service pricing and market penetration  the continuing effect of an increasingly diversified customer base with lower average usage and the development of new technologies  such as personal communications service pcs 
directory advertising and publishing revenues include revenues derived from publishing  printing and selling advertising in  and performing related services concerning  alphabetical and classified telephone directories 
directory advertising and publishing revenues increased in compared to a increase in the increase was due primarily to increases in the volume of advertising sold and the impact of bellsouth telecommunications adoption of issue basis accounting for directory revenues in connection with the discontinuance of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

other services revenues are principally comprised of revenues from customer premises equipment cpe sales and maintenance services  billing and collection services and other nonregulated services primarily inside wire services offered by bellsouth telecommunications 
other services revenues increased in compared to a decrease of in the increase in was due primarily to reduced levels of revenue reduction accruals related to potential sharing under certain state regulatory plans coupled with the reclassification of certain such accruals to local service revenues  the combined effect of which increased other services revenues by approximately the increase was also due to approximately resulting from higher demand for voice messaging and inside wire services 
the increase was partially offset by a reduction of in revenues from billing and collection services and by approximately related to the sale in april of bellsouth telecommunications out of region cpe sales and service operations 
the slight decrease in was primarily attributable to increased revenue reduction accruals related to potential sharing under certain state regulatory plans and the sale in april of bellsouth telecommunications out of region cpe sales and service operations 
the decrease was substantially offset by higher demand for unregulated products and services  including cpe for residential customers  voice messaging and inside wire services  and the effects of adjustments and reclassifications related to services under certain state regulatory plans and billing and collection services

the increase in was due primarily to higher levels of property  plant and equipment since december  resulting from continued growth in the customer base for wireless and wireline services and continued modernization of the networks 
the increase for the period was partially offset by the expiration of reserve deficiency amortizations in louisiana and the inclusion in of related to extraordinary property retirements in conjunction with a regulatory settlement in florida 
other operating expenses are comprised of cost of services and products and selling  general and administrative 
cost of services and products includes employee and employee related expenses associated with network repair and maintenance  material and supplies expense  cost of tangible goods sold and other expenses associated with providing services 
selling  general and administrative includes expenses related to sales activities such as salaries  commissions  benefits  travel  marketing and advertising expenses and administrative expenses 
other operating expenses increased in compared to an increase of in the increase was due primarily to increased expenses of approximately related to sustained growth in the wireless communications customer base  reflecting additional marketing and operational costs associated with higher levels of sales and expanded operations 
at bellsouth telecommunications  other operating expenses increased  which reflected volume growth that was partially offset by a decrease of approximately for labor costs  including expenses for employee benefits 
the decrease in such labor costs reflects employee reductions attributable to the restructuring plan begun in  partially offset by annual compensation increases for management and represented employees 
the increase in other operating expenses was also attributable to approximately related to growth in the volume of directory advertising sold 
the increase in was primarily attributable to increased expenses related to growth in the wireless communications customer base 
also contributing to the increase were expenses related both to volume growth and network modernization in the core wireline business and  to a lesser extent  volume growth in the directory advertising and publishing businesses 
total employee related costs also increased  reflecting annual compensation increases for management and represented employees  increased overtime attributable to volume growth and network service activities and higher expenses for employee benefits  partially offset by salary and wage savings from employee reductions attributable to the restructuring plan begun in at bellsouth telecommunications and a reduction in pension expense see note i 
the expense increase in was partially offset by the sale in of the out of region cpe sales and service operations and the inclusion in of approximately and  respectively  related to a regulatory settlement in florida and severe weather conditions 
work force reduction restructuring charges 
in the fourth quarter of  bellsouth recognized a pretax charge of  after tax  comprised of after tax related to planned work force reductions by the end of  after tax for expected severance benefit payments after and after tax for additional net curtailment losses related to employee reductions under the restructuring plan initiated in each component of the overall work force reduction charge  as well as the restructuring charge  is discussed below 
work force reduction charge 
in connection with a previously disclosed plan to significantly reduce its work force by the end of  bellsouth recorded a pretax charge of in the fourth quarter of under this plan  bellsouth expects to reduce the work force of the core wireline business by approximately  employees by the end of  including a reduction of employees which occurred in december the work force reduction will be accomplished through the separation of approximately  employees  partially offset by the planned hiring of new employees primarily to replace those not expected to relocate in connection with the consolidation of work locations 
the pretax charge is comprised of approximately under the provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for postemployment benefits  related to those employees who are expected to receive severance benefits under preexisting separation plans  and approximately for curtailment losses under the provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
substantially all of the curtailment losses relate to postretirement benefits other than pensions 
once the plan to reduce  employees is completed  annual employee cost savings are estimated to be approximately such annual savings will be partially offset by increased costs of approximately for outsourced services 
postemployment benefits charge 
the pretax charge of represents estimated future postemployment severance benefits to be paid after  also in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
this component is based on bellsouth s belief that work force reductions will continue under existing separation plans  although at reduced separation benefit levels 
restructuring of telephone operations 
during  bellsouth telecommunications recognized a  restructuring charge in connection with a plan to redesign  consolidate and streamline the fundamental processes and work activities in its telephone operations 
consistent with previously disclosed expectations  the restructuring was completed in  about one year earlier than initially planned 
as a part of the restructuring  bellsouth telecommunications consolidated and centralized its existing operations 
these efforts involved redesign of key work processes and the design of new processes that facilitated the consolidation of service functions and the reduction of  employees 
since inception of the restructuring plan  total employee reductions were approximately  including  since december  as a result of employee reductions in and  employee related expenses  included as a component of operating expenses  for the year were reduced by approximately compared to the level 
the cumulative reduction of  employees since inception of the plan reduced employee related expenses by approximately for the year  the cumulative employee reductions under the plan are projected to reduce employee related expenses by approximately a summary of employee reductions and expenditures through december  under the restructuring plan is as follows total employee reductions     expenditures by component consolidation and elimination of operations systems employee separation total  expenditures by type cash  noncash total  capital expenditures not included in above expenditures total expenditures of  include of additional net curtailment losses resulting from a greater number of retirement eligible employees separating under the plan than originally expected 
these additional net curtailment losses were included in the work force reduction charge discussed above

interest expense other income  net provision for income taxes   interest expense includes interest on debt  certain other accrued liabilities and capital leases  partially offset by interest capitalized as a cost of installing equipment and constructing plant 
interest expense increased in compared to a decrease of in the increase was primarily attributable to higher average interest rates on short term borrowings and higher average debt levels for long term borrowings 
the average interest rate on long term borrowings was slightly lower in compared to  reflecting the initial impact of debt refinancings at more favorable interest rates 
the decrease for resulted primarily from interest savings attributable to refinancings in of long term debt at lower interest rates 
the decrease was partially offset by higher average levels of short term borrowings at higher average interest rates 
other income  net includes earnings and losses from unconsolidated subsidiaries  businesses and partnerships  gains and losses from the sale of operations  interest and dividend income  and minority interests 
other income  net increased in compared to an increase of in the increase in included a increase in interest income and in lower net minority interest deductions 
equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates was in compared to in the lower losses reflect a reduction in losses in the mobile data communications businesses and higher income from domestic cellular operations  partially offset by increased losses from certain developing international businesses  principally operations in germany and israel 
the increase in other income was also attributable to a increase in miscellaneous income related to nonstrategic business activities 
the increases in other income were partially offset by a gain of in  as discussed below 
the increase in reflected an aggregate gain of from the sale of two international cellular investments and a increase in interest income 
the increases were partially offset by a increase in net minority interest deductions 
equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated affiliates was in compared to in the overall loss reflects increased losses attributable to developing operations  principally the mobile data communications businesses and  to a lesser extent  the cellular business in germany and the long distance telecommunications business in chile

provision for income taxes decreased in compared to an increase of in bellsouth s effective tax rates were  and in  and  respectively 
a reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rates to these effective tax rates is provided in note l 
a discussion of the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  also is included therein 
extraordinary losses discontinuance of sfas no 
as a result of its continuing regulatory and marketplace assessments  bellsouth telecommunications concluded that it is no longer appropriate to prepare its external financial results using the accounting method required for regulated enterprises 
bellsouth telecommunications believes that based on recent changes in the regulatory framework and the increasing level of competition  it was required to discontinue sfas no 
for financial reporting purposes 
discontinuance was required because most of bellsouth telecommunications revenues will not be generated under cost based regulation and because it is doubtful that regulated rates sufficient to recover the net book value of telephone plant could be charged to and collected from customers due to the expected levels of future competition 
accordingly  in the second quarter of  bellsouth telecommunications discontinued application of sfas no 
and recorded a noncash extraordinary charge of  net of a deferred tax benefit of 
the extraordinary charge reflects  after tax to reduce the recorded value of long lived telephone plant and equipment  all of which was within the regulatory framework  to the level appropriate for nonregulated enterprises 
the overall charge was partially offset by related to the method by which bellsouth telecommunications reports its directory publishing revenues  related to the elimination of regulatory assets and liabilities and for the partial acceleration of unamortized investment tax credits associated with the reductions in asset carrying values and in asset lives 
recent changes in its regulatory framework and the simultaneous elimination of legal and regulatory barriers for its competitors both support discontinuance of sfas no 
in the regulatory arena  implementation of price regulation has been and continues to be a cornerstone in bellsouth telecommunications corporate strategy 
due in part to this strategy  changes in the regulatory framework are now being implemented see operating environment and trends of the business 
as a result of such changes  a significant portion of bellsouth telecommunications revenue will no longer be regulated based on the recovery of specific costs 
furthermore  bellsouth telecommunications expects that competition in its local exchange markets will accelerate 
the removal of legal and regulatory barriers is expected to encourage potential competitors to accelerate deployment of competing networks to either compete directly for local service or to bypass the bellsouth telecommunications network for long distance access 
potential competitors have continued to make investments in wireless licenses  cable properties and enhanced interexchange networks  which serves as further evidence of increased competition 
in connection with the discontinuance of sfas no 
 the average depreciable lives of significant categories of long lived telephone plant were reduced to more closely reflect the economic and technological lives 
the application of such shorter lives does not result in a material increase in depreciation expense 
see note b to the consolidated financial statements 
early extinguishment of debt 
during and  bellsouth telecommunications recognized extraordinary losses of net of a current tax benefit of and net of a current tax benefit of  respectively  related to the early extinguishment of outstanding debt issues

while current liabilities exceeded current assets at both december  and  bellsouth s sources of funds primarily from operations and  to the extent necessary  from readily available external financing arrangements are sufficient to meet all current obligations on a timely basis

bellsouth s debt to total capitalization ratio  adjusted to exclude the of debentures redeemed in january  increased to at december  from at december  the increase was mostly caused by the reduction in equity due to the extraordinary loss from the discontinuance of sfas no 
derivative activities 
bellsouth is party to foreign exchange forward contracts  currency swap agreements and interest rate swap agreements in its normal course of business for hedging purposes 
these financial instruments are used to mitigate foreign currency and interest rate risks  although to some extent they expose the company to market and credit risks 
the credit risks associated with these instruments are controlled through the evaluation and continual monitoring of the creditworthiness of the counterparties 
in the event that a counterparty fails to meet the terms of a contract or agreement  bellsouth s exposure is limited to the currency rate or interest rate differential  not the full notional amount 
such contracts and agreements have been executed with creditworthy financial institutions whose credit ratings are generally aa aa or higher 
as such  bellsouth considers the risk of nonperformance to be remote 
see note o to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
operating environment and trends of the business regulatory environment 
in providing telecommunications services  bellsouth telecommunications is subject to regulation by both state and federal regulators with respect to rates  services and other issues 
bellsouth s primary regulatory focus continues to be directed toward modifying the regulatory process to one that is more closely aligned with changing market conditions and overall public policy objectives 
bellsouth believes that price regulation  whereby prices of basic local exchange services are regulated based on factors other than rate of return and prices for other products and services are based on market factors  is a logical progression to competitive fairness and provides advantages for consumers 
while price regulation plans limit the amount of increases in prices for specified services  such plans enhance the company s ability to adjust prices and service options to more effectively respond to changing market conditions and competition and enable it to more fully benefit from productivity enhancements 
price regulation plans have been approved or authorized by the requisite legislative or regulatory bodies in alabama  florida although a sharing requirement exists at least through  georgia  kentucky  mississippi  south carolina and tennessee  and approval of a plan is pending in north carolina 
in addition  bellsouth telecommunications has filed a proposed price regulation plan in louisiana 
at the federal level  bellsouth telecommunications is operating under an interim price regulation plan established by the federal communications commission fcc in this plan provided a productivity option  which bellsouth telecommunications selected  that eliminated both earnings limitations and sharing requirements 
the fcc is expected to consider further the interim rules as well as other issues related to competition  streamlined regulation and other matters contained in the telecommunications act of the act 
a final order is expected to be issued in economy 
the nation s output of goods and services  which grew in  expanded in employment in nonfarm business establishments grew during the year and the unemployment rate averaged 
the nine state region served by bellsouth telecommunications wireline telephone business outperformed the nation again in the number of jobs in nonfarm businesses grew as the unemployment rate averaged for the year 
real income expanded at an estimated rate 
net in migration added approximately  persons  accounting for half of the region s population growth 
the demand for telecommunications services in the region reflected the strength of its economic and population growth 
while the economic expansion is expected to continue through  boosted in georgia in particular by the olympic games to be held in july and august  tight labor markets  slow labor force growth and modest productivity growth will likely result in slower output growth 
its cost advantages and strong net in migration promise to keep the region s economic performance comparatively better than the nation s and to bring increased demand for telecommunications services 
the increasing competition faced by bellsouth telecommunications and the growing percentage of revenues from bellsouth enterprises make bellsouth s financial performance more susceptible to changes in the economy than previously  as its operations reflect the more competitive business environment and the greater demand elasticities for its products and services 
competition 
developments in the telecommunications marketplace continue to indicate that a technological convergence is occurring in the telephone  cable and broadcast television  computer  entertainment and information services industries 
the technologies utilized and being developed in these industries are able to provide multiple and integrated communications offerings 
a number of large companies  including at t corp 
at t and the other major interexchange carriers  other bell holding companies and cable and other video and entertainment companies  have completed acquisitions and entered into business alliances that will ultimately intensify and expand competition for local and toll communications and other services currently provided over bellsouth s networks 
other competitors have announced plans to build  and in certain locations have begun construction of  local phone connections and private networks that would permit business and residential customers to bypass the facilities of local telephone companies  including those of bellsouth telecommunications in certain cities in its service territory 
in conjunction with the approval of state price regulation plans  competition for local service has been authorized by legislative or regulatory action in alabama  florida  georgia  north carolina and tennessee  and proceedings to consider local service competition are pending in kentucky  louisiana and mississippi 
in addition  the act preempts state legislative and regulatory barriers to competition for local telephone service  subject only to competitively neutral requirements to assure quality service consistent with public safety  convenience and consumer welfare 
at t  mci telecommunications corporation mci  u s west  inc u s west and a number of other carriers have filed applications and have announced their intent to provide local service in many of the areas in which bellsouth telecommunications provides service 
the new legislation allows for the bell holding companies  including bellsouth  to compete for interlata toll business in states outside their local service territories prior to the time that such companies can offer interlata toll services in states within their local service territories 
bellsouth expects bell holding companies and interexchange carriers  including at t and mci  to compete for interlata toll service and local service business 
those competitors that choose to provide local service predominantly over their own facilities may bundle local and toll service offerings 
such services could be provided before bellsouth becomes eligible to provide interlata service within the states in its region 
notwithstanding the risks associated with increased competition  bellsouth will have opportunities to benefit from entry into new business markets 
for example  the presence of competition will allow the entry by bellsouth into interlata wireline businesses under provisions contained in the new federal telecommunications legislation 
bellsouth believes that in order to remain competitive in the future  it must aggressively pursue a corporate strategy of expanding its offerings beyond its traditional businesses and markets 
these offerings may include interlata services  information services and video and electronic commerce services 
as a part of this strategy  bellsouth is conducting a trial of video dial tone services  acquiring broadband pcs licenses in certain areas of its wireline territories  and forming business alliances and partnerships  both domestically and internationally  related to the provision of interactive and traditional video programming services as well as wireless and wireline communications services 
as a result of the act  bellsouth is freed from many of the laws  regulations and judicial restrictions including the modification of final judgment that constrained the provision of voice  data and video communications throughout its wireline service territory and elsewhere
