item  management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the company has historically engaged in providing support services engineering  technical  and airport management to agencies of the united states government  government prime contractors  and local government agencies 
during the past two years  the company  through its subsidiary  comarco wireless technologies  inc  has invested more of its resources in developing products for the wireless communications industry 
this effort has resulted in comarco realizing well over of its operating income from this business area 
summarized financial information by business segment for the company s fiscal year  which ended january   is as follows wireless government communications contracting and corporate and other products other revenue total dollars in thousands revenues    operating income    identifiable assets     wireless communications products the company s wireless communications products business is presently comprised of three product families field measurement products  revenue assurance products and wireless applications products 
o field measurement products provide a method for benchmarking and analyzing the performance of wireless system networks as they are perceived by customers 
the field measurement product line includes the generation ii cellular survey system  the nes real time rf tool  the nrs network readiness system  and a new line of cdpd data survey products 
o the revenue assurance product line includes system products and services that test the integrity of cellullar carriers billing systems 
o wireless applications products include emergency callbox systems and wireless data telemetry systems 
emergency callbox systems are distributed through gte with more than  units produced  of which approximately  were produced in the last year 
the cellular data gateway is a new wireless product that is used to transport data and is optimized for wide area applications 
comarco wireless technologies revenues increased to of the company s total revenue in fiscal year  a increase over the prior fiscal year 
operating income increased year to year and represented of comarco s consolidated operating income for fiscal year continued growth in comarco wireless revenues and income is predicated on a number of factors  including the continued success of the company s product development efforts  a geographical expansion to international markets and continued acceptance of the company s products by its customers  none of which can be assured 
product development as part of its product development program  the company is continuing its software product development program in its wireless communications business 
because a common thread of technology runs through all comarco wireless product lines  the company believes that it can leverage its investment and maintain the focus and concentration of its technical and marketing resources 
the company in general has been developing and continues to plan to develop products that will be compatible with all wireless communications air interfaces worldwide 
this program resulted in five new product offerings during fiscal year  and six new product releases in fiscal year the company s product life cycle is estimated to be two to five years  depending on the product 
the company plans to continue to invest substantially in product development efforts 
its products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving standards  and continuous improvements in products and services 
the company s future prospects will depend in part on its ability to enhance the functionality of its existing products in a timely and cost effective manner and to identify  develop  and achieve market acceptance of new products that address new technologies and standards and meet customer needs in the wireless communications marketplace 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to respond to technological advances  changes in customer requirements  or changes in regulatory requirements or industry standards  and any significant delays in development  introduction or shipment of products  or achievement of acceptable product costs  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
as part of its product development program  the company is continuing its software product development program in its wireless communications business 
during fiscal year and fiscal year  the company capitalized approximately million and million of software product development costs  respectively  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards number  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
of the amounts capitalized  million and  respectively  were amortized in fiscal years and against product sales in accordance with statement in addition  during fiscal years   and  comarco wireless had expenditures of   and  respectively  for research and development expenses includes company sponsored software development costs prior to determination of technological feasibility on current and anticipated products 
backlog the value of unfilled orders at comarco wireless as of january  is approximately million  compared to million as of january  the current year balance consists of million of product orders and million of deferred revenue for basic and extended warranty commitments 
approximately of this value will result in revenue during fiscal year in general  most of the company s orders are filled within months from the receipt of the order 
seasonality comarco wireless has experienced in each of the past three years a seasonal fluctuation in wireless communications products activity  with greater sales in the third and fourth quarters of its fiscal year and lesser amounts in the first and second quarters 
this fluctuation may or may not continue due to a number of factors  including the timing  cancellation  or delay of customer orders  the timing of new product introductions by the company or its competitors  the size of customers capital budgets  which are the traditional source of customer funding for the purchase of the company s products  market acceptance of the company and its customers products  and other competitive factors 
therefore  the nature of the wireless communications products business is inherently unpredictable and sales and profits may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
marketing  sales distribution comarco wireless maintains its own internal sales force for the marketing and sales of the company s product offerings in the united states 
the company is establishing a network of agents and distributors for the coordination of sales activity outside of the united states 
this product and geographical expansion into europe is well underway and expansion into asia is expected to begin in earnest in the later part of fiscal year this expansion overseas faces a number of inherent barriers  including the need for export licenses  tariffs and other potential trade restrictions including the need to be iso certified  and changes in laws governing the imposition of duties  quotas  taxes  or other charges relating to the import or export of its products 
the company currently has limited experience in penetrating the foreign marketplace and  therefore  companies having a presence or already doing business overseas may have an advantage 
capital requirements comarco wireless working capital needs primarily consist of the cost of the upfront product development effort required to expand the company s product offerings  inventory requirements including long lead time materials  and the financing of accounts receivable  which will generally become longer upon the company s planned geographical expansion into europe and asia 
certain components used by the company in its existing products are only available from single sources  and certain other components are presently available or acquired only from a limited number of suppliers 
in the event that any of its single source suppliers are unable to fulfill company requirements or discontinue the manufacture of a key component  the company may experience an interruption in production 
the radio interface devices designed into the company s products are key purchased components whose lack of availability could have a material adverse impact on sales and profits 
working capital requirements are expected to be financed from operations and the financial resources of the company 
technical requirements comarco wireless is selling its products into a market that is growing rapidly and technological obsolescence and market timing of product introductions is critical for success 
in the development of new or expanded product offerings  the company s access to the technical design of air interface devices is essential for the company to anticipate and develop compatible wireless communications products 
the inability to obtain the technical designs on a timely basis will have a direct impact on product design and schedule and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
employees as of april   comarco wireless employed approximately employees 
the company believes its employee relations to be good 
the majority of the company s employees are professional or technical personnel having training and experience in engineering  computer science  and management 
the company s future success depends in large part on the continued service of its key technical  marketing  and management personnel  and on its ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees  particularly those highly skilled design  process  and test engineers involved in the development of new products 
the competition for such personnel is intense  and the loss of key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
recognizing this reality  the company has instituted a long term incentive stock option plan for key comarco wireless employees  whereby they will directly participate in the success of comarco wireless see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company obtains its employees through a variety of means including advertisements  engineering recruiters  and engineering temporary help firms 
competition comarco wireless competes in a small niche field measurement equipment of the wireless communications marketplace and believes it may be the domestic market leader for most of its products 
the business is competitive and there are other companies  many of which are larger and have greater financial resources  who provide or could provide the same type of products 
the ability of the company to compete successfully depends upon a number of factors  including the rate at which customers accept the company s products in overseas markets  product quality and performance  experienced sales and marketing personnel  rapid development of new products and features  evolving industry standards  and the number and nature of the company s competitors 
the company believes there are companies that provide or have the ability to provide the products the company is planning for overseas users 
also  companies having a presence or already doing business overseas may have an advantage in knowing how to penetrate those markets 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future 
proprietary information the company has one patent for its small power adapter for portable computing devices 
however  the company currently relies primarily on a combination of trade secrets  copyrights  trademarks  and contractual rights to protect its intellectual property in the wireless products area 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company will be adequate to deter misappropriation or impede third party development of its technology 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries in which the company s products may be sold do not protect the company s intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
the failure of the company to protect its proprietary information could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition

in addition  during fiscal year and  the company had expenditures of  and  respectively  for research and development expenses includes company sponsored software product development costs prior to determination of technological feasibility in this business area 
backlog the company s backlog from government contracting and other revenue believed to be firm as of january  was million  compared to million as of january  the primary reason for the decrease year to year is due to the completion of the contract with the naval air warfare center  china lake  california  as well as the fact that the company had no other major contract recompetitions during fiscal year the source of backlog is primarily contracts with the us and local governments 
government contracts normally have a base and option periods totalling three to five years in duration 
in many instances  government entities must issue work orders  delivery orders  or task orders prior to the company commencing work 
these entities have the discretion to terminate any contract at their convenience  and are normally obligated only to pay for costs incurred to date under a contract 
in addition  these entities may elect to remove funding previously attached to a contract 
many of the company s contracts are multi year  with options to provide services for additional periods of time 
there can be no assurances that the government entities will exercise the options  will not withdraw funds already committed  nor that the entities will fund the unfunded portions of the company s contracts 
it is estimated that more than of the firm backlog will be realized in fiscal year government contracts the majority of the company s total revenues approximately in fy  in fy  and in fy were derived from contracts with the united states government  principally agencies of the department of defense 
a significant portion of the company s revenue is derived from contracts with the us navy 
should changes in procurement policies or reductions in government expenditures occur  revenue and the income of the company could be adversely affected see management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 
the company s government contracts business is not seasonal  however variations may occur at the expiration of major contracts until such contracts are renewed or new contracts obtained 
in the course of the company s business  its contracts are periodically opened for competition 
currently  of the company s fiscal year government contracting and other revenues after exclusion of the china lake contract are in recompetition or are planned for recompetition in fiscal year in addition  the company s contract with the naval air warfare center  china lake  california  which represented of the company s fiscal year revenues  ran through november and will not generate any revenue in fiscal year the company plans to aggressively compete for its existing work and selectively pursue other high value government procurements 
as of april  the company has outstanding proposals valued at approximately million for recompetition or new efforts with governmental agencies 
there can be no assurance that the company will be selected and awarded work under these outstanding proposals 
competition in excess of of the company s government contracting and other revenue business is awarded through competitive procurements 
government contracting services industries consist of thousands of companies  many of which are larger and have greater financial resources than the company  who can provide the same type of services 
the business is highly competitive 
the company obtains much of its business on the basis of submitted proposals to new and existing customers 
competition generally centers on price  past performance  technical capability  management plan  and personnel 
there is no single company that competes directly with the company on all of the company s services and products

wireless communications products wireless communications products revenues increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year wireless communications products revenues comprised approximately of total company revenues during fiscal year  up from in the prior fiscal year 
this increase is due to increased sales of the company s network evaluation and revenue assurance systems to major cellular telephone carriers 
during the year the company continued to broaden its product line with the introduction of its second generation of field measurement equipment  including products supporting the amps  tdma  namps  etacs and gsm air interfaces 
revenues from sales of callboxes were minimal during fiscal year as states other than california have not yet progressed past the field testing stage of these units 
operating income from wireless communications products increased year to year  comprising of comarco s total operating income for fiscal year summary operating results for comarco wireless technologies  inc  the company s wireless communications products subsidiary  are as follows january  january  revenues   cost of products sold   gross margin   percentage indirect costs   operating income   indirect costs include selling  general and administrative expenses  as well as research and development expenses 
the increased gross margin percentage is due to the incremental benefit of spreading the fixed costs of operations over a larger activity base and the ability to obtain economic order buys on component materials 
the increase in indirect costs  excluding research and development expenses  are in line with the increase in revenues 
research and development expense totaled million during fiscal year  compared to  in the prior fiscal year 
the substantial increase year to year is due to a concerted effort by the company in fiscal year  to accelerate the expansion of both its product development program and its efforts to upgrade its existing product line 
the company continues to view the next few years as a window of opportunity to expand its product line to take advantage of the worldwide growth in this market 
the company plans to continue to invest heavily in new product development 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in generating future revenues from such development efforts 
operating income increased to million in fiscal year from million in the prior fiscal year 
operating income as a percentage of revenues is for fiscal year  compared to for the comparable prior period 
the increase is due to the improvement in gross margin percentage noted above  which was partially offset by an increase in indirect costs  as discussed above 
as part of its product development program  the company is continuing its software product development program in it wireless communications products business 
in accordance with financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  the company capitalized and amortized million and million  respectively  during fiscal year the company capitalized and amortized million and  in fiscal year  respectively 
these amounts are in addition to the research and development expense discussed above 
the company s orders for wireless communications products totaled million for fiscal year  up from million during fiscal year the value of unfilled orders at january  totaled million 
an additional million of deferred revenue has been recorded for anticipated customer warranty obligations 
the company has experienced fluctuations in wireless communications products activity in each of the past three years  with greater sales in the second half of its fiscal year and lesser amounts in the first half 
this trend may or may not continue as the company broadens its product offerings 
the nature of the wireless communications products business is inherently less predictable than the company s traditional government contracting business as the company will normally not have a significant amount of unfilled orders at the end of a period 
therefore  sales levels and profits are more difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
government contracting and other revenue revenues provided by the company s traditional government contracting services business area decreased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year revenues for government contracting services for fiscal year comprised of the company s total revenues compared with in the prior year 
this decrease is primarily due to the reduced activity in the company s contracts with the naval air warfare center at china lake  california and the army s software development center at ft 
lee  virginia 
the china lake contract substantially ended on september  and accounted for approximately of the company s total revenues and approximately of total government contracting revenues during fiscal year and will not generate any revenue in fiscal year this contract also accounted for approximately of the company s total operating income and approximately of total government contracting operating income during fiscal year the loss of this contract required the company to reduce the indirect organization supporting this business in line with the reduced revenue base 
sales to the us government as well as to government prime contractors were and of the company s total revenue during the fourth quarter and the fiscal year ended january   respectively 
in the course of the company s business  its government contracts are periodically opened for competition 
approximately of the company s current government contracting services revenues will either end or will be open for competition during fiscal year the company plans to aggressively compete for all work opened for competition to the extent possible and selectively pursue certain high value government procurements 
as of april  the company has outstanding proposals valued at approximately million for recompetition or new efforts with government agencies 
there can be no assurance that the company will be selected and awarded the work associated with these outstanding proposals 
in addition  government agencies may terminate their contracts in whole or in part at their convenience 
government agencies may remove funding previously provided or may not exercise option periods 
therefore  there can be no assurance that the government will fund the portions of existing contracts that are unfunded  or that the governmental agencies will exercise any options 
operating income revenues less direct costs  indirect costs  and depreciation and amortization for government contracting services is down year to year from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year the reduced operating income is primarily due to the operating loss of million incurred by the company s software products line in fiscal year the operating loss is due to a concerted effort on the company s part to complete a comprehensive repositioning of the case tool products 
because the project took longer and cost more than anticipated  the company believes sales were delayed awaiting the release of new product 
the upgraded product was released on february  in addition to completing the project  the company took other steps to reorganize this product line during the latter part of fiscal year including having this software products group report to the government business organization 
net interest income interest income  less amortization of offering costs and interest expense for fiscal year totaled  compared to  for the prior fiscal year 
the increase is principally due to the retirement of the company s remaining convertible subordinated debentures and accelerated amortization of offering costs related to the company s purchase of its convertible subordinated debentures during the first quarters of fiscal years and  as well as higher available investable balances year to year 
the company recorded accelerated offering cost amortization of  and  in fiscal years and  respectively 
the company retired the remaining  of its convertible subordinated debentures on april   leaving no outstanding debt as of january  the company s effective tax rate is for fiscal year versus for the previous fiscal year 
the increased effective tax rate is due to a reduced level of current tax credits available to offset income taxes on current taxable income 
the overall increase in net income from the prior year is primarily due to the significant increase in sales of wireless communications products at a higher operating income margin and increased investment net earnings  partially offset by the operating loss incurred by the company s software products business and a higher effective income tax rate 
new accounting standards in march  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards  no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of statement 
statement requires that the company review its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
to the extent that the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from an asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized based on the difference between the asset s carrying amount and its fair market value 
the company is required to adopt statement as of february  in the opinion of company management  the adoption of statement will not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation statement 
statement recommends  but does not require  the adoption of a fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation of employees  including common stock options

the company currently intends to continue recording stock based compensation to employees under the intrinsic value method and does not intend to adopt the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation to employees as permitted by statement certain pro forma disclosures will be required in the company s financial statements for the year ending january  as if the fair value based method had been adopted 
fiscal year ended january  compared to fiscal year ended january  the company is involved in two distinct business areas development and manufacture of wireless communications products  and providing government contracting services primarily to government entities 
fiscal year revenues totaled million  up from the prior year 
increased year to year revenue is primarily due to o sales of the company s wireless communications products  including various field measurement and revenue assurance systems to major cellular carriers  o increased efforts providing testing of ci systems and field test instrumentation as part of joint ventures at the joint interoperability test command  ft

in august  the company was notified that it was not selected in the contract competition with the naval air warfare center nawc at china lake  california 
the company and two other companies submitted protests to their elimination from the recompetition 
based on these protests  the navy reinstated all of the protesting companies  including comarco  to the competition 
the navy issued an extension on the company s contract to continue work at the naval air warfare center at china lake through may  with an option to extend through september the company s current contract in this location accounted for approximately of the company s revenues in fiscal year and of the company s fiscal year fourth quarter revenues 
since most of the costs associated with this contract are directly attributable to the contract  the company currently anticipates that there will be few residual costs not reimbursed by the customer 
if the company is not successful in the recompetition of this contract  it will have a material adverse effect on operations which will require appropriate organizational changes and cost reduction efforts 
wireless communications products wireless communications products revenues increased to million for fiscal year  up from million in the prior fiscal year 
this increase is due to increased sales of the company s network evaluation and revenue assurance systems to major cellular telephone carriers 
revenues from sales of callboxes were minimal during fiscal year  as states other than california were only at the field testing stage of these units 
if these other states move forward and select the company s units  production of units may return in fiscal year  although there can be no assurance that production will resume 
in accordance with financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  the company capitalized and amortized million and 
million  respectively  of software product development costs related to wireless communications products during fiscal year orders for wireless communications products increased to million during fiscal year  as compared to orders of million received during fiscal year the value of unfilled orders at january  totaled million 
operating income revenues less direct costs  indirect costs  and depreciation and amortization from wireless communications products increased by to million for fiscal year from 
million in the prior year 
operating income as a percentage of revenue for wireless communication products improved to of revenue in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increased operating income margin is due to the impact of spreading the fixed costs of this operation over a larger revenue base 
government contracting and other revenues the company s traditional business of providing engineering services to the us government and other government entities declined to of the company s revenues in fiscal year from and in fiscal years and  respectively 
the company experienced a decline in defense related activity of approximately during fiscal year the company anticipates that continued government budgetary pressures will result in continued erosion in fiscal year the company s contract at the naval air warfare center in china lake  california  which has a current expiration date including options of september  has experienced a decrease in activity of approximately from last fiscal year 
this decrease in revenue is due to a reduction in government funding available for projects at the naval air warfare center 
notwithstanding this decline in revenue  the company s performance grades on many government contracts  including the contract at the naval air warfare center  china lake  california  which determine the percentage of profit the company receives on the contracts  have steadily improved 
except as noted above  the company s other defense related activity has been steady during fiscal year in the course of the company s business  its government contracts are periodically opened for competition 
the company s contracts with the naval air warfare centers in china lake and point mugu  california are currently under a combined recompetition that includes these two contracts plus a number of other companies contracts 
these two contracts accounted for approximately of the company s revenues in fiscal year an award decision is expected during the summer of there can be no assurance that the company will be selected in this recompetition 
if the company is not successful  it will have a material adverse effect on operations that will require appropriate organizational changes and cost reduction efforts 
operating income revenues less direct cost  indirect costs and depreciation and amortization remained level at million or operating income as a percentage or revenue  on the same amount of revenues year to year
