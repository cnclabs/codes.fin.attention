item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general fluctuations in premiums charged by insurance companies have a material effect on the insurance brokerage industry 
commission revenues are based on a percentage of the premiums paid by the insured and generally follow premium levels 
since the mid s  lower premium rates and excess capacity have prevailed among property and casualty insurance carriers resulting in heavy competition for market share 
this soft market ie generally lower premium rates has generally resulted in flat to reduced renewal commissions during the period 
over the past three years  the united states and the world have experienced catastrophes ranging from severe hurricanes to devastating earthquakes 
extraordinarily high losses associated with these events appear to have had a generally limited impact on the insurance industry 
turmoil continues at lloyd s of london raising doubt about its long term viability 
in the past year  there have been substantial mergers and a consolidation within the insurance industry 
rates for workers compensation coverage have generally been reduced 
in recent years  low interest rates have reduced interest income earned on invested funds 
throughout all of this  there has generally been little change in property casualty rates 
excess capacity remains and the competitive environment continues 
it is management s view that for the foreseeable future  insurance pricing will not change significantly 
growth of the alternative insurance market has continued  albeit more slowly in recent years  notwithstanding the soft market conditions 
the company believes this move from the traditional approach of purchasing insurance will continue regardless of the property casualty pricing environment and anticipates that sales in the risk management  benefits and self insurance services areas will again be a major contributor to fee revenue growth in historically  inflation has contributed to increased property replacement costs and higher litigation awards causing some clients to seek higher levels of insurance coverage 
these factors have the effect of generating higher premiums to customers and higher commissions to the company 
more recently  however  the united states has experienced low rates of inflation along with business downsizing  reduced sales and lower payrolls 
these events have resulted in lower levels of exposure to insure 
in general  premium rates have had a greater effect on the company s revenues than inflation
