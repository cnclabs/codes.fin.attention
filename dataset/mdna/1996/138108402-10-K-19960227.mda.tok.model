the spring season will require that landscape maintenance expend funds for labor and materials in advance of billings as the business gears up for the summer months

average collection time for accounts receivables improved by during fiscal over management believes available working capital lines of credit  as well as positive cash flow contributions from the company s operating segments  will be sufficient to cover cash flow requirements for the company for the next months
