see item  business general 
liquidity and capital resources the company s operations require a substantial line of letters of credit to cover its customers orders 
the company s credit facility provides for an overall facility of million for letters of credit  including up to million in revolving funds 
this facility expires october  management believes that this facility will be extended for several additional years and will be revised appropriately to meet current financial requirements 
working capital at june  was million as compared to million at july   a decline of million 
operating activities in fiscal provided million in funds 
in fiscal  such activities required million 
this improvement in cash flow from operations resulted essentially from substantial decreases in accounts receivable and inventories and an increase in accrued expenses and customers deposits 
in the current fiscal year  investing activities used  as compared to usage of  in the prior year 
as a result  cash and cash equivalents increased by million to total million at june  as compared to million at july  seasonality and other factors there are certain seasonal factors that may affect the company s business 
traditionally  manufacturing businesses in italy close for the month of august  and the company s customers close for one week in july 
consequently  no shipments or deliveries  as the case may be  of machines distributed by the company that are manufactured in italy are made during these periods which fall in the company s first quarter 
in addition  manufacturing businesses in italy generally close for two weeks in december  during the company s second quarter 
fluctuations of customer orders or other factors may result in quarterly variations in net revenues from year to year 
effects of inflation and changing prices management believes that inflation has not had a material effect on the company s operations 
a substantial portion of the company s machine and spare part purchases are denominated and payable in italian lira 
currency fluctuations of the lira could result in substantial price level changes and therefore impede or promote import export sales and substantially impact profits 
however  to reduce exposure to adverse foreign currency fluctuations during the period from customer orders to payment for goods sold  the company enters into forward exchange contracts 
the company is not able to assess the quantitative effect that such currency fluctuations could have upon the company s operations 
there can be no assurance that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will not have a significant adverse effect on future operations
