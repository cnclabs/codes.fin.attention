loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net loss cayenne s operating results for the years ended june   and were significantly adversely affected by the continuing market trends of cayenne customers moving from mainframe development towards client server and similar computing platforms  together with cayenne s efforts to respond to those trends 
in particular  cayenne s business operations in fiscal were significantly adversely affected by the severing of substantially all of its relationships with ibm 
cayenne historically relied significantly on its relationship with ibm for development and marketing of cayenne s products 
prior to fiscal  cayenne s products were designed primarily for organizations that employ ibm and ibm compatible mainframe computers  the mvs operating system and the db relational database management system 
as a result  the market for cayenne s products has been directly affected by declines in the acceptance of those ibm and ibm compatible products 
prior to january  cayenne was a member of ibm s international alliances for ad cycle  systemview and information warehouse 
cayenne also maintained a close technical relationship with ibm  which provided cayenne with access to technical information concerning certain current and planned developments in ibm products and systems 
ibm marketed cayenne s products in the united states  canada  puerto rico and austria prior to july  and continues to be a non exclusive distributor of cayenne s products in certain asia pacific countries and switzerland 
while cayenne expects that its broadened focus will benefit cayenne in the long term  there can be no assurance that the foregoing events will not materially adversely affect either the success with which cayenne develops  supports and sells products for use with ibm and ibm compatible computers and systems or the extent to which ibm continues to be a customer of cayenne 
the foregoing events may limit cayenne s ability to compete as effectively in the ibm and ibm compatible market  particularly with companies that continue to be members of ibm s international alliances 
historically  cayenne relied significantly on its relationship with ibm for development and marketing of cayenne s products 
ibm was cayenne s single largest customer in each of fiscal  and when revenue from ibm including license and maintenance fees paid by ibm in connection with its own use of cayenne products  as well as amounts paid by ibm as a distributor and systems integrator accounted for  and of cayenne s total revenue  respectively 
revenues as the company continues its migration from providing tools focused solely on mainframe application development to supporting customers needs for a more open and flexible set of solutions aimed at the growing client server market  it faces many challenges 
the company has addressed some of these challenges during the past two fiscal years by introducing additional products targeted at the client server market 
the company plans to continue to enhance its product offerings through development efforts  strategic alliances and acquisitions to improve its competitive position 
the actions necessary to execute this transition have had an adverse effect on the company s operating results during fiscal  and in july  the company acquired cadre  thereby expanding its product offerings and customer base 
cayenne s revenues currently are derived from three sources i fees for the perpetual license of cayenne s proprietary software products  ii fees from sales of consulting and education services  and iii maintenance fees for maintaining  supporting and providing periodic upgrades of cayenne s software products 
the following table sets forth the amount of revenue derived by cayenne  by source  for each period indicated and the percentage change in such amounts as compared to the prior period percent change year to year year ended june  compared compared to to dollars in thousands software license united states    italy    export sales from united states  rest of world    total software license    consulting and education services united states    italy    rest of world   total consulting and education services    maintenance united states    italy   rest of world    total maintenance    total revenues    compared to software licenses 
software license revenue for fiscal amounted to  compared to  for fiscal  an increase of 
this increase resulted primarily from a series of significant orders in the quarter ended december  from a major italian systems integrator for the company s mainframe based products 
these orders accounted for approximately of total software license revenue for the fiscal year ended june  revenue continues to be impacted by aggressive efforts of cayenne customers to move away from traditional  centralized mainframe development towards client server and similar computing platforms 
client server product license revenue accounted for of license revenue for the year ended june   compared to for the year ended june  client server product license revenue represented approximately of software license revenue for the quarter ended june  versus for the comparable period of the prior fiscal year

consulting and education services 
total consulting and education revenue in fiscal decreased over the preceding year by  or 
consulting and education revenue in italy increased  while united states revenue declined by approximately for the year ended june  compared to the prior fiscal year

the decrease in the united states consulting and education revenue is attributable to decreased demand together with reduced staffing in this area 
training courses are offered for each of cayenne s major products 
typically  consulting and education revenue follows the trend of software license revenue and  therefore  the decline in license revenue experienced in the united states has caused the consulting and education revenue also to decline in fiscal from fiscal maintenance 
maintenance revenue for annual maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
the increase in maintenance revenue in italy resulted from increased penetration of the international markets along with an increase in the portion of the customer base that renewed maintenance contracts 
the decrease in maintenance revenue in the united states resulted primarily from the aforementioned market place migration to client server tools and fewer customers renewing their maintenance contracts on mainframe based tools 
the aggressive migration from mainframe to client server products has resulted in an increased number of customers not renewing their maintenance contracts 
the company s client server products were introduced late in fiscal and have not offset the mainframe decline

on june   cayenne had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
on june   the company amended and restated its revolving credit agreement with a bank to borrow up to  increasing to  upon achievement of profitability

the loan is secured by all of the assets of the company and any borrowing amounts are tied to a percentage of qualified accounts receivable outstanding at the time of any borrowing 
the financial covenants include the attainment of certain specified levels of consolidated net income loss at the end of each quarter  tangible net worth generally defined as the excess of tangible net assets of the company over total liabilities excluding any outstanding redeemable preferred stock at the end of each quarter and month  and liquidity generally defined as cash and cash equivalents plus eligible domestic accounts receivable and eligible international accounts receivable less any indebtedness to the bank at the end of each month

included in the estimated charge is approximately million of employee related termination expenses  million of legal  accounting  broker and other professional fees  million of facility closure and consolidation expenses  and million of other miscellaneous expenses associated with the consolidation of the two companies and the company name change 
in conjunction with the merger  the company guaranteed a  advance made to cadre by silicon valley bank which was applied against the company s borrowing base under its credit agreement 
with the additional million the company raised in its september private placement and its revolving credit agreement  the company anticipates that existing cash balances and funds generated from operations will provide sufficient cash resources to finance its current operations  including cadre  and projected capital expenditures through fiscal thereafter  the company s cash requirements will depend upon the results of future operations  including the impact of the cadre acquisition  which cannot be foreseen 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to meet its loan covenants  achieve its operating plan and return to profitability  and the failure to do so may have a material adverse impact on the company s business and operations 
the company expects to incur a significant loss from operations in the first quarter of fiscal which will include an estimated million to million in charges discussed above associated with its acquisition of cadre completed in july recently issued accounting standards in march  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  which is effective for the company s fiscal year this statement requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable

the company will be required to disclose the pro forma net income or loss and per share amounts in the notes to the financial statements using the fair value based method beginning in fiscal with comparable disclosures for fiscal the company has not determined the impact of these pro forma adjustments 
foreign currency all of cayenne s foreign sales  other than those of its foreign subsidiaries  are invoiced and collected in united states dollars 
cayenne experienced no significant gains or losses on foreign currency transactions or translations in fiscal  or no assurance can be given  however  that it will not experience such material affects subsequent to june  inflation to date  inflation has not had a material impact on cayenne s revenues or income 
quarterly performance cayenne s revenues vary from quarter to quarter  historically  the largest portion of cayenne s revenue has been recognized in the fourth quarter of a fiscal year 
the first quarter is traditionally cayenne s slowest quarter 
in the normal course of events  cayenne may realize lower revenue in the first quarter than in the preceding quarter and also could realize lower revenue in the third quarter than in the preceding second quarter 
cayenne has also frequently recognized more revenue in the last month of each quarter than in either of the preceding two months 
cayenne believes these quarterly and monthly patterns have been partly attributable to cayenne s sales commission policies  which compensate sales personnel for meeting or exceeding annual quotas  and to the budgeting and purchasing cycles of customers 
in addition  cayenne s revenue and earnings have fluctuated historically  and may fluctuate in the future  due to the timing of large individual orders 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the company had a series of significant orders from a major systems integrator totaling million 
the company completed an order for approximately million from an international customer in the third quarter of fiscal factors that may affect future results from time to time  information provided by the company or statements made by its employees may contain forward looking information  as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of the act 
the company cautions investors that there can be no assurance that actual results or business conditions will not differ materially from those projected or suggested in such forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including but not limited to the following the company s future operating results are dependent on its ability to develop product and market new and innovative products and services 
there are numerous risks inherent in this complex process  including rapid technological change and the requirement that the company bring to market in a timely fashion new products and services which meet customers changing needs 
historically  the company has generated a disproportionate amount of its operating revenues toward the end of each quarter  making precise prediction of revenues and earnings particularly difficult and resulting in risk of variance of actual results from those forecast at any time 
in addition  the company s operating results historically have varied from fiscal period to fiscal period  accordingly  the company s financial results in any particular fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of results for future periods 
the company operates in a highly competitive environment and in a highly competitive industry  which include significant pricing pressures and intense competition for skilled employees 
from time to time  the company may experience unanticipated intense competitive pressure  possibly causing operating results to vary from those expected 
the company offers its products and services directly and through indirect distribution channels 
changes in the financial condition of  or the company s relationship with  distributors and other indirect channel partners could cause actual operating results to vary from those expected 
the company does business worldwide 
global and or regional economic factors and potential changes in laws and regulations affecting the company s business  including without limitation  currency fluctuations  changes in monetary policy and tariffs  and federal  state and international laws could impact the company s financial condition or future results of operations 
the market price of the company s securities could be subject to fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  changes in analysts earnings estimates  market conditions in the information technology industry  as well as general economic conditions and other factors external to the company
