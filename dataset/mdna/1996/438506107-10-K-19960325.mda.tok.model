litigation on march   litton systems  inc filed suit against honeywell inc 
in us district court  central district of california  alleging honeywell patent infringement relating to the process used by honeywell to coat mirrors incorporated in its ring laser gyroscopes  attempted monopolization and predatory pricing by honeywell of certain alleged markets for products containing ring laser gyroscopes  and intentional interference by honeywell with litton s prospective advantage in european markets and with its contractual relationships with ojai research  inc  a california corporation 
honeywell generally denied litton s allegations  contested both the validity and infringement of the patent  and alleged that the patent had been obtained by litton s inequitable conduct before the united states patent and trademark office 
honeywell also filed counterclaims against litton alleging  among other things  that litton s business and litigation conduct violated federal and state laws  causing honeywell considerable damage and expense 
on january   judge mariana pfaelzer of the us district court set aside an august jury verdict and damage award of billion against honeywell in the patent and interference with contract case 
she ruled  among other things  that the litton patent was unenforceable because it was obtained by inequitable conduct and invalid because it was an invention that would have been obvious from combining existing processes 
she further ruled that if her judgment were ever subsequently vacated or reversed on appeal  honeywell would be granted a new trial on the issue of damages because the jury s award was inconsistent with the clear weight of the evidence  and permitting it to stand would constitute a miscarriage of justice 
litton has appealed to the court of appeals for the federal circuit  washington  dc briefs for the appeal have been submitted by the parties and oral arguments were presented december  honeywell believes that judge pfaelzer s rulings will be upheld on appeal 
as a result  no provision has been made in the financial statements with respect to this contingent liability 
the trial for the antitrust case began on november   before judge pfaelzer and a different jury 
prior to the jury s deliberations in the antitrust trial  the court dismissed  for failure of proof  litton s contentions that honeywell engaged in below cost predatory pricing  illegal tying  bundling and illegally acquiring sperry avionics in the case was submitted to the jury on two claims  monopolization and attempt to monopolize  both based on litton s allegations that honeywell entered into certain exclusive dealings and penalty arrangements with aircraft manufacturers and airlines to exclude litton from the commercial aircraft market 
on february   the jury returned a million verdict against honeywell for the monopolization claim 
on march   the jury indicated that it was unable to reach a verdict on damages for the attempted monopolization claim  and a mistrial was declared on that claim 
honeywell continues to maintain that it competed vigorously and lawfully in the inertial navigation business and will continue to defend itself against litton s allegations 
honeywell believes that the jury s partial verdict should be overturned because litton i failed to prove essential elements of liability and ii failed to submit competent evidence to support its claim for damages by offering only a speculative  all or nothing million damage study 
honeywell will file post verdict motions with the trial court asking that judgment be granted in favor of honeywell as a matter of law or  in the alternative  for a new trial  and will argue important procedural and other matters which could dispose of this case 
if the million jury verdict withstands post verdict motions  in whole or in part  any dollar judgment will be trebled under federal antitrust laws and will be appealed by honeywell 
the case will conclude only when the trial and appellate courts resolve all of the legal issues that could reduce or eliminate the jury verdict 
as a result  no provision has been made in the financial statements with respect to this contingent liability
