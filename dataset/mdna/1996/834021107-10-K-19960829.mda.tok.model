income loss from continuing operations 
 description of the business during fiscal the company had two primary operating divisions 
the network systems group nsg markets a wide variety of well known computer hardware and off the shelf software products as well as a full array of computer related services to its customers through seven offices located in michigan  north carolina  and new york 
the cad division markets  distributes and supports several popular computer aided design cad and product data management pdm software offerings to its customers through seven offices in six states 
in addition  this division is an authorized reseller of numerous hardware platforms on which the software operates and provides a full spectrum of services to support the installation 
on june   the company announced that it had signed a non binding letter of intent to sell nsg to data systems network corporation dsn 
this transaction is expected to be completed in early september the results of the nsg business have been presented as a discontinued operation 
the nsg assets and liabilities have been reclassified in the consolidated balance sheets as net assets of discontinued operations 
the nsg operating results are shown net of income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations and retained earnings under the caption discontinued operations 
the analysis below is directed exclusively to the continuing operations which are composed solely of the cad division 
see also the discussion under item business discontinued operation and notes a  i and l to the consolidated financial statements of the company included herein 
results of operations total revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  a increase 
the revenue increase from fiscal to was 
the acquisition of micro control in january accounted for approximately million of the fiscal and million of the fiscal revenue 
product revenue includes hardware and off the shelf software 
product revenue increased in fiscal from and for fiscal to service revenue  which includes hardware and software maintenance  installation  training and consulting  increased in fiscal from and from fiscal to as described above under item business the cad division  effective september   the company will no longer be able to sell the pro engineer product line of parametric technology corporation ptc  the supplier of the core technology for the company 
pro engineer is the leading high end mechanical cad cam product available today and has been the core product of the company 
in order to reduce channel conflict and customer confusion in the marketplace  ptc has established the pro engineer offering as a product of the direct sales force only 
reseller s such as softech will market  distribute and support a mid range product expected to be introduced by ptc in september 
this mid range product is expected to sell for approximately one half the price of pro engineer and is more likely to be operated on a personal computer 
historically  the company sold primarily unix workstation platforms on which the software would run 
it is unclear as to the market acceptance of the new product and the impact on the company of the potential loss of hardware revenue and margin related to workstations 
the competitive environment for the distribution of personal computers is such as to make it difficult for the company to pursue it as an opportunity 
under the new reseller relationship with ptc  the company will receive a margin on ptc software sales made to its customers by the ptc direct sales force for the period from october to december  in addition  the company will be permitted to market and support pro engineer maintenance until september  lastly  it is expected that the company will partner with the ptc direct sales force to supply hardware and  in some cases  support services related to the sales of pro engineer 
this partnering with ptc direct has not been an opportunity in the past given the competition for the same customer s business 
this will no longer be the case given the different product lines offered by each 
the current agreement between the company and ptc to market products and services expires on or about october  the agreement contains certain cancellation provisions which allow either party to terminate the relationship for any reason with days notice 
the ability to continue the relationship as a ptc business partner is material to the business 
selling  general and administrative expense increased from fiscal to and from fiscal to this category of expense as a percent of revenue was  and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the increases in sg a in fiscal and relative to fiscal were primarily due to three factors 
those three factors and the impact on sg a expenditures in each of the years were as follows goodwill amortization related to the mid year fy acquisition of micro control totaled  in fiscal and  in fiscal allocation of softech corporate expenses increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal and  in fiscal the increase in fiscal and relative to was due to the sale of the gsd in fiscal which had absorbed most of those corporate expenditures  and a one time charge of  was recorded in fiscal related to an amendment to the micro control purchase agreement see note j to the company s consolidated financial statements included herein 
interest income decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal in fiscal the company did not earn any interest income 
the decrease in interest income since fiscal is due primarily to the use of approximately million in cash to acquire three companies during fiscal and the negative impact of that activity on available cash resources for passive investment 
during fiscal available cash was invested at short term rates and the interest generated from that activity was offset against bank fees for other services provided to the company  such as lockbox charges 
the effective tax rate was in each of fiscal and the effective tax rate for fiscal was 
the provision in each of the years is related primarily to state and local taxes 
the effective rate was different from the statutory rate primarily due to valuation reserves established against the deferred tax asset due to the uncertainty of the recoverability of those assets against taxes due in the future 
the company has tax credits of  and net operating loss carryovers of approximately million to offset future federal taxes that may be payable 
included in the results is an estimated loss of  expected to be realized upon completion of the sale of nsg as presented on the statement of operation under the caption discontinued operations gain loss from disposal 
the anticipated premium of million in excess of net tangible value of the assets to be transferred  if the transaction is completed  would be offset by estimated expenses of million directly related to the transaction 
those estimated expenses include the write off of approximately million of unamortized nsg goodwill as of the expected transaction date  projected value of the proposed issuance of  softech shares to certain key executives as described in note l  and certain transaction related expenses of about million associated with employment and severance agreements  and professional fees 
capital resources and liquidity the company ended fiscal with approximately million in cash  an increase of approximately  from the previous year 
the net cash provided from operating activities totaled  for fiscal with the discontinued operations having utilized  of cash during that period 
the loss from continuing operations  which included the non recurring charge of  adjusted for non cash expenses of depreciation and amortization  provided approximately  recovery of previously paid federal and state taxes provided approximately  a decrease in accounts receivable provided cash of  and the decrease of accounts payable and accrued expenses utilized approximately  in cash 
subject to the successful completion of the proposed sale of nsg and collection of accounts receivable and other assets retained and not sold as part of the transaction  and the continuing review and oversight by the board of directors of the company  a possible distribution of all or a portion of the net proceeds from the proposed nsg sale  if consummated  is being considered see note l to the company s consolidated financial statements included herein 
it is expected that such a distribution would be made after the nsg cash is collected from the receivables not sold as part of the transaction  which is expected to be prior to december  the existing million line of credit arrangement has been reduced to million until such time as the bank can assess the creditworthiness of the company following the planned distribution 
however  there can be no assurance that the proposed sale of assets of nsg will in fact be consummated  or that any distribution to stockholders will be made in any amount or at any time in the future 
see also note l to the consolidated financial statements of the company included herein 
the company has never paid cash dividends on its capital stock in the past 
the company believes that the cash remaining in the business following the proposed distribution  together with funds expected to be available under an amended line of credit agreement reduced to accommodate the smaller  less capital intensive cad business and cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet the company s working capital needs through fiscal in october  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas 
this statement establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for stock based employee compensation plans 
while the company is reviewing the adoption and impact of fas  it is expected that adoption of this standard will have no material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company will be required to adopt fas in fiscal
