item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview over the past two years  the company completed a number of transactions which have had and will continue to have significant impact to the company 
since  the company s total assets and shareholders equity has more than doubled as total assets increased from million at december  to billion at december   while shareholders equity increased from million at december  to billion at december  among the more significant transactions that the company completed during and were as follows the company s ownership interest in real estate facilities has increased from at the end of to  at the end of  through the acquisition of wholly owned facilities combined with the acquisition of interests in real estate entities  the company completed three mergers with affiliated reits  one in with an aggregate cost of million and two in with an aggregate cost of million  the company completed the merger with public storage management  inc psmi during with an aggregate cost of million  the company issued approximately million of preferred stock and million of common stock in public offerings  and the company issued approximately million of preferred stock and million of common stock in connection with mergers and real estate acquisitions 
the significant increases in both the company asset and capital base has translated into significant growth in the company overall operating results 
historically  this growth was due to the acquisition of wholly owned facilities and the acquisition of ownership interests held by minority interests in the company existing portfolio of facilities 
the growth in the historical operating results  however  do not fully reflect the effects of the most significant transaction that the company has completed in its entire history the merger with psmi the psmi merger which was completed on november  in the psmi merger  the company acquired all the real estate operations of psmi  including i general and limited partnership interests in limited partnerships owning an aggregate of mini warehouses  ii shares of common stock in reits owning an aggregate of mini warehouses and commercial properties  iii seven wholly owned properties  iv all inclusive deeds of trust secured by ten mini warehouses  v property management contracts  exclusive of facilities owned by the company  for mini warehouses and through ownership of economic interest in a subsidiary  commercial properties and vi a economic interest in another subsidiary that currently sells locks and boxes in mini warehouses operated by the company 
the psmi merger not only doubled the size of the company and significantly expanded the company s ownership interest in mini warehouse facilities it also provided the following benefits i the company became a fully integrated  self advised and self managed commercial real estate company with expertise in development  construction  acquisition  operation and leasing services  ii the company is now able to expand its property holdings without a proportionate increase in advisory and property management fees  which would have resulted had its current advisory contract and management agreements remained in effect  iii conflicts of interest between the company and its executive officers and directors who were also affiliated with psmi were reduced  and iv the company significantly increased it ownership interest in the real estate facilities operated under the public storage name 
as noted above  the historical operations do not fully reflect significant transactions which occurred during and the following table summarizes historical and unaudited pro forma operating data assuming that significant transactions described below were completed at the beginning of for the year ended december  pro forma unaudited historical in thousands  except per share data rental income      equity in earnings of real estate entities    facility management fee    interest and other income      cost of operations      cost of facility management   depreciation and amortization      general and administrative      environmental costs   advisory fee    interest expense      income before gain on disposition of real estate and minority interest      gain on disposition of real estate minority interest in income      net income      weighted average common shares      earnings per common share the pro forma financial data for and has been prepared assuming i the issuance of preferred and common stock during and with the exception of the series g preferred stock which was issued on december  and the utilization of the proceeds therefrom  ii the merger transactions with affiliated reits during and  and iii the psmi merger  were each completed at the beginning of pro forma adjustments were made by management based upon available information and upon certain assumptions that the company believes are reasonable in the circumstances 
the pro forma financial data does not purport to represent what the company s results of operations would actually have been if the transactions in fact had occurred at the beginning of or to project the company s results of operations for any future date or period 
historical results of operations net income net income for  and was   and  respectively  representing increases over the prior year of for and for these increases reflect the continued growth in the company s asset base from million at the end of to billion at the end of combined with improvements of operations generated by the company s asset base existing at the end of net income allocable to common shareholders net income less preferred stock dividends for  and was   and  respectively  representing increases over the prior year of for and for on a per share basis  net income was per share based on weighted average shares outstanding of  for  per share based on weighted average shares outstanding of  for  and per shares based on weighted average shares outstanding of  for the decrease in net income per share for compared to was principally due to increasing depreciation expense allocable to the common shareholders combined with the accrual of estimate environmental remediation costs at the end of net income allocable to the common shareholders includes depreciation and amortization expense of approximately  per common share for   per common share for  and  per common share for the remaining depreciation and amortization expense has been allocated to the minority interest 
the fiscal earnings per common share also includes a reduction of approximately per common share relating to the accrual of estimated environmental remediation costs discussed below 
as a reit  the company s real estate operations account for substantially all of the company operating activities 
during  approximately of the company s sources of operating income income prior to deductions for depreciation  general and administrative expenses  advisory fees and interest expense was generated from property operations 
the company expects that property operations will continue to generate a substantial portion of the company s operations with property management operations and interest income from mortgage note investments generating a much lesser amount 
at december  the company s investment portfolio consists of i wholly owned properties owned by the company  ii properties owned by real estate partnerships in which the company has significant ownership interests the consolidated partnerships  and iii properties owned by real estate entities partnership and reits in which the company s ownership interest and control are not sufficient to warrant the consolidation of such entities the unconsolidated entities

the company believes that geographic diversity reduces the impact from regional economic downturns and provides a greater degree of stability to revenues 
property operations rental income and cost of operations presented on the consolidated statements of income reflect the operations of the consolidated properties owned by the company and the consolidated partnerships 
the following table summarizes the operating results of these facilities year ended december  year ended december  change change dollar amounts in thousands rental income mini warehouse     business park     cost of operations a mini warehouse     business park     net operating income mini warehouse     business park     gross profit margin mini warehouse b business park b number of facilities at the end of the period mini warehouse business park a included in cost of operations are property management fees totaling   and  for  and  respectively 
for financial statement purposes  property management fees from the period from november  through december  the period the company became self managed totaling  have been reclassified as a reduction to property management fees 
b gross profit margins are after management fees of and for mini warehouse and business park facilities  respectively 
giving effect to the psmi merger and the elimination of such management fees  the pro forma gross profit margins  net of costs of providing management services  would have been as follows mini warehouses business parks the significant increase in property operations for the company s mini warehouses is principally due to the acquisition of additional facilities during facilities  facilities and facilities 
excluding such acquisitions  mini warehouse facilities have been in the company s portfolio since the beginning of the operating results rental income less cost of operations of these facilities improved in and in compared to prior period 
these increases are principally due to improve rental rates  as average realized monthly rent per square foot increased from in  to in  and to in weighted average occupancy levels for these facilities were in  in and in the increase in property operations with respect to the business park facilities is principally due to the acquisition of facilities during and excluding such acquisitions  business park facilities have been in the company s portfolio since the beginning of the operating results rental income less cost of operations of these facilities improved in and in compared to prior period 
these increases are principally due to reductions in operating expense and to improved rental rates  as average realized monthly rent per square foot increased from in  to in  to in weighted average occupancy levels for these facilities were in  in and in equity in earnings of real estate entities equity in earnings of real estate entities was   and  in  and  respectively 
for and  equity in earnings of real estate entities principally consists of earnings from partnerships which  commencing in  are now consolidated with the company and  accordingly are no longer included in equity in earnings of real estate entities 
the earnings principally consists of earnings related to the interests acquired pursuant to the psmi merger 
the company currently has ownership interests in limited partnerships and reits which comprise the unconsolidated entities 
the company s ownership interest in these entities ranges from to  but generally averages approximately 
due to the company s limited ownership interest and control of these entities  the company does not consolidate the accounts of these entities for financial reporting purposes 
similar to the company  the unconsolidated entities generate substantially all of their income from their ownership of mini warehouse facilities 
in aggregate  the unconsolidated entities own a total of facilities  of which are mini warehouse facilities 
the following summarizes combined operating data with respect to the unconsolidated entities for the year ended december  rental income  total revenues  cost of operations  depreciation  net income  equity in earnings of real estate entities for consists of the company s pro rata share of earnings including the company s share of depreciation expense  and environmental costs  of the unconsolidated entities based upon the company s ownership interest in each for the period from november  through the end of the year 
in addition  equity in earnings of real estate entities for includes amortization totaling  representing the amortization of the company s cost basis over the underlying book value of the company s equity interest in each of the entities 
property management operations in connection with the psmi merger  the company acquired property management contracts  exclusive of facilities owned by the company  for mini warehouses and through ownership of economic interest in a subsidiary  commercial properties 
these facilities constitute all of the united states mini warehouses and business parks doing business under the public storage name and all those in which the company has an interest  which include all the facilities owned by the consolidated partnerships  unconsolidated entities  and facilities owned by third parties in which the company has no equity interest 
the property management contracts generally provide for compensation equal to  in the case of the mini warehouses  and  in the case of the business parks  of gross revenues of the facilities managed 
under the supervision of the property owners  the company coordinates rental policies  rent collections  marketing activities  the purchase of equipment and supplies  maintenance activity  and the selection and engagement of vendors  suppliers and independent contractors 
in addition  the company assists and advises the property owners in establishing policies for the hire  discharge and supervision of employees for the operation of these facilities  including resident managers  assistant managers  relief managers and billing and maintenance personnel 
during  the company s property management operations generated net operating income of  on revenues of  and expenses of  for the period from november  through december  because the company has significant ownership interests in all but of the facilities it manages  the revenues generated from its property management operations are generally predictable and are dependent upon the future growth of rental income for those facilities the company manages 
the company has in the past  and may continue to seek to acquire in the future  real estate facilities owned by the consolidated partnerships and the unconsolidated entities 
acquisitions of such facilities will have the affect of reducing management fee income with a corresponding reduction in the cost of property operations 
interest and other income interest and other income was  in   in and  in this revenue is primarily attributable to interest income on the cash balances as a result of uninvested net equity offering proceeds during and interest income from mortgage notes receivable 
the company canceled approximately   and  of mortgage notes receivable during  and  respectively  in connection with the acquisition of real estate facilities securing such notes 
as a result  interest income from the mortgage notes receivable decreased from  in  to  in and to  in  as the average outstanding mortgage notes receivable balance was significantly lower 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense has increased from  in  to  in and to  in these increases are principally due to the acquisition of additional real estate facilities in each period combined with amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with the psmi merger 
depreciation expense with respect to the real estate facilities increased from  in to  in and to  in as a result of the acquisition of additional real estate facilities in through amortization expense with respect to intangible assets acquired in the psmi merger totaled  in  representing a pro rated amount from november  through the end of the year 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense was  in   in  and  in the company has experienced and expects to continue to experience increased general and administrative costs during due to the following i the growth in the size of the company has resulted in increased expenses  ii the company s property acquisition activities has continued to expand  resulting in certain additional costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of additional real estate facilities  and iii pursuant to the psmi merger  the company has become self advised  resulting in the company internalizing management functions which previously was provided by the adviser 
however  offsetting the expected increases in general and administrative expenses will be the elimination of advisory fee expense 
general and administrative costs for each year principally consist of state income taxes for states in which the company is a non resident  investor relation expenses  and certain costs incurred in the acquisition and development of real estate facilities 
environmental costs the company s policy is to accrue environmental assessments and or remediation cost when it is probable that such efforts will be required and the related costs can reasonably be estimated 
the majority of the company s real estate facilities were acquired prior to the time when it was customary to conduct environmental assessments 
during  the company and the consolidated partnerships conducted independent environmental investigations of their real estate facilities 
as a result of these investigations  the company has recorded an amount which  in management s best estimate  will be sufficient to satisfy anticipated costs of known remediation requirements 
at december   the company accrued  for estimated environmental remediation costs 
although there can be no assurance  the company is not aware of any environmental contamination of any of its facilities which individually or in the aggregate would be material to the company s overall business  financial condition  or results of operations 
advisory fees advisory fees were  in   in  and  in the advisory fee  which was based on a contractual computation  increased as a result of increased adjusted net income as defined per common share combined with the issuance of additional preferred and common stock during each of the periods 
advisory fees for fiscal represents such amounts from the beginning of the year through november   when the company became self advised pursuant to the psmi merger 
as a result of becoming self advised  the company will no longer incur advisory fees 
minority interest in income minority interest in income represents the income allocable to equity interests in the consolidated partnerships which are not owned by the company 
since  the company has acquired portions of these equity interests through its acquisition of limited and general partnership interests in the consolidated partnerships 
these acquisitions have resulted in reductions to the minority interest in income from what it would otherwise have been in the absence of such acquisitions  and accordingly  have increased the company s share of the consolidated partnerships income 
in determining income allocable to the minority interest for  and consolidated depreciation and amortization expense of approximately   and  respectively  was allocated to the minority interest 
the decrease in depreciation allocated to the minority interest was principally the result of the acquisition of limited partnership units in the consolidated partnerships by the company throughout fiscal and pro forma results of operations property operations although not consolidated with the company  the operating results of the properties owned by the unconsolidated entities are no less important to management than the results of the properties which are consolidated 
the company s operating results are highly dependent upon the overall performance of the company s investment in mini warehouse facilities for the following reasons i at december   the company owned interests in a total of  real estate facilities which consists of  mini warehouse facilities which are consolidated with the company and which are owned by entities in which the company has an ownership interest and business park facilities and ii growth in revenues of the company s mini warehouse property management operations is directly related to the growth in revenues of these mini warehouse facilities 
on a pro forma basis  the company s significant revenue sources property net operating income  equity in earnings of real estate entities and property management activities have all increased in compared to each of these revenue sources is principally dependent upon the operating results of the mini warehouses owned and or managed 
in order to evaluate how the company s overall portfolio is performing  management analyzes the operating performance of a consistent group of mini warehouse facilities representing of the  mini warehouse facilities in which the company has an ownership interest in herein referred to as same store mini warehouse facilities which have been operated under the public storage name for at least the past three years 
this group of properties includes facilities owned by the company and the consolidated partnerships and facilities owned by unconsolidated entities

management believes this is a more relevant measure then the posted rental rates  since posted rates can be discounted through the use of promotions 
gross profit margin is computed by dividing property net operating income before depreciation expense by rental revenues 
in addition to evaluating property operating trends in occupancy  realized rents  expenses and net operating income on a same store basis  management evaluates trends by geographic regions

during  management expects additional property tax assessments due to higher valuations rates  resulting in increased property taxes 
in addition  due to severe winter weather  snow removal expense is expected to increase 
pro forma equity in earnings of real estate entities property management operations the improvement in the historical operating performance of the same store facilities in compared to has translated into pro forma increases in the company s equity in earnings of real estate entities and property management operations  assuming the company owned such interests as of the beginning of as noted above  a substantial portion of the real estate facilities owned by the unconsolidated entities is represented in the same store operations included in the above table 
improvements in the same store operations generally translates into increased equity in earnings from the unconsolidated entities 
accordingly  the increase in the pro forma equity in earnings during compared to was principally the result of improved operations for the facilities owned by the unconsolidated entities 
since the company s property management fees are directly related to the growth in revenues of the facilities it manages  the growth in the revenues of the same store facilities generally translates into increased property management fees 
the pro forma property management income fee after consolidation adjustments to eliminate management fees with respect to the consolidated properties increased from million in to million in  representing an increase of 
this increase is principally the result of increased rental income for those facilities owned by the unconsolidated entities

pro forma interest expense for and indicates a substantial increase with respect to the historical amounts for the same periods 
these increases reflect the additional debt million which the company assumed in connection with the psmi merger 
the pro forma amounts  however  do not reflect the prepayment of million of mortgage debt during january and the related pro forma reduction to interest expense 
liquidity and capital resources the company has operated and intends to continue to operate in a self sufficient manner without reliance on external sources of financing to fund its ongoing operating needs 
the company believes that funds internally generated from ongoing operations will continue to be sufficient to enable it to meet its operating expenses  capital improvements  debt service requirements and distributions to shareholders for the foreseeable future 
over the past three years  funds internally generated from ongoing operations were in excess of the company s operating needs  allowing the company to retain cash flow  which it used to invest in the acquisition of additional real estate investments or make optional principal repayments on debt 
despite the company s ability to retain a portion of its internally generated cash flow  the company s growth strategies have required the company to seek external financing 
the company has an unsecured million revolving credit facility with a group of banks which it uses as a temporary source of acquisition financing 
the company  however  seeks to ultimately finance all acquisitions with permanent sources of capital 
as a result  the company has raised capital through the public issuance of both common and preferred stock which was used to repay borrowings and make additional investments in real estate assets 
internally generated cash flows the company believes that important measures of its performance as well as its liquidity are cash provided by operations  funds from operations ffo and the ability of these measures to fund the company s operating requirements ie capital improvements  principal payments on debt  and distribution requirements 
net cash provided by operations as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles reflects the cash generated from the company s business before distributions to various equity holders  including the preferred shareholders  capital expenditures or mandatory principal payments on debt 
net cash provided by operations has increased over the past three years from million in to million in the following table summarizes the company s ability to pay the minority interests distributions  its dividends to the preferred shareholders and capital improvements to maintain the facilities through the use of cash provided by operating activities 
the remaining cash flow is available to the company to make both scheduled and optional principal payments on debt  pay distributions to common shareholders and for reinvestment

    see the consolidated statements of cash flows for the each of the three years in the period ended december  for additional information regarding the company s investing and financing activities 
total ffo increased to  for the year ended december  compared to  in and  in ffo applicable to the common shareholders after deducting preferred stock dividends increased to  for the year ended december  compared to  in and  in ffo means net income loss computed in accordance with gaap before i gain loss on early extinguishment of debt  ii minority interest in income and iii gain loss on disposition of real estate  adjusted as follows i plus depreciation and amortization including the company s pro rata share of depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated equity interests and amortization of assets acquired in the psmi merger  including property management agreements and goodwill  and ii less ffo attributable to minority interest 
ffo is a supplemental performance measure for equity reits as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts  inc nareit 
the nareit definition does not specifically address the treatment of minority interest in the determination of ffo or the treatment of the amortization of property management agreements and goodwill 
in the case of the company  ffo represents amounts attributable to its shareholders after deducting amounts attributable to the minority interests and before deductions for the amortization of property management agreements and goodwill 
ffo is presented because many industry analysts consider ffo to be one measure of the performance of the company and it is used in establishing the terms of the class b common stock 
ffo does not take into consideration capital improvements  scheduled principal payments on debt  distributions and other obligations of the company 
accordingly  ffo is not a substitute for the company s cash flow or net income as discussed above as a measure of the company s liquidity or operating performance 
the company accounts for the unconsolidated entities using the equity method of accounting  and accordingly  earnings are recognized based upon the company s interest in each of the partnerships and reits 
the interest for a period is based upon the company s share of the increase or decrease in the net assets of the entities 
provisions of these partnerships and reits  however  provide for the payment of preferred cash distributions to other investors until certain specified amounts have been paid without regard to the pro rata interest of all investors in current earnings 
as a result  actual cash distributions to be paid to the company s for a period of time will be less than the company s ffo  as defined  from these entities 
on a pro forma basis for  ffo distributed to the company was approximately million less than the company s share of ffo 
preferred cash distributions paid to other investors during each period have the effect of increasing the company s economic interest in each of the respective entities and reducing the amount of future preference payments which must be paid to other investors before cash distributions will be shared on a pro rata basis with respect to each investor s actual interest 
the aggregate future preference payments to other investors is approximately million and is expected to be paid over approximately years  with approximately of the amount being paid over the next years 
retention of operating cash flows operating as a reit  the company s ability to retain cash flow for reinvestment is restrictive 
in order for the company to maintain its reit status  a substantial portion of its operating cash flows must be used to make distributions to its shareholders see reit status below 
remaining cash flows must then be sufficient to fund necessary capital improvements and scheduled debt service requirements 
accordingly  the company s ability to be self sufficient is predicated on its ability to generate sufficient operating cash flows to satisfy its reit distribution requirements  capital improvement requirements  scheduled debt service requirements  and provide funds for additional investments 
over the past four years  the company s conservative distribution policy has enabled it to retain significant funds after capital improvements to make additional investments and debt reductions 
during   and  the company distributed to common shareholders approximately  and of its ffo available to common shareholders  respectively  allowing it to retain approximately million over this period of time after satisfying its capital improvements and preferred stock dividend requirements 
distributions requirements during  the company paid dividends totaling  to the holders of the company s senior preferred stock   to the holders of the convertible preferred stock  and  to the holders of common stock 
dividends with respect to the senior preferred stock and the convertible preferred stock include pro rated amounts for securities issued during in january  the company issued approximately million of additional senior preferred stock series h preferred stock 
the company estimates that the distribution requirements for fiscal with respect to senior preferred stock including the senior preferred stock issued in january and the convertible preferred stock to be approximately million 
capital improvement requirements during  the company has budgeted approximately million for capital improvements million for its mini warehouse and million for its business park facilities 
the minority interests share of the budgeted capital improvements is approximately million 
during  the company commenced a program to enhance its visual icon and modernize the appearance of its mini warehouse facilities  including modernization of signs  paint color schemes  and rental offices 
included in the capital improvement budget is approximately million with respect to these expenditures 
the significant increases in capital improvements in and for the mini warehouse facilities as reflected in the table above is due to i the acquisition of new facilities in  and  ii approximately  of non recurring expenditures the company incurred during to upgrade certain facilities in texas to provide for climate controlled storage units  and iii approximately million of visual enhancements during debt service requirements the company does not believe it has any significant refinancing risks with respect to its mortgage debt and nominal interest rate risks associated with its variable rate mortgage debt 
the company uses its million of bank credit facility all of which was unused as of march  primarily to fund acquisitions and provide financial flexibility and liquidity 
the credit facility currently bears interest at libor plus 
at december   the company had total outstanding borrowings of approximately million 
during january  the company retired early approximately million of debt with the proceeds of a preferred stock offering 
approximate principal maturities of notes payable  as adjusted to reflect the early retirement of mortgage debt totaling million in january  are as follows mortgage debt unsecured variable senior notes fixed rate rate total in thousands thereafter    external financing the company intends to continue to expand its asset and capital base through the acquisition of real estate assets and interests in real estate assets from both unaffiliated and affiliated parties through direct purchases  mergers  tender offers or other transactions 
the company expects to fund these transactions with internally generated retained cash flows and borrowings under its million credit facility 
the company intends to repay amounts borrowed under the credit facility from undistributed operating cash flow or  as market conditions permit and are determined to be advantageous  from the public or private placement of securities 
during and  the company publicly issued approximately million of preferred stock and million of common stock 
in addition  in january  the company issued million of its series h preferred stock 
the following table summarizes the company s historic capitalization at the end of  and as adjusted to reflect the issuance of the series h preferred stock in january and the use of proceeds therefrom to retire mortgage debt at december  as adjusted historical historical in thousands total debt lines of credit  unsecured senior debt   mortgage notes    total debt    minority interests    total shareholders equity senior preferred stock    convertible preferred stock    common stock    total capitalization book value    ratio of debt to total capitalization ratio of debt to total shareholders equity ratio of debt and preferred stock to total capitalization the company believes that its size and financial flexibility enable it to access capital for growth when appropriate 
the company s financial profile is characterized by a low level of debt to total capitalization  increasing net income  increasing cash flow from operations  and a conservative dividend payout ratio with respect to the common stock 
the company s credit ratings on its senior preferred stock were recently upgraded by each of the three major credit agencies baa by moody s and bbb by standard and poors and duff phelps 
the company s portfolio of real estate facilities remains substantially unencumbered 
at december   the company had mortgage debt outstanding of million as adjusted and had consolidated real estate facilities with a book value of billion 
the company  however  has been adverse to financing its acquisitions with debt and generally will only increase its mortgage borrowing through the assumption of pre existing debt on acquired real estate facilities 
over the past three years the company has funded substantially all of its acquisitions with permanent capital both common and preferred stock 
unlike many other real estate companies  the company has elected to use preferred stock despite the fact that the coupon rates of its preferred stock exceeds current rates on conventional debt 
the company has chosen this route for the following reasons i the company s perpetual preferred stock has no sinking fund requirements  or maturity date and does not require redemption  all of which eliminate any future refinancing risks  ii preferred stock allows the company to leverage the common stock without the attendant interest rate or refinancing risks of debt  and iii dividends on the preferred stock can be applied to the company s reit distributions requirements  which have helped the company to maintain a low common stock dividend payout ratio and retain cash flow 
subsequent to december   the company issued approximately million of its series h preferred stock 
the net proceeds from the offering have been used to repay debt million  acquire real estate facilities million  and acquire limited partnership interests in unconsolidated entities million 
the company believes that its cash reserves at march  will be approximately of million 
proposed mergers on march   the shareholders of each of public storage properties ix  inc properties and ps business parks  inc 
psbp approved the mergers of the respective corporations into the company and it is expected that the mergers will be completed during march in the mergers  it is estimated that the company will issue an aggregate of million shares of common stock and pay an additional million in cash 
properties owns and operates properties mini warehouses  square feet and one business parks  square feet 
psbp owns and operates a single business park  square feet 
in march the company and storage properties  inc spi  a publicly traded equity real estate investment trust agreed  subject to certain conditions  to merge 
upon the merger  each outstanding share of spi common stock would be converted  at the election of the shareholders of spi  into either shares of the company s common stock with a market value of or  with respect to up to of the spi common stock  in cash 
spi has  outstanding shares of common stock and an estimated value of million 
the merger agreement is conditioned on  among other requirements  receipt of satisfactory fairness opinions by spi and approval by the shareholders of spi 
the company has as advisory agreement and a property management agreement with spi 
spi owns seven mini warehouses  square feet 
development activities historically  the company only acquired interests in existing operating real estate facilities 
during  the company began the development of three mini warehouse facilities  one of which began operations in the company currently has plans to develop an additional mini warehouses in various locations at an estimated cost of approximately million 
the company is evaluating the feasibility of developing additional mini warehouses in selected markets in which there are few  if any  facilities to acquire at attractive prices and where the scarcity of other undeveloped parcels of land or other impediments to development make it difficult to construct additional competing facilities 
generally the construction period takes months followed by a month fill up process until the newly constructed facility reaches a stabilized occupancy level 
due to the timing of the employment of the capital to construct the facilities and the relatively long fill up period until the facilities reach a stabilized occupancy level  the company s believes that its development plans may create earnings dilution in the short term 
reit status the company believes that it has operated  and intends to continue to operate  in such a manner as to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code of  but no assurance can be given that it will at all times so qualify 
to the extent that the company continues to qualify as a reit  it will not be taxed  with certain limited exceptions  on the taxable income that is distributed to its shareholders 
as a reit  the company is not taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders provided that at least of its taxable income is so distributed prior to filing of the company s tax return 
the company has satisfied the reit distribution requirement since in addition to certain asset tests  the company must meet several annual gross income tests to retain its reit qualification 
under the gross income test  the company must derive at least of its total gross income from specified classes of income related to real property  dividends  interest or gains from the sale or other distribution of stock or other securities that do not constitute dealer property 
if the company fails to meet the test during any taxable year  its reit status would terminate for that year and future years unless it qualifies for the good cause exception 
generally  if the company fails the test but still retains its qualification as a reit under the good cause exception  it would be subject to a excise tax on the amount of the excess nonqualifying income multiplied by a fraction  the numerator of which would be the company s taxable income computed without its distribution deduction and the denominator of which would be the company s gross income from all sources 
this excise tax would have the general effect of causing the company to pay all net profits generated from this excess nonqualifying income to the internal revenue service 
subsequent to the psmi merger  the company assumed and is performing property management activities for the various partnerships and reits in which the company has an interest 
the company receives property management fees from such partnerships  reits and other owners in exchange for the performance of such management activities 
the gross income received by the company from these property management activities with respect to the facilities owned by third party entities and reits in which the company has an ownership interest will be treated as income not qualifying under the test 
a portion of the gross income representing a pro rata amount allocated to partnership interests not owed by the company received by the company from property management activities with respect to the facilities owned by partnerships in which the company has an ownership interest will also be treated as income not qualifying under the test 
at the time of the psmi merger  if there were no change in current revenues of the company and psmi and the company took no action to reduce its nonqualifying income  the company estimated it would not satisfy the gross income test for however  the percentage of nonqualifying income may be reduced in a variety of ways i through the prepayment of management fees  ii through increase in overall gross income that result from increases in qualifying rents will reduce the percentage of nonqualifying income ie the acquisition of additional real estate investments which generate qualifying rents  and iii through the acquisition of properties currently managed by the company  thereby the management fees received by the company would cease to be nonqualifying income 
in order to reduce the amount of nonqualifying income the company would earn in  certain entities prepaid during to the company a portion of the management fees that the company otherwise would have received in discounted for early payment 
the amount prepaid during was approximately million 
in addition  subsequent to the psmi merger  the company publicly issued preferred stock raising net offering proceeds of approximately million 
the net proceeds have been used to repay debt and acquire additional real estate investments including interests in properties managed by the company 
the company believes that the prepayment of management fees combined with the acquisition of additional real estate investments will enable the company to meet the test for and subsequent years
