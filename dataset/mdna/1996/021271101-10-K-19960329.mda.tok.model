outlook the company has budgeted cash expenditures of million for asset acquisition and mine development  excluding site development and construction at olinghouse and copper flat  million in debt repayments and 
million for reclamation in these expenditures are expected to be funded from revenues generated from gold production at kinsley 
an additional million in expenditures for site development and construction at olinghouse and copper flat has been tentatively budgeted for million for olinghouse and million for copper flat 
at olinghouse  these expenditures would primarily be for development drilling 
at copper flat  these expenditures would primarily be for site preparation  equipment purchases and plant construction 
the timing of these expenditures is dependent upon the approval of all of the necessary permits and the availability of outside financing 
the company is currently in the process of permitting both olinghouse and copper flat and is in negotiations with certain parties in connection with such financing 
the company expects to be able to obtain all of the necessary permits and the necessary financing  however  there is no assurance that the company will be able to find external sources of capital on terms that are favorable to the company or that the necessary permits will be obtained 
the company does not believe that any significant capital expenditures to monitor or reduce hazardous substances or other environmental impacts are currently required 
as a result  near term reclamation obligations are not expected to have a significant impact on the company s liquidity 
cash expenditures budgeted for are based upon future events which cannot be predicted with total accuracy and which may be beyond the control of the company  nevertheless  the company expects to meet its obligations in as of december   the company had sold forward  ounces of gold at an average price of per ounce and bought sold put call options for  ounces of gold at an average price of per ounce
