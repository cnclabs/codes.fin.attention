united total states europe other consumer existing unit volume price currency total consumer total revenues in the consumer segment for were higher than in  with existing unit volume up over the level 
unit volume in the united states increased by in over the level as a result of strong unit volume growth in the power tools and accessories and household products businesses  partially offset by unit volume declines in the security hardware and plumbing products businesses 
the domestic growth in the power tools and accessories business was the result of continued strong demand for dewalt professional power tools and accessories and the successful expansion in the latter half of of a line of consumer products that use the versapak interchangeable battery system 
during  the household products business achieved a double digit rate of growth in unit volume driven by the continued success of the snakelight flexible flashlight  which was introduced late in the domestic security hardware and plumbing products businesses each experienced modest unit volume declines from levels during the decrease in unit volume of the security hardware business was due to inventory reductions made by its customers in the latter part of while the plumbing products business experienced unit volume growth in the second half of over the corresponding period in  that growth was not sufficient to cover revenue shortfalls experienced in the first half of as a result of poor weather conditions in the western united states and the resulting soft demand in professional distribution channels 
excluding the substantial positive effects of changes in foreign exchange rates  revenues in the corporation s consumer businesses in europe increased by in over the level despite a weak fourth quarter in this increase was composed of increased sales of power tools and accessories  household products  and security hardware  offset by decreased sales of outdoor products 
the growth in power tools and accessories revenues during over the prior year level was attributable to strong sales of professional products  partially offset by sales declines in consumer power tools and accessories 
the increased household products revenues in over the level was due primarily to the introduction of the snakelight flexible flashlight in europe late in an extremely dry winter and late spring resulted in decreased revenues for outdoor products in compared to exclusive of positive effects of changes in foreign exchange rates during  some european countries achieved results substantially higher than the prior year level  and other countries  most notably  germany  the united kingdom  and france  reported results essentially equal to or below the prior year level

improved operating income levels in over in the worldwide power tools and accessories business resulted principally from substantial improvements in the domestic power tools and accessories business as a result of increased sales volume  higher manufacturing productivity  and the impact of cost reduction initiatives  partially offset by reduced profitability in the european operations 
a softening retail environment in the fourth quarter of  expenses incurred in connection with the reorganization of certain european operations  and residual inefficiencies associated with the closure of two manufacturing facilities since mid contributed to markedly lower profitability in the corporation s consumer businesses in europe in than in cost reduction initiatives and manufacturing productivity improvements resulted in increased operating income as a percentage of revenues during compared to in the security hardware business  despite year to year sales declines in its domestic operations 
a decline in operating income in the plumbing products business in compared to resulted from reduced sales and rising material costs 
total revenues in the consumer segment for were higher than in existing unit volume increased by for over the level 
unit volume in the united states for rose by over the level 
the domestic unit volume increase resulted from double digit rates of growth in the power tools and accessories  security hardware  and plumbing products businesses 
this growth primarily stemmed from the continued strong demand for the dewalt professional power tools and accessories line  expanded distribution of titan locksets  and the introduction of the genesis series of single control faucets 
despite strong demand experienced late in when the snakelight flexible flashlight and a new line of under the cabinet kitchen appliances were introduced in the united states  unit volume in the household products business was down slightly in compared to the prior year level 
the corporation s consumer power tools business in europe achieved moderate unit volume growth in over the level

partially offsetting this improvement was a decline in the operating income level in over for the household products business 
this decline was primarily the result of increased promotion spending and administrative expenses in  which were not offset by revenue increases 
in addition  operating income improved during for the golf club shafts business over the low level experienced in due to shifting consumer preferences to graphite golf club shafts from steel golf club shafts 
commercial and industrial products the following chart sets forth an analysis of the change in revenues for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   by geographic area within the commercial segment 
united total states europe other commercial existing unit volume price currency total commercial total revenues in the commercial segment for were higher than the level 
excluding the substantial positive effects of changes in foreign exchange rates  revenues in the commercial segment were higher in than in the preceding year 
the fastening systems fastening business achieved solid unit volume growth in over the prior year level  as softening industrial sales in the united states and europe were more than offset by increased automotive sales in those regions 
the glass container making equipment glass business experienced a double digit rate of growth in unit volume in compared to a weak despite declines in volumes in the united states 
the backlog of orders in the glass business at december   was slightly above the level  reflecting strong order levels experienced during operating income as a percentage of revenues for the commercial segment was in compared to in excluding the effects of goodwill amortization  operating income as a percentage of revenues would have been in compared to in the fastening and glass businesses each experienced improvements in operating income percentages 
total revenues in the commercial segment for were essentially flat compared to those of the prior year 
an increase of in existing unit volume  coupled with the positive effects of pricing and changes in foreign exchange rates  were offset by the effects of the sale of the remaining dynapert business late in a double digit rate of increase in unit volume in the fastening business was partially offset by a volume decline in the glass business 
fastening business sales improved during in the united states and europe  primarily as a result of the strengthening of the automotive industry 
sales in the glass business were weak throughout all geographic areas during operating income as a percentage of total revenues for the commercial segment for was compared to for excluding the effects of goodwill amortization and  for  restructuring credits of million relating to the gain on the sale of dynapert s through hole business  operating income as a percentage of total revenues for the commercial segment would have been for compared to for operating income improved in the fastening business in as a result of increased sales and cost reduction initiatives  but was offset by an operating income decline in the glass business due to revenue shortfalls 
financial condition operating activities of continuing operations before the sale of receivables generated cash of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this increase in cash generation during was primarily the result of increased profitability  partially offset by increased working capital levels 
the major cause of the working capital increase at december   over the prior year level was an increase in inventories 
despite a weakening retail environment  the corporation achieved sales growth of  excluding the positive effects of changes in foreign exchange rates  in the fourth quarter of over the corresponding period in that growth  however  was below the corporation s expectations  and inventory levels at year end were higher than planned 
while a portion of the inventory increase is required to support new product initiatives and manufacturing rationalizations that are underway and should further improve manufacturing productivity  the corporation will actively seek to reduce inventory levels in in addition to measuring its cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating  investing  and financing classifications included in the consolidated statement of cash flows  the corporation monitors its free cash flow  a measure commonly employed by bond rating agencies and banks 
the corporation defines free cash flow as cash available for debt reduction including short term borrowings  prior to the effects of cash proceeds received from sales of divested businesses  equity offerings  and sales of receivables 
free cash flow  a more inclusive measure of cash flow generation than cash flows from operating activities included in the consolidated statement of cash flows  considers items such as cash used for capital expenditures and dividends  as well as net cash inflows or outflows from hedging activities 
during the year ended december   the corporation generated free cash flow of million compared to million of free cash flow generated in the decrease in free cash flow in from the level was primarily the result of higher working capital levels and capital expenditures in than in when the corporation experienced particularly strong free cash flow from the initial effects of more stringent working capital management 
the corporation expects to reduce debt by approximately million in the first quarter of upon receipt of the proceeds from the sale of prc inc had the sale of prc inc closed prior to december  and a net gain of million been recognized upon the sale  the corporation s ratio of debt to total capitalization would have decreased from at december   to approximately 
the total amount of receivables sold under the corporation s sale of receivables program at december   was million compared to million at december  the sale of receivables program provides for a seasonal expansion of the amount of receivables that may be sold  from million to million during the period from october through january the corporation s liquidity facility  which supports the sale of receivables program  expires in may the corporation expects to be able to extend this facility beyond december excluding amounts related to discontinued operations  investing activities for used cash of million compared to million of cash used in capital expenditures of million during exceeded the level of million 
during  approximately of the capital expenditures were in the consumer segment  primarily in support of new product initiatives and productivity enhancements 
the corporation expects capital spending in to approximate the level 
the corporation actively seeks to identify opportunities to improve its cost structure 
these opportunities may involve the closure of manufacturing facilities or the reorganization of other operations 
the ongoing costs of compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations have not had  nor are they expected to have  a material adverse effect on the corporation s capital expenditures or financial position 
the corporation has a number of manufacturing sites throughout the world and sells its products in over countries 
as a result  the corporation is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the united states dollar 
the major foreign currencies in which the corporation has foreign currency risk are the pound sterling  deutsche mark  dutch guilder  canadian dollar  swedish krona  japanese yen  french franc  italian lira  australian dollar  mexican peso  and brazilian real 
assets and liabilities of the corporation s subsidiaries located outside the united states are translated at rates of exchange at the balance sheet date  as more fully explained in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the resulting translation adjustments are included in equity adjustment from translation  a separate component of stockholders equity 
during  translation adjustments  recorded in the equity adjustment from translation component of stockholders equity  increased stockholders equity by million compared to an increase of million in as more fully explained in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation historically has hedged a portion of its net investment in foreign subsidiaries 
during  the corporation decided to limit the future hedging of its net investment in foreign subsidiaries 
this action may increase the volatility of reported equity in the future  but will result in more predictable cash flows from hedging activities 
during  the corporation elected to hedge a portion  generally limited to tangible net worth  of its foreign subsidiaries 
prior to  the corporation operated under a full hedge policy  hedging the net assets  including goodwill  of its foreign subsidiaries 
in hedging the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations on its net investments in subsidiaries located outside the united states  the corporation has entered into various currency forward contracts and options 
these hedging activities generate cash inflows and outflows that offset the translation adjustment 
during  these activities netted to a cash outflow of million compared to a cash outflow of million in the corresponding gains and losses on these hedging activities were recorded in the equity adjustment from translation component of stockholders equity 
also included in the equity adjustment from translation component were the costs of maintaining the hedge portfolio of foreign exchange contracts 
these hedge costs decreased stockholders equity by million and million in and  respectively 
as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation seeks to minimize through its foreign currency hedging activities the risk that its united states dollar cash flows resulting from product sales outside the united states will be affected by changes in exchange rates 
foreign currency commitment and transaction exposures generally are an integral part of the responsibility of management of the corporation s individual operating units 
these management responses to foreign exchange movements vary 
for example  pricing actions  changes in cost structures  and changes in hedging strategies may all be effective responses to a change in exchange rates 
in late  the mexican peso was severely devalued 
because the corporation s mexican peso exposure was hedged  this devaluation did not have a significant effect on earnings in while the currency situation in mexico had an adverse effect on mexican revenues in  the effect on operating income was substantially offset by pricing actions and changes in cost structures and by the lower relative costs of mexican production during financing activities for used cash of million compared to million of cash used in during  the corporation recognized a million extraordinary loss  million of which was a non cash charge  as a result of the early redemption of its emhart subsidiary s sinking fund debentures in the aggregate principal amount of million 
this extraordinary loss consisted of the write off of the associated debt discount  plus premiums and costs associated with the redemption  net of related income tax benefits 
as more fully explained in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation seeks to issue debt opportunistically  whether at fixed or variable rates  at the lowest possible costs 
based upon its assessment of the future interest rate environment and its desired variable rate debt to total debt ratio  the corporation may later convert such debt from fixed to variable or from variable to fixed interest rates  or from united states dollar based rates to rates based upon another currency  through the use of interest rate swap agreements 
in addition  the corporation may enter into interest rate cap agreements in order to limit the effects of increasing interest rates on a portion of its variable rate debt 
in order to meet its goal of fixing or limiting interest costs  the corporation maintains a portfolio of interest rate hedge instruments 
these interest rate hedges could change the mix of fixed and variable rate debt as actual interest rates move outside the ranges covered by these instruments 
the corporation s variable rate debt to total debt ratio  after taking interest rate hedges into account  was at december   compared to at december   and at december  at december   average debt maturity was years compared to years at december   and years at december  the corporation s unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility includes certain covenants that require the corporation to meet specified minimum cash flow coverage and maximum leverage debt to equity ratios during the term of the loan  as more fully explained in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the corporation s leverage ratio during the life of the credit facility may not exceed at the end of any fiscal quarter 
the cash flow coverage ratio calculated as of the end of each fiscal quarter must be greater than for any month period 
at december   the corporation was well within the limits specified for the leverage and cash flow coverage ratios and was in compliance with all other covenants and provisions of the credit facility 
the corporation began the process of negotiating a replacement to the credit facility during the first quarter of the replacement facility is not expected to contain terms more stringent than those set forth in the credit facility and is expected to expire in the year the corporation expects to continue to meet the covenants imposed by the credit facility or any replacement facility over the next months 
the corporation will continue to have cash requirements to support seasonal working capital needs and capital expenditures  to pay interest  and to service debt 
in order to meet these cash requirements  the corporation intends to use internally generated funds and to borrow under the credit facility or under short term borrowing facilities 
management believes that cash generated from these sources will be adequate to meet the corporation s cash requirements over the next months
