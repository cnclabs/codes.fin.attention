the company believes that its historic revenue growth as well as its historic network costs and results of operations for each of its us  canadian and us operations generally reflect the state of development of the company s operations  the company s customer mix and the competitive and deregulatory environment in each of those markets 
the company entered the us  canadian and us telecommunications markets in  and  respectively 
deregulatory influences have affected the telecommunications industry in the us since and the us market has experienced considerable competition for a number of years 
the competitive influences on the pricing of acc us s services and network costs have been stabilizing during the past few years 
this may change in the future as a result of recent us legislation that further opens the market to competition  particularly from rbocs 
the company expects competition based on price and service offerings to increase 
see the risk factor discussions of potential adverse effects of regulation and increasing domestic and international competition in item of this report 
because the deregulatory trend in canada  which commenced in  has increased competition  acc canada experienced significant downward pressure on the pricing of its services during the company expects such downward pressure to continue  although it is expected that the pricing pressure may abate over time as the market matures 
the impact of this pricing pressure on revenues of acc canada is being offset  in part  by an increase in the canadian residential and student billable minutes of usage as a percentage of total canadian billable minutes of usage 
toll revenue per billable minute attributable to residential and student customers in canada generally exceeds the toll revenue per billable minute attributable to commercial customers 
the company expects that  based on existing and anticipated regulations and rulings  its canadian contribution charges will increase by up to approximately cdn 
million in over levels  which the company will seek to offset with increased volume efficiencies 
the company also believes that its network costs per billable minute in canada may decrease during periods after if there is an anticipated increase in long distance transmission facilities available for lease from canadian transmission facilities based carriers as a result of expected growth in the number and capacity of transmission networks in that market 
the foregoing forward looking statements are based upon expectations of actions that may be taken by third parties  including canadian regulatory authorities and transmission facilities based carriers 
if such third parties do not act as expected  the company s actual results may differ materially from the foregoing discussion 
the company believes that  because deregulatory influences have only recently begun to impact the uk telecommunications industry  the company will continue to experience a significant increase in revenue from that market during the next few years 
the foregoing belief is based upon expectations of actions that may be taken by uk regulatory authorities and the company s competitors  if such third parties do not act as expected  the company s revenues in the uk might not increase 
if acc uk were to experience increased revenues  the company believes it should be able to enhance its economies of scale and scope in the use of the fixed cost elements of its network 
nevertheless  the deregulatory trend in that market is expected to result in competitive pricing pressure on the company s uk operations which could adversely affect revenues and margins 
since the uk market for transmission facilities is dominated by british telecom and mercury  the downward pressure on prices for services offered by acc uk may not be accompanied by a corresponding reduction in acc uk s network costs and  consequently  could adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition  particularly in the event revenue derived from the company s uk operations accounts for an increasing percentage of the company s total revenue 
moreover  the company s uk operations are highly dependent upon the transmission lines leased from british telecom 
see risk factors dependence on transmission facilities based carriers and suppliers in item of this report 
as each of the telecommunications markets in which it operates continues to mature  growth in its revenue and customer base in each such market is likely to decrease over time 
the company believes that competition in non us markets is likely to increase and become more like competition in the us markets over time as non us markets continue to experience deregulatory influences 
prices in the long distance industry have declined from time to time in recent years and  as competition in canada and the uk increases  prices are likely to continue to decrease 
since the commencement of the company s operations  the company has undertaken a program of developing and expanding its service offerings  geographic focus and network 
in connection with this development and expansion  the company has made significant investments in telecommunications circuits  switches  equipment and software 
these investments generally are made significantly in advance of anticipated customer growth and resulting revenue 
the company also has increased its sales and marketing  customer support  network operations and field services commitments in anticipation of the expansion of its customer base and targeted geographic markets 
the company expects to continue to expand the breadth and scale of its network and related sales and marketing  customer support and operations activities 
these expansion efforts are likely to cause the company to incur significant increases in expenses from time to time  in anticipation of potential future growth in the company s customer base and targeted geographic markets 
the company s operating results have fluctuated in the past and they may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  some of which are beyond the company s control 
the company expects to focus in the near term on building and increasing its customer base  service offerings and targeted geographic markets  which will require it to increase significantly its expenses for marketing  and development of its network and new services and may adversely impact operating results from time to time 
the company s sales to other long distance carriers have been increasing 
revenues from other resellers accounted for approximately  and of the revenues of acc us  acc canada and acc us  respectively  in  and are expected to account for a higher percentage in the future 
with respect to these customers  the company competes almost exclusively on price  does not have long term contracts and generates lower gross margins as a percentage of revenue

toll revenue for increased by to million from million in in the united states  toll revenue increased as a result of a increase in billable minutes of use and a more favorable mix of toll services provided  offset slightly by a decrease in prices per minute

in canada  toll revenue increased  primarily as a result of a increase in billable minutes primarily because of a increase in the number of customer accounts from approximately  to  offset by a slight decline in prices 
the price declines are a result of the price competition  particularly in canada  in which decreased rates in the middle of that year

in connection with the departure of one executive  the vesting schedule for options to purchase  shares of class a common stock out of the options to purchase a total of  shares which had been granted to the executive were accelerated to allow him to exercise the options 
during the third quarter of  the company initiated the process of enhancing its network to prepare for equal access for its canadian customers 
equal access allows customers to place a call over the company s network simply by dialing plus the area code and telephone number 
before equal access was available  the company needed to install a dialer on its customers premises or require the customer to dial an access code before placing a long distance call 
costs associated with this process included maintaining duplicate network facilities during transition  recontacting customers and the administrative expenses associated with accumulating the data necessary to convert the company s customer base to equal access

acc expects that it will continue to make significant capital expenditures during future periods 
the company s actual capital expenditures and cash requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the nature of future expansion including the extent of local exchange services  which is particularly capital intensive and acquisition opportunities  economic conditions  competition  regulatory developments  the availability of capital and the ability to incur debt and make capital expenditures under the terms of the company s financing arrangements 
prior to  the company had funded capital expenditures through its credit facilities and other short term debt arrangements  which were refinanced in with the credit facility 
the company is obligated to pay the lenders under the credit facility a contingent interest payment based on the appreciation in market value of  shares of the company s class a common stock from per share  subject to a minimum of million and a maximum of million 
the payment is due upon the earlier of i january   ii any material amendment to the credit facility  iii the signing of a letter of intent to sell the company or any material subsidiary  or iv the cessation of active trading of the company s class a common stock on other than a temporary basis

the company s financing arrangements  which are secured by substantially all of the company s assets and the stock of certain subsidiaries  require the company to maintain certain financial ratios and prohibit the payment of dividends 
in the normal course of business  the company uses various financial instruments  including derivative financial instruments  for purposes other than trading 
these instruments include letters of credit  guarantees of debt  interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency exchange contracts relating to intercompany payables of foreign subsidiaries 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
foreign currency exchange contracts are used to mitigate foreign currency exposure and are intended to protect the us dollar value of certain currency positions and future foreign currency transactions 
the aggregate fair value  based on published market exchange rates  of the company s foreign currency contracts at december  was million 
interest rate swap agreements are used to reduce the company s exposure to risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
the company was party to interest rate swap agreements at december  which had the effect of converting interest in respect of million principal amount of the credit facility to a fixed rate 
as is customary for these types of instruments  collateral is generally not required to support these financial instruments 
by their nature  all such instruments involve risk  including the risk of nonperformance by counterparties  and the company s maximum potential loss may exceed the amount recognized on the company s balance sheet 
however  at december   in management s opinion there was no significant risk of loss in the event of nonperformance of the counterparties to these financial instruments 
the company controls its exposure to counterparty credit risk through monitoring procedures and by entering into multiple contracts  and management believes that reserves for losses are adequate 
based upon the company s knowledge of the financial position of the counterparties to its existing derivative instruments  the company believes that it does not have any significant exposure to any individual counterparty or any major concentration of credit risk related to any such financial instruments 
the company believes that  under its present business plan  the net proceeds from a public offering of up to  shares of its class a common stock for which the company has filed a registration statement on form s with the sec  together with borrowings under the credit facility  vendor financing and cash from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements of its existing operations 
the forward looking information contained in the previous sentence may be affected by a number of factors  including the matters described in this paragraph and under risk factors in item of this report 
the company may need to raise additional capital from public or private equity or debt sources in order to finance its operations  capital expenditures and growth for periods after and for the optional redemption of series a preferred stock if it is not converted 
moreover  the company believes that continued growth and expansion through acquisitions  investments and strategic alliances is important to maintain a competitive position in the market and  consequently  a principal element of the company s business strategy is to develop relationships with strategic partners and to acquire assets or make investments in businesses that are complementary to its current operations 
the company may need to raise additional funds in order to take advantage of opportunities for acquisitions  investments and strategic alliances or more rapid international expansion  to develop new products or to respond to competitive pressures 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of the company s then current shareholders may be reduced and such equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of class a common stock 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to raise such capital on acceptable terms or at all 
in the event that the company is unable to obtain additional capital or is unable to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms  the company may be required to reduce the scope of its presently anticipated expansion opportunities and capital expenditures  which could have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations and financial condition and could adversely impact its ability to compete 
the company may seek to develop relationships with strategic partners both domestically and internationally and to acquire assets or make investments in businesses that are complementary to its current operations 
such acquisitions  strategic alliances or investments may require that the company obtain additional financing and  in some cases  the approval of the holders of debt or preferred stock of the company 
the company s ability to effect acquisitions  strategic alliances or investments may be dependent upon its ability to obtain such financing and  to the extent applicable  consents from its debt or preferred stock holders

 accounting for stock based compensation in this statement encourages entities to adopt a fair value based method of accounting for employee stock option plans whereby compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized over the employee service period rather than the current intrinsic value based method of accounting whereby compensation cost is measured at the grant date as the difference between market value and the price for the employee to acquire the stock 
if the company elects to continue using the intrinsic value method of accounting  pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share  as if the fair value based method of accounting had been applied  will need to be disclosed 
management has not decided if the company will adopt the fair value based method of accounting for the company s stock option plans 
the company believes that adopting the fair value basis of accounting could have a material impact on the financial statements and such impact is dependent upon future stock option activity
