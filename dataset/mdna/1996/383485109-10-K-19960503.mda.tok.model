item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the fiscal retail environment presented the company with many challenges 
as described more fully below  the company s fiscal comparable store sales and gross margin were negatively impacted primarily by external factors influencing the company s operating environment 
such external factors included unusual variances in weather conditions during the spring and fall selling seasons and intense pricing competition initiated by two financially troubled retailers in certain of the company s market areas 
in order to compete in such an environment  the company increased its promotional activity  resulting in higher markdowns and a lower gross margin 
the company s fiscal results of operations were also negatively impacted by the amortization of new store pre opening costs associated with the opening of two new stores in fiscal and six new stores including one larger replacement for a pre existing store in fiscal the company also incurred higher selling  general and administrative and interest costs as a percent of net sales in connection with those new stores 
these factors were partially offset by increased service charge income as a percent of net sales 
while management believes the impact of such external factors is temporary and will not continue throughout fiscal  the company is implementing revised operational strategies which include cost reduction and revenue enhancement plans 
management believes the implementation of such plans will assist the company in achieving its goal of profitable operations 
management also expects the company s fiscal results of operations to benefit by the acquisition of broadway stores  inc broadway  one of the company s primary competitors  by federated department stores  inc federated and the temporary and permanent closure of certain broadway locations in connection with that acquisition

the company recorded a net loss of million in fiscal as compared to a net income of million in fiscal the company s fiscal results of operations were favorably impacted by the year end lifo inventory valuation adjustment and other non recurring adjustments to certain other reserves  partially offset by a provision for unusual items 
the company recorded a net loss of million in fiscal the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain items from the company s consolidated statements of operations  expressed as a percent of net sales net sales service charges and other income

this increase reflects additional sales volume generated by the opening of six new gottschalks stores during fiscal and two new gottschalks stores not open for the entire year in fiscal new stores opened in california during fiscal include auburn february  san bernardino april  a larger replacement for a pre existing store in visalia august  watsonville august and tracy october 
the company also opened its first store in nevada during the year in carson city march 
new stores opened in fiscal include oakhurst october and sacramento  california november 
comparable store sales decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal this decrease is due  in part  to unusual variances in weather conditions in many of the company s market areas during the year 
spring and summer apparel sales were weak due to unusually cold and rainy weather conditions early in the spring season  and unseasonably warm weather in the fall and winter seasons resulted in sluggish fall and winter apparel and seasonal home merchandise sales 
temporary pricing competition initiated by two financially troubled retailers operating in certain of the company s market areas also negatively impacted sales at the company s stores in those areas 
management is continuing efforts to increase sales volume through the controlled expansion of the company and is attempting to improve market share in its existing markets through the development of new sales and customer service related programs 
new stores opening in fiscal included a new gottschalks store in reno  nevada in march and two larger replacement stores for pre existing stores in modesto and fresno  california  in march and april   respectively 
management also expects sales volume to increase in fiscal as the result of the acquisition of broadway stores  inc  one of the company s major competitors  by federated department stores  inc see liquidity and capital resources 
service charges and other income service charges and other income increased million to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  an increase of 
as a percent of net sales  service charges and other income increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal service charges associated with the company s customer credit cards increased million to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this increase is primarily due to an increase in the late charge fee assessed on delinquent customer accounts  effective january  which resulted in increasing late charge fees by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal credit sales as a percent of total sales have also continued to improve  increasing to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal  primarily due to the ongoing success of credit related programs first implemented by the company in fiscal and  in addition to increased marketing efforts aimed at the company s customer credit cardholders and credit solicitation activities resulting in a higher percentage of new credit card accounts opened in connection with new store openings

other income  which includes the amortization of deferred income and other miscellaneous income and expense items  was  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal cost of sales cost of sales increased million to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  an increase of 
the company s gross margin percent decreased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal this decrease in gross margin percent relates primarily to an increase in markdowns as a percent of net sales due to i heavy discounting of men s  women s and junior apparel necessitated by unusually cold and rainy weather conditions in the spring and summer selling seasons and unseasonably warm weather conditions during the fall and winter selling seasons  ii temporary competitive pressures caused by pricing policies of two financially troubled retailers in certain of the company s market areas during the period  iii the clearance of certain merchandise in connection with a modification of the company s women s apparel merchandising strategy  and iv promotional activity related to new store openings during the period 
the company s inventory shrinkage was of net sales in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the company s gross margin percent was favorably impacted by the year end lifo inventory valuation adjustment  which resulted in an increase in gross margin of million 
the company s lifo inventory reserve for financial reporting purposes was eliminated as a result of the fiscal adjustment and no similar benefit was recognized as a result of the company s fiscal lifo adjustment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
excluding the effect of the lifo adjustment  the company s gross margin percent was in fiscal to a lesser extent  the company s fiscal gross margin percent was also favorably impacted by a reduction of inventory shrinkage to of net sales in fiscal as compared to in fiscal  primarily due to improved inventory related controls 
management believes the company s gross margin will continue to be pressured in fiscal by both intense competition and pricing pressures from other department and specialty stores  discount retailers and outlet malls  and as a result of changing consumer spending patterns 
management is continuing efforts to implement a variety of strategies designed to counteract these pressures  including tight controls over inventory levels  shifting inventories into more profitable lines of business based on current trends  the negotiation of additional guaranteed gross margin arrangements with vendors  and the implementation of enhanced information systems and new technology as a means to reduce inventory related costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  an increase of 
as a percent of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal this increase as a percent of net sales is primarily due to lower than expected sales volume  in addition to higher payroll  advertising and other selling  general and administrative costs associated with certain of the company s new stores opened during the year 
certain store operating costs as a percent of net sales are generally higher for new stores and decline as the stores mature over a two to three year period 
the company has also experienced an increase in building and equipment rental expense as a result of the sale and leaseback financing of the capitola store in fiscal and enhanced pos terminal and information systems equipment leased during the year 
the impact of such increases has been partially offset by reductions in depreciation and amortization as a result of such sales 
see liquidity and capital resources 
in fiscal  the company realized the benefit of reductions to required workers compensation claim reserves resulting from favorable experience adjustments and revisions to applicable workers compensation laws 
excluding the effect of such experience adjustments  selling  general and administrative expenses were of net sales in fiscal the company revised its workers compensation program in early fiscal and no significant favorable or unfavorable experienced adjustments were recognized in fiscal or are expected in the future 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization  which includes the amortization of new store pre opening costs  increased million to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  an increase of 
this increase is primarily due to the amortization of new store pre opening costs which increased by million to million in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal  as a result of completing and opening two new stores in fiscal and six new stores including one replacement store in fiscal excluding the amortization of new store pre opening costs  depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales decreased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal this decrease is primarily due to lower depreciation expense resulting from the sale and leaseback of the company s department store in capitola  california in fiscal and its mainframe computer in fiscal  partially offset by additional depreciation expense resulting from capital expenditures  net of reimbursements received for certain of those expenditures  for new stores opened during the year 
see liquidity and capital resources 
management expects the amortization of new store pre opening costs to be lower in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to fewer planned new store openings 
interest expense interest expense increased million to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  an increase of 
due to the increased sales volume  interest expense as a percent of net sales remained unchanged at in fiscal and the dollar increase in interest expense resulted from an increase in the weighted average interest rate charged on outstanding borrowings under the company s various lines of credit in fiscal as compared to in fiscal  higher average outstanding borrowings under those lines of credit to fund increased inventory purchases associated with new stores and operating losses during the year  and additional interest expense associated with the midland mortgage loans october  heller note payable december and fixed base certificates march 
these increases were partially offset by lower interest on long term borrowings as a result of the application of proceeds from the midland mortgage financing and the capitola sale and leaseback arrangement

liquidity and capital resources overview of current liquidity position 
the fiscal retail environment presented the company with many challenges 
the company s operating losses and capital requirements associated with the opening of new stores strained the company s working capital facilities and reduced the company s liquidity 
as described more fully below  the company has limited internal sources of liquidity due to the fact that operating uses of cash have exceeded cash generated by operations  requiring the company to turn to external sources for a portion of its liquidity requirements 
sources of external liquidity are also limited due to the fact that i all but one of the company owned stores have either been mortgaged or sold and leased back to the company  leaving the company with limited capacity for future secured borrowing  and ii borrowing capacity under the company s primary revolving line of credit arrangement with fleet capital corporation fleet depends on the company s ability to comply with restrictive covenants in the applicable agreement 
the company had difficulties meeting certain of such covenants in fiscal fleet has cooperated with the company in revising such covenants and  when necessary  has granted waivers or agreed to forebear such violations 
in addition  for fiscal  fleet has tied the covenants to the company s financial plan the plan 
as of the date of this report  the company s actual results of operations for the first two months of fiscal exceeded the plan and the company was in compliance with all applicable restrictive covenants 
the following more completely summarizes the company s present liquidity position and provides factors for evaluating the company s liquidity prospects 
liquidity needs 
the company s primary needs for liquidity are to provide working capital  to meet its debt service requirements and to fund costs associated with the acquisition and construction of new stores and the renovation of existing stores 
in fiscal the company also required additional funds for the payment of million in connection with previously settled stockholder litigation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s working capital increased by in fiscal  primarily as a result of increases in inventory and prepayments to vendors in connection with new store openings 
the company  unable to fully fund this increase from operating cash flow  funded the increase with debt 
the increased inventory is pledged as collateral under the line of credit with fleet 
note see proposed course of action and the factors listed therein which may affect the forward looking statements contained in this paragraph 
the company anticipates its cash flow requirements for fiscal to be lower than in fiscal  primarily due to fewer new store openings 
the company currently anticipates additional capital expenditures in fiscal of million and increased inventory requirements and other costs of million in connection with its fiscal new store openings  or million less than such amounts incurred in connection with fiscal new store openings 
the company will also continue to require funds to meet its debt service payments  including a million short term note payable to wells fargo bank  n 
a  due in september while management currently expects to repay such loan with proceeds from a proposed sale and leaseback arrangement of the company s department store in san luis obispo  california  in the event the proposed transaction is not finalized or its finalization is delayed  management believes the company will have adequate cash flow available under alternative sources to repay the loan upon its scheduled maturity 
see mortgage and sale leaseback financings below 
in addition  as described more fully in part i  item iii  legal proceedings  the f n litigation presently pending against the company is scheduled for trial in july while the company previously recorded a reserve for a loss that may result from an unfavorable judgement or settlement of that litigation  a cash payment in connection with such a judgement or settlement could take place in fiscal management believes such amounts have been adequately provided for in the company s fiscal plan 
liquidity sources 
in recent years  the company s working capital requirements have been met through a combination of long term and short term debt financing  cash flows provided pursuant to its receivables securitization program  mortgage financings and sale leasebacks of its owned department stores 
the company s current sources of liquidity  however  are more limited 
it is anticipated that the company s current liquidity will come primarily from cash  its revolving lines of credit and its securitization program 
as described below  other sources of liquidity which were used by the company in recent years are not likely to provide the company with significant working capital funds 
as a result  the company s ability to take advantage of growth opportunities will be limited 
mortgage and sale leaseback financings 
the company finalized certain mortgage loans and a sale leaseback financing of its properties in fiscal see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
proceeds from such transactions were used primarily to repay pre existing loans and to reduce outstanding borrowings under the company s line of credit with fleet 
management is currently negotiating for the sale and leaseback of its department store located in san luis obispo  california 
management expects the arrangement to be finalized in the second quarter of fiscal and intends to use the million expected proceeds from the arrangement to repay the million short term obligation to wells fargo  due september   with the remaining million available for working capital purposes 
however  there can be no assurance that the arrangement will be finalized  or that its finalization will not be delayed  subject to a variety of conditions precedent or other factors 
assuming such sale leaseback is completed  all of the company s land and buildings will either have been sold or pledged as collateral for mortgage loans and the company will have no additional land or buildings that could be used to raise additional working capital 
cash flows from securitization program 
the company s receivables securitization program provides the company with an additional source of working capital financing that is generally more cost effective than traditional debt financing 
see other recent sources of liquidity and note to the consolidated financial statements 
management is presently negotiating with the bank hapoalim for the expansion and extension of the previously issued variable base certificate and related line of credit  and expects to finalize such negotiations in fiscal based on the present level of receivables and historical trends  management believes there will be adequate collateral to expand the variable base certificate by million in late fiscal  which would result in total availability under the line of credit with bank hapoalim of million 
however  there can be no assurance that a sufficient level of receivables will be generated or that bank hapoalim will enter into such an expansion or extension 
revolving lines of credit 
the company s primary revolving line of credit arrangement is with fleet and provides for borrowings of up to million through march such borrowings are limited to a restrictive borrowing base equal to of eligible merchandise inventories during the months of march through december during all other months 
interest under the fleet line of credit is charged at a rate equal to libor plus through august  and libor plus thereafter at february  
in addition  as described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements  the arrangement with fleet contains various restrictive covenants 
thus  while the maximum amount available for borrowings under the line of credit was million at february   and only million was outstanding as of that date  the company s ability to continue to borrow under the fleet facility depends upon its ability to meet the financial covenants and the restrictive borrowing base 
the arrangement with fleet was amended several times during fiscal and one additional time in early fiscal  primarily to increase the company s borrowing capacity under the arrangement and to revise certain restrictive covenants that the company would have otherwise breached 
increases to the borrowing capacity under the arrangement were requested by the company in order to fund additional inventory purchases and capital requirements that were incurred in connection with opportunities to open new stores that were presented to the company after the fiscal borrowing capacity had been established 
the company also required increases to its borrowing capacity to provide funds to cover operating losses during the period 
certain of the restrictive covenants under the arrangement were originally established by fleet based on the company s fiscal financial plan 
the company revised its fiscal plan several times during the year to reflect its current level of operations and the impact of the new stores added after its original fiscal plan had been finalized 
accordingly  fleet amended the agreement several times during the year  and in connection with such amendments  increased the interest rate charged under the arrangement and charged the company additional loan and administrative fees 
notwithstanding the amendments  the company was in violation of four of the covenants applicable to the fleet arrangement as of february  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
fleet agreed to forebear such violations as of that date and to further amend certain of the restrictive covenants for fiscal certain of the restrictive covenants applicable to the arrangement for fiscal have been established by fleet based on the company s fiscal financial plan 
see proposed course of action 
accordingly  the company s ability to maintain compliance with such covenants is contingent upon its ability to meet its plan 
the company believes that it will be able to maintain compliance with the restrictive covenants in the fleet arrangement 
however  if the company is unable to comply or to obtain waivers or amendments to the agreement in the future  fleet will have the ability to deem all outstanding borrowings under the arrangement as immediately due and payable prior to its maturity on march  management believes alternative financing sources may be available to the company  however  any delay in obtaining such alternative financing would have a material adverse effect on the company 
proposed course of action 
the statements in this section proposed course of action and in the section liquidity needs above contain forward looking statements 
numerous factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements described 
many of such factors are beyond the company s control 
such factors include  but are not limited to  i the company s ability to improve performance of existing stores  reduce operating costs  enhance service charges and other revenues and improve cash flows  each as described below  ii potential negative customer response to the proposed changes summarized below  iii the actual costs incurred in opening new stores  iv the variability of the company s results in any period due to the seasonal nature of the business  the timing and level of the company s sales and promotions  the timing of new store openings  the weather and fashion trends  v the overall health of the economy in the company s markets  such as levels of employment  consumer confidence and income and the effect of any downturn in the california economy or in the specific regions in which the company operates  vi promotional and pricing programs of competitors  vii the ability of the company to complete the sale leaseback of its san luis obispo store  and viii the outcome of any company litigation 
the company s plan is aimed  among other things  at improving the company s liquidity position 
the plan projects that the company will have adequate cash and availability under its various revolving lines of credit to meet its liquidity needs through the end of fiscal the plan incorporates a variety of strategies developed in connection with a recent operational and strategic review 
such strategies are aimed at increasing the company s sales and gross margins  reducing its operating expenses and enhancing its service charges and other revenues 
management believes the company s outlook for fiscal will largely be dependant upon the company s ability to achieve the operating results and level of cash flows projected in that plan 
as of the date of this report  certain of the operational and stretegic assumptions incorporated in the plan  described more fully below  have already been implemented 
improved performance of existing stores management believes the company s performance can be improved by changing its approach with respect to under performing stores 
management has identified two of its department stores that are currently performing below desired levels and is pursuing a strategy to modify the operations of those locations in an attempt to minimize their adverse affect on the company s overall operating results 
unfortunately  the opportunities to close these locations are limited due to certain provisions contained in the related lease agreements 
reduce operating costs in connection with its efforts to reduce operating costs  the company benchmarked its operating costs against certain of its peer group and competitors operations and has identified areas in which the company could potentially reduce its operating costs without adversely affecting customer service and sales levels 
the primary source of operating cost reductions are expected to occur in the following areas i personell reductions through the reduction of selling  buying  and administrative staff  the restructuring of job assignments and the elimination of duplicative functions and functions no longer essential to the core operations of the company  ii the outsourcing of certain functions where cost benefits and efficiencies can be attained  iii the renegotiation of certain contracts and agreements  and iv the elimination or reduction of certain discretionary expenses 
enhance service charges and other revenues the company intends to implement an increase to the finance charge rate assessed on outstanding customer credit card account balances and to increase the late charges assessed on delinquent customer accounts  consistent with rates charged by certain competitors  by mid fiscal see part i  item i  business credit policy 
improve cash flow the company s fiscal expansion program included the opening of six new department stores 
see part i  item i  business store expansion and remodeling 
as of the date of this report  the company has opened the one new store in reno  nevada  and the two replacement stores in fresno and modesto  california  contemplated in the company s plan 
with the exception of expenditures related to those new stores  the company currently does not anticipate any further new store openings in fiscal additionally  the company intends to limit major capital expenditures  maintain tight controls over inventory levels and substantially reduce other discretionary expenditures in order to provide increased cash flows for operations 
the company s cash flow was enhanced during the first quarter of fiscal by the receipt of million in connection with the filing of certain amended income tax returns 
management believes the company s ability to meet its plan is further enhanced by the acquisition of one of its primary competitors 
federated department stores  inc federated acquired broadway stores  inc broadway  in late fiscal broadway operated eleven stores under broadway and weinstocks nameplates in approximately one third of the company s market areas 
federated has announced that it will permanently close four of those locations during the first quarter of fiscal and will temporarily close three of those locations for remodeling  with those stores expected to reopen in the third or fourth quarters of fiscal under a macys or bullocks nameplate 
the remaining four locations were reopened by federated immediately under a macys or bullocks nameplate 
management believes that while broadway stores carried substantially the same merchandise and competed for the same customer as the company  macys bullocks department stores generally carry higher priced merchandise and compete with the company to a lesser degree 
the company s stores in the locations in which broadway stores are to be permanently or temporarily closed comprised of the company s fiscal sales 
management expects this percentage to increase in fiscal as a result of the temporary and permanent store closures 
other recent sources of liquidity 
mortgage and sale leaseback financings 
the company obtained additional working capital funds in fiscal through mortgage loans and a sale leaseback 
on october   the company finalized three fifteen year mortgage loans with midland commercial funding midland  and on october  finalized a fourth such mortgage loan 
the mortgage loans  collectively the midland loans  are collateralized by the land  buildings and leasehold improvements of four of the company s department stores located in eureka  antioch  yuba city and palmdale  california 
the million total proceeds from the arrangements were used to repay the million remaining outstanding balance of a pre existing long term loan with wells fargo  with the remaining million used to reduce outstanding borrowings under the fleet line of credit and pay certain costs associated with the transaction 
monthly principal payments on the mortgage loans are based on twenty five year amortization schedules and interest is payable at fixed rates ranging from to 
the outstanding balance of the midland loans was million at february  on june   the company finalized the sale and leaseback of the land  building and leasehold improvements comprising its department store located in capitola  california 
proceeds from the arrangement  totaling million  were used to reduce the outstanding balance of the previously described wells fargo long term note payable by million  with the remaining million used to reduce outstanding borrowings under the fleet line of credit 
bank and other financings 
in addition to the fleet facility  the company also has a revolving line of credit with bank hapoalim that provides for additional borrowings of up to million through march  limited to a restrictive borrowing base 
interest on outstanding borrowings under the line of credit is charged at a rate equal to libor plus at february  
at february   the maximum amount available for borrowings of million was outstanding under the line of credit with bank hapoalim 
the company also has a long term financing arrangement with heller financial  inc heller  due january   which bears interest at a rate of and had an outstanding loan balance of million at february  the note with heller also contains various restrictive loan covenants 
the company was in violation of one of those covenants at february  the company has obtained a waiver from the lender for the violation as of that date and the agreement has been amended to avoid expected future violations 
management believes the company will be able to maintain compliance with the applicable covenants  as amended  throughout fiscal accordingly  the related debt is classified as long term pursuant to its original terms in the accompanying financial statements 
the company s commercial revenue bonds were paid upon their maturity on december  with proceeds from a short term note payable to wells fargo in the amount of million 
the note payable  originally due march   extended to september   is collateralized by the company s department store in san luis obispo  california  and bears interest at a rate of above the prime rate of interest through march   increasing to and above the prime rate through june  and above the prime rate of interest  thereafter 
during  the company also received a total of million in connection with two of its fiscal store openings for the purpose of financing fixture and equipment expenditures at those locations 
the million is to be repaid over ten year maturity periods at interest rates ranging from to 
the outstanding balance of such loans at february  was million 
securitization program 
as described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company issued million principal amount fixed base class a credit card certificates fixed base certificates to third party investors in march under a receivables securitization program 
interest  earned by the certificateholders on a monthly basis  is paid through finance charges collected under the program 
the outstanding principal balance of the certificates is to be repaid in equal monthly installments commencing september through september  through the application of credit card receivable principal collections during that period 
the issuance of the fixed base certificates was accounted for as a sale for financial reporting purposes 
accordingly  the million of receivables underlying those certificates and the corresponding obligations are excluded from the accompanying financial statements 
the company used the million proceeds from the initial securitization and sale of the receivables to repay all outstanding borrowings under a pre existing line of credit and long term credit facility and to pay certain costs related to the securitization transaction 
in september  a variable base class a credit card certificate variable base certificate in the principal amount of up to million was also issued to bank hapoalim as collateral for the previously described revolving line of credit financing arrangement with that bank 
in addition to the fixed and variable base certificate  additional series of certificates may be issued as a source of additional working capital financing to the company 
management is presently contemplating the issuance of an additional variable base certificate in late fiscal  however  there can be no assurance that such an issuance will occur 
subsequent events 
on march   the company finalized an agreement with broadway stores  inc broadway  a wholly owned subsidiary of federated department stores  inc federated  and way modesto properties  corp  the landlord  whereby the company vacated its present location in the modesto  california vintage faire mall and sub leased broadway s former store in that mall for the remaining twelve years  including renewal periods  of the lease 
pursuant to a letter of intent dated april   the company also vacated its present location in the fresno fashion fair mall and reopened a new store in that mall in the former broadway store location 
management expects to finalize a twenty year lease for fashion fair location in the near term 
lease terms under both of the arrangements are comparable to other leases of the company 
in connection with the arrangements  the company purchased certain of the existing fixtures and equipment at the modesto location from federated for million  and federated financed the purchase price with a five year note payable bearing interest at a rate of 
the company expects federated to finance the purchase of additional fixtures and equipment under similar terms in connection with the finalization of the fashion fair arrangement 
additional cash flow and working capital analysis 
working capital increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the company s ratio of current assets to current liabilities continued to improve  increasing to at february   as compared to at january  and at january  cash flows from operating activities consist primarily of net income loss adjusted for certain non cash income and expense items  including  but not limited to  depreciation and amortization  the provision for uncollectible accounts and changes in deferred taxes 
net cash used in operating activities was million in fiscal excluding the payment of certain recurring expenses related to fiscal that occured in fiscal due to the rd week  net cash used in operating activities was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million 
this increase is primarily attributable to increased inventory requirements associated with six new stores including one larger replacement store opened since the prior year  less million received as incentive to open one of those new stores see note to the consolidated financial statements and an increase in amounts due from vendors and prepayments for certain merchandise 
as described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements  net cash used in operating activities in fiscal also includes the payment of million into an irrevocable trust in accordance with the settlement of the previously described stockholder litigation and amounts paid in connection the settlement of previously outstanding state income tax matters 
net cash used in operating activities in fiscal and related primarily to increases in merchandise inventories and receivables associated with new stores opened during and shortly after year end in each of those years
