item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations fiscal as compared with fiscal and revenues the company s total revenues for fiscal were  as compared with  for fiscal and  for fiscal optical memory card products sales of optical memory cards and related products to value added reseller vars  licensees  and end user customers increased to  for fiscal as compared with  for fiscal and  for fiscal  mainly due to increases in unit shipments for commercial applications 
for the development of commercial market applications for its products  the company utilizes var companies as part of its marketing and distribution program for lasercard r products 
sales to vars include the company s optical memory cards  the company s system software  optical card reader writers made by a licensee of the company  and add on peripherals made by other companies such as equipment for adding a digitized photo  fingerprint  hand template  or signature to the cards 
the vars may add application software  personal computers  and other peripherals  and then resell these products  integrated into data systems  for end user customers in their geographic regions 
for fiscal year  the company commercially sold approximately  lasercard r optical memory cards and reader writers versus  cards and reader writers for fiscal and  cards and reader writers for fiscal the company sold lasercard products in fiscal to approximately customers in states and foreign countries  including products for american medical data applications  us government related programs  several programs in italy  including a secure soccer season ticket  and two programs in the philippines an admission pass retail purchase log at a duty free shopping zone and a vehicle warranty maintenance records card 
in addition  these sales included products for medical card field trials pilot programs in the united states  south korea  brazil  saudi arabia  and other countries 
there can be no assurances that any var company in any country will be successful in its markets or field trials or that it will place follow on orders with the company for additional quantities of cards and systems 
in order to upgrade its var customer base to increase the probability of success  the company will continue its efforts to recruit new vars and eliminate nonproductive ones 
the company provides marketing leads  customer support  and system software to assist vars 
seventeen newly recruited vars purchased initial systems including optical cards and equipment during fiscal software is an important factor in developing the commercial markets for optical cards 
the company s system software consists of optical card interface software and device drivers  file systems  software development tools  and demonstration software 
the company does not provide software for specific applications  but instead depends on its vars to integrate optical card products into existing software products  write new application software for specific optical card programs  or license software from other vars 
several vars have written optical card software programs for applications such as automobile warranty maintenance  cargo manifesting  digital optical key systems  admissions id  data logging systems  and various medical related applications such as medical image storage and health history cards 
other application software development is underway by vars and their customers 
optical memory cards are used in conjunction with card reader writer equipment connected to personal computers and accessed in the same manner as floppy disk drives 
such reader writers are incorporated into lasercard systems sold to vars and other customers of the company 
the price  performance  and availability of such reader writers are factors in the commercialization of optical cards 
the company sells reader writers for a few thousand dollars per unit  and these units generally include the company s interface software and device drivers 
the company does not manufacture card reader writers but instead continues to purchase such equipment from a japanese licensee  nippon conlux co  ltd  currently the company s sole supplier of reader writers 
the company s inventory level for reader writers fluctuates based on the timing of purchases and sales 
the company can give no assurance that increased production of card reader writers will occur in the near term or that high volume sales and correspondingly lower prices will result 
if market demand increases sharply over a short period of time  an initial shortage of reader writers could result 
also  an interruption or change in the supply of reader writers could cause a delay in product shipments and a possible loss of sales  which would affect operating results adversely 
licensing the company sold one license in fiscal for  one license for  in fiscal  and no licenses in fiscal payment of the license fees were received in the respective fiscal periods 
the fiscal license agreement included a trademark license and an installment payment toward the purchase of a lasercard distribution license 
the fiscal license agreement was for a lasercard distribution license sold to a korean var of the company 
license fees received by the company are unconditional and nonrefundable  and no significant obligations remain unfulfilled by the company under any of its licenses 
the company is actively pursuing its efforts to generate additional license revenues  however  license sales by the company are sporadic and unpredictable as to timing and type of license 
the magnitude of future license revenues  if any  cannot be predicted or inferred from past events 
royalties royalty revenues were  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal although royalty revenues have not reached material amounts  the company does anticipate future royalty income on a long term  continuing basis from among two royalty bearing optical memory card manufacturing licenses and several royalty bearing  equipment license upgrades previously sold 
the company cannot predict whether or when equipment or card sales by its licensees will result in material royalties to the company  since the optical memory card industry is in the early commercial stage 
therefore  the company is not relying on royalty income and does not expect it to be a significant factor in the near term 
backlog the company generally fills most orders within to days of receipt of purchase order or release order 
therefore  to date there has not been a consistent  large order backlog 
the company s quarterly sales are generally dependent upon new orders placed each quarter 
until a large order backlog is established  the company s quarterly sales will be subject to material fluctuation 
margins gross margin on product sales for fiscal was as compared with for fiscal and for fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal as compared with is due mainly to a decrease in the average selling price of optical memory cards  partially offset by a lower per card cost 
this is a result of a greater portion of fiscal card sales being lower priced cards with fewer features than cards sold the previous fiscal year 
the decrease in fiscal as compared with fiscal is due mainly to an increase in optical memory card facility costs charged to cost of product sales and a decrease in the markup on optical memory card reader writers 
gross margins on optical memory card sales will fluctuate based upon type and volume of cards sold 
as card manufacturing for commercial orders increases  the company s optical memory card manufacturing facility is used less for the purposes of research and engineering 
therefore  an increasing amount of the manufacturing facility costs depreciation expense  building lease payments  and other costs are allocated to cost of product sales and a decreasing amount of these costs are charged to research and engineering 
this allocation has no effect on pretax profits 
for fiscal   and  respectively  the company allocated   and of the facility expenses to card manufacturing for commercial orders and marketing samples 
when the company reaches a production level of approximately million cards per year for commercial orders  the cost allocation percentages should become relatively fixed  with essentially all of the card manufacturing facility costs allocated to cost of product sales 
the facility expenses will then become a fixed cost component of product sales and should decrease on a per card basis as volumes increase 
income and expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a for fiscal  sg a expenses were  as compared with  and  respectively  for fiscal and sg a spending is expected to continue at current levels for the short term 
the  increase for fiscal is due mainly to a  increase in payroll expenses  a  increase in marketing expenses  including trade shows and travel  and a  increase in legal expenses 
the company s plans include increased marketing and customer support activity  which will be implemented when certain financial goals are achieved 
research and engineering expenses research and engineering expenses were  for fiscal as compared with  for fiscal and  for fiscal the optical memory card facility is used both for engineering and manufacturing 
therefore  the facility costs depreciation expense  building lease payments  and other costs are allocated between manufacturing and engineering based upon the level of manufacturing activity 
depreciation and amortization expenses charged to research and engineering decreased to  for fiscal as compared with  for fiscal and  for fiscal this was due mainly to a change on october  in the estimated useful lives of the optical memory card manufacturing equipment 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as optical card production increases and card manufacturing resources are allocated to card production to a greater degree than at present  reported research and engineering expenses are expected to decrease 
the company believes that the reduction in card manufacturing facility expenses allocated to research and engineering will not have any negative effect on its optical card business since research and engineering projects are continuing 
it also is possible that future projects may require increased spending as the optical card industry grows 
other income and expense other income for fiscal was  as compared with  for fiscal and  for fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  the company received a  nonrefundable deposit toward a license agreement 
the license agreement was not consummated and the deposit was forfeited by the licensee 
the income from the forfeiture of the deposit is recorded as other income in fiscal see part i  item  legal proceedings 
there was no income of this type for fiscal or fiscal other income for fiscal included  net of expenses  resulting from full and final settlement of a claim filed in december by the company against a third party for possible future business loss 
there was no income of this type for fiscal or fiscal interest income for fiscal was  as compared with  for fiscal and  for fiscal the increase in interest income for fiscal versus fiscal was due to an increase in average invested funds 
the increase for fiscal versus fiscal was due to an increase in average invested funds and higher interest rates 
the company s interest expense on short term loans was  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal discontinued operations during fiscal  the company discontinued its emulsion photoplate operation because of the limited market for these products  which was long anticipated by the company 
during fiscal  the company completed settlement of its remaining commitments related to its discontinued emulsion photoplate operation  at an amount lower than its accruals for these items 
therefore  discontinued operations had income of  for fiscal as compared with a loss of  for fiscal there was no income or loss of this type for fiscal liquidity as of march   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  and a current ratio of to net cash used for operating activities was  during fiscal year as compared with  for fiscal and  for fiscal the company had no long term debt as of march  the company has not established a line of credit 
generally  the company s customers make advance payments  in whole or in part  at time of order placement because the company s optical memory cards are usually made to custom specifications that are specific to each customer  end user  or application 
the company believes that although working capital requirements should grow in proportion to product shipment levels  the advance payments will reduce the need for working capital financing 
the company may negotiate a line of credit if and when it becomes appropriate 
at the current level of product sales  the company does not generate cash or profits from operations 
to fund its operations  the company requires either a substantial increase in order levels of optical cards  sales of additional licenses  or additional financing 
based on current raw material costs and other expense calculations  the company estimates that it will break even on operations at annual sales of approximately million optical memory cards along with sales of related hardware 
if there is slow progress by customers in the development and implementation of lasercard based programs  this could extend the period during which the company would need additional financing 
the company has updated its plan to increase card production capacity  which calls for the addition over several years of million in capital equipment to the card manufacturing facility and additional production employees when customer orders are of sufficient magnitude to justify each incremental step 
previously  in its report on form k for the year ended march   the company estimated a requirement for million in capital additions to attain a million card production level 
the updated plan provides for a greater variety of optical memory card versions based upon presently known customer requirements 
the added million investment in a high throughput  color printing press would further expand the company s color ink printing capacity 
this would permit color printing of all of the million cards per year that the company estimates it could produce in an updated manufacturing facility 
the million investment in capital equipment would be implemented incrementally  as follows to increase the current production equipment capabilities from million to million cards annually   for producing up to million cards annually  million more  for producing up to million cards annually  million more 
the company may make additional capital investments for cost savings and other purposes 
at march   the company had an accumulated deficit of  the company anticipates that the size of its losses will decrease due to anticipated increases in sales of optical memory cards and related products  except for possible quarterly fluctuations 
however  if increased commercialization is delayed and the company does not realize such increased sales  its losses will continue  except in the event of sporadic sales of licenses which in the past have ranged in price from approximately million for a card distribution license to million plus royalties for a card manufacturing license 
during fiscal  the company had cash receipts  net of expenses  of  from the private placement of  shares of its common stock 
these shares have not been registered under the securities act of and cannot be offered or sold in the united states absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements 
the company has agreed to file an s registration statement covering certain of the shares sold by the company under private placements in fiscal years and at such time as the sec approves the registration  the shareholders may resell the shares 
during fiscal  company employees and consultants purchased from the company  shares of registered common stock  at an average price of per share  through the exercise of stock options under the company s stock option plan  which resulted in additional cash receipts to the company of  as of march   company employees and consultants held unexercised  vested options to purchase  shares of common stock at exercise prices ranging from to per share  for an average of per share 
these stock options  if exercised  would provide the company cash in the amount of  the company will continue its product marketing activities and its licensing efforts and will consider opportunities for additional equity financing in order to strengthen its cash position  to accelerate its marketing and sales activities  and to add software and manufacturing capabilities to more rapidly build sales of optical memory cards 
the company is not aware of any materially adverse trends that would limit its ability to finance operations through additional equity financings  if required 
however  the company cannot guarantee that such equity financing would be available  if needed 
stock price volatility the company s common stock price is subject to significant volatility due to fluctuations in revenues  earnings  capitalization  liquidity  press coverage  and financial market interest 
some of these factors may be exacerbated because the company operates solely in the optical memory card products industry  which is in the early stage of commercialization
