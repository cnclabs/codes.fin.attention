item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis mesa air group  inc mesa and its subsidiaries are a group of regional airlines and related companies providing service across the united states as america west express  mesa airlines  united express and usair express 
the following tables set forth selected operating and financial data of mesa for the years indicated below operating data years ended september passengers    available seat miles    revenue passenger miles    load factor revenue per asm cent cent cent yield per rpm cent cent cent cost per asm cent cent cent financial data years ended september percent cost percent cost percent cost amount of per amount of per amount of per revenues asm revenues asm revenues asm flight operations  cent  cent  cent maintenance  cent  cent  cent aircraft and traffic servicing  cent  cent  cent promotion and sales  cent  cent  cent general and administrative  cent  cent  cent depreciation and amortization  cent  cent  cent aircraft return provision  cent total operating expenses  cent  cent  cent interest expense  cent  cent  cent revenue and expense comparison fiscal versus fiscal operating revenues increased million percent for fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year 
this increase in operating revenues is the result of a six percent increase in passengers and a four percent increase in average fares 
capacity  measured by available seat miles asms  increased by percent 
the load factor increased from percent to percent and revenue per asm increased from cent to cent 
the airline industry has a history of fare and traffic volatility  however  management expects revenue per available seat mile to remain relatively stable during the next fiscal year 
flight operations expense decreased from cent per asm in to cent per asm in primarily due to a reduction of fleet integration costs during the current year  a conversion of many aircraft from being operated under operating lease to owned aircraft  and the operation of jet aircraft throughout the entire fiscal year 
however  this benefit was partially offset by higher than average pilot training costs in the third and fourth quarters caused by major airlines hiring more than the usual number of pilots and an increase in fuel related to a new tax on jet fuel and a general increase in price 
maintenance expense was essentially unchanged at cent per asm in aircraft and traffic servicing cost increased slightly from cent per asm in to cent per asm in this increase is primarily the result of increased operating fees at denver international airport 
these costs include landing fees  station wages  rent and other station costs 
promotion and sales expense decreased slightly from cent in to cent per asm in these costs include commissions  booking fees and other reservation costs and will vary with revenue 
general and administrative expense remained constant at cent per asm 
depreciation and amortization expense increased from cent per asm in to cent per asm in primarily due to additional depreciation on owned aircraft 
depreciation will continue to increase per asm during as a result of additional owned aircraft 
interest expense increased from cent per asm in to cent per asm in as a result of financing more aircraft through use of debt rather than operating leases 
mesa incurred an effective tax rate of approximately percent for the year this rate is lower than due in part to implementation of a state tax minimization program 
the combination of the above factors  excluding a one time accrual for fokker return costs of cent per asm  resulted in a slight increase in operating expenses from cent per asm in to cent per asm in fiscal versus fiscal operating revenues increased million percent for fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year 
capacity measured by asms increased by percent 
during fiscal capacity grew at a higher rate than revenues primarily as a result of intense competition and negative publicity regarding regional airline safety which took place in the first six months of the fiscal year 
the introduction of jet aircraft into the fleet in the last quarter of the fiscal year also increased capacity without corresponding increase in revenue per available seat mile 
the load factor decreased slightly from percent to percent and the yield per rpm decreased from cent to cent 
the decrease in yield per rpm is primarily the result of lower air fares on the west coast during the first six months of the year  which adversely affected financial results at the westair subsidiary 
flight operations cost increased by million percent compared to a percent increase in capacity 
this resulted in an increase in cost per asm from cent in to cent in the primary reason for the increase in flight operations expense was the integration costs related to introduction of dhc and fokker jet aircraft into the fleet 
these integration costs were expensed during the fiscal year 
maintenance expense decreased from cent per asm in to cent per asm in excluding jet asms  the decrease was from cent per asm in to cent per asm in this decrease was primarily the result of a fewer number of scheduled engine overhauls in as compared to aircraft and traffic servicing cost increased slightly from cent per asm in to cent per asm in these costs include landing fees  station wages  rent and other station costs 
promotion and sales expense decreased slightly from cent in to cent per asm in these costs include commissions  booking fees and other reservation costs and will vary with revenue 
general and administrative expense decreased from cent per asm in to cent per asm in depreciation and amortization expense increased from cent per asm in to cent per asm in due to increased amortization resulting from an increase in intangibles 
interest expense decreased from cent per asm in to cent per asm in as a result of financing more aircraft through operating leases rather than debt and a decrease in the amount of long term debt 
mesa incurred an effective tax rate of approximately percent for the year  a slightly higher rate than the prior year 
changes in tax law and the adoption of financial accounting standards board statement in did not have a material impact on the financial statements 
the combination of the above factors resulted in a slight increase in operating expenses from cent per asm in to cent per asm in liquidity and capital resources mesa s cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of september  amounted to million 
this was a decrease of million from the prior year resulting from utilization of cash in a stock repurchase program 
mesa generated approximately million in cash from operating activities during mesa s cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities are intended to be used for working capital  acquisitions  capital expenditures and a continuing stock buy back program 
mesa had receivables of million at september  which consist primarily of amounts due from code sharing partners united and usair 
under the terms of the united and usair agreements  mesa receives a substantial portion of its revenues through the airline clearing house 
historically  mesa has generated adequate cash flow to meet its operating needs 
mesa currently has a million line of credit  of which approximately million is available 
amounts reserved under this line of credit have been used to facilitate the issuance of letters of credit 
mesa has significant operating lease obligations on existing aircraft 
at september   mesa leased aircraft with remaining terms of up to years 
future lease payments due under all aircraft operating leases were approximately million at september  at september   mesa had commitments to acquire nine beechcraft model d aircraft prior to december  beech acceptance corporation has agreed to provide lease or debt financing  at mesa s option 
mesa accepted delivery of two fokker jet aircraft during the summer of mesa s purchase contract included an option to acquire six additional aircraft 
the agreement with fokker allowed mesa the right to return the two aircraft to fokker from to months after delivery  subject to a six month notification 
during january  fokker announced a suspension of payments to its creditors 
by april  fokker had entered into liquidation and was unable to provide the six additional fokker aircraft under option to mesa 
therefore  since management believed a fleet of two fokker s could not be operated profitably  the company noticed the return of the two fokker aircraft 
daimler benz  the owner of the fokker aircraft  and mesa have negotiated an agreement in principle which allows mesa to continue operating the two aircraft through august at existing lease rates in exchange for the company s agreement to pay for time related costs use of the aircraft through the date of return 
at june   the company accrued a provision for the hours utilized on the aircraft through june  in addition  the company will continue to accrue additional time related aircraft costs on an hourly basis through the remainder of the lease term of the aircraft 
at june  the company accrued an aircraft return provision for all other estimated costs related to the return of these two aircraft 
mesa has an aircraft order with bombardier  inc to acquire de havilland dash aircraft worth million with deliveries scheduled in early through march due to production delays  the delivery schedule was delayed and mesa was granted an option to cancel up to five of the aircraft on order 
as of september   mesa had taken delivery of only five of the scheduled dash aircraft 
mesa has arranged financing commitments for of the aircraft and is presently arranging financing for the remaining aircraft on order 
bombardier will participate as needed to finance any new aircraft deliveries 
mesa also has an option to acquire additional de havilland dash aircraft 
the dash aircraft purchase agreement provides for a spare parts supply program  which includes all required parts to maintain the aircraft  excluding engines and propellers  for a period of seven years 
mesa will pay a fixed hourly charge per flight hour for this spare parts supply program 
during august  mesa entered into a memorandum of understanding to acquire canadair regional passenger jet aircraft crjs worth approximately million with deliveries to begin in february mesa will trade in embraer brasilia aircraft on the canadair regional jet aircraft on order 
an million deposit has been made to bombardier  inc related to this commitment  and bombardier will participate as needed to provide financing for the crjs to be acquired by mesa 
mesa has options to acquire an additional crj aircraft 
during december  the federal aviation administration faa announced rules which require commuter airlines with aircraft of or more passenger seats operating under far part rules to begin operating those aircraft under far part regulations by the end of march mesa is one of the largest regional airlines operating under far part regulations 
in anticipation of mesa s conversion to far part and to address issues raised in past inspections  the faa began a special review of mesa s operations in june as a result of the special review by the faa of mesa s operations  a consent order was signed in september assessing a compromise civil penalty of  mesa paid  of the compromise amount  and the remaining  will be waived upon mesa complying with provisions of the consent order 
under the consent order  mesa has agreed to adopt operational standards that exceed the requirements of the federal aviation regulations 
the consent order requires that control of operational areas maintenance  flight operations and training be consolidated under one central management team 
the company has until march to complete the specified tasks  and as of december  was on or ahead of the schedule set forth in the order 
based on the required conversion to far part and the provisions of the faa consent order  mesa anticipates a one time capital expenditure of approximately million in fiscal to bring all aircraft currently being operated by mesa into compliance with the enacted far part rules 
in addition  mesa presently anticipates ongoing operational costs in order to comply with the far part rules and consent order of approximately million per year 
mesa does not expect any material negative impact to its operations as a result of inflation 
mesa believes fares  and accordingly revenues  can be changed to offset the impact of inflation 
approximately percent of mesa s million of indebtedness is at floating rates and may be affected by inflation if such inflation results in an increase in interest rates 
a significant portion of the aircraft fleet is leased at fixed rates that would not be impacted by inflation 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for stock based compensation sfas requires that companies can elect to account for stock based compensation plans using a method based upon fair value or can continue measuring compensation expense for those plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
companies electing to continue using the intrinsic value method must make pro forma disclosures in fiscal of net earnings and earnings per share as if the fair value based method had been applied 
the company will continue using apb  therefore  sfas is not expected to have an impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
mesa announced on december  that it anticipates falling short of analysts earnings expectations for the first fiscal quarter of october december 
disappointing revenues in november  along with several one time costs associated with changes in its operations  are the primary causes of the anticipated shortfall 
these changes relate to improvements in the company s performance and customer service levels in the denver system  the consolidation of operations on the west coast by fleet type and the related closing of two maintenance facilities in that system 
in addition  the company incurred unusually high pilot training costs resulting from a transition into the dehavilland dash aircraft 
the company has also suffered the industry wide consequences of dramatically increased fuel costs 
as a result of these changes  which caused these one time expenses  the company expects to realize improving financial results going forward into the subsequent quarters
