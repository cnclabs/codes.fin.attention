as a result  all assets and liabilities were restated to reflect their appropriate value or fair value

interest and fee income on mortgage loans was million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal in march  the trust completed the disposition of substantially all of its mortgage loan portfolio 
the trust received million in net cash proceeds through a series of transactions which included loan repayments and a bulk sale of certain mortgage loans 
as a result  interest income earned on the mortgage loan portfolio will be substantially reduced in the future 
the trust s remaining mortgage loan portfolio is currently less than million 
interest and fee income decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the fiscal decrease resulted primarily from a reduction in earning mortgage loans which averaged million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal during fiscal  mortgage loans of approximately million were transferred to real estate and million have been repaid 
interest on short term investments was million for fiscal compared to million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal is due to the reduction in cash balances as a result of a million payment made on april  and an additional million payment made on september  to the old note holders in conjunction with the restructuring 
prior to these payments  the trust was continuing to accumulate cash and since september   had not made payments of interest or principal on its indebtedness 
available cash averaged million for fiscal compared to million and million in fiscal years and  respectively

liquidity and capital resources prior to its restructuring  the trust faced significant liquidity problems 
the trust did not generate sufficient cash flow from normal operations and was not able to liquidate mortgage loans and real estate investments in order to meet scheduled amortization on its indebtedness 
as a result of the restructuring  management believes the cash flow from operating activities will be sufficient to meet minimum debt service requirements 
the trust expects to fund capital expenditures from available funds from operations and cash on hand 
however  the trust s present liquidity  cash flow from operating activities and ability to liquidate existing assets to meet its obligations can be adversely impacted by a negative change in the economy  particularly as those changes may relate to real estate assets 
taxable income required to be distributed in order for the trust to maintain its reit status will be less than income reported for financial statement purposes under generally accepted accounting principles due to differences related to depreciation  use of nols subject to the code section limitations and timing differences related to bad debt deductions
