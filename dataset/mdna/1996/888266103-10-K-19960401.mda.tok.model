item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
dollar amounts are expressed in thousands 
company overview throughout  titan pursued its strategy of investing in its emerging commercial businesses 
investment dollars were provided primarily by drawing upon the company s bank line of credit and through internally generated funds 
the investments included  among other things  the construction of the titan scan medical device sterilization facility in san diego  california  hardware and software development related to the secure television business and increased selling  marketing and research and development expenditures 
significant accomplishments achieved by titan s emerging commercial businesses this year included the award of a million fixed price rural telephony development contract in indonesia  the completion of a million contract in thailand to integrate a satellite network  delivery of the first products in the secure television business and the sale of a turnkey medical device sterilization system in austria 
these accomplishments marked significant progress for titan 
however  the need to speed up product development and the commercialization process heightened the challenge of internally funding these start up activities 
as such  management continued the process of critically examining titan s long term operating and financing strategy 
in response  the board of directors adopted a strategy to reshape the company in order to make it more attractive to external funding sources within the capital marketplace 
a formal plan of restructuring was adopted which redefined titan s businesses into four business segments communications systems  software systems  defense systems  and emerging technologies 
as part of this strategy  management has determined that the restructuring would require dispositions of certain of titan s businesses as well as significant reorganizations of its software systems segment and sterilization business  reductions of personnel  and other actions associated with reorganizing the structure of the company 
a charge of approximately million was recorded in to reflect these restructuring activities 
titan s strategic plan now focuses on the pursuit of various financing alternatives including  but not limited to  public and private offerings of minority interests in certain of its subsidiaries and the sale of non core businesses  in order to provide additional funding for the development and commercialization of new products and services 
the company is currently involved in a number of start up ventures  most notably secure television  commercial satellite communications  and medical device sterilization 
certain investments made in these start up ventures have been capitalized and are included in the balance sheet  primarily within the captions of property and equipment and other assets which includes capitalized software costs 
at december   these capitalized investments aggregate approximately million 
these start up ventures are in various growth stages and have not yet generated sufficient revenues to achieve profitability 
management plans to continue to invest  primarily in the communications systems segment  while at the same time carefully monitoring its return on investment from all of its start up ventures 
an essential element of the company s long term operating plan is the growth associated with its well established defense systems segment 
this segment offers a variety of opportunities for titan 
management intends to grow this segment s businesses relying on titan s proven technological capabilities and reputation for performance 
during  achievements in this segment included a million award for low rate initial production for mini dama satellite communications terminals  a million contract with the us navy for engineering services in the ci area  and a million production order for satellite communication modems to be installed in motorola s lst tactical radios 
operating results the table below sets forth titan s consolidated revenues  operating profit loss  net interest expense  provision for income taxes benefit and net income loss for each of the three years ended december  revenues    operating profit loss    interest expense  net   income tax provision benefit    net income loss    titan s consolidated revenues were   and  in  and  respectively 
excluding revenues from titan s applications group  which was sold in april  titan s pro forma revenues were   and  reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 
this revenue growth was achieved primarily in the communications systems and software systems segments  while the defense systems segment  excluding the applications group  and emerging technologies segment revenues were relatively stable over the three year period 
titan s consolidated operating profit loss has been significantly impacted by a number of factors in each of the three years shown above 
combined selling  marketing  and research and development expenses were   and  in  and  respectively  reflecting titan s efforts to expand commercial applications of its technologies and to continue developing certain defense communication technologies 
general and administrative expenses decreased from  in to  in after having been reduced significantly from the level of  the decrease in resulted from specific actions taken to reduce headcount as well as more selective bid and proposal activity primarily in titan s defense systems segment 
restructuring charges were recorded in both and reflecting management s efforts to adapt to both internal and external forces impacting titan s long term operating strategy 
the charge was offset by a  pre tax gain resulting from the sale of titan s applications group 
lastly  in  operating profit was significantly impacted by the recording of an increase in estimated cost at completion of approximately  on the company s mini dama fixed price development contract with the us navy 
net interest expense has fluctuated significantly over the three year period ended december  generally  the principal component of interest expense is the company s borrowings under its bank line of credit 
borrowings from this source averaged   and  at weighted average interest rates of  and during  and  respectively 
also affecting interest expense is interest on the company s deferred compensation and retiree medical obligations 
interest expense related to these items was  and for  and  respectively 
interest on the deferred compensation obligation will continue to increase as the total obligation increases  while interest on the retiree medical obligation is expected to decrease 
income taxes reflect a benefit of  in or a effective tax rate 
the difference between the actual provision and the expected provision based on the united states statutory tax rates applicable each year is due to the alternative minimum tax and to permanent differences between financial statement income and taxable income 
the provision for taxes in was  or a effective tax rate  while the benefit for taxes in was  or a effective rate 
the differences between the actual effective rate and the expected rate in both these years was largely due to the effects of research credits and operating loss carryforwards 
also with respect to taxes  in titan recorded a  benefit representing the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principal as a result of the company s adoption of sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
business segments communications systems the communications systems segment contains two business units  both targeting rapidly growing commercial markets 
the first business unit  secure television  specializes in providing complete turnkey security for television delivery systems 
the second business unit is satellite communications  which develops  manufactures and sells satellite earth station networks and related subsystems 
revenues in this segment were   and  in  and  respectively 
the composition of the revenues was significantly different over the three year period 
revenues in included approximately  of secure television revenues from the company s first contract in this business area 
there were no secure television revenues in or revenues in the satellite communications business unit were approximately  in   in and  in however  in early  titan sold its transceiver manufacturing division which was part of this business unit 
on a pro forma basis  excluding the sold division  this segment s revenues were approximately   and  in  and  respectively 
the increase in pro forma revenues from to resulted from obtaining and performing on a contract to develop and integrate a satellite communications network in thailand as well as from the addition of secure television revenues previously mentioned 
the change from to was primarily due to increased sales of voice digitizing cards 
the segment s operating loss was  in compared to  in and  in the loss in reflects the start up nature of this segment s businesses which require significant selling  marketing and research and development activities disproportionate to the level of revenues generated to date 
management intends to continue investing in these businesses and  as a result  expects that significant losses will also be experienced in the loss in includes approximately  of losses and restructuring charges associated with titan exiting its transceiver manufacturing business which was primarily responsible for this segment s operating loss 
software systems the software systems segment provides custom and semi custom software development services to assist customers in moving from older mainframe systems to distributed computing systems utilizing client server software 
revenues in this segment were  for   in and  in one customer accounted for approximately  of this segment s revenue in both and  and  in in the second half of  this segment experienced reduced demand from this customer and management expects this trend to continue in the revenue increase was generated from new customers 
as shown above  the increase from to resulted from increased business with the one significant customer 
segment income margin segment operating income as a percentage of segment revenues was in and in the decrease was principally due to the effect of restructuring charges for severance and other reorganization costs and the impact of reduced sales volume from the one previously mentioned customer 
segment income margin was in the results for included losses on certain now completed fixed price contracts which significantly lowered overall segment profitability 
defense systems the defense systems segment includes two business units  communications and information systems  which provide information systems solutions primarily to us and allied government and defense customers 
the defense communications business develops and produces advanced satellite terminals and associated voice data processing modems 
these products are specifically tailored to meet defense requirements  provide highly secure communications and are produced in relatively small amounts 
the defense information systems business supports high priority government programs by providing information systems engineering services as well as development and integration of systems and specialized products 
revenues in this segment were   and  for  and  respectively 
however  excluding revenues attributable to the company s applications group  pro forma segment revenues were   and  for  and  respectively 
the decrease from to was due to reduced shipments in the electronics division 
revenues in and included approximately  and  respectively  for work subcontracted to the buyer of the applications group 
there was no operating profit associated with these revenues 
this contract is expected to conclude in mid furthermore  revenues and operating profit included approximately  recovered from a termination for convenience claim with the us government for work performed in prior years 
segment income margin for was  compared with in in there was an operating loss of  operating results for include  of profit resulting from a favorable settlement and from improved contract performance on the company s mini dama fixed price development contract 
this profit was offset by a charge of approximately  for restructuring this segment s electronics division 
the loss in was primarily the result of recording an increase in estimated costs to complete the company s mini dama fixed price development contract which was the subject of a contract dispute with the customer  the us navy 
emerging technologies emerging technologies contains a group of mature businesses generally involved in department of defense dod funded research and development contracts and start up commercial businesses  including medical product sterilization services and systems and environmental consulting services 
the company s strategy is to use the research and development activities as a source of additional dod and commercial products  systems and services 
revenues in this segment were   and  in  and  respectively 
approximately  of revenue was generated by the segment s start up businesses 
substantially all remaining revenue for all periods presented was derived from the various established business lines 
this segment s operating profit loss has not been material in relation to titan s consolidated operating results 
generally losses experienced by the start up operations have offset profits contributed by the segment s other lines of business 
liquidity and capital resources during  the company used cash for increased operating requirements  investing in its emerging businesses which included significant capital expenditures as well as investments in capitalized software costs  and payment of dividends 
the operating cash requirements resulted primarily from an increase in accounts receivable and inventories along with payment of certain compensation obligations and funding of restructuring activities 
cash was provided from a variety of sources 
the company utilized  of its bank line of credit  obtained  as a result of secured debt financing for the san diego scan facility  received  through a private placement of common stock and  from the sale of businesses 
in january  the company obtained  in cash as a result of the replacement of a maturing secured obligation with a new secured financing transaction 
cash requirements in are expected to continue to be significant 
cash generation varies from quarter to quarter and in most years the company has experienced higher cash requirements in the first quarter than in other quarters 
management expects this pattern to continue in the first quarter of during  the company expects to invest up to million primarily in the further development of business ventures within the communications systems segment 
funding is planned to be from operations  the bank line of credit  and the sale of non core businesses 
titan s line of credit agreement requires the company to have annual net income  as defined  prohibits two consecutive quarterly losses and contains other financial covenants which require the company to maintain stipulated levels of tangible net worth  a minimum debt service coverage ratio and a specified quick ratio 
the company has obtained a waiver from the bank for the net loss 
in order to provide additional funding for further and or accelerated growth  the company continues to explore various other financing alternatives 
should the company be unable to successfully obtain outside financing  the investment in these start up ventures could change

entry into commercial business 
prior to  the company s revenues had been derived principally from business with the department of defense and other government agencies 
since that time  the company has pursued a strategy of using the technology from its defense business to build commercial businesses 
this strategy presents both significant opportunities and significant risks for the company 
many of the company s commercial businesses  such as secure television  satellite communications and medical sterilization  remain in an early stage 
as such  the company is subject to all the risks inherent in the operation of a start up venture  including the need to develop and maintain marketing  sales and customer support capabilities  to secure appropriate third party manufacturing arrangements  to respond to the rapid technological advances inherent in these markets and to secure the necessary financing to support these activities 
in addition  many of the opportunities in the secure television and satellite communications businesses are large  international projects which require long lead times in the contract process 
the company s efforts to address these risks have required  and will continue to require  significant expenditures and dedicated management time and other resources 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in addressing these risks 
reliance on major software customer 
the company s software systems business is substantially dependent on business from a major telecommunications company to develop and support access carrier client server software applications 
revenues from this customer totalled approximately million  million and million  or  and of total company revenues in  and  respectively 
in the second half of  the company experienced reduced demand from this customer and management expects this trend to continue in the loss of this customer  or a substantial delay or decrease in the amount of its business  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on defense spending 
the company s defense systems segment is dependent upon continued funding of us department of defense programs 
titan  like other companies doing business with the us department of defense  has been affected by declining defense budgets and has experienced increased competition in certain of its defense business areas 
the size and scope of any reductions in future defense budgets is uncertain  and management anticipates that competition in most defense related areas will continue to be intense
