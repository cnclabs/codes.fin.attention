item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition for the last several years  the company has been working towards repositioning its grossman s stores in the east to focus store operations upon a market niche to serve the professional customer and offset the loss of market share with the retail customer 
sales for september  which in the prior year had been the largest volume month for professional sales  were below expectations 
within grossman s stores  comparable store sales to professionals decreased by  compared with a increase one year ago 
comparable retail sales in these stores declined by in september versus a decline in september eleven underperforming stores were closed immediately  but sales results in the remaining stores continued to deteriorate 
based upon these results  it became apparent that future professional sales growth could not be anticipated to cover the continued erosion in the retail sector 
losses and cash deficits attributable to the grossman s stores significantly impaired the company s liquidity  and projections of future results did not indicate a reversal of this trend 
during the latter months of  the company met with potential strategic and financial buyers and lenders to seek sources of capital or financing to meet the upcoming debt maturities and provide sufficient liquidity to adequately stock the stores with merchandise for the upcoming spring selling season 
no outside sources of capital for the continuation of the grossman s stores were found and the company s revolving credit agreement did not provide sufficient availability to enable the stores to secure sufficient inventory for the spring selling season 
additionally  funds were not available for the scheduled million of principal and interest payments due on maturing debentures 
as a result  a course of action was undertaken to liquidate the grossman s stores  offer the owned properties for sale and provide the requisite liquidity to service debt and to support the current operations and future expansions of the contractors warehouse and mr 
nd s bargain outlet divisions 
to improve liquidity during the latter part of  the company sought offers for its million note receivable from kmart corporation  received in partial settlement from the sale of its former braintree  massachusetts headquarters property 
due to kmart s troubled financial situation at that time  no reasonable non contingent offers were received 
the company continued to seek additional financing in and  after lengthy negotiations  a restructuring and refinancing plan was announced on march   under which the remaining grossman s stores  located in eight northeastern states  were closed 
four transactions were committed to in the same time period refinancing of the company s debentures originally due january  sale of the note receivable from kmart corporation  obtaining a million mortgage loan  secured by owned properties to be offered for sale  and a commitment for a new long term revolving credit agreement  with increased borrowing availability 
an estimated million restructuring charge will be reflected in the first quarter financial statements related to severance costs  lease payments  inventory liquidation costs  other expenses and the net unrecoverable amount of property plant and equipment 
approximately one half of the charge will result in a cash outflow  most of which will occur in the company began the closing and liquidation of its grossman s stores on march  concurrent with the timing of the store closings  expected to take up to ten weeks  administrative support functions in the company s headquarters were reduced 
upon completion of the store closings  the company s total workforce will have been reduced from approximately  to  holders of debentures will be paid for principal and interest due  in a combination of cash and notes payable 
cash payments will total approximately million 
notes payable of million  due in three years  with interest payable semi annually at  will be issued 
these notes will be convertible at the holder s option into shares of the company s common stock at per share 
an additional million of non convertible notes payable  with interest payable semi annually at per annum  will also be issued 
these notes are due in three years and may be repaid prior to maturity from proceeds of real estate sales  after full repayment of mortgage notes  described below 
interest on these notes may be deferred at the company s option 
the company s million note receivable from kmart corporation  originally discounted for financial reporting purposes to million  was sold for cash of million on march  the company received a commitment for a series of mortgage notes  payable principally from sales of closed store and other properties 
the mortgage notes are secured by both closed and operating owned properties 
the notes total million  million of which will be non interest bearing and is payable from the first sale of properties 
an additional million will be non interest bearing and convertible into common stock at per share  following repayment of the remainder of the mortgage notes 
the remaining million bears interest at per annum  payable monthly 
principal is payable as following million is due upon the sale of furniture  fixtures and equipment from closed stores  million is due in september  million is due in march  million is due in september and the remainder is due in march fees due under the various notes  totalling million  will be paid from loan proceeds 
the company also received a commitment to provide a three year line of credit for borrowings up to million  including letters of credit up to million  under a formula based arrangement based on of qualified inventory and of qualified accounts receivable 
borrowings pursuant to this agreement will be secured by inventory  receivables and other assets 
this agreement  which bears interest at over prime rate  contains no financial covenants or capital spending limitations 
upon closing  the company s existing revolving term note payable will be terminated 
cash flow and liquidity difficulties during the last quarter of and first quarter of resulted in an inability to fully stock stores to historical seasonal levels 
it is expected that the refinancing plan will again allow for all stores to be fully stocked  however  first quarter and future sales and operating results will be impaired until the in stock inventory positions reach the required levels 
in september  the company sold its former corporate headquarters to kmart corporation for million and recognized a pre tax gain of million 
the purchase price was paid with million in cash and the remainder in a million note receivable 
cash proceeds were used to repay revolving credit borrowings 
the note is due in two installments  million is due in january and the remainder is due september the note bears interest at over prime rate during the note s final eight month period 
the note was discounted for financial reporting purposes and was initially recorded at million 
as described above  the note was sold for million in march during  the company sold its eastern division distribution center and certain closed store properties  and repaid outstanding mortgage debt totalling million 
throughout  the company actively marketed properties vacated as a result of previously closing a total of stores in the past two years and stores in of the owned stores within this group  stores have been sold  three stores were reopened as a mr 
nd s bargain outlets and the remainder are available for sale 
proceeds received in from the sale of the distribution center  the cash portion of the headquarters property sales and the sale of closed store properties totalled million 
following the closing of stores in  as described above  the company has owned properties which are being actively marketed 
sales proceeds will be used for payment of mortgage debt financing  with the company retaining the excess 
in march  available borrowings under the company s revolving credit agreement  including letters of credit up to million  were increased from million to million 
the agreement contains various covenants which  among other things  require minimum levels of net worth  establish minimum interest and fixed charge ratios  and establish maximum levels of capital expenditures and investments in subsidiaries 
the company required amendments to modify previously established covenants in the second  third and fourth quarters of in march  the loan facility was reduced to million and available borrowings were reduced to million 
as previously discussed  the company has received a commitment for a new three year line of credit with available borrowings up to million 
at december   cash borrowings under the revolving credit agreement totalled million and outstanding standby letters of credit totalled million 
the maximum total borrowings under this agreement during were million  including letters of credit of million 
total long term debt  including the debentures and capital lease obligations  decreased by million 
this decrease results from million of payments associated with sold properties  and continuing scheduled payments  offset by an increase in capital lease obligations  principally for equipment in new contractors warehouse stores 
inventory at december  totalled million  a million decrease from the prior year end 
inventory declines as a result of eastern division store closings were offset in part by inventory in newly opened stores 
accounts payable  which historically have trended along with inventory  increased from million in to million in  reflecting cash management in light of the liquidity issues discussed above 
declines in property  plant and equipment reflect the sale of closed store properties  offset in part by the capital expenditures  principally to support new stores  which totalled million 
during  the company opened new contractors warehouse stores in indianapolis and fort wayne  indiana and in columbus  ohio 
two new mr 
nd s bargain outlet locations were opened  in schenectady and renssalaer  new york  and one store was relocated in braintree  massachusetts 
two additional contractors warehouse locations are scheduled for opening in lexington  kentucky in may and cleveland  ohio in the fall of mr 
nd s bargain outlet opened three stores in the first quarter of  and four or more former grossman s stores  presently leased  are expected to be converted to new stores 
it is the company s plan to continue the expansion of each of these divisions in future years 
the investment in the company s owned unconsolidated joint venture  construcentro  declined from million in to thousand in  reflecting a cash investment of thousand  a net loss of thousand  and adjustments totalling approximately million to reflect the devaluation of the mexican peso in relation to the us dollar 
plans to build additional stores in mexican markets remain on hold awaiting stabilization of the mexican economy 
at december   operations of the company s consolidated installed sales subsidiary ceased to be supported by the company 
on december   the actuarial assumption for the discount rate used to value pension benefit obligations was changed from to  on par with yields for appropriate high quality debt instruments 
as a result  a non cash adjustment of million was recorded to increase the minimum pension liability  the intangible asset was reduced by thousand to equal unrecognized prior service cost  and the difference of million was charged to stockholders investment 
the minimum liability  intangible asset and adjustment to stockholders investment will be measured annually and will change based upon interest rate assumptions  changes in the benefit obligation and changes in the value of plan assets 
beginning in  new employees of the company will not be eligible to participate in this pension plan 
the company believes that existing funds  funds generated from operations  proceeds to be received upon closing of financing activities and proceeds from sales of non operating properties  will be sufficient to pay existing liabilities  to satisfy debt service requirements  to pay other liabilities in the normal course of business and to finance planned capital expenditures 
in march  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  which requires impairment losses to be recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amount 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company believes that adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on results of operations or financial condition 
in november  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  under which companies can choose to account for stock compensation awards based on their fair value at the date the awards are granted 
this statement is effective for calendar year the company will continue to account for stock compensation under the accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
under apb  because the exercise price of options granted are equal to the market price  no compensation expense will be recognized 
results of operations compared with a net loss of thousand in compares to a net loss of million in  with non recurring items occurring in each year 
the results include a pre tax gain on the sale of the company s former headquarters site and a provision for the closing of eastern division stores 
the results include a provision for the closing of eastern division stores 
before non recurring items  an operating loss of million resulted in  as compared to operating income of million in operating expense savings in were insufficient to offset a gross profit decrease of million  which resulted from both sales and margin rate decreases 
competitive conditions  declining housing starts and turnover rates  low selling prices and margins on commodity lumber prices  and sluggish economic conditions  particularly in the northeast  contributed to the results

throughout  this strategy produced comparable store sales increases to professionals  more than offsetting retail comparable store sales declines 
in the first half of  retail sales continued to decline and professional sales continued to increase  but at lesser rates 
beginning in april  professional sales increases were insufficient to offset retail declines and by the third quarter  comparable store sales to professionals began to decline 
in advance of and during the fourth quarter of  the company undertook initiatives to improve future sales  particularly with respect to professional sales 
additional sales personnel  both on the road and within stores  were added in both contractors warehouse and grossman s stores to expand service to professional customers 
these initiatives had positive results in contractors warehouse stores  and its comparable store sales increased by in the fourth quarter 
within grossman s stores  however  both retail and professional comparable store sales continued to decline  with fourth quarter decreases of and  respectively

within these stores  a comparable store sales decline of for the first six months of  affected by heavy rains in the first quarter  was offset by the third and fourth quarter increases of and  respectively 
the gross profit decline of million was the result of both the sales decrease and a decline in the gross margin rate from in to in  reflecting lower commodity lumber margins 
margin declines also continue to occur as a result of increased sales to professional customers

included in selling and administrative expenses is pension expense  which decreased from million in to million in as the result of changes in assumptions used to actuarially determine the pension liability and expense

in both and  the company s strategy was to emphasize sales to the professional customer 
in both years  comparable retail sales declines were offset by comparable professional sales increases 
total sales results included contractors warehouse store openings in both and  offset by grossman s store closings 
gross margin declined from in to in throughout  margin declines occurred as the result of the increase in sales to professional customers  who receive discounts from normal retail pricing  and the growth in contractors warehouse stores  which operate at higher per stores sales volume with lower gross margins 
margin declines were also due to competitive market conditions and volatile lumber prices
