item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company entered into an agreement effective october  with solaris to become both the master agent and master distributor for sales of solaris products nationwide 
management believes that the new relationship with solaris embodied in the solaris agreement has had a substantial impact on the company s results of operations 
under the solaris agreement  which has an initial four year term  the company  in addition to serving as the master agent and master distributor for sales of solaris products  provides a wide range of value added services including logistics  order processing and fulfillment  inventory distribution and merchandising 
however  solaris continues to negotiate its sales prices directly with its direct sales accounts 
as a result of the solaris agreement a majority of the company s sales of solaris products are derived from servicing direct sales accounts  whereas in and fiscal  a majority of the company s sales of solaris products were made by the company as a traditional distributor 
a substantial portion of these sales consists of large shipments to retail distribution centers which are characterized by lower gross profit as a percentage of net sales compared with sales made by the company as a traditional distributor 
the company believes that the operating expenses associated with this type of sale are lower than the operating expenses associated with sales made by the company as a traditional distributor 
the company believes that the gross profit as a percentage of net sales associated with the company s services to solaris direct sales accounts is higher than the gross profit as a percentage of net sales associated with the company s historical agency sales due to the greater services provided pursuant to the solaris agreement 
the company believes that the collective impact of these factors has led to substantially increased sales of solaris products  increased gross profit from sales of solaris products and lower gross profit as a percentage of net sales 
in addition  under the solaris agreement  the company s accounts receivable related to solaris products sold to direct sales accounts are paid more quickly since the amount owed to the company is settled by solaris within days of receipt of an invoice  rather than waiting for payment by retailers in accordance with their normal payment terms 
since entering into the solaris agreement  inventories of solaris products have increased since the company is not only carrying inventories to support its own sales of solaris products but also certain inventory previously carried by solaris as well as additional inventories to support sales of solaris products by the company s network of independent distributors 
the solaris agreement provides for the company to be reimbursed for costs incurred in connection with services provided to solaris direct sales accounts and to receive payments based on the growth of sales of solaris products 
the company also shares with solaris in the economic benefits of certain cost reductions  to the extent achieved 
as a result  management believes that the company s profitability is more directly attributable to the success of solaris than it has been in the past 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the relative percentages that certain income and expense items bear to net sales nine month fiscal fiscal period year year ended ended ended december september september net sales cost of goods sold and occupancy gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest expense net other income expense income before income taxes and minority interest income taxes net income fiscal compared with twelve months ended september  in  the company changed its fiscal year to the last saturday in september 
accordingly  the fiscal year ended september  was a nine month period 
as a result of this change  operating results are not directly comparable with operating results for the nine month period ended september the company believes that comparing fiscal with the twelve month period ending september  will provide a more meaningful analysis of the company s operating results 
unaudited summary operating results for the twelve months ended september  are shown in note to the consolidated financial statements 
net sales for the year ended september  increased by or million to million from million for the comparable period 
the increase in net sales was due to incremental business resulting from the solaris agreement  acquisition of two pet supplies distributors in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and the addition of stores previously serviced by a competitor  expanded product placements and new store openings with existing customers 
gross profit increased by or million from million during the twelve months ended september  to million for the same period in gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased from in the twelve months ended september  to for the comparable period 
the decrease in the gross profit as a percentage of net sales is due principally to the incremental sales of solaris product which were sold to high volume  minimum service level retail distribution centers and to a lesser extent  the elimination of certain discounts and rebates which historically had been part of the solaris marketing programs 
for the year ended september   selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million from million for the similar period 
as a percentage of net sales  these expenses decreased from in the twelve months ended september  to in the comparable period 
the million increase relates to the two pet supplies distributors acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal and increased sales  offset in part by cost reductions in the existing pet operations 
the decrease in these expenses as a percentage of net sales relates to the fixed portion of these expenses being spread over substantially greater sales volume in compared with interest for the year ended september  decreased by or million to million from million for the twelve months ended september  the decrease is attributable principally to lower average outstanding borrowings as a result of applying the proceeds from the company s two public offerings of its common stock during fiscal and the termination of the monsanto trade financing agreement 
average short term borrowings for fiscal were million compared with million for the comparable period 
the outstanding borrowings include amounts due to solaris under the monsanto trade financing agreement which ended in november the average interest rates for the twelve months ended september  and september  were and respectively 
the company s effective income tax rate for fiscal was compared with a tax credit of for the similar period 
first nine months of compared with first nine months of in  the company changed its fiscal year to the last saturday in september 
accordingly  the fiscal year ended september  was a nine month period 
as a result of this change  operating results will not be directly comparable with the company believes that comparing the nine months periods of and will provide a more meaningful analysis of the company s operating results 
unaudited summary operating results for the nine months ended september  are shown in note to the consolidated financial statements 
net sales for the nine months ended september  increased by or million from million for the comparable period 
the increase in net sales was due to revenue from acquired operations and an increase in agency sales during the third calendar quarter of  offset in part by a sales decline in the western region lawn and garden markets 
the lawn and garden sales decrease in the western region was due principally to adverse weather conditions and the loss of certain customers who elected to buy direct from the company s major supplier 
agency sales as a percentage of net sales increased in the first nine months of to compared with for the similar period 
gross profit decreased by or million from million during the nine months ended september  to million for the comparable period 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased from in the nine months ended september  to in the comparable period 
the decrease in gross profit for the nine months ended september  was due principally to lower gross margin agency sales to high volume  low service accounts  which also typically have lower associated operating expenses 
in addition  the company sold a higher percentage of lower margin products 
for the nine months ended september   selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million from million for the comparable period 
as a percentage of net sales  these expenses increased slightly from during the first nine months of to for the comparable period 
of the million increase  approximately million is associated with the increase in sales while the balance  million  relates to i increased costs related to the consolidation of facilities in colorado  ii increased costs in the pet supplies division related to the downsizing and integration of the company s northern california pet operations  iii costs associated with certain potential pet acquisitions  iv costs associated with retention of employees in anticipation of increased sales and v additional bad debt provision 
interest expense for the first nine months of increased by or million from million for the comparable period 
the increase is due principally to a combination of higher interest rates and increased borrowing under the company s trade financing agreement with its major supplier and under the company s principal credit facility 
average short term borrowings for the nine months ended september  were million compared with million for the comparable period in the average interest rates were and  respectively 
the company s effective income tax rate for the nine months ended september  increased to compared with for the similar period  principally due to the impact of non deductible goodwill amortization 
inflation the results of operations and financial condition are presented based upon historical cost 
while it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation  the company believes that the effects of inflation on its operations have been immaterial 
liquidity and capital resources the company has historically financed its growth through a combination of bank borrowings  supplier credit  internally generated funds and sales of its stock to the public 
additionally  in november  the company received net proceeds after offering expenses of approximately million from the sale of million of convertible subordinated notes due the company s business is highly seasonal and its working capital requirements and capital resources track closely to this seasonal pattern 
during the first quarter of each calendar year  inventory  accounts receivable  accounts payable  and short term borrowings begin to increase  reflecting the build up of inventory and related payables in anticipation of the peak selling season 
during the second quarter of the calendar year  inventory levels decrease while account receivables peak and short term borrowings start to decline as cash collections are received during the peak selling period 
in the third quarter of the calendar year inventory levels are at their lowest level and receivables and accounts payable are substantially reduced through conversion of accounts receivable to cash 
during the fourth quarter of the calendar year  accounts receivable reach their lowest levels  while inventory and accounts payable and short term borrowings begin to increase 
since the company s short term credit line fluctuates based upon a specified asset borrowing base  the fourth quarter of each calendar year is typically the period when the asset borrowing base is at its lowest and consequently its ability to borrow is at its lowest 
for the twelve months ended september   the company used cash from operating activities of approximately million  resulting principally from the initial build up of inventory related to the solaris agreement combined with the termination of the monsanto trade financing agreement 
the company believes that the increased solaris inventory will allow it to accommodate the increased sales of solaris products under the solaris agreement without significantly increasing inventory levels in cash used from investing activities was million reflecting the purchase of two pet supplies distribution businesses for approximately million and additions to plant and equipment of million offset in part by the proceeds of million from the sale of the company s visalia  california warehouse 
cash provided from financing activities of million consisted primarily of million net proceeds from the company s stock sales in november and july offset in part by repayments of short and long term debt of approximately and million to acquire treasury shares 
the company generated cash from operating activities of million in fiscal year and million for the nine month period ended september  cash used in investing activities  which included approximately million to acquire four companies during  and million to acquire one company in  and the purchase of warehouse and delivery equipment  office furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements in fiscal year and the nine month period ended september  was million and million  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities of approximately million in consisted primarily of proceeds related to the company s short term credit facility reduced by approximately million repayments of its long term debt 
cash used in financing activities during of million was attributable to reductions in both short term and long term debt offset in part by proceeds from the sale of shares of the company s convertible preferred stock million to monsanto company and the exercise of stock options of approximately million 
the company has a line of credit with congress financial corporation western for million 
the available amount under the line of credit fluctuates based upon a specific asset borrowing base 
the line of credit  which bears interest at a rate equal to the prime rate plus per annum  is secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
at september   the company had outstanding borrowings of approximately million and had an additional million of available borrowing capacity under this line 
as a result of the company s sale of million of convertible subordinated notes  as of november   the indebtedness to congress was eliminated leaving the company with million of borrowing availability 
the company s line of credit contains certain financial covenants such as minimum net worth and minimum working capital requirements 
the line also requires the lender s prior written consent to any acquisition of a business 
the company had a trade credit arrangement with a financing affiliate of monsanto pursuant to which monsanto permitted the company to borrow up to million for the purchase of solaris products 
such borrowings were secured by a first priority lien on the company s inventory of solaris products and a second priority lien on all other inventories and receivables and bore interest at a rate below the prime rate 
this arrangement expired on november  subsequent to that date  financing arrangements with monsanto have been on typical solaris credit terms 
the company believes that cash flow from operations  funds available under its line of credit and its arrangements with suppliers including monsanto and funds available related to the sale of million of convertible subordinated notes in november will be adequate to fund its presently anticipated working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
the company anticipates that its capital expenditures will not exceed million for the next months 
as part of its growth strategy  the company has engaged in acquisition discussions with a number of companies in the past and it anticipates it will continue to evaluate potential acquisition candidates 
if one or more potential acquisition opportunities  including those that would be material  become available in the near future  the company after first using the funds received from the sale of its convertible subordinated notes may require additional external capital 
in addition  such acquisitions would subject the company to the general risks associated with acquiring companies  particularly if the acquisitions are relatively large 
in october  the company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the united states and canada flea and tick business of sandoz agro  inc sandoz flea and tick for approximately million 
the acquisition is expected to close before march  subject to approval by the federal trade commission ftc of the divestiture of sandoz flea and tick in connection with the merger of sandoz ltd 
and ciba geigy limited into novartis ag 
certain terms of the agreement  including the purchase price  are subject to change depending on the ftc review 
if the acquisition is consummated  proceeds from the sale of convertible subordinated notes will be used to finance the transaction 
weather and seasonality historically  the company s sales have been influenced by weather and climate conditions in the markets it serves 
for example  during the first six months of both and and the first three months of the calendar year in  the company s results of operations were negatively affected by severe weather conditions in many parts of the country 
additionally  the company s business is highly seasonal 
in  approximately of the company s sales occurred in the first six months of the year 
substantially all of the company s operating income is typically generated in this period which has historically offset the operating losses incurred during the rest of the year
