the other primary subsidiaries include hopper soliday co  inc hopper soliday  a broker dealer  and eastern mortgage services  inc eastern mortgage  a mortgage banking company 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements which appear elsewhere in this report 
on july   dauphin acquired eastern mortgage services  inc  a mortgage banking company headquartered in trevose  pennsylvania  for approximately million in cash pursuant to a definitive agreement signed in may the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
therefore  the results of operations of eastern mortgage from the date of acquisition are included with the results of dauphin 
results of operations summary dauphin deposit corporation recorded net income of million for  compared with million recorded in on a per common share basis  net income was in compared with in and in return on average total assets was for  compared with for and for return on average equity  excluding the sfas as defined in investment securities and other short term investments adjustment  was for compared with for and for return on average stockholders equity  including the sfas adjustment  was for compared with for during average earning assets increased to billion and the interest rate spread decreased to from 
the decrease in the interest rate spread was primarily the result of a shifting of deposits from transaction oriented deposits to time deposits 
the result was a decrease of million or in fully taxable equivalent net interest income 
dauphin continues to maintain a high quality loan portfolio

of year end loans and other real estate owned  down from 
at december  the allowance for loan losses was of year end loans at december  compared with at december  non performing loans were covered times by the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance includes million which is not allocated to any specific loan category 
because of this strong asset quality  the provision for loan losses was decreased by million in non interest income  other than securities gains  increased million  or 
increased non interest income was the result of growth in fiduciary activities  increase in volume of merchant credit card processing and mortgage banking activities 
offsetting these increases was a decline in commission and fee income generated by hopper soliday 
non interest expense items increased million  or 
contributing to this increase were strategic initiatives implemented  normal salary adjustments and additions to staffing levels and the inclusion of a full year of results for eastern mortgage 
additionally  other non interest expenses decreased due to the industry wide reduction in fdic insurance premiums 
net interest income net interest income is the product of the volume of average earning assets and the average rates earned on them  less the volume of average interest bearing liabilities and the average rates paid thereon

dauphin deposit corporation for analytical purposes  net interest income is adjusted to a taxable equivalent basis 
this adjustment facilitates performance comparisons among taxable and tax exempt assets by increasing tax exempt income by an amount equivalent to the federal income taxes which would have been paid if this income were taxable at the federal statutory rate of

dauphin deposit corporation during there was a decrease in net interest income of million due to changes in volume and a decrease of million due to changes in rate 
in there was an increase of million due to changes in volume and a decrease of million due to changes in rate 
the change in the net interest margin attributable to interest rates can be understood by analyzing the interest rate spread and the net interest margin on earning assets 
while the interest rate spread considers only the difference between the average rate earned on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  the net interest margin takes into account the contribution of assets funded by interest free sources 
as reflected in table  average earning assets were billion in and billion in and the interest rate spread for was compared with for and for the net interest margin for was compared with for and for table interest rate spread and net interest margin on earning assets dollars in millions average average average balance rate balance rate balance rate taxable equivalent earning assets    interest bearing liabilities    interest rate spread interest free sources used to fund earning assets total sources of funds    net interest margin short term interest rates prime  federal funds  etc 
continued to rise during the first half of followed by a decline in the second half of long term interest rates  in general  declined steadily for the entire year 
the net result of these interest rate movements was a flattening of the overall yield curve 
the average prime rate in was compared with in the average federal funds rate increased to for compared with for during  compared with  the average yield on earning assets increased basis points while the average cost of funds increased basis points resulting in a decrease in the interest rate spread of basis points 
the yield on the investment portfolio increased basis points due to the reinvestment of maturities at higher rates  when compared with the yield of the security maturing 
average loans  which represent the highest yielding earning assets  increased million or and produced a yield of in compared with in average loans represented of the average earning assets for the cost of interest bearing deposits increased to in compared with in rates paid on interest bearing transaction accounts decreased throughout interest rates offered on time deposits have been rising 
consequently  depositors have been shifting from transaction accounts to higher yielding time deposits 
the increase in the cost of short term borrowings basis points was caused primarily by the rise in the federal funds rate 
the interest rate spread decreased basis points which was partially offset by an increase in the value of non interest bearing funds resulting in a net basis point decline in the net interest margin

the yield on the investment portfolio decreased basis points due to the reinvestment of maturities at dauphin deposit corporation significantly lower rates when compared with the yield of the security maturing 
average loans  which represent the highest yielding earning assets  increased million or and produced a yield of in compared with in this slight increase was the result of a higher interest rate environment during  somewhat offset by fee income which is included in interest income 
the reduction of fees  due to lower refinancings in residential mortgages  reduced the yield by basis points 
average loans represented of the average earning assets for the cost of interest bearing deposits decreased to in compared with in rates paid on interest bearing transaction accounts decreased in early and remained relatively flat throughout the year 
interest rates on time deposits have recently been rising 
consequently  depositors are shifting from transaction accounts to higher yielding time deposits  reversing the trend of the prior three years 
the increase in the cost of short term borrowings basis points was caused primarily by the rise in the federal funds rate 
the interest rate spread decreased basis points which was partially offset by an increase in the value of non interest bearing funds resulting in a basis point decline in the net interest margin 
dauphin s cost of interest bearing funds is generally higher  and its net interest margin is generally lower  when compared with banking companies of dauphin s asset size 
an important factor in these comparative differences is certain individual retirement accounts which are invested in month variable interest rate products with a minimum interest rate of for the month term as discussed herein under deposits 
if these interest rate products had paid interest at dauphin s weighted average cost of funds for all other retail certificates of deposit  dauphin s cost of interest bearing liabilities would have been decreased by basis points  basis points and basis points for  and  respectively 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses charged against earnings was million in compared with million in  a decrease of 
this decrease was mainly due to the improved asset quality of the loan portfolio 
the provision is based on management s estimate of the amount needed to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses 
this estimate is based on the review of the loan portfolio  the level of net credit losses  past loan loss experience  the general economic outlook and other factors that management feels are appropriate 
management takes an aggressive approach to charging off loans 
this does not necessarily indicate a decline in the asset quality of the loan portfolio 
several improvements were seen in certain measures of loan portfolio performance 
the ratio of net charge offs to average loans decreased to

this non recurring refund was the result of litigation contesting the commonwealth s ability to tax united states obligations 
the broker dealer segment of dauphin represents broker dealer commissions and fees generated by hopper soliday 
this income is generated from underwriting securities which are predominantly general obligations of central pennsylvania municipalities  providing financial advisory services  selling securities to individual and institutional investors and other related activities

dauphin goes through a continual review to control benefit costs 
in the second quarter of  the bank insurance fund bif reached its statutory reserve ratio requirement of 
consequently  the fdic significantly reduced the assessment rates applicable to bif members and refunded to bif members that portion of the assessment for the second and third quarters of which represented an overpayment once bif had achieved full funding in accordance with the statutory reserve ratio requirement 
dauphin received a refund from the fdic in september in the amount of million which included interest from june  the date the bif was fully funded 
in addition  dauphin s assessment rate was dropped from basis points to basis points effective from the date of bif reaching its statutory reserve ratio requirement 
this reduced dauphin s deposit insurance expense by million when compared to in  dauphin will record  for deposit insurance for the period from january through june 
deposit insurance assessments for the second half of have not yet been determined 
dauphin deposit corporation all other non interest expense items increased million or in compared with the increase for was primarily the result of increased expenses to reflect numerous strategic initiatives implemented in the other non interest expense items that increased include depreciation on technological investments  upgrades to branch facilities  legal  and consulting fees

the balances maintained for short term investments and investment securities are  for the most part  supported by short term deposits such as money market and interest bearing demand accounts  short term borrowings and time deposits 
as reflected in table  the average maturity of the investment portfolio was years at year end included in the portfolio are state and municipal securities and mortgage backed securities that have a longer term maturity but are sometimes either called before maturity or have repricing characteristics that occur before final maturity

dauphin accounts for investment securities in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
sfas addresses the accounting and reporting for investments in equity securities that have readily determinable fair values and for all investments in debt securities 
these investments are to be classified in one of three categories and accounted for as follows debt securities that a company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity securities and reported at amortized cost  debt and equity securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings  and debt and equity securities not classified as either held to maturity or trading securities are classified as available for sale securities and reported at fair dauphin deposit corporation value  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
management has determined that the entire investment securities portfolio should be classified as available for sale 
loans average loans increased million or during compared with an increase of million or in loan growth continued to increase in  primarily in the area of consumer loans  as more emphasis was placed on this line of business 
the economy in our market area is diversified and has been relatively stable 
this affords dauphin the opportunity to select quality commercial credits and stabilizes our consumer business 
loan balances during were influenced by the improving economy and  as a result  balances in both the commercial and consumer areas increased 
dauphin continues to sell residential mortgages in the secondary market in order to avoid taking interest rate risk 
dauphin s policy is to make the vast majority of its loans and commitments in the market area it serves 
this tends to reduce risk and gives dauphin the opportunity to deliver its many products to the same customer base

competition for deposits has come from other commercial banks  thrift institutions  credit unions  brokerage houses and mutual funds 
deposit growth was primarily due to the increase in average interest rates during while rates paid on interest bearing transaction accounts decreased throughout  rates paid on time deposits have been increasing due to rising interest rates 
depositors appear to be shifting from transaction accounts to time deposits 
included in interest bearing deposits are certain individual retirement accounts ira totaling million which are invested in month variable interest rate products with a minimum interest rate of for the month term 
during  dauphin charged a service fee on these products  and initiated the process to discontinue the products in accordance with the terms of the ira contract 
in furtherance of its right to terminate this investment product  dauphin commenced a legal action for a declaratory judgment in seeking a judicial determination from the court permitting dauphin to discontinue the month variable rate investment product at issue and or to charge an annual maintenance fee and an additional fee on rollovers or transfers into the ira account 
dauphin s right to terminate the variable rate investment product and to charge a service fee is in dispute and is being challenged by the holders of the ira accounts in question 
it is management s opinion that continuation of the month variable rate investment product is not in the best interest of dauphin 
management intends to vigorously assert its legal right to discontinue the month variable rate investment product 
counsel expects the case to go to trial in the second quarter of and for a decision to be rendered by the court promptly thereafter 
during average time deposits increased million compared with a decrease of million during this funding source was used to replace volatile liabilities such as overnight federal funds 
additionally  the growth of non interest bearing deposits has been relatively slow in recent years 
the percentage of average non interest bearing demand deposits to average total deposits amounted to in and and for dauphin s banking subsidiary has remained interest rate competitive and has introduced new deposit products to maintain and attract deposits 
short term borrowings average short term borrowings decreased million or during compared with an increase of million or in short term borrowings are primarily represented by federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
the level of short term borrowings is dependent upon many items such as loan growth  deposit growth and the interest rates paid for these funds 
the average cost of short term borrowings increased from in to in and to in non performing assets table reflects dauphin s non performing assets for the five years ended december  dauphin s policy is to discontinue the accrual of interest on commercial loans on which principal or interest is past due days or more and on commercial mortgages on which principal or interest is past due days or more 
consumer loans  excluding residential mortgages  which are days past due are charged off 
residential mortgages are placed on non accrual status after becoming days past due 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  any unpaid interest is generally charged against income 
management believes that strict adherence to this policy with regard to non accruals and charge offs will insure that the historically high quality of the loan portfolio will be maintained

allowance for loan losses to non performing loans loan quality is maintained through diversification of risk  strict enforcement of credit control practices and continued monitoring of the loan portfolio 
at december   dauphin had no loan concentrations exceeding of total loans 
loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar activities which would cause them to be similarly affected by economic or other industry specific conditions 
the balance of non accrual and restructured loans is million at december  interest income on these loans of 
million was recorded on a cash basis 
if such loans were on the accrual basis  an additional 
million of interest income would have been recognized 
loans which are not included in non performing and are current as to payments of principal and interest but have a somewhat higher than normal risk of becoming non accrual  impaired or reduced rate in the future are estimated to total approximately million at december  on january   dauphin adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
sfas addresses the accounting by creditors for impairment of certain loans 
sfas requires that impaired loans that are within the scope of the statement be measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or  at the loan s market price of the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
on december  the balance of impaired loans was million 
impaired loans of million have a related allowance for loan losses of million and the remaining impaired loans of million have no related allowance for loan losses 
the impaired loans consist of loans where it is probable that dauphin will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual term of the loan agreement 
interest income for impaired loans that are on non accrual status is recognized using the cash basis  while interest on impaired loans that are still accruing is recognized using the accrual method 
the average balance of impaired loans for was million and the interest recognized for the year was

dauphin deposit corporation federal regulatory authorities have defined highly leveraged transactions hlt s as a credit of million or more which is extended in connection with an acquisition by  or a restructuring of  an organization  and the extension of credit results in high leverage or is made to an already highly leveraged organization 
it is the policy of dauphin to consider financing hlt s for its customers or for potential customers in its market area which usually involves the change of ownership from one generation of a family to the next  or from present owners to the existing management team

the specific allocations in any particular category may prove excessive or inadequate and consequently may be re allocated in the future to reflect then current conditions

the resulting internal capital generation percentage amounted to for compared with for and for common measures of adequate capitalization for banking institutions are ratios of capital to assets 
these ratios indicate the proportion of permanently committed funds to the total asset base 
guidelines issued by federal regulatory authorities require both banks and bank holding companies to meet minimum risk based capital ratios in an effort to make regulatory capital more responsive to the risk exposure related to a bank s on and off balance sheet items 
risk based capital guidelines redefine the components of capital  categorize assets into different risk classes and include certain off balance sheet items in the calculation of capital requirements 
the components of risk based capital are segregated as tier and tier capital 
tier capital is composed of total stockholders equity reduced by goodwill and other intangible assets 
tier capital is the allowance for loan losses with certain limitations and qualifying debt obligations 
regulators have also adopted minimum tier leverage ratio standards 
tier capital for the leverage ratio is the same as the tier capital definition in the risk based capital guidelines

rates on different assets and liabilities within a single maturity category adjust to changes in interest rates to varying degrees and over varying periods of time 
the rate of growth in interest free sources of funds will influence the level of interest sensitive funding sources 
in addition  the interest rates will affect the volume of earning assets and funding sources 
as a result of these limitations  the interest sensitivity gap is only one factor to be considered in estimating the changes in net interest margin 
dauphin deposit corporation table presents an interest sensitivity analysis of dauphin s assets and liabilities at december  for several time intervals 
this table reflects the interest sensitivity gap in two formats 
the detailed presentation represents management s assumption on certain interest bearing deposits  such as passbook savings accounts  as not being subject to immediate repricing 
management is of the opinion that historical interest rate movements indicate that these products do not reprice in direct relation to the change in the interest rate environment 
additionally  these products have provided dauphin with a stable core deposit base 
therefore  the detailed presentation within table attempts to reflect these products in the appropriate interest sensitivity time interval based on their interest sensitivity to the movement of other interest rates 
also included in table is a summary of the gap  as viewed by certain regulatory authorities  which presents these interest bearing deposits as being subject to immediate repricing

interest sensitivity gap as a percent of total assets an interest sensitivity analysis is measured as of a specified date and  therefore  is subject to almost immediate change as the maturities of assets are reinvested and liabilities  such as deposits and short term borrowings  are received or mature 
the mismatch of assets and liabilities in a specific time frame is referred to as a sensitivity gap 
the gap at december  reflects dauphin s sensitivity at a point in time to rate changes over future periods of time 
generally  an asset sensitive gap will increase an institution s net interest income during periods of rising interest rates and the liability sensitive gap will increase an institution s net interest income during declining rates 
the lower the amount of this gap  the less sensitive an institution s earnings are to interest rate changes 
however  dauphin s assets and liabilities with similar maturities or repricing will  at times  react differently in varying interest rate environments 
therefore  the interest sensitivity dauphin deposit corporation gap does not accurately predict the actual impact of market rate changes 
the volume and mix of future assets and liabilities changes will also impact dauphin s net interest income as indicated on table dauphin continuously monitors and adjusts the gap position  taking into consideration current interest rate projections  and maintaining flexibility if rates move contrary to expectations 
dauphin uses on balance sheet financial instruments  such as investments classified as available for sale  to provide flexibility in managing the interest sensitivity gap 
effects of inflation the impact of inflation upon banks differs from the impact upon non financial institutions 
banks  as financial intermediaries  have assets which are primarily monetary in nature and change corresponding to movements in the inflation rate 
the precise impact of inflation upon dauphin is difficult to measure 
inflation may cause non interest expense items to increase at a more rapid rate than earning sources 
inflation may also affect the borrowing needs of consumers  thereby affecting the growth rate of dauphin s assets 
inflation may also affect the general level of interest rates  which can have an effect on the profitability of dauphin
