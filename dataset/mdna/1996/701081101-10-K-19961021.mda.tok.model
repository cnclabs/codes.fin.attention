item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations outlook and overview the company s operations and future results will be altered significantly by the pending acquisitions of mallard and quail 
see item business pending acquisitions 
as a result of the mallard acquisition  the company will become one of the primary barge drilling contractors in the gulf of mexico and in nigeria  markets in which the company currently does not operate 
as a result of the quail acquisition  the company will expand its operations into the complementary rental tool business currently servicing the land and offshore markets of the us gulf coast 
in addition to the substantial revenue growth realized by the increase in size and scope of the company s operations as a result of these acquisitions  based on the historical operations of mallard and quail  the operating margins of the company will also increase 
further  the company s relative percentage of domestic revenue will increase in comparison to its international operations by the incorporation of the new business segments 
the acquisitions will also increase the company s participation in the workover service market  which historically has been characterized by less volatility than the drilling services market 
additionally  because a significant amount of the company s business as a result of these acquisitions will be based in the transition zones of the u 
s 
gulf coast  the company may experience some seasonal variation in its future results 
mallard s business historically has been subject to seasonality with the first two quarters of the calendar year generally corresponding to the company s second and third quarters being less active than the second half of the calendar year 
the company s and quail s operations generally have not reflected seasonal variation 
the acquisitions will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
as a result  the assets and liabilities of mallard and quail will be recorded at their estimated fair values as of the date the acquisitions are consummated 
the purchase price in excess of the fair value of mallard s and quail s assets will be recorded as goodwill and amortized over a year period 
accordingly  the company s depreciation and amortization will increase significantly in future periods 
the financings related to the acquisitions will substantially increase the company s debt levels 
at august   pro forma for the sale of the notes  borrowings under the senior credit facility and the acquisitions  the company would have million in total indebtedness  compared with total actual indebtedness of million at such date 
the substantial increase in debt levels will result in a higher level of interest expense and an increased percentage of the company s cash flows being used for debt service and may limit the company s ability to obtain additional financing for future acquisitions or capital expenditures 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
for the foregoing reasons  the acquisitions of mallard and quail will affect the comparability of the company s historical results of operations with results in future periods

there can be no assurance that such financing would be available to the company on terms it considers acceptable 
description of senior credit facility the company has received a commitment from a syndicate of financial institutions the lenders to establish a senior credit facility  which will consist of a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility

description of senior notes in order to finance the acquisitions of mallard and quail  the company proposes to offer million in senior notes due the notes 
the offering of the notes is being made in compliance with rule a and regulation d under the securities act of accordingly  the sale of the notes will not be registered under the securities act and such notes may not be offered or sold by any purchaser thereof absent registration under the securities act or an applicable exemption from such registration requirements

other matters internationally  the company specializes in drilling in remote locations and under difficult geological or operating conditions 
the company s international services are primarily utilized by international and national oil companies in the exploration and development of reserves of oil 
domestically  the company specializes in drilling deep wells in search of natural gas 
business activity is dependent on the exploration and development activities of the major  independent and national oil and gas companies that make up the company s customer base 
generally  temporary fluctuations in oil and gas prices do not materially affect these companies exploration and development activities  and consequently do not materially affect the operations of the company 
however  sustained increases or decreases in oil and natural gas prices could have an impact on customers long term exploration and development activities which in turn could materially affect the company s operations 
generally  a sustained change in the price of oil would have a greater impact on the company s international operations while a sustained change in the price of natural gas would have a greater effect on domestic operations 
weak prices for natural gas have resulted in depressed markets for domestic drilling services over the past decade 
historically  due to the importance of oil revenue to most of the countries in which the company operates  the company s operations generally have not been negatively impacted by adverse economic and political conditions 
however  there can be no assurances that such conditions could not have a material adverse effect in the future 
in march  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of  was issued 
the statement establishes accounting standards for the impairment of long lived assets  such as the company s drilling  transportation and other equipment  and will be effective for the company beginning with the year ending august  the company does not believe the new standard will have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in october  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  was issued 
the statement requires the computation of compensation for grants of stock  stock options and other equity instruments issued to employees based on fair value and will be effective for the company beginning with the year ended august  the compensation calculated is to be either recorded as an expense in the financial statements or  alternatively  disclosed 
the company anticipates it will elect the disclosure method of complying with the new standard 
under the provisions of the new statement  it is anticipated that pro forma net income to be disclosed will be lower than net income reported in the financial statements
