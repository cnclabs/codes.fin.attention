item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s financial performance and growth are directly related to certain characteristics and trends in the vegetable processing industry 
the united states vegetable processing industry is a mature industry  with relatively modest growth 
therefore  any significant sales growth that may be experienced by the company likely would come at the expense of the loss of market share by another processor  but also may occur through efforts designed to promote increased consumption  such as through the introduction of new or improved products or through increased sales internationally 
the company s net sales are affected by product availability and market pricing 
in the vegetable processing industry  product availability and market prices tend to have an inverse relationship market prices tend to decrease as more product is available  whereas if less product is available  market prices tend to increase 
product availability is a direct result of plantings  growing conditions  crop yields and inventories  all of which may vary from year to year 
in addition  price can be affected by the planting  inventory level and individual pricing decisions of the three or four largest processors in the industry 
generally  the market prices in the vegetable processing industry tend to adjust more quickly to variations in product availability than an individual processor can adjust its cost structure  thus  in an oversupply situation  a processor s margins likely will weaken  as suppliers generally are not able to adjust their cost structure as rapidly as market prices adjust for the oversupply 
the company typically has experienced lower margins during times of industry oversupply 
there can be no assurance the company s margins will improve in response to favorable market conditions or that the company will be able to operate profitably during depressed market conditions 
nonrecurring charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a nonrecurring charge of million related to the company s decision to exit the frozen vegetable business 
sharply declining frozen operating margins in fiscal caused primarily by excess frozen industry inventory coupled with excess capacity in the frozen vegetable industry were major factors in the decision to cease processing operations of the company s frozen business unit 
in conjunction with that decision  the company has reached an agreement with three third parties for the sale of two frozen processing plants  located in the state of washington  and substantially all its frozen business inventory 
the sale of the two plants was completed in the second fiscal quarter of a third plant representing less than of the company s total frozen capacity remains for sale 
the nonrecurring charge of million  a major portion of which is non cash  will cover costs associated with the sale of its three frozen processing plants and related inventories 
the frozen business sales approximated of the company s fiscal year sales 
the sale proceeds of the frozen plant facilities and related inventory were used to pay down long term debt and reduce working capital requirements 
the frozen plants formerly employed approximately full time and seasonal employees 
the exit from the frozen business will allow the company to concentrate on its core business of canned vegetables

results of operations fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  net earnings loss the net loss for the fiscal year ended march  was million compared to net income of million for the previous year 
the decline in earnings in fiscal  excluding the nonrecurring charge of million as a result of the company s decision to exit the frozen vegetable business  was primarily due to decreased margins  particularly in the frozen vegetable business  and increases in canned selling and promotional expenses due to the depressed market conditions that prevailed for most of fiscal net sales net sales in fiscal decreased million  or  to million from million in fiscal the reduction in sales was due primarily to a decline in frozen vegetable sales volume  a decline in frozen vegetable prices and lower canned sales volume in the last half of fiscal caused primarily by lower available inventories due to lower planted acreage and a poor growing season during fiscal these volume and pricing shortfalls were only partially offset by slightly higher average pricing for canned vegetables 
total canned vegetable sales decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decline in total canned vegetable sales was the result of an million reduction in sales volume partially offset by a million increase in sales due to higher pricing 
selling prices increased moderately in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily in response to last summer s lower production volume due to reduced planted acreage and poor growing and harvesting conditions 
the company believes that reduced industry production in the summer of resulted in more normal industry inventory levels 
however  market conditions did not substantially rebound as anticipated  indicating other market forces were at work which continued to depress selling prices and caused the company to increase selling and promotion expenses in order to respond to competitive pricing pressure 
the company believes these market conditions may be the result of inventory distribution imbalances within the industry  extremely competitive market conditions  including aggressive pricing strategies of some industry participants  and the emergence of large volume customers and the effects of their buying power 
total frozen sales declined million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decline in sales was the result of a million reduction in sales volume  and a million decrease in sales due to lower pricing 
the decrease in sales volume and pricing in fiscal reflects the general decline in the frozen vegetable markets due to excess industry inventories and excess industry production capacity causing an extremely competitive market climate and sharply lower margins 
these factors led to the company s decision announced in february to exit the frozen business 
cost of products sold cost of products sold decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in cost of products sold was due primarily to the lower sales volume in both the canned and frozen divisions 
cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales increased by to in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in cost of products sold as a percent of sales is due to increases in certain cost components  including containers and packaging costs  and proportionate increases in the fixed cost component of product costs due primarily to lower canned production volume caused by reduced planted acreage and weather extremes during the summer of selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales  increased by to in fiscal compared to in fiscal these increases resulted primarily from a million increase in variable selling and promotion expense incurred in response to competitive pricing pressures prevailing for most of fiscal general and administrative expenses also increased million as a result of legal costs incurred in defense of two shareholder suits stemming from the november common stock offering

interest expense interest expense decreased million or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this reduction was primarily the result of lower revolving credit borrowing rates from a new revolving credit facility entered into in early fiscal offset in part by higher average borrowing levels 
income taxes in fiscal  no income tax expense or benefit was recorded 
the tax benefit of the pre tax operating loss of fiscal was offset by a corresponding increase in the valuation allowance of allowable tax benefits 
at march   the company had net operating loss carryforwards of million and tax credit carryforwards of million  which are available to reduce and or offset future tax liabilities 
fiscal year ended march   compared to fiscal year ended march  net sales net sales in fiscal decreased million  or  to million from million in fiscal the reduction in sales was primarily the result of the elimination of certain low margin or unprofitable products and distribution channels as part of the company s restructure program implemented during fiscal lower sales volume due to lower available inventories at the beginning of fiscal  caused by a poor growing season during fiscal  also contributed to the decline in sales in fiscal these volume shortfalls were only partially offset by slightly higher average pricing 
total canned vegetable sales decreased million or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decline in total canned vegetable sales was the result of an million reduction in sales volume partially offset by a million increase in sales due to higher pricing 
of the net decrease in sales of million  million was due to a reduction in sales of discontinued products  partially offset by a million increase in sales of continued products 
as expected  selling prices declined from the levels experienced early in fiscal  in response to the prior summer s record production  to levels the company considered sustainable 
given apparent industry inventory positions  the company did not anticipate the round of price cutting that began late in the third quarter of fiscal nevertheless  in order to maintain market share  it was necessary for the company to respond to this new competitive environment which resulted in a substantial decline in pricing late in the third quarter 
these depressed market conditions persisted during the fourth quarter of fiscal causing sharply lower profit margins for the company 
pricing conditions in the processed vegetable markets remained extremely depressed at march  the company believes this situation was caused by an unlikely and unpredictable sequence of events that eventually led to apparent industry inventory excesses and distribution imbalances 
the initial event was the midwest flooding that occurred during the summer of and resulted in sharply curtailed yields and production 
the industry responded to the shortfall with a substantial increase in planted acreage in the summer of due to excellent growing conditions in the midwest  the crop yields on that acreage surpassed previous records 
as a result  industry production exceeded the planned increases leading to excess inventories which had a negative impact on selling prices 
however  pricing declined dramatically late in the third quarter  and based on industry and market information first available in late and to date  inventory distribution imbalances may have played a part 
government mandated label changes required by the nutrition labeling education act nlea may have resulted in a disproportionate share of the late summer early fall feature business going to the brand market at the expense of the private label market participants 
while the company s volume of canned brand and private label sales increased during the third quarter of fiscal compared to the third quarter in the prior year  syndicated market share data made available in december of indicated that  for the category in total  private label did lose market share to the brand market during the fall of further  the pricing strategies of some industry participants were particularly aggressive during the same period 
these factors would tend to create an increasingly uneven distribution of inventories as the third quarter progressed and a corresponding increase in pressure to liquidate excesses 
total frozen sales declined million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decline in sales was the result of a million reduction in sales volume due primarily to the elimination of certain low margin or unprofitable frozen products and exiting certain channels of distribution as part of the company s restructure program 
sales of discontinued frozen products decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal also contributing to the decline in sales was a million decrease in sales due to lower pricing caused primarily by exiting certain higher priced but lower margin product lines and distribution channels as part of the company s restructure program 
cost of products sold cost of products sold decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in cost of products sold was due primarily to the lower sales volume in both the canned and frozen divisions 
cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal of the decrease  was due to higher selling prices 
the decrease in cost of products sold as a percent of sales is also due to lower unit manufacturing costs caused by higher production volume in fiscal  partially offset by unfavorable  nonrecurring cost variances related to agricultural and processing operations caused by the unusual nature of last summer s processing season 
the improvement in the cost of sales ratio also reflects the elimination of higher cost but marginally unprofitable product lines as part of the company s restructure program 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expenses declined by million or  to million in fiscal from million excluding a charge of million relating to the settlement of a product liability claim in fiscal this reduction was primarily the result of lower variable selling expenses related to lower sales volume 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal compared to excluding the product liability settlement in fiscal interest expense interest expense decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this reduction was primarily the result of lower short term borrowings resulting from lower working capital requirements 
in addition  long term debt levels were reduced by the proceeds of sales of closed plants  and short term borrowings were further reduced by proceeds from the november stock offering 
the savings from lower borrowing levels were partially offset by increases in short term interest rates and higher financing expenses associated with the june amendment of the company s revolving credit facility during fiscal income taxes the effective income tax rate in fiscal was compared to the used for calculating tax credits in fiscal the effective tax rate differs from the statutory rates due primarily to allowable tax benefits from net operating loss carryforwards 
net earnings loss net earnings in fiscal were million compared to a net loss of million in fiscal financial condition and liquidity and capital resources general due to the seasonal production nature of the canned and frozen vegetable processing business  the company must maintain substantial inventories of processed vegetables throughout the year 
the working capital requirements associated with producing and maintaining such inventories are financed primarily through short term borrowings and deferred payment terms with major raw product and container suppliers 
the maximum amount of short term borrowings in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal on may   the company entered into a new revolving credit agreement with a commercial lender which provides for borrowings up to million 
the new revolving credit agreement provides for an expanded collateral borrowing base  lower interest rates and less restrictive financial and operating covenants than the former agreement 
the company believes the new revolving credit agreement will be adequate to meet the company s seasonal borrowing needs 
maximum revolving credit borrowings projected for fiscal are approximately million 
for a more detailed description  see note d of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the revolving credit facility  the company has various long term debt obligations  which aggregated million at march   excluding current maturities of million 
current maturities include scheduled maturities and expected payments upon sale of the property  plant and equipment relating to the company s frozen business 
included in the long term debt obligations are two senior notes totaling million  various industrial development revenue bonds totaling million and million of revolving credit notes which are not expected to be repaid currently and are classified as long term 
see note d of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at march   the company was not in compliance with certain financial ratio covenants of its senior note agreements 
however  the note agreements were amended and prior covenant violations waived on july  the amended senior note agreements provide that the note holders receive interest at  payable quarterly  plus capitalized interest payable at maturity of the amended agreements on january  the amended agreements also provide for adjustments to the interest rates based upon the company attaining certain reductions in the principal balance of the senior notes 
in addition  the company issued warrants to the senior note holders in consideration for amending the applicable note agreements 
the warrants entitle the holders to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock through july  at a price per share equal to the lower of or the average trading price of the company s stock over a subsequent day period as defined in the agreements 
the number of shares covered by the warrants are subject to reduction upon the company attaining certain reductions in the principal balance of the senior notes 
the note holders expenses related to the amended agreements also were paid 
the amended agreements require the company to maintain certain revised financial covenants including net worth and current ratio covenants 
in conjunction with the refinancing of the revolving credit facility entered into on may  and the amendment of the senior note agreements entered into on july   the company will incur a loss of  in the first half of fiscal for the charge off of deferred debt expense associated with the early extinguishment of the respective former financing agreements 
cash flows from operating activities cash used in operations during fiscal totaled million 
of the total cash used  changes in operating assets and liabilities provided cash of million  primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable of million and an increase in accounts payable of million  partially offset by an increase in inventory of million less cash used in operations totaling million 
the decrease in accounts receivable of million is due to a decrease in sales in the quarter ended march  compared to a year ago 
the increase in accounts payable of million is due to deferral of certain vendor payments to the first quarter of fiscal while the new revolving credit agreement was being finalized 
the increase in inventory of million is due primarily to higher frozen vegetable finished goods at march  caused by lower sales volume in fiscal cash used in operations during fiscal totaled million 
of the total cash used  changes in operating assets and liabilities used cash of million  primarily due to an increase in inventory of million and an increase in accounts receivable of million  partially offset by cash generated from operations totaling million 
the increase of million in inventory levels primarily reflects the contrast of the fiscal and summer processing seasons 
inventory levels during fiscal were unusually low due to the poor growing and harvesting conditions of the summer of in contrast to inventory levels during fiscal which were higher due to favorable growing conditions during the summer of the increase in accounts receivable of million is due to an increase in sales in the quarter ended march   compared to a year ago 
during fiscal  the company realized significant improvements in cash flow from operating activities and applied such cash flow primarily to reduce short term debt and accounts payable 
net cash provided by operations improved million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in cash provided by operations is partially attributable to reduced net losses net of a nonrecurring restructuring charge in fiscal in fiscal compared to fiscal additionally  cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities increased million primarily from the benefits of inventory and accounts receivable reductions of million and million  respectively  offset in part by a reduction in accounts payable of million 
the company s aggressive inventory reduction programs in the first quarter of fiscal  combined with the elimination of certain product lines and the adverse growing and harvesting conditions during fiscal  were the primary reasons for the company s reduced inventories
