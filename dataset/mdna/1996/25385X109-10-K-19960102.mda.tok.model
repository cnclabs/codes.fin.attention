item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation results of operations annual periods the following table sets forth for the years indicated certain operational data as a percentage of net sales may not add due to rounding 
year ended september net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general  and administrative total operating expenses loss from operations interest expense  net litigation settlement loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes loss before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in method of accounting for income taxes net loss these periods have been restated to reflect the merger of radius and supermac which has been accounted for as a pooling of interests 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements for all periods prior to fiscal have not been restated to adjust supermac s fiscal year end to that of radius 
such periods include radius results of operations and balance sheet data on a september fiscal year basis and supermac s on a december calendar year basis 
the operating results for both the twelve months ended september  and september  include the restructuring and other charges of million recorded by supermac in december fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
the company s net sales decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal fiscal net sales were reduced by approximately million due to reserves taken by the company in anticipation of future price reductions on a number its graphics cards  macos compatible systems and other products that are designed for apple s nubus based computers which have been largely replaced by apple s recently introduced pci bus based computers 
during the fiscal year  net sales of graphics cards declined substantially due primarily to reduced demand resulting from apple s incorporation of built in graphics capabilities in its powerpc based macintosh systems 
net sales from displays  accelerator cards and printers also declined during the fiscal year 
these declines were largely offset by sales of macos compatible systems which were first introduced in the fiscal year and by a substantial increase in net sales from the company s color server products 
while net sales from the company s digital video products increased slightly during the fiscal year  the company anticipates lower revenue from this product line until the introduction of new products now under development 
the company anticipates significantly lower overall net sales in fiscal as a result of the company s decision to focus its efforts on providing solutions for high end digital video and graphics customers  discontinue selling mass market displays and other low value added products  and divest of certain businesses such as color servers and macos compatible systems 
on december   the company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its color server business to splash technology  inc  a company in which radius will retain a equity interest  for approximately million 
that sale is anticipated to be completed in january in addition the company is now negotiating to sell its macos compatible systems business and does not anticipate significant net sales from this business during the fiscal year 
export sales represented approximately   and of net sales for fiscal  and  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
export sales are subject to the normal risks associated with doing business in foreign countries such as currency fluctuations  longer payment cycles  greater difficulties in accounts receivable collection  export controls and other government regulations and  in some countries  a lesser degree of intellectual property protection as compared to that provided under the laws of the united states 
gross profit 
the company s gross profit margin including restructuring and other charges declined to in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal the company s gross profit margin excluding the restructuring and other charges declined to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal excluding restructuring and other charges  the company s gross profit margin declined primarily due to lower sales of higher margin graphics cards  costs incurred to process higher than expected product returns resulting from the consolidation of the radius and supermac product lines and slower than expected sell through of its radius telecast digital video product  significant price erosion on nubus based macos compatible systems combined with high production costs for these systems  the sale of end of life products  and increased pricing pressures 
the company anticipates continued competitive pricing actions resulting in declining prices in its industry 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased to million of net sales in fiscal from million of net sales in fiscal the company s research and development expenses in fiscal included restructuring and other charges of million 
no restructuring and other charges were included in research and development expenses in fiscal the decrease in research and development expenses during the fiscal year was primarily due to the reduction of expenses as a result of the company s restructuring following the merger 
the merger related restructuring resulted in reduced costs primarily related to headcount  depreciation  and facilities 
while there can be no assurance that the company s product development efforts will result in commercially successful products  the company believes that development of new products and enhancement of existing products are essential to its continued success  and management intends to continue to devote substantial resources to research and new product development 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses including restructuring and other charges decreased to million of net sales in fiscal from million of net sales in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses excluding restructuring and other charges decreased to million of net sales in fiscal from million of net sales in fiscal the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses during the fiscal year was primarily due to the reduction of expenses as a result of the company s restructuring following the merger 
the merger related restructuring resulted in reduced costs primarily related to headcount  depreciation and facilities 
provision for income taxes 
the company s annual combined federal and state effective income tax rates were approximately expense in fiscal and benefit in fiscal in fiscal  the rate differs from the combined statutory rate in effect during the period primarily as a result of the impact of not benefiting the operating losses and the reversal of existing deferred tax assets 
the fiscal rate differs from the combined statutory rate in effect during the period primarily as a result of non deductible merger related costs  the one time write off of purchased research and development which is not tax deductible and the impact of not benefiting a significant portion of the operating loss 
fasb statement provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
the company s valuation allowance reduced the deferred tax asset to the amount realizable 
the company has provided a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets due to uncertainties surrounding their realization 
due to the net losses reported in the prior three years and as a result of the material changes in operations reported in its fiscal fourth quarter  predictability of earnings in future periods is uncertain 
the company will evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax asset on a quarterly basis 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
the company s net sales decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the company believes that this decline in net sales was in part attributable to the customers postponing purchasing decisions during the fourth quarter while waiting to see which of the company s product lines would be supported and which would be discontinued following the merger 
sales were flat for the nine months ended june  prior to the merger 
net sales of video products and displays increased but this increase was offset by pricing pressure on graphics cards 
demand was lower than anticipated for graphics cards due to the introduction of the power macintosh by apple and the resulting customer uncertainty surrounding the need for graphics acceleration given the built in video capabilities of this new product 
gross profit 
the company s gross profit margin including the restructuring and other charges declined to in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal the company s gross profit margin excluding the restructuring charges declined to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements regarding the restructuring and other charges for supermac in december and merger related restructuring and other charges in september excluding the restructuring charges  the decline in gross margins was due to increased pricing pressures and a change in the product mix favoring lower margin displays over higher margin graphics accelerator cards 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased slightly to million of net sales in fiscal from million of net sales in fiscal the relatively flat absolute dollar expenditures in research and development activities were due to recording significant restructuring and other charges related to development project cancellations  equipment disposal  and severance in fiscal offset by the decrease in expenditures in fiscal as a result of the cancellation of radius efforts to develop a variety of technologies originally intended for a minicomputer class server product 
additionally  the research and development expenses appeared flat due to the supermac restructuring of million for development project cancellations included in both the fiscal and fiscal results of operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million of net sales in fiscal from million of net sales in fiscal the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increased personnel expense  market development expenses  restructuring and other charges in fiscal and the company s investment in its information system 
the restructuring and other charges included the elimination of excess facilities  capital equipment write offs  severance payments and the termination of certain contractual agreements 
restructuring and other charges for fiscal included the elimination of duplicative facilities  property and equipment and other assets  severance payments  as well as transaction fees and costs incidental to the merger 
provision for income taxes 
the company s annual combined federal and state effective income tax rates were approximately in fiscal and in fiscal before the cumulative effect of the change in method of accounting for income taxes 
the fiscal rate differs from the combined statutory rate in effect during the period primarily as a result of non deductible merger related costs  the one time write off of purchased research and development which is not tax deductible and the impact of not benefiting a significant portion of the operating loss 
the rate differs from the combined statutory rate in effect during the period primarily as a result of the utilization of the research and development tax credit

results of operations quarterly periods the following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly financial information for the company s last eight fiscal quarters in thousands  except per share data 
the information includes all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments that management considers necessary for a fair presentation thereof 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
the company s fiscal year ends on the sunday closest to september fiscal fiscal net sales         cost of sales         gross profit loss         operating expenses research and development         selling  general and administrative         total operating expenses         income loss from operations        interest expense income  net    litigation settlement  income loss before income taxes       provision benefit for income taxes   net income loss       net income loss per share common and common equivalent shares used in computing net income loss per share         these periods have been restated to reflect the merger of radius and supermac which has been accounted for as a pooling of interests 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements for all periods prior to fiscal have not been restated to adjust supermac s fiscal year end to that of radius 
such periods include radius results of operations and balance sheet data on a september fiscal year basis and supermac s on a december calendar year basis 
therefore  results for the quarter ended september  shown above include a million charge recorded by supermac in december additionally  the results for the quarter ended december  reflect this same million charge recorded by supermac in december the company s operating results are subject to quarterly fluctuations as a result of a number of factors  including the sales rate and mix of apple computers  the introduction of new products by apple  the company or its competitors  the timing of sales and marketing expenses by the company  the timing of business cycles in the united states and worldwide  the availability and cost of key components  the company s ability to develop innovative products  the company s product and customer mix  and the level of competition 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash and cash equivalents decreased approximately million during fiscal to approximately million at september   as compared with the fiscal ending balance of cash and cash equivalents of million 
approximately million of the million of cash and cash equivalents available at september  was restricted under various letters of credit 
capital expenditures were million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in the company s cash and cash equivalents during fiscal was primarily attributable to expenditures made in connection with the development and introduction of the company s macos compatible systems 
the company completed a private placement during the third quarter of the fiscal year  the proceeds of which allowed the company to build inventory of macos compatible systems components and reduce other vendor payables 
in the private placement  the company sold  shares of its common stock resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
at september   the company s principal sources of liquidity included approximately million in inventory and working capital financing under an agreement with ibm credit corporation the icc agreement together with an additional million provided by ibm credit corp 
under the icc agreement to finance the manufacturing of the company s macos compatible products  all of which was fully utilized 
in addition  the company has a million credit arrangement with silicon valley bank svb which was partially utilized as of that date 
additionally  the company s japanese subsidiary has a revolving line of credit with a bank in japan under which million has been utilized as of september  as of september   the company was not in compliance with all of its contractual obligations and financial covenants under the icc agreement  however  ibm credit corp 
has waived such defaults pursuant to an amendment to the icc agreement executed in december the icc amendment 
the icc amendment  among other things  also provides that until march  ibm credit corp 
will extend advances to the company in an amount up to of the company s collections and fund the company s payroll in the event that collections are insufficient to permit the advances needed for this purpose 
such advances and payroll funding  however  may be suspended by ibm credit corp 
i immediately following a default of the icc amendment  and ii following thirty days notice in the event of any default of the icc agreement 
as of september   the company was not in compliance with all of its contractual obligations and financial covenants under its credit arrangement with svb 
as of december  approximately  was outstanding under this credit arrangement  all of which the company anticipates paying svb during the first calendar quarter of recently  the company s limited cash resources have restricted the company s ability to purchase inventory which in turn has limited its ability to manufacture and sell products and has resulted in additional costs for expedited deliveries 
the company also is delinquent in its accounts payables as payments to vendors are not being made in accordance with vendor terms 
the adverse effect on the company s results of operations due to its limited cash resources can be expected to continue until such time as the company is able to return to profitability  or generate additional cash from other sources 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so 
additional funds will be needed to finance the company s development plans and for other purposes  and the company is now investigating possible financing opportunities 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available when needed or  if available  that the terms of such financing will not adversely affect the company s results of operations 
certain factors that may affect the company s future results of operations a number of uncertainties exist that could affect the company s future operating results  including  without limitation  the following continuing operating losses the company experienced net operating losses in the fiscal years ended september   and the company s ability to achieve and sustain profitable operations will depend upon a number of factors  including the company s ability to control costs  to develop innovative and cost competitive new products and to bring those products to market in a timely manner  the rate and mix of apple computers and related products sold  competitive factors such as new product introductions  product enhancements and aggressive marketing and pricing practices  general economic conditions  and other factors 
the company has faced and expects to continue to face increased competition in graphic cards as a result of apple s transition of its product line to the pci bus 
in addition  the company anticipates significantly lower revenue and gross profit from its digital video products primarily due to lower than anticipated sell trough rates for radius telecast 
for these and other reasons  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve profitability in the near term 
fluctuations in operating results the company has experienced substantial fluctuations in operating results 
the company s customers generally order on an as needed basis  and the company has historically operated with relatively small backlogs 
quarterly sales and operating results depend heavily on the volume and timing of bookings received during the quarter  which are difficult to forecast 
a substantial portion of the company s revenues are derived from sales made late in each quarter  which increases the difficulty in forecasting sales accurately 
recently  shortages of available cash have delayed the company s receipt of products from suppliers and increased shipping and other costs 
the company recognizes sales upon shipment of product  and allowances are recorded for estimated noncollectable amounts  returns  credits and similar costs  including product warranties and price protection 
due to the inherent uncertainty of such estimates  there can be no assurance that the company s forecasts regarding bookings  collections  rates of return  credits and related matters will be accurate 
a significant portion of the operating expenses of the company are relatively fixed in nature  and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts which  as indicated above  are uncertain 
any inability on the part of the company to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for any failure to meet sales forecasts or to receive anticipated collections  or any unexpected increase in product returns or other costs  could also have an adverse impact on the company s operating results 
dependence on and competition with apple historically  substantially all of the company s products have been designed for and sold to users of apple personal computers  and it is expected that sales of products for such computers will continue to represent substantially all of the net sales of the company for the foreseeable future 
the company s operating results would be adversely affected if apple should lose market share  if macintosh sales were to decline or if other developments were to adversely affect apple s business 
as software applications for the color publishing and multimedia markets become more available on platforms other than macintosh  it is likely that these other platforms will continue to gain acceptance in these markets 
for example  recently introduced versions of the windows operating environment support high performance graphics and video applications similar to those offered on the macintosh 
there is a risk that this trend will reduce the support given to macintosh products by third party developers and could substantially reduce demand for macintosh products and peripherals over the long term 
a number of the company s products compete with products marketed by apple 
as a competitor of the company  apple could in the future take steps to hinder the company s development of compatible products and slow sales of the company s products 
the company s business is based in part on supplying products that meet the needs of high end customers that are not fully met by apple s products 
as apple improves its products or bundles additional hardware or software into its computers  it reduces the market for radius products that provide those capabilities 
for example  the company believes that the on board performance capabilities included in macintosh power pc products have reduced and continue to reduce overall sales for the company s graphics cards 
in the past  the company has developed new products as apple s progress has rendered existing company products obsolete  but there can be no assurance that the company will continue to develop successful new products on a timely basis in the future 
in order to develop products for the macintosh on a timely basis  the company depends upon access to advance information concerning new macintosh products 
a decision by apple to cease sharing advance product information with the company would adversely affect the company s business 
new products anticipated from and introduced by apple could cause customers to defer or alter buying decisions due to uncertainty in the marketplace  as well as presenting additional direct competition for the company 
for example  the company believes that apple s transition during to power pc products caused delays and uncertainties in the market place and had the effect of reducing demand for the company s products 
in addition  sales of the company s products have been adversely affected by apple s revamping of its entire product line from nubus based to pci bus based computers 
in the past  transitions in apple s products have been accompanied by shortages in those products and in key components for them  leading to a slowdown in sales of those products and in the development and sale by the company of compatible products 
in addition  it is possible that the introduction of new apple products with improved performance capabilities may create uncertainties in the market concerning the need for the performance enhancements provided by the company s products and could reduce demand for such products 
competition the markets for the company s products are highly competitive  and the company expects competition to intensify 
many of the company s current and prospective competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  manufacturing and marketing resources than the company 
the company believes that its ability to compete will depend on a number of factors  including the success and timing of new product developments by the company and its competitors  product performance  price and quality  breadth of distribution and customer support 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully with respect to these factors 
in addition  the introduction of lower priced competitive products could result in price reductions that would adversely affect the company s results of operations 
dependence on suppliers the company outsources the manufacturing and assembly of its products to third party suppliers 
although the company uses a number of manufacturer assemblers  each of its products is manufactured and assembled by a single supplier 
the failure of a supplier to ship the quantities of a product ordered by the company could cause a material disruption in the company s sales of that product 
in the past  the company has at times experienced substantial delays in its ability to fill customer orders for displays and other products  due to the inability of certain suppliers to meet their volume and schedule requirements and  recently  due to the company s shortages in available cash 
due to recent shortages in cash resources and because the company seeks to manage its use of working capital by  among other things  limiting the backlog of inventory it purchases  the company is particularly vulnerable to delays in shipments from suppliers 
such delays can cause fluctuations in the company s short term results and contribute to order cancellations 
the company is also dependent on sole or limited source suppliers for certain key components used in its products  including certain digital to analog converters  digital video chips  and other products 
certain other semiconductor components and molded plastic parts are also purchased from sole or limited source suppliers 
the company purchases these sole or limited source components primarily pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time in the ordinary course of business and has no guaranteed supply arrangements with sole or limited source suppliers 
the company expects that these suppliers will continue to meet its requirements for the components  but there can be no assurance that they will do so 
the introduction of new products presents additional difficulties in obtaining timely shipments from suppliers 
additional time may be needed to identify and qualify suppliers of the new products 
also  the company has experienced delays in achieving volume production of new products due to the time required for suppliers to build their manufacturing capacity 
an extended interruption in the supply of any of the components for the company s products  regardless of the cause  could have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
the company s products also incorporate components  such as vrams  drams and asics that are available from multiple sources but have been subject to substantial fluctuations in availability and price 
since a substantial portion of the total material cost of the company s products is represented by these components  significant fluctuations in their price and availability could affect its results of operations 
technological change  continuing need to develop new products the personal computer industry in general  and the color publishing and video applications within the industry  are characterized by rapidly changing technology  often resulting in short product life cycles and rapid price declines 
the company believes that its success will be highly dependent on its ability to develop innovative and cost competitive new products and to bring them to the marketplace in a timely manner 
should the company fail to introduce new products on a timely basis  the company s operating results could be adversely affected 
technological innovation is particularly important for the company  since its business is based on its ability to provide functionality and features not included in apple s products 
as apple introduces new products with increased functionality and features  the company s business will be adversely affected unless it develops new products that provide advantages over apple s latest offerings 
continued reduction in the available cash resources of the company could result in the interruption or cancellation of research and product development efforts 
the company anticipates that the video editing industry will follow the pattern of the professional publishing industry in which desktop publishing products  including those produced by radius  replaced more expensive  proprietary products  and the company also anticipates that this evolution will lead to a significant increase in the purchase and use of video editing products 
there is a risk that this evolution will not occur in the video editing industry as expected by the company  or that it will occur at a slower pace than anticipated 
the introduction of new products is inherently subject to risks of delay 
should the company fail to introduce new products on a timely basis  the operating results of the company could be adversely affected 
the introduction of new products and the phasing out of older products will require the company to carefully manage its inventory to avoid inventory obsolescence and may require increases in inventory reserves 
the long lead times as much as three to five months associated with the procurement of certain components principally displays and asics exposes the company to greater risk in forecasting the demand for new products 
there can be no assurance that the company s forecasts regarding new product demand and its estimates of appropriate inventory levels will be accurate 
moreover  no assurance can be given that the company will be able to cause all of its new products to be manufactured at acceptable manufacturing yields or that the company will obtain market acceptance for these products 
distribution the company s primary means of distribution is through a limited number of third party distributors and master resellers 
as a result  the company s business and financial results are highly dependent on the amount of the company s products that is ordered by these distributors and resellers 
such orders are in turn dependent upon the continued viability and financial condition of these distributors and resellers as well as on their ability to resell such products and maintain appropriate inventory levels 
due in part to the historical volatility of the personal computer industry  certain of the company s resellers have from time to time experienced declining profit margins  cash flow shortages and other financial difficulties 
the future growth and success of the company will continue to depend in large part upon its reseller channels 
if its resellers were to experience financial difficulties  the company s results of operations could be adversely affected 
international sales the company s international sales are primarily made through distributors and the company s subsidiary in japan 
the company expects that international sales will represent a significant portion of its net sales and that it will be subject to the normal risks of international sales such as currency fluctuations  longer payment cycles  export controls and other governmental regulations and  in some countries  a lesser degree of intellectual property protection as compared to that provided under the laws of the united states 
in addition  fluctuations in exchange rates could affect demand for the company s products 
if for any reason exchange or price controls or other restrictions on foreign currencies are imposed  the company s business and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
dependence on key personnel the company s success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of its key management  marketing  product development and operational personnel and the company s ability to retain and continue to attract highly skilled personnel 
competition for employees in the computer industry is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain qualified employees 
the company has recently made a number of management changes  including the appointment of a new chief financial officer 
if the company continues to experience financial difficulties  it may become increasingly difficult for it to hire new employees and retain current employees 
the company does not carry any key person life insurance with respect to any of its personnel 
dependence on proprietary rights the company relies on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret protection  nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to establish and protect its proprietary rights 
the company has a number of patents and patent applications and intends to file additional patent applications as it considers appropriate 
there can be no assurance that patents will issue from any of these pending applications or  if patents do issue  that any claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect the company s technology 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any patents that may be issued to the company will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that any rights granted thereunder would provide proprietary protection to the company 
the company has a number of trademarks and trademark applications 
there can be no assurance that litigation with respect to trademarks will not result from the company s use of registered or common law marks  or that  if litigation against the company were successful  any resulting loss of the right to use a trademark would not reduce sales of the company s products in addition to the possibility of a significant damages award 
although  the company intends to defend its proprietary rights  policing unauthorized use of proprietary technology or products is difficult  and there can be no assurance that the company s efforts will be successful 
the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect the proprietary rights of the company to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
the company has received  and may receive in the future  communications asserting that its products infringe the proprietary rights of third parties  and the company is engaged and has been engaged in litigation alleging that the company s products infringe others patent rights 
as a result of such claims or litigation  it may become necessary or desirable in the future for the company to obtain licenses relating to one or more of its products or relating to current or future technologies  and there can be no assurance that it would be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms 
volatility of stock price  dilution the price of the company s common stock has fluctuated widely in the past
