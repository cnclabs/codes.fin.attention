item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the consolidated results of operation and financial condition of the company for each of the years in the three year period ended december  should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere herein general the company follows the full cost method of accounting for its investments in oil and gas properties 
the company capitalizes all acquisition  exploration  and development costs incurred 
proceeds from sales of oil and gas properties are credited to the full cost pool 
capitalized costs of oil and gas properties are amortized on an overall unit of production method using proved oil and gas reserves as determined by independent petroleum engineers 
costs amortized include all capitalized costs less accumulated amortization  the estimated future expenditures based on current costs to be incurred in developing proved reserves  and estimated dismantlement  restoration  and abandonment costs 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain information regarding the production volumes of  average sales prices received for  and average production costs associated with  and depletion rate associated with the company s sales of oil and gas for the periods indicated 
year ended december  net production gas mmcf    oil mbbls average sales price gas per mcf oil per bbl average production cost per mcfe depletion rate per mcfe includes natural gas liquids 
includes direct lifting costs labor  repairs and maintenance  materials and supplies and the administrative costs of production offices  insurance and property and severance taxes 
compared with revenues 
total revenues increased million to million for from million for the increase in revenues was due primarily to the new production from the company s interest in east cameron blocks  matagorda block and ship shoal block coupled with higher average oil prices in partially offset by lower average gas prices in expenses 
total expenses increased million to million for from million for an increase in depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a is the primary source for the increase in expenses 
dd a increased million to million for from million in due to increased production coupled with an increase in the depletion rate 
interest expense increased million to million for from million for because of an increase in average outstanding debt and higher average interest rates 
lease operating costs and production taxes increased  to million for compared with million for lease operating expenses increased because of increased production 
reflected in the lease operating expense amount are expenses related to the texas panhandle properties that were sold in august production costs on a per unit basis decreased significantly because east cameron blocks  matagorda block and ship shoal block all have a low per unit operating cost  while the texas panhandle properties sold in august had a high per unit operating cost 
administrative expenses increased  to million in from million in principally due to an increase in legal  salary and printing expenses partially offset by increased overhead capitalization relating to technical staff associated with exploration activity 
net income 
net income increased million to million  or per share  from  or per share  in the primary reason for the increase in net income was the increase in production 
compared with revenues 
total revenues decreased million to million for from million for the decrease in revenues was due principally to a natural decline in production from the company s properties coupled with lower product prices  and also to the sale of non strategic properties in both and expenses 
total expenses decreased million to million for from million for lease operating costs and production taxes decreased million to million for compared with million for due primarily to reduced transportation fees on the galveston field coupled with the sale of certain producing properties whose associated costs are reflected in depreciation  depletion and amortization decreased million to million for from million for this decrease was primarily due to lower production volumes in there was only a nominal increase in general and administrative expenses due mainly to an increase in the number of technical personnel 
there was also a nominal increase in interest expense due to an increase in outstanding debt 
net income 
net income of  or per share  was generated for  compared with million  or per share  after an extraordinary charge of  or per share  in the extraordinary charge in was in connection with the write off of unamortized issuance costs attributable to the company s prior credit facility 
the decrease in net income was primarily the result of the decrease in revenues due to decreased production  partially offset by decreased production and depletion expenses 
capital resources and liquidity at december   the company had existing cash and cash investments of million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for  compared with million for the primary reason for this increase in cash provided by operating activities was higher results of operations or earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization offset by increased working capital requirements 
net cash used in investing activities for was million compared with million in the million is net of million received by the company for consideration paid for an acquisition in this increase was principally due to expenditures for exploration and development prospects 
net cash provided by financing activities for was million compared with million in the cash provided by financing activities during consisted of million in net proceeds from a public offering of common stock partially offset by a reduction in net borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility of million 
in general  because the company s oil and gas reserves are depleted by production  the success of its business strategy is dependent on a continuous exploration and development program 
therefore  the company s capital requirements relate primarily to the acquisition of undeveloped leasehold acreage and exploration and development activities 
company is currently pursuing a number of existing exploration prospects 
the company s operating needs and capital spending programs have been funded by borrowing under its bank credit facilities  proceeds from public offerings of its common stock and cash flow from operations 
the company expects capital expenditures for development during to total approximately million 
at december   the company s capital resources consisted primarily of available borrowing capacity under the incc credit agreement and cash flow from operations 
management believes that cash flow from operations along with the amount available under the incc credit agreement will be sufficient to finance the currently planned development expenditures 
if the company is successful in substantially all of its currently scheduled exploration prospects  additional funds may be required in order to conduct the necessary development activities 
if necessary  the company may seek to raise additional capital in public or private equity or debt markets 
no assurance can be given that the company may seek to raise additional capital in public or private equity or debt markets 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to raise such capital if needed or on terms that are favorable to the company 
any resulting lack of sufficient capital may require the company to reduce its interest in such properties or to forego developing such reserves 
in addition  the company normally does not act as operator with respect to its properties 
the company may not be able to control the development activities or the associated costs with respect to properties operated by other properties 
credit facility 
the company has a million credit facility the incc credit agreement with incc and meespierson  under which the current borrowing base is million 
the incc credit agreement is secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
it contains financial covenants which require the company to maintain a ration of current assets to current liabilities excluding the current portion of related debt of no less than to and a tangible net worth of not less than million 
the company is currently in compliance with such financial covenants 
outstanding borrowings accrue interest at either incc s fluctuation base rate or incc s reserve adjusted eurodollar rate plus  at the company s option 
on march   the borrowings outstanding under this facility will be converted to a term loan that requires various quarterly principal payments through december  interest is payable quarterly on any base rate borrowings and payable on maturity of any eurodollar borrowings 
the incc credit agreement does not permit the company to pay or declare any cash or property dividends or otherwise make any distribution of capital 
the company is obligated to pay a quarterly fee equal to one half of per annum of the unused portion of the borrowing base under the facility 
the company s ability to borrow under the incc credit agreement is dependent upon the reserve value of its oil and gas properties 
if the reserve value of the company s borrowing base declines  the amount available to the company under the incc credit agreement will be reduced and  to the extent that the borrowing base is less than the amount then outstanding under the incc credit agreement  the company will be obligated to repay such excess amount on thirtyday s notice from incc or to provide additional collateral 
incc and meespierson have substantial discretion in determining the reserve value of the borrowing base 
the following table illustrates the borrowing base  the outstanding borrowings  an outstanding letter of credit and the available borrowings under the credit facility at december  borrowing outstanding letter available base borrowings of credit borrowings credit facility     the company believes that available borrowings under the credit facility combined with cash flows from the operations will be sufficient to fund its currently anticipated development and exploration expenses 
if the company is successful in substantially all of its currently scheduled exploration prospects  additional funds will be required in order to conduct the necessary development activities 
any resulting lack of sufficient capital may require the company to reduce its interest in such properties or to forego developing such reserves 
in addition  the company does not act as operator with respect to most of its properties 
therefore  the company may not be able to control the development activities or the associated costs with respect to properties operated by other parties 
net operating losses 
for federal income tax purposes  at december   the company had net operating losses nols of approximately million 
those nols include approximately million of estimated nols that carried over to the company from smith as a result of the smith acquisition 
the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  permits a corporation to carryback an nol from the year in which it is incurred to the immediately preceding three years and then carry forward any unused portion of the nol up to years 
however  the code contains a further limitation regarding a corporation s use of its nols following a statutorily defined change in ownership 
generally  this limitation permits the corporation to use in each year subsequent to the ownership change a prescribed amount of the nols hereinafter referred to as the annual limitation amount  subject however to the general restriction that a corporation cannot carry forward a nol more than years 
the company s nols of approximately million which accumulated through august  are subject to an annual limitation of million 
from september through october  the company incurred additional nols of approximately million  and although a change in ownership occurred in october  the annual limitation attributable to such a change in ownership is anticipated to exceed the nols 
the smith nols of approximately million to which the company succeeded in the smith acquisition are subject to an annual limitation that the company currently expects will be million 
the company s nols accumulated through will expire principally in through for alternative minimum tax purposes  nols may be further adjusted to determine the allowable alternative tax nol  and the alternative tax nols can be used to offset no more than of alternative minimum taxable income 
accordingly  the company may owe an alternative minimum tax even though its nols otherwise eliminated its regular tax liability 
changes in prices and inflation the company s revenues and the value of its oil and gas properties have been and will continue to be affected by changes in oil and gas prices 
the company s ability to maintain its current borrowing capacity and to obtain additional capital on attractive terms is also substantially dependent on oil and gas prices 
oil and gas prices are subject to significant seasonal and other fluctuations that are beyond the company s ability to control or predict 
although certain of the company s costs and expenses are affected by the level of inflation  inflation has not had a significant effect on the company s results of operations during  or in an effort to reduce the effects of the volatility of the price of oil and gas on the company s operations  management has adopted a policy of hedging oil and gas prices  usually when such prices are at or in excess of the prices anticipated in the company s operating budget  through the use of commodity futures  options  forward contracts and swap agreements 
hedging transactions are limited by the board of directors such that no transaction may fix an oil and gas price for a term of more than months  and the aggregate oil and gas production covered by all transactions may not exceed of the company s budgeted production for any month period from the date of the transaction or of the company s budgeted production for any single month from the date of the transaction 
by hedging its oil and gas prices  the company intends to mitigate the risk of future declines in oil and gas prices 
under certain contracts should oil or gas prices increase above the contract rate  the company will not participate in the higher prices for the production 
the company has entered into a number of gas price swap transactions under which the company receives a fixed price per mmbtu and pays a floating price based on the settlement prices for the nymex natural gas futures contract for the delivery month 
in total under these contracts the company has fixed the price of  mmbtu of gas for the period january to september at an average price of per mmbtu 
the company may enter into certain interest rate hedging contracts 
by hedging its interest rate under its credit facility  the company would intend to mitigate the risk of future increases in interest rates 
should interest rates decrease below the contract rate  the company will not participate in the lower interest rate for the portion of the credit facility under the hedging contract 
the company currently has no interest rate hedging contracts in place
