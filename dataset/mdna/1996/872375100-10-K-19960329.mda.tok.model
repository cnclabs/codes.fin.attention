earnings summary teco energy achieved earnings of per share in compared to reported earnings of in these results were achieved after the deferral of million of revenues at tampa electric under a plan described in the utility regulation section 
earnings were before a cent charge for corporate restructuring 
earnings growth in was driven by strong performance at the diversified companies as well as continued growth in energy sales and reduced operating expenses at tampa electric 
earnings grew in on the strength of increased retail energy sales at tampa electric and increased third party business at teco coal 
the restructuring charge reduced reported earnings per share by cents 
the restructuring program included a percent reduction in staffing levels and other cost reductions  primarily at tampa electric 
approximately percent of the charge represented costs associated with retirement benefits

tampa electric s operating revenues tampa electric s revenues decreased slightly to  million reflecting the deferral of million of revenues 
tampa electric s revenues rose in with retail customer growth of almost percent  increased retail energy sales of almost percent and a million retail price increase effective in january the economy in tampa electric s service area continued to strengthen in the combined residential and commercial energy sales grew by more than percent in sales to the phosphate industry grew by almost percent in as these companies continued to experience strong prices and demand for their product 
non phosphate industrial sales declined in due to the closure of a steel making facility in the service area 
total retail energy sales are projected to increase almost percent annually over the next five years based on continued growth in the local economy 
annual energy sales growth in the residential and commercial sectors is projected at percent to percent for the next five years 
growth in energy sales to non phosphate industrial customers is projected to be less after a possible decline in in the tampa electric service area economy is expected to grow moderately  but at rates higher than the country as a whole 
the local economy continues to benefit from a good labor market  available land and good access through airport and port facilities 
energy sales to the phosphate industry are expected to decline from increased self generation and as mining activity slowly moves out of tampa electric s service area 
in sales to the phosphate customer group represented less than percent of total operating revenues 
non fuel revenues from sales to other utilities in were million  million in and million in energy sold to other utilities increased in due to generating unit availability and lower fuel cost 
in energy sold to other utilities declined because of lower priced oil and gas fired generation available on other systems 
a shift to higher margin  longer term wholesale power sales agreements resulted in only a percent decline in non fuel revenues despite the percent decline in energy sales to other utilities 
securing additional longer term wholesale power sales agreements remains a priority 
in the past three years  tampa electric has added nine bulk power sales contracts of varying size and duration 
competitive pricing of coal fired generation has allowed tampa electric to market available capacity successfully

operating expenses change change millions other operating expenses maintenance depreciation taxes  other than income operating expenses restructuring charge fuel purchased power total fuel cost total operating expenses in non fuel operations and maintenance expenses declined almost percent from levels before the restructuring charge 
the million reduction was primarily from lower payroll and employee related expenses as a result of fewer positions than in in both and tampa electric achieved savings from work redesign efforts and equipment redesign and enhancements 
in operating areas of the company achieved lower costs through technology improvements  the streamlining of maintenance programs  and the sharing of manpower resources in power generation facilities 
the savings realized from these efforts will partially offset increased operations and maintenance expenses expected in from polk unit one 
during the first two years of operations  when domestic coals will be evaluated for use in the gasifier  tampa electric will receive million from the u 
s 
department of energy for operations  maintenance and fuel expenses 
total operating expenses in included the restructuring charge discussed in the earnings summary section  a million annual charge to establish a transmission and distribution property storm damage reserve in accordance with regulatory directives described in the utility regulation section  and the effects of accounting for fuel expense in accordance with florida public service commission fpsc requirements 
absent these three items  total operating expense increased only percent over principally as a result of higher employee related expenses  higher accruals for self insurance liability reserves and increased expenses for regulatory activity 
depreciation expense in decreased as certain shorter lived assets were fully amortized 
the decrease more than offset the impact of normal additions to plant and equipment 
the company s efforts to reduce capital investment in recent years have limited additions to all asset classes  particularly shorter life asset classes 
the increased depreciation expense in from normal additions to plant and equipment was minimized by these cost control efforts 
depreciation expense is projected to increase in as a result of the start of commercial operation of polk unit one 
taxes other than those on income increased each year primarily from higher gross receipts taxes and franchise fees 
actual system fuel cost was only percent higher than in despite an percent increase in generation 
the success in controlling fuel cost is a result of tampa electric s use of lower priced coals and the mix in operating generating units 
average coal cost  on a cents per million btu basis  declined percent in after a percent drop in fuel and purchased power cost rose only percent in despite a percent increase in coal burned to meet increased generation 
this cost increase was partially offset by the normal effects of accounting for deferred fuel expense consistent with the fpsc approved fuel adjustment clause 
fuel and purchased power cost was percent higher in than in primarily from the normal effects of accounting for deferred fuel expense consistent with the fuel adjustment clause 
in tampa electric purchased more power from both teco power services hardee power station and cogenerators than in  primarily to meet weather related demand 
in tampa electric purchased less energy from other utilities than in because of the combination of mild weather and higher levels of availability of its own generating units 
substantially all fuel and purchased power expenses were recovered through the fuel adjustment clause 
nearly all of tampa electric s generation in the last three years has been from coal  and the fuel mix will continue to be substantially coal 
coal prices are expected to remain relatively unchanged during the next few years compared to oil or gas prices 
the company continues to work to reduce its fuel cost 
coal contract buyout in december  tampa electric bought out a long term coal supply contract which would have expired in for a payment of million and entered into two new contracts with the supplier 
the coal supplied under the new contracts is competitive in price with coals of comparable quality 
as a result of this buyout tampa electric customers will benefit from anticipated savings of more than million  net of the buyout costs  through the year the fpsc has authorized the recovery of the buyout costs plus carrying costs through the fuel adjustment clause during the years through diversified companies operating results the diversified companies achieved operating income of million in compared with million in before the restructuring charge and million in the increase in was the result of strong performances at all of the diversified companies  led by teco transport trade 
increased third party sales at teco coal and teco power services guatemalan power project also contributed to the improved results 
the decrease in operating income from the diversified companies reflected the effects of a difficult year for teco transport trade in the ocean shipping business 
teco coalbed methane s operating income was lower  despite a percent increase in production  because of lower gas prices in the second half of these results were only partially offset by improvements in other diversified businesses

the principal items are the non conventional fuels tax credit related to coalbed methane production and interest expense on the non recourse debt related to independent power operations  both of which are included in operating income for the diversified companies 
in the consolidated statements of income the tax credit is part of the provision for income taxes and the interest is part of interest expense 
teco transport trade achieved significantly higher operating income in through improved results in all of its businesses 
the river business in particular had an excellent year as a result of higher volumes and prices 
improved fleet utilization and increased levels of northbound shipments contributed to increased volumes 
a strong demand for northbound movements and a record grain harvest together with a better balance in the supply and demand for barges caused stronger prices throughout the industry 
the transfer facility at the mouth of the mississippi river handled more coal tonnage for both tampa electric and third party export business 
the ocean shipping business benefited from increased shipments of phosphate and higher shipments of coal to tampa electric 
lower operating expenses at all the transportation companies also contributed to the improved results 
the conditions affecting favorable pricing and strong demand in are expected to continue in teco transport trade reported lower operating income in from reduced overseas grain business  adverse weather early in the year and lower tampa electric volumes which more than offset improved utilization of the river fleet 
teco transport s overseas grain business was adversely impacted by the u 
s 
maritime administration s suspension which was lifted in april  reduced u 
s 
bulk cargo preference program tonnage  lower grain charter prices and a late start to movements caused by high grain prices 
in addition the loss of an ocean barge in a winter storm off the coast of louisiana had an adverse impact on fleet utilization in teco coal s operating income grew in as a result of increased third party tonnage and a million pretax gain from the sale of land and mineral rights under a condemnation settlement with the state of kentucky 
the combination of mild winter weather and excess capacity in domestic steam coal production resulted in soft demand and prices in total tonnage increased more than percent to million tons  up from million tons in and million tons in this growth came from sales to third parties which more than offset reduced tonnage to tampa electric 
the company completed a high speed unit train loading facility and a state of the art coal washing and preparation plant in late at the premier elkhorn mines  which supported increased third party sales 
teco coal expects sales to third parties to increase again in as eastern utilities meet increasing demand with existing coal fired generating capacity and use low sulfur coal to comply with the clean air act 
in teco coal expects to sell percent of the production from the premier mines under existing multi year contracts 
the increased third party sales in more than offset a decline in the tonnage sold to tampa electric 
sales to tampa electric decreased in and are expected to decrease again in tampa electric is reducing its purchases of gatliff s low sulfur  low ash fusion temperature coal as a result of its success in burning more conventional lower cost steam coals 
teco coal s objective is to more than offset the effects of this reduction by increasing the amount of coal sold to third parties  principally from the reserves being developed by premier 
teco coalbed methane s operating income increased as production rose to billion cubic feet bcf in  up from bcf in and bcf in although gas prices strengthened in the fourth quarter  average gas prices in were significantly lower than in s lower gas prices were more than offset by a percent increase in production  a percent reduction in operating costs  and a million pretax settlement related to the termination of a gas sales contract and related agreements 
in connection with this settlement  teco coalbed methane entered into replacement contracts providing for the sale of all gas produced at spot prices  similar to the original contract  for the life of the reserves 
in gas prices declined significantly in the second half of the year  more than offsetting the impact of percent higher production 
in both and teco coalbed methane acquired additional reserves in alabama s black warrior basin through the purchase of royalty interests in wells located on or near teco coalbed methane s existing holdings 
production from all reserves is eligible for the alternative energy tax credits under section of the internal revenue code through the year assuming normal operating conditions  production is expected to remain stable in and then decline gradually in and beyond 
teco power services operating income increased in from the commercial operation of the alborada power station in guatemala beginning in september 
the power station consists of two combustion turbines supplying a combined megawatts of power to a local distribution utility under a year power sales agreement 
at dec 
  teco power services  through a wholly owned subsidiary  owned an percent interest in the project  and a guatemalan business group owned the remaining interest 
in march  the teco power services subsidiary acquired an additional interest in the project from the guatemalan business group  bringing its total interest to percent 
teco power services expects to secure project debt financing from the overseas private investment corporation opic  an agency of the us government  for percent of the project cost by mid year in operating income for teco power services remained stable relative to  the year teco power services made its initial contribution to operating income from its hardee power station 
diversified companies operating revenues diversified revenues increased significantly in from better operating results at all companies 
teco coal recorded million before expenses from the sale of land and mineral rights under a condemnation settlement with the state of kentucky and teco coalbed methane recorded million from the termination of a gas sales contract 
the diversified companies revenues decreased slightly in as growth in coal revenues was more than offset by decreased revenues from the water transportation business 
diversified companies operating expenses diversified operating expenses increased percent in teco power services incurred higher expenses from increased power generation at the hardee plant and the new guatemalan plant 
these increases were partially offset by lower operating expenses at other diversified companies 
in diversified companies operating expenses increased slightly in line with higher production of coal and natural gas 
the diversified companies recorded a charge of million for corporate restructuring in related to reductions in staffing levels and other costs 
new businesses teco energy has expanded its natural gas production business through a new subsidiary  teco gas oil  inc  which is participating in joint ventures in exploration and development of conventional gas and oil in the shallow gulf waters off texas and louisiana 
the joint ventures have successfully bid for several offshore leases at federal auctions and have negotiated drilling rights on other parcels 
the first two exploratory wells were successfully completed in with production facilities planned to be operational in the first half of the joint ventures are making extensive use of d seismic data to increase the probability of successful exploration efforts 
the company expects to invest million to million per year for the next few years for exploration and production 
in teco energy organized a new subsidiary  tecom inc  formerly named teco energy management services corporation  which is pilot testing an advanced energy management and communications system for residential and commercial use  and has under development a system for industrial application 
development and testing will continue in with pilot testing at other utilities expected 
the operating expenses and capital investment for these pilot programs are not expected to be significant 
non operating itemsother income expense other income in consisted mostly of allowance for funds used during construction afudc which increased to million from million in and million in afudc will increase again in with the additional investment in the construction of tampa electric s polk unit one and is expected to decline to minimal amounts for several years after the completion of this unit  scheduled for the fourth quarter of in addition  investment earnings were lower in primarily because of lower invested balances 
other income expense in included a one time million pretax charge at tampa electric associated with an fpsc approved settlement agreement between tampa electric and the office of public counsel as described in the utility regulation section 
excluding this million charge  other income was million in interest charges interest charges were million in  up percent from due to higher short term debt balances and rates 
in interest expense included million of interest accrued on tampa electric s million of deferred revenues 
savings from long term debt refinancings accomplished in substantially offset the impact of rising short term interest rates in income taxes income tax expense increased over levels primarily from higher pretax income 
income tax expense was below levels  primarily due to higher section tax credits related to coalbed methane gas production and lower taxable income because of the restructuring charge 
in addition  income tax expense included a charge for restating deferred income tax balances for the diversified companies to reflect the federal corporate income tax rate increase to percent 
primarily due to the tax credits related to the production of coalbed methane  income tax expense was percent of pretax income in  percent in and percent in reflecting increased production  these tax credits totaled million in  up from million in and million in the tax credit rate was estimated at per thousand cubic feet in  and was in and cents in this rate escalates with inflation  and could be limited by domestic oil prices 
in  domestic oil prices would have had to exceed per barrel for this limitation to have been effective 
the federal tax credit on production of coalbed methane is available through the year accounting standards stock options in  the financial accounting standards board issued fas  accounting for stock options  effective for fiscal years beginning after dec 
 fas encourages  but does not require  companies to recognize compensation expense based on the fair value of grants of stock  stock options and other equity instruments to employees 
although expense recognition for employee stock based compensation is not mandatory  fas requires that companies not adopting must disclose pro forma net income and earnings per share 
teco energy will continue to apply the prior accounting rules and make pro forma disclosures 
capital expenditures teco energy s capital expenditures of million consisted of million for tampa electric  which included million of afudc  and million for the diversified companies 
tampa electric spent million in on construction of polk unit one  a megawatt coal gasification plant 
the capital cost of the plant is estimated at about million  net of the construction funding from the us department of energy under its clean coal technology program 
an estimated million will be spent in to complete this project with commercial operation expected in the fourth quarter of tampa electric spent an additional million in for equipment and facilities to meet the company s growing customer base and for generation equipment improvements 
at the diversified companies in teco transport trade s capital program of million included purchasing an ocean barge previously leased  a program of barge enlargement and refurbishment  and normal equipment replacement 
teco coalbed methane s additional investment of million in included the purchase of the royalty rights to additional reserves in the black warrior basin and enhancements to existing wells 
teco coal spent million primarily on the completion of its new coal washing and preparation plant  and the development of new mines 
teco power services spent million for its percent share of the megawatt alborada power station in guatemala 
teco energy estimates total capital expenditures for ongoing operations at million for and million for through  excluding afudc 
tampa electric expects to spend million in and million during the period  mainly for distribution facilities to meet customer growth and for polk unit one in at the end of  tampa electric had outstanding commitments of about million for capital programs including the construction of polk unit one 
tampa electric s capital expenditure projections include about million over the to period to comply with phase ii of the clean air act amendments for nitrogen oxide reductions and emissions monitoring equipment as described in the environmental compliance section 
the diversified companies expect capital expenditures of about million in and million for the through period for coal mining equipment  exploration and production of conventional gas and oil  acquisition of river barges and ocean transportation equipment  and normal asset replacement 
at the end of  million had been committed 
environmental compliance tampa electric is complying with the phase i emission limitations imposed by the clean air act amendments which became effective jan 
 by using blends of lower sulfur coal  controlling stack emissions and emission allowances 
in tampa electric successfully integrated big bend unit three into the existing scrubber on big bend unit four 
this resulted in an additional scrubbed unit at a fraction of the cost of a new scrubber 
in connection with its phase i compliance plan  tampa electric entered into two long term contracts effective in mid for the purchase of low sulfur coal 
in december  one of the sellers ceased operations at the mine supplying this coal 
tampa electric believes that there will be no negative impact on its operations because of the availability of alternative sources of supply and the successful scrubber integration of big bend units three and four 
to comply with phase ii emission standards set for tampa electric would potentially have to scrub additional capacity and is evaluating equipment and technologies to accomplish compliance in the most cost effective manner 
absent capital expenditures for additional scrubbing  tampa electric expects to spend million of capital to comply with phase ii of the clean air act amendments for nitrogen oxide reductions and emissions monitoring equipment 
the cost of compliance with phase i and phase ii is expected to have little impact on tampa electric s prices 
utility regulation price increase and the fpsc granted tampa electric a million permanent base revenue increase and a million revenue increase primarily associated with recovery of purchased power capacity payments effective in february the utility received an additional base revenue increase of million effective jan 
 the fpsc s decision reflected overall allowed regulatory rates of return of percent in and percent in  which included an allowed regulatory rate of return on common equity roe of percent  the midpoint of a range of percent to percent 
return on equity agreements in march the fpsc issued an order which changed tampa electric s authorized roe to an percent midpoint with a range of percent to percent  while leaving in effect the rates it had previously established 
the fpsc also ordered a million annual accrual to establish an unfunded storm damage reserve for transmission and distribution property 
in july the fpsc issued an order approving an agreement between its staff and tampa electric to cap the utility s authorized regulatory rate of return on common equity at percent for only with any earnings above that amount to be used to increase the storm damage reserve 
tampa electric did not exceed the percent cap in and therefore accrued only the million to the storm damage reserve 
tampa electric s objective is to place polk unit one in service without increasing the total price that its customers pay for electric service 
a number of actions  discussed in the tampa electric s operating expenses section  have been taken to reduce costs 
a component of the strategy to accomplish this objective has been the deferral of certain revenues 
in the fpsc approved a plan submitted by tampa electric to defer certain revenues for under this plan tampa electric s allowed roe increased to an percent midpoint with a range of percent to percent and tampa electric deferred revenues under certain financial circumstances related to these returns 
for a minimum of million of revenues was deferred as well as percent of actual revenues in excess of an roe of percent up to a net earned roe of percent and all actual revenues above an roe of percent 
in tampa electric deferred million of revenues under this plan 
the deferred revenues accrue interest at the day commercial paper rate specified in the florida administrative code 
also as part of this plan the fpsc eliminated tampa electric s oil backout tariff effective jan 
  a reduction of about million of annual revenues 
on jan 
 the fpsc in a proposed agency action approved a plan by tampa electric relating to the deferral in of revenues under certain circumstances defined by roe levels 
as a result of protests by the office of public counsel and the florida industrial power users group  this action did not become effective and there became operative a provision of the order that required tampa electric to hold subject to the fpsc s jurisdiction any revenues in contributing to an roe in excess of percent 
on march  tampa electric filed with the fpsc an agreement between tampa electric and the two intervenors protesting the january proposed order 
if approved by the fpsc in a proposed agency action proceeding and if no protests are filed  the agreement would replace the jan 
 order 
this agreement addresses  among other things  tampa electric s base rate levels  roe levels for through  and regulatory treatment of all accumulated deferred revenues through the period ending dec 
 it provides for tampa electric s existing base rates to be frozen at current levels through dec 
  a refund to its customers of million million from operations and million from the deferred revenues plus interest over a period of one year commencing on oct 
  and for the possibility of an additional refund in under the agreement  for the years through tampa electric will keep in each year all revenues contributing to an roe up to percent 
any additional revenues will be allocated according to the following formula 
in  percent of any actual revenues that contribute to an roe in excess of percent will be included in revenues and the remaining percent will be deferred for use in and there will also be available for use in and about million of the revenues deferred from  after deducting from deferred revenues the million portion of the million refund 
in  percent of any revenues that contribute to an roe in excess of percent up to percent will be included in tampa electric s revenues 
the remaining percent will be deferred for use in any revenues contributing to an roe exceeding percent will be deferred for use during the same percent allocation of revenues will be made in after taking into account any accumulated deferred revenues not used in previous years 
the remaining percent  as well as all revenues contributing to an roe in excess of percent  if any  will be refunded to tampa electric s customers in no refunds resulting from the portion of the agreement will commence until a final  non appealable order has been issued resolving all issues with respect to the calculation of earned roe during the periods covered by the agreement  including the appropriate regulatory treatment of the polk power station 
finally  the agreement calls for an expeditious review of the regulatory treatment of tampa electric s polk power station 
tampa electric is optimistic that the fpsc will complete this review in the third quarter of an objective of the agreement is to maintain price stability by utilizing the  and deferred revenues to offset a portion of the revenue requirements associated with the polk power station 
coal settlement in february the fpsc approved an agreement between tampa electric and the office of public counsel that resolved all issues relating to prices for coal purchased in the years through by tampa electric from its affiliate  gatliff coal  a subsidiary of teco coal 
tampa electric agreed to refund million plus interest to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause over a month period beginning april  tampa electric refunded million to its customers in and the remainder in utility competition tampa electric s retail business is substantially free from direct competition with other electric utilities  municipalities and public agencies 
at the present time  the principal form of competition at the retail level consists of natural gas for residences and businesses and the self generation option available to larger users of electric energy 
such users  and possibly commercial and residential customers as well  may seek to expand their options through legislative and or regulatory initiatives that would permit competition at the retail level 
tampa electric intends to take all appropriate actions to retain and expand its retail business  to control costs  and provide high quality service to retail customers 
there is presently active competition in the wholesale power markets in florida  and this is increasing largely as a result of the energy policy act of and related federal initiatives 
this act removed certain regulatory barriers to independent power producers and required utilities to transmit power from such producers  utilities and others to wholesale customers under certain circumstances 
tampa electric continues its cost reduction efforts to increase its wholesale business  which is dependent on access to transmission systems owned by others 
in march the federal energy regulatory commission ferc issued its notice of proposed rulemaking on open access transmission services nopr 
the nopr would require open access to transmission systems and utilities owning transmission facilities including tampa electric to provide services to wholesale transmission customers comparable to those they provide to themselves on comparable terms and conditions including price 
among other things the nopr would unbundle transmission services from power sales and require owners of transmission systems to take service under their own transmission tariffs 
ferc transmission interchange proceedings tampa electric is one of several utilities that intervened in florida power and light s fpl proceeding before the ferc in which fpl has requested to change substantially the terms for providing interchange power and transmission services 
in addition to challenging the reasonableness and fairness of many aspects of fpl s filing  tampa electric maintains that fpl s transmission tariffs adversely affect competition in the wholesale market and violate ferc s comparability standard governing open access to wholesale transmission 
in december an administrative law judge appointed by the ferc issued his initial decision which is generally favorable to the positions advocated by tampa electric 
briefs on this decision have been filed by the active intervenors  ferc staff and fpl and the case is now fully submitted for a decision by the ferc 
any disposition of transmission issues is expected to reflect ferc action on the nopr 
tampa electric protested transmission tariff filings by florida power corporation fpc  likewise based principally on their adverse competitive effects on the wholesale power market and failure to comply with the ferc s comparability standard 
fpc has withdrawn these tariffs and substituted tariffs which conform to the pro forma tariffs in the nopr 
the ultimate terms of these tariffs will be determined after final action by ferc under the nopr 
in november the ferc accepted for filing tampa electric s open access transmission tariffs  which conform to the pro forma tariffs contained in the nopr  subject to refund and the outcome of the final rule under the nopr 
investment activity at dec

in july tampa electric entered into a forward refunding arrangement for million of outstanding pollution control revenue bonds 
under this arrangement million of new tax exempt bonds due dec 
 were issued on dec 
  at a percent interest rate 
the proceeds were used on feb 
 to refund the series having a percent interest rate 
for accounting and ratemaking purposes tampa electric began recording interest expense using a blended rate for the original and refunding bonds 
this blended rate was used from july and will continue to be used through the maturity dates of the original bonds 
teco energy raised million of common equity in  million in and million in from the sale of common stock through its dividend reinvestment and common stock purchase plan drp implemented in the company expects to raise a similar amount of equity through this plan in as a part of its risk management program teco energy has entered into interest rate exchange agreements to moderate its exposure to interest rate changes 
the benefit of these agreements are at risk only in the event of non performance by the other party to the agreement  which the company does not anticipate
