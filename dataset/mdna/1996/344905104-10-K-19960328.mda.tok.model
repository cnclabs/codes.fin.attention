item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s principal operating subsidiary is foothill independent bank  a california state chartered commercial bank the bank  which accounts for substantially all of the company s revenues and income 
accordingly  the following discussion focuses primarily on the operations and financial condition of the bank 
net interest income 
net interest income is a principal determinant of a bank s income 
net interest income represents the difference or spread between the interest earned on interest earning assets  such as loans and investment securities  and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  principally deposits 
net interest income increased by approximately  or in compared to  and by approximately  or in compared to the increase in was attributable to increases in interest earned on loans due to higher interest rates during the first half of and to growth in the average volume of the bank s interest earning assets  which increased by approximately during the increase in net interest income in was due to a increase in the average volume of interest earning assets and increases in market rates of interest during rate sensitivity and effect on net interest income 
the spread between the interest earned on interest earning assets and the interest paid on deposits the net interest margin will be affected by the extent to which interest rates charged on loans and leases are subject to adjustment in response to changes in market conditions that affect the interest rates a bank must offer to maintain and attract deposits  its principal source of funds 
banks that are heavily dependent on interest sensitive deposits to fund loans and other interest earning assets must increase the rates they pay to retain and attract deposits during periods of rising interest rates 
as a result  unless their loans and other interest earning assets have variable interest rates or short term maturities  such banks will experience reductions in net interest margins during periods of increasing interest rates 
on the other hand  during periods of declining interest rates  interest income on interest sensitive variable interest rate assets will decline and banks with a high portion of variable rate or short term loans may sustain reductions in net interest income during such periods 
the bank attempts to reduce its exposure to interest rate fluctuations  and thereby at least to maintain and  if possible  to increase its net interest margin or spread by seeking i to attract and maintain a significant volume of demand and savings deposits that are not as sensitive to interest rate fluctuations as are time certificates of deposit tcd s  and ii to match opportunities to reprice earning assets  particularly loans  in response to changes in market rates of interest which require or cause repricing of deposits 
during  the bank was able to increase  in absolute dollars  the volume of the bank s demand and savings deposits  as compared to and due in part to the increase in the volume of demand and savings deposits  the relative stability of those deposits  and the decision of the federal reserve board to begin reducing interest rates  the bank was able  during the second half of  to increase the volume of fixed rate loans in order to maintain yields on earning assets in a declining interest rate market 
as a result  at december   the volume of loans with variable interest rates declined to of the bank s totals loans outstanding  as compared to and  at december  and  respectively 
despite the increase in the volume of savings and demand deposits and the increase in the volume of fixed rate loans  the bank s net interest margin ie  net interest income stated as a percentage of interest income in declined to from in and in this decline in was attributable to a combination of i increases in interest expense due to the rise in the rates paid on interest bearing time deposits in and the first half of  ii increases in in the average volume of time certificates of deposits time deposits or tcd s  on which the bank pays higher rates of interest than on savings and demand deposits  iii a slowing of loan growth in and an increase in the volume of other types of interest earning assets  such as federal funds sold  investment securities and deposits held at other institutions  which generally are lower yielding assets than are loans  and iv a decline in market rates of interest during the second half of  which had a more immediate impact on variable rate or short term interest earning assets than it did on the rates of interest paid on time deposits 
the increase in the volume of the bank s time deposits  which was greater than the increase in the volume of savings and demand deposits in  were used to fund the bank s internal growth and increase the bank s liquidity  which had declined in primarily because of a increase during that year in the bank s outstanding loans 
as time deposits mature during  the bank expects that they will be replaced by deposits at the lower rates of interest corresponding to current market interest rates 
the ability of the bank to maintain its net interest margin is not entirely within its control because the interest rates the bank is able to charge on loans and the interest rates it offers to maintain and attract deposits are affected by national monetary policies established and implemented by the federal reserve board and by competitive conditions in the bank s service areas 
in addition  the effect on a bank s net interest margins of changes in market rates of interest will depend on the types and maturities of its deposits and earning assets 
for example  a change in interest rates paid on deposits in response to changes in market rates of interest can be implemented more quickly in the case of savings deposits and money market accounts than with respect to time deposits as to which a change in interest rates generally cannot be implemented until such deposits mature 
in addition  a change in rates of interest paid on deposits can and often does lead consumers to move their deposits from one type of deposit to another or to shift funds from deposits to non bank investments or from such investments to bank deposit accounts or instruments  which also will affect a bank s net interest margin 
the bank currently anticipates an improvement in net interest margin in  as compared to  due to a number of factors  including  a decline in market rates of interest and an anticipated run off of some of the bank s higher interest bearing tcd s in denominations of  or more  which should reduce interest expense  and somewhat greater loan growth which is expected to result from the decline in interest rates  a slowly improving economy in southern california and the consolidations of larger banks in its market area which  based on past experience  can lead some of their customers to transfer their business to community banks  such as the bank  to obtain improved service 
however  there are a number of uncertainties and risks that could adversely affect the bank s net interest margin in  including the possibility of adverse changes in economic conditions in southern california  changes in market rates of interest and the possibility of increased competition in the bank s market areas  both from other banks and from financial institutions and from securities brokerage firms that offer competing loan and investment products 
years ended december  and interest income 
interest income increased by approximately  or in  compared to  due to an increase of approximately  in interest earned on loans and other interest earning assets that was attributable both to increases in market rates of interest during the first half of and to increases in the volume of the bank s interest earning assets  but which was partially offset by a decline  as compared to  of approximately  in loan fees  as loan growth was lower in than in interest expense 
the increase in interest expense in of approximately  or  compared to figures  was primarily attributable to a increase in the average volume of interest bearing deposits and to increases in interest rates paid on deposits as a result of a change in the mix of deposits to a higher percentage of time deposits on which the bank pays interest at higher rates and increases in market rates of interest during the first half of provision for loan and lease losses 
the bank maintains a reserve for possible losses on loans and leases that occur from time to time as an incidental part of the banking business 
write offs of loans primarily reductions in the carrying values of non performing loans due to possible losses on their ultimate recovery are charged against the reserve and the reserve is adjusted periodically to reflect changes in the volume of outstanding loans and in the risk of potential losses due to a deterioration in the condition of borrowers or in the value of property securing non performing loans or changes in general economic conditions 
additions to the loan loss reserve are made through a charge against income referred to as the provision for loan and lease losses 
in this provision was  compared to  in  and the reserve at december  was approximately  or of total loans and leases outstanding compared to a reserve of approximately  or of total loans and leases outstanding at december  the decrease in the provision made in  as compared to the provision made in  was due primarily to a slowing in the growth of the bank s volume of outstanding loans and the assessment of the bank s management that the amount of the loan loss reserve was adequate in relation to the volume and condition of the bank s outstanding loans 
net loan charge offs in aggregated  representing sixty one hundredths of one percent of the average volume of loans and leases that were outstanding in  as compared to net loan charge offs in of  which represented sixty nine hundredths of one percent of average loans and leases outstanding 
other income 
other income decreased by  or in compared to this decrease was primarily due to decreases in the volume of and  consequently  in the fees generated from  sales of small business administration sba guaranteed loans 
other expenses 
the bank s non interest expense increased by approximately  or during this increase included a  increase in salaries and employee benefits and a  increase in occupancy expense 
the increase in salaries and employee benefits was due primarily to staffing requirements for two new banking offices established by the bank  one in glendale  california that was opened in march  and the second in corona  california that was opened in july also contributing to the increase in occupancy expense in was an increase in rental expense resulting from the sale and leaseback in december of of the building housing the bank s san dimas  california service center  that was effectuated to convert a non earning asset into cash that could be invested in earning assets 
also contributing to the increase in other operating expenses in was a provision of  made to increase the bank s reserves for possible losses on other real estate owned  which is real property that was acquired by the bank on defaulted loans and is being held for resale 
this compares to the provisions of  in and  in the increases in the provision in and were made in response to declining real estate values due to the continued softness in demand for commercial real estate in southern california  which is a sector of the local economy which has not experienced any material improvement during the past three years 
the reserves for possible losses on other real estate owned totaled  at december   as compared to  and  at december  and  respectively 
income taxes 
income taxes decreased by approximately  or during compared to  as a result of the increase in the volume of tax exempt investment securities held by the bank 
years ended december  and interest income 
the increase in interest income of approximately  or in compared to was attributable to an increase in the volume of the bank s outstanding loans and  to a lesser extent  an increase in market rates of interest 
interest expense 
interest expense increased by approximately  or in compared to  primarily as a result of increases in the average volume of time deposits on which the bank pays higher rates of interest than on savings deposits  and  to a lesser extent  increases in the rates paid on those deposits 
provisions for loan and lease losses 
the provision for loan and lease losses made in was  as compared to  during net charge offs for aggregated  representing approximately sixty nine hundredths of one percent of average loans and leases  as compared to net loan charge offs in of  which represented forty seven hundredths of one percent of average loans and leases outstanding 
other income 
the bank s other income decreased approximately  or in as compared to this decrease was primarily attributable to the fact that other income in included i a one time gain of approximately  from the sale of the bank s portfolio of municipal leases in march  and ii a gain of  on the sale of the government guaranteed portion of the bank s sba loans  as compared to gains from the sale of sba loans of  in other expenses 
the bank s non interest expense  consisting primarily of salaries and other employee benefits  occupancy expenses  furniture and equipment expenses  insurance expenses  data processing expenses  and professional expenses  increased by approximately  or during as compared to this increase was primarily due to an increase of  in salaries and employee benefits to facilitate the service needs of increased deposits and loans and a  increase  as compared to  in the provision made for possible losses on other real estate owned 
income taxes 
income taxes increased by approximately  or during as compared to  primarily as a result of the increase in pre tax income in and a reduction in the proportion of the bank s interest income that was exempt from federal income taxes 
financial condition the company s total assets at december  were approximately  or  higher than at december  average total assets for increased by approximately  or to  from  for these increases were primarily the result of the implementation of marketing programs designed to attract new customers and increase deposits throughout the bank  and to a lesser extent  the opening of two new banking offices in the additional deposits that were generated by those programs were used primarily to fund increases in deposits held at other banks  federal funds sold and investment securities  thereby increasing the bank s liquidity and  to a lesser extent  to fund new loans 
the average volume of interest bearing deposits held at other financial institutions increased by to  in from  in and the average volume of federal funds sold by the bank in increased by approximately to  from  in the average volume of investment securities held by the bank during increased by approximately  or compared to figures 
the average volume of loans and leases less reserves outstanding during increased by approximately  a increase from as a result of the addition in of the two new banking offices  and the programs implemented to attract new deposits to the bank  total deposits at december  had increased by approximately  or as compared to total deposits at december  at december   time deposits in denominations of less than  had increased to of the bank s total deposits from approximately at december  however  although the aggregate volume of tcd s in denominations of  or more increased during  such deposits constituted approximately of total deposits at december   the same percentage as at december  tcd s in denominations of more than  are more sensitive to changes in the market rates of interest than other types of deposits 
for that reason  the bank has made it a policy to seek tcd s in denominations over  primarily from existing customers or from public agencies and does not rely unduly on brokered deposits  which tend to be more interest sensitive and volatile 
of the tcd s in denominations of  or more outstanding at december   approximately  had maturities of three months or less  approximately  had maturities of between three and twelve months and the balance had maturities of more than twelve months 
although no assurances can be given  based on the fact that the holders of a large portion of these tcd s are local depositors who in the past have renewed their tcd s with the bank  the company anticipates that a substantial portion of these deposits will be renewed  at interest rates which  due to declining market rates of interest  are expected to be lower than those that were in effect when such tcd s were originated  and that net withdrawals of these deposits in should not materially exceed approximately  the company anticipates more modest growth in the bank s total assets and total deposits in  as compared to  during which the bank opened two new banking offices and implemented marketing programs designed to increase deposits to fund that growth and increase the bank s liquidity 
among other things  the bank intends to allow a run off of  rather than to renew  some of the shorter term tcd s in denominations of  as they mature in  which should have the effect of offsetting deposit growth anticipated within other deposit categories 
liquidity management 
liquidity management policies attempt to achieve a matching of sources and uses of funds in order to enable the bank to fund its customers requirements for loans and deposit withdrawals 
in conformity with those policies  the bank maintains short term sources of funds to meet periodic increases in loan demand and deposit withdrawals and maturities 
at december   the principal source of asset liquidity consisted of  in cash and demand balances due from banks and  of federal funds sold which  together  totaled  compared to a total of  at december  other sources of liquidity included  in securities available for sale  of which approximately  mature within one year 
the bank also has established facilities to borrow federal funds from other banks in excess of  and has established a borrowing line of credit with the federal home loan bank in the amount of  furthermore  substantially all of the bank s installment loans and leases  the amount of which aggregated  at december   require regular installment payments  providing a steady flow of cash funds to the bank 
accordingly  the company believes that the bank has adequate cash and cash equivalent resources to meet any increases in demand for loans and leases and any increase in deposit withdrawals that might occur in the foreseeable future 
capital resources 
during  the board of directors discontinued payment of cash dividends in order to retain internally generated funds to support internal growth of the bank 
in addition to the new banking offices opened in glendale in march and in corona in july  the bank has recently opened a new banking office in chino  california 
the board of directors intends to consider  later in  whether to resume cash dividends 
however  it is not possible to predict at this time whether cash dividends will be resumed  as that will depend on a number of factors  including the company s earnings and the growth of the company s assets in and whether opportunities for further growth may arise in the future 
during the first quarter of  the board of directors declared a stock dividend on the company s outstanding shares  which was distributed on may   and which  for accounting purposes  was recorded as a  reduction in retained earnings  offset by a corresponding  increase in the company s stated capital 
as a result of the increased earnings in and the retention of internally generated funds  the company s total shareholders equity increased by approximately  or to  at december  from  at december  earnings in represent a return on beginning assets that is  total assets as of january  of and a return on beginning equity total shareholders equity as of january  of  as compared to and  respectively  in in january  the company declared another stock dividend on its outstanding shares that will be distributed on april  to shareholders of record as of march  it is anticipated that an additional  shares will be issued to the company s shareholders as a result of this stock dividend and that the stock dividend will be accounted for as a  approximate reduction in retained earnings and an offsetting approximate increase of  in stated capital  so that the company s total shareholders equity will not be diminished as a result of this stock dividend 
federal regulations require that banks maintain a minimum ratio of capital exclusive of loan loss reserves to average assets of between and the tier capital ratio or tier leverage ratio 
despite the increases in average assets during  the bank s tier capital ratio at december  remained unchanged from the december  percentage of 
federal bank regulations also require banks to meet a minimum risk based capital ratio of 
under those regulations  a bank s assets are weighted according to certain risk formulas  and  the higher risk profile of a bank s assets  the greater of the amount of capital that is required to meet the risk based capital ratio 
on the basis of the formulas set forth in those regulations  the bank s risk based capital ratio at december  was
