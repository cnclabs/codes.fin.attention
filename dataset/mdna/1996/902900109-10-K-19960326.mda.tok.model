item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the operating results for the year ended december   are highlighted by a substantial improvement in earnings and continued progress in the resolution of problem assets 
net income for was million  or per share  well above results of million  or per share  as costs associated with problem assets  including loan loss provisions and loan workout expense  were significantly reduced 
refer to results of operations comparison of with for a further discussion 
substandard loans  as determined by the company s internal credit risk rating system  peaked at million at year end  following a three year recessionary period in the local economy 
such loans were reduced million during for a total reduction of over percent  or million since  to million at december  nonperforming assets  consisting of substandard nonaccrual loans which are included in the aforementioned figures  restructured loans  accruing loans greater than days past due and other real estate owned also reflect the company s successful efforts to reduce problem assets 
nonperforming assets were decreased million in to million at year end 
during the fourth quarter  the company initiated a program for the accelerated disposition of million of such substandard and nonperforming assets 
these million of troubled loans are classified as loans held for sale  net of million in chargeoffs  at december  refer to credit quality and reserve for possible loan losses for a further discussion of asset quality 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements  notes  and tables included elsewhere in this form k 
certain amounts reported for prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the presentation 
financial condition at december  assets total assets at december  were billion  an increase of million from billion a year ago 
the asset growth was primarily in securities which increased million during the year 
funding for the higher level of securities was provided by an increase in deposits and short term borrowings 
also contributing to the increase in securities was a million change from a gross unrealized loss to an unrealized gain on securities available for sale 
refer to securities herein for a further discussion 
slightly offsetting the higher level of securities were decreases in loans of million  other real estate owned of million and excess funds sold decreased to zero from million a year ago 
this year s increase in total assets is in contrast to the downward trend in the level of assets over the past several years which was led by declining loan volume 
presently the company anticipates a relatively stable level of total and interest earning assets in the coming year 
loan growth is expected to be funded by a combination of maturing securities  and additional short term borrowings or deposit growth  as needed 
loans the following table presents the composition of the loan portfolio december  dollars in thousands commercial and financial      commercial real estate construction      developer  investor and land      consumer residential mortgage      home equity      indirect automobile installment      other consumer      lease financing      total loans      reserve for possible loan losses      certain loans for which the principal source of repayment is not real estate collateral have been classified as commercial and financial for the through presentations 
for these loans were included in the commercial real estate category 
information is not readily available to reclassify loans for that year 
indirect automobile installment loans represent loans purchased without recourse from automobile dealers subject to adherence to the company s underwriting standards 
automobile loans made directly to consumers are not significant and are included with other consumer loans 
not included in the loan balances at december  were million in troubled loans held for sale  recorded at net realizable value and classified as other assets 
refer to credit quality and reserve for possible loan losses for a discussion 
the company s commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios have been experiencing a decline due to the combination of normal amortization and the aggressive reduction of problem loans through collection  chargeoff  third party refinancing  or sale 
the future outflow is expected to subside due to the significantly reduced level of troubled loans 
commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios are expected to experience modest growth  tempered by increasing competition for small to middle market credits 
the indirect automobile loan portfolio has grown considerably since due to the company s increased marketing efforts supported by the automation of this business unit s operations 
indirect automobile loans grew percent  or million in  compared with growth of percent  or million in the company anticipates continued growth in this portfolio in the coming year 
in the aggregate  the remaining loan and lease portfolios  home equity  other consumer and equipment lease financing  are expected to continue with their current level of moderate growth 
loan maturity distribution the following table reflects the maturity and interest sensitivity of commercial and financial  and commercial real estate loans at december  after year dollars in thousands year or less through years after years total commercial and financial     commercial real estate construction    developer  investor and land     interest sensitivity of above loans with predetermined interest rates     with floating interest rates     the company does not have an automatic rollover renewal policy for maturing loans 
renewal requests are reviewed and approved in substantially the same manner as applications by new customers for extensions of credit 
additionally  any renewal of a loan rated substandard or lower in the company s credit risk rating profile  requires the controlled loan department head approval and for certain size loans and circumstances  the approval of the senior credit committee and board of directors 
securities securities increased million during the year to million at december  the growth in the portfolio reflects purchases of us government agency securities  mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
in addition  the increase in securities reflects the change from an unrealized loss on securities available for sale of million to an unrealized gain of million  a million improvement 
this improvement was the result of a lower interest rate environment and corresponding higher bond prices in the upward trend this year compares with the sharp decline in bond prices in due to the rapid rise in interest rates

the change in unrealized valuation to market value on securities available for sale also had the positive effect of increasing stockholders investment by million from a year ago 
the unrealized loss reported as part of stockholders investment of million  net of a million deferred tax benefit at december  changed to a unrealized gain of million  net of a 
million deferred tax provision at december  in the fourth quarter of this year the company redesignated a thousand municipal bond  its sole held to maturity designated security  to the available for sale designation 
this change was in response to a one time opportunity permitted by the financial accounting standards board fasb to reassess the appropriateness of the designations of an institution s securities that are affected by fasb no 
as of december   the company s entire securities portfolio of million was designated as available for sale 
the company has a policy of purchasing securities primarily rated a or better by moody s investors services and us government securities to minimize credit risk 
all securities  however  carry interest rate risk which affects their market value such that as market yields increase  the value of the company s securities declines and vice versa 
additionally  mortgage backed securities carry prepayment risk where expected yields may not be achieved due to an inability to re invest the proceeds from prepayment at comparable yields 
moreover  such mortgage backed securities may not benefit from price appreciation in periods of declining rates to the same extent as the remainder of the portfolio

liquidity and funding liquidity involves the company s ability to raise or gain access to funds in order to fulfill its existing and anticipated financial obligations 
it may be provided through the maturity or sale of an entity s assets  such as loans and securities available for sale  liability sources such as increased deposits and purchased or borrowed funds  and access to the capital markets 
while the company s securities portfolio is currently classified entirely as available for sale  the company has no present intention or need to sell any of its securities or existing loan portfolio  other than a nominal volume of fixed rate residential mortgage loans sold to investors as they are originated 
as discussed in the introduction the company has classified million of troubled loans as held for sale at december  at december   liquidity  which includes excess cash  excess funds sold and unpledged securities  totaled approximately million  or percent of total assets  a million increase from the funds needed to support the company s loan and securities portfolios are provided through a combination of commercial and retail deposits and short term borrowings 
total deposits increased million  or percent  to billion since december  now  money market and regular savings deposits decreased million while time deposits increased million reflecting investors attraction to the company s competitively aggressive certificate of deposit rates throughout much of the year 
demand deposits experienced a slight increase of million during as shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows  cash and cash equivalents decreased million during cash provided by operations resulted largely from net interest income from loans and securities  less the net difference of noninterest expense over noninterest income 
cash provided by financing activities was due principally to the net increases in deposits and in short term borrowings  offset in part by payments on other borrowings 
net cash used by investing activities was due to an excess of purchases of securities over the proceeds from the sales and maturities of securities 
at december   the parent company had million in cash and due from banks and million in short term securities purchased under agreements to resell  compared with million in cash and due from banks and million in us treasury securities at december  during  the company paid the remaining principal of million plus accrued interest on its senior notes 
for the year ended december   the company received a total of million in dividends from its asset management and trust subsidiary  united states trust company ustc  million from ustrust and million from jsa financial corporation jsa  a nonbanking subsidiary of the company specializing in the liquidation of problem assets 
during the same period million was contributed to ust bank connecticut ust conn and million was contributed to jsa 
this capital contribution to jsa facilitated the purchase of million in problem assets from ust conn and provided jsa with additional operating capital 
deposits the following table sets forth the remaining maturities of certificates of deposit in the amount of thousand or more at december  dollars in thousands less than three months  three to six months  six to twelve months  over twelve months  total  short term borrowings the company s short term borrowings consist primarily of federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
these instruments are generally overnight funds 
december  for the year ended december  weighted average maximum amount average amount weighted average dollars in thousands balance interest rate at any month end outstanding interest rate federal funds purchased securities sold under agreements to repurchase interest rate risk volatility in interest rates requires the company to manage interest rate risk which arises from differences in the timing of repricing of assets and liabilities 
management monitors and adjusts the difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities gap position within various time frames 
an institution with more assets repricing than liabilities within a given time frame is considered asset sensitive positive gap and in time frames with more liabilities repricing than assets it is liability sensitive negative gap 
within gap limits established by the board of directors  the company seeks to balance the objective of insulating the net interest margin from rate exposure with that of taking advantage of anticipated changes in rates in order to enhance income 
the company s policy is to limit its one year cumulative gap position to times equity  presently equal to approximately percent of total assets 
the company manages its interest rate gap primarily by lengthening or shortening the maturity structure of its securities portfolio 
the company s gap presentation may not reflect the degrees to which interest earning assets and core deposit costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
the company s rate sensitive assets consist primarily of loans tied to the prime rate and to a lesser extent the london interbank offered rate libor 
as interest rates rose during the first quarter of  the prime rate and  therefore  the company s yield on earning assets increased faster than the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
after a period of interest rate stability experienced within the second quarter  interest rates decreased during the last half of  effecting a reduced prime rate 
this had a predictable effect on the company s margin with the yield on earning assets decreasing faster than the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the following table summarizes the company s gap position at december  the majority of loans are included in days as they reprice in response to changes in the interest rate environment 
interest bearing deposits are classified according to their expected interest rate sensitivity 
actual sensitivity of these deposits is reviewed periodically and adjustments are made in the company s gap analysis as management deems appropriate 
securities and noninterest bearing demand deposits are categorized according to their expected lives based on published industry prepayment estimates in the case of securities and current management estimates for demand deposits 
securities are evaluated in conjunction with the company s asset liability management strategy and may be purchased or sold in response to expected or actual changes in interest rates and credit risk  prepayment risk  loan growth and similar factors 
the reserve for possible loan losses is included in the over year category of loans

two requirements take into consideration risks inherent in assets for both on and off balance sheet items on a risk weighted basis risk based assets 
risk weightings are as determined by banking regulators for the industry as a whole 
under these requirements  the company must meet minimum tier and total risk based capital ratios capital  as defined in the regulations  divided by risk based assets of percent and percent  respectively 
tier capital is essentially shareholders investment  net of intangible assets and tier capital is the allowable portion of the loan loss reserve as defined and discounted subordinated debt 
total capital is the combination of tier and tier the third requirement is a leverage capital ratio  defined as tier capital divided by total average assets  net of intangibles 
all but the most highly rated banks are required to maintain a minimum of percent 
the company has not been notified of a specific requirement above the minimum

in the fourth quarter of the company declared and paid a cash dividend of per share to stockholders for a total dividend of thousand 
during this year the company received dividends from subsidiaries of million from ustc  million from ustrust and million from jsa financial corporation 
during the same period the company contributed as capital to its subsidiaries totaling million to ust conn and million to jsa financial corporation

for a discussion of the agreement which is no longer in effect  refer to the company s annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  in june  the company s massachusetts based and largest subsidiary bank  ustrust  was released by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the massachusetts commissioner from the terms of its cease and desist order  originally issued in january in conjunction with the release of the order  ustrust s board of directors adopted a resolution pursuant to which ustrust agreed  among other matters i to continue to maintain a tier leverage capital ratio of at least percent  ii not to pay a dividend which would cause the bank s tier leverage capital ratio to fall below percent  iii to continue to implement plans to reduce nonperforming assets and the aggregate level of insider loans  and iv to provide a quarterly progress report to the fdic and the massachusetts commissioner 
for a discussion of the order which is no longer in effect  refer to the company s annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  the company s second massachusetts based banking subsidiary  ustc  was released from a similar order in  and has also agreed not to declare or pay dividends should the effect of the payment of such dividends cause ustc s tier leverage capital ratio to fall below percent

at december   substandard loans were million compared with million a year ago and a peak of million at the end of loans reported as substandard for the purpose of this discussion include loans classified as substandard or doubtful  as determined by the company in its internal credit risk rating system 
under the company s definition  substandard loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that some loss will be sustained if the credit deficiencies are not corrected 
the substandard classification  however  does not necessarily imply ultimate loss for each individual loan so classified 
loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in substandard loans with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection of percent of the assets questionable and improbable 
at december   substandard and doubtful loans were million and 
million  respectively 
substandard loans include million of accruing commercial and commercial real estate loans  of which percent were current  and million in loans that were on nonaccrual and included in nonperforming assets 
all of the loans rated doubtful were on nonaccrual and included in nonperforming assets 
also  at december   loans rated special mention in the company s internal credit risk rating profile amounted to million  all of which were current 
this compares with million a year ago 
special mention loans  as defined by the company  have potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention 
if left uncorrected  these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the assets 
as of year end  approximately percent of loans classified as substandard or doubtful were collateralized with real estate  and the remainder were collateralized with accounts receivable  inventory  equipment and other business assets 
of the loans secured by real estate  approximately percent were collateralized by owner occupied commercial properties  approximately percent were collateralized by commercial real estate development  and approximately percent by residential real estate 
the remaining loans were collateralized by real estate under construction and raw land 
nonperforming assets the following table displays the company s total nonperforming assets and measures performance regarding key indicators of asset quality december  dollars in thousands nonperforming assets nonaccruals commercial and financial      commercial real estate construction    developer  investor and land      consumer residential     home equity   indirect automobile installment other consumer lease financing total nonaccrual      accruing loans days or more    other real estate owned oreo       restructured loans      total nonperforming assets      reserve for possible loan losses      net chargeoffs      oreo reserve   ratios reserve to nonaccrual loans reserve to total of nonaccrual loans  accruing loans days or more past due and restructured loans reserve to period end loans nonaccrual loans to period end loans nonaccrual loans and accruing loans over days past due to period end loans nonperforming assets to period end loans and oreo nonperforming assets to total assets net chargeoffs to average loans oreo reserve to oreo the amount of interest on december  nonaccrual and restructured loans that would have been recorded had the loans been paying in accordance with their original terms during was approximately  the amount of interest income on these loans included in net income in was approximately  other real estate owned oreo represents assets to which title to the collateral has been taken through foreclosure or in settlement of loans 
other real estate owned is recorded at the lower of the recorded investment in the loan or fair value minus estimated costs to sell net realizable value 
prior to  other real estate owned was recorded at the lower of recorded investment in the loan or fair value 
included in oreo are automobiles owned which are vehicles repossessed for reason of nonpayment 
the balance is stated at the lower of the recorded investment in the loan or net realizable value 
restructured loans are those where interest rates and or principal repayments have been restructured to defer or reduce payments as a result of financial difficulties of the borrower 
prior to december  when the company adopted aicpa statement of position  oreo was reduced to its fair value by direct charges to the asset 
since then  the company  like other bank holding companies  has used reserves to indicate the net realizable value of its oreo 
the improvement in credit quality is also exhibited in the company s successful reduction of nonperforming assets 
during  these assets were reduced percent  or million to million 
nonperforming assets were percent of total assets at december  compared with percent and percent at year end and  respectively 
the lower level of nonperformers has also directly contributed to the decreasing amount of net chargeoffs recorded by the company 
this year net chargeoffs were million compared with and chargeoffs of million and million  respectively 
the net chargeoffs included a charge of million recorded in connection with a program for the accelerated disposition of million in troubled assets which are classified as loans held for sale at december  the company continues to consider further accelerated disposition programs for the remaining balance of troubled loans 
at december   total impaired loans were million  comprised of million that required a reserve for possible loan losses of 
million and million that did not require a related reserve 
impaired loans  as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
are loans recognized by the company as nonaccrual and restructured 
refer to note to the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for a further discussion on sfas no 
the reserve for possible loan losses decreased from million at year end to million this year 
provisions for possible loan losses were recorded at amounts relatively consistent with the level of net chargeoffs throughout much of the year 
the exception was the late fourth quarter million charge related to the accelerated disposition program 
despite the decrease in the reserve balance  the reserve coverage continually strengthened throughout equaling percent of nonaccrual loans at year end compared with percent last year and percent in credit quality monitoring credit quality within the commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios of each subsidiary is quantified by an internal credit risk rating system designed to parallel regulatory criteria and categories of loan risk 
lenders monitor their loans to ensure appropriate rating assignments are made on a timely basis 
risk ratings and overall loan quality are also assessed on a regular basis by an independent loan review department which reports to the company s board of directors and its asset quality committee 
loan review personnel conduct ongoing portfolio trend analyses and individual credit reviews to evaluate loan risk and compliance with corporate lending policies 
results and recommendations from this process provide senior management and the board of directors and its asset quality committee with independent information on loan portfolio condition 
the asset quality committee  which reports to the audit committee of the company s board of directors  monitors asset quality monthly and actively reviews the large credit exposures 
the company s commercial lending  credit and loan administration departments are charged with ensuring compliance with lending policies  procedures and administrative guidelines for the commercial portfolio 
in addition  an appraisal department reviews third party real estate loan collateral appraisals to ensure adherence to federal requirements and the company s lending policies 
there is a controlled loan department with specialized expertise in handling most of the company s nonaccrual and other troubled loans 
in order to ensure the effectiveness of credit quality monitoring systems  monitoring controls are periodically reviewed and tested by the company s internal audit department 
the credit quality of the lease financing receivables portfolio is measured by the same credit rating system described above 
consumer loan quality is evaluated on the basis of delinquent data due to the large number of such loans and relatively small size of individual credits 
historical trend analysis reports are reviewed on a monthly basis by senior lending officers and the company s board of directors 
past due nonconsumer loans  nonaccrual loans  and troubled debt restructurings are reviewed at least quarterly by a special assets committee whose membership includes the chief executive officer of the company  loan review department management and the most senior lending officers in the major lending and credit related divisions 
loans are placed on nonaccrual when there is doubt as to the collectibility of interest or principal or if loans are days or more past due unless they are both well secured and in the process of collection 
in every case  a loan reaching days past due is placed on nonaccrual 
reserve for possible loan losses the company maintains a reserve for possible loan losses to absorb future chargeoffs of loans and leases in the existing portfolio 
the reserve is increased when a loan loss provision is recorded in the income statement 
when a loan  or portion thereof  is considered uncollectible  it is charged against the reserve 
recoveries on amounts previously charged off are added to the reserve when collected 
adequacy of the reserve for possible loan losses is determined using a consistent  systematic methodology which analyzes the size and risk of the loan and lease portfolio on a monthly basis 
factors in this analysis include historical loss experience and asset quality  as reflected by delinquency trends  nonaccrual and restructured loans and the company s credit risk rating profile 
consideration is also given to the current and expected economic conditions and in particular how such conditions affect the types of credits in the portfolio and the market area in general 
this analysis is documented using a combination of numerical and qualitative analysis and includes sensitivity testing and a written conclusion 
no portion of the reserve is restricted to any loan or group of loans  and the entire reserve is available to absorb future realized losses 
the amount and timing of realized losses and future reserve allocations may vary from current estimates

results of operations comparison of with for the year ended december   net income was million  or per share  a substantial increase over the million  per share  earned in the improvement in earnings was the direct result of a million reduction in the provision for possible loan losses from million last year to million for in addition  a stronger net interest margin and notable reductions in noninterest expense  particularly foreclosed asset and workout expense and fdic deposit insurance assessments  also contributed to a higher level of net income

in order to make pretax yields comparable to taxable loans and investments  a tax equivalent adjustment is utilized 
the adjustment is based on a percent federal income tax rate in and  and percent in and includes applicable state taxes  net of federal tax benefit 
net interest spread is the excess of the interest rate on average earning assets over the interest rate on average interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin is the excess of the interest earned over interest expense divided by average earning assets 
interest rates moved downward in the second half of following a period of rapid interest rate rise from early through the first quarter of the result of this year s higher level of interest rates was an improvement in yield on earning assets of basis points from percent last year to percent this year 
the cost of interest bearing liabilities  principally deposits  increased by basis points from percent last year to percent in yields on prime based loans and excess funds  which reprice daily  reached their peak in the first quarter of this year and decreased steadily throughout the remainder of the year consistent with the movement of interest rates 
while the company initially refrained from increasing deposit rates in the rising interest rate environment of  to satisfy liquidity needs and in response to competition for deposits  more aggressive deposit pricing was adopted in late and the first quarter of this year 
beginning with the second quarter and continuing through the rest of  the company moved to a less competitive pricing policy 
the result was a rising cost of deposits earlier this year which subsided during the latter half of the year 
the company anticipates that deposit rates will be relatively level in the first half of and move downward in the second half in response to lower interest rates 
this year s interest rate spread of percent was approximately equal with the spread of percent as the rise in yield on earning assets equaled the increase in cost of interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest rate margin improved basis points to percent reflecting the positive impact of an equal rise in rates on the larger balance of average earning assets which totaled billion compared with interest bearing liabilities which totaled billion 
also contributing to the increased net interest rate margin was a reduction in interest bearing liabilities of million which exceeded a decrease in interest earning assets by million 
the net effect on net interest income from changes in rates in compared with was an increase of million 
despite the year to year increase in interest rate margin and level interest rate spread  both spread and margin were in a downward trend since peaking at historical highs in the first quarter of this year 
the narrowing of rate and margin is expected to continue due to declining interest rates  which will reduce yield on interest earning assets  particularly loans 
in the short term  rates on new deposits are expected to remain relatively stable with little impact on margin and spread 
average earning assets decreased million from billion in to billion in the decrease reflects declines in average loans of million and securities of million which was partially offset by an increase in lower yielding excess funds of million 
average interest bearing liabilities decreased million from last year to billion 
in addition  interest bearing liabilities experienced a shift in the mix of average deposits from savings and money market deposits to higher cost certificates of deposit 
regular savings  now and money market deposits decreased million while time deposits increased million 
further changes in the mix from savings deposit products to higher cost time deposit products would negatively impact net interest income

accounting for income taxes 
this standard changed the accounting for deferred income taxes to the liability method

million  which is expected to be realized against future taxable income

fair value of financial instruments the methods and assumptions used by the company to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments as of december  and  in accordance with sfas no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments  are discussed in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
financial instruments do not include all of the assets and liabilities recorded on a company s balance sheet 
therefore  the aggregate fair value amounts of the financial instruments do not represent the underlying value of a company 
as a result of those assumptions and valuation methodologies  the estimated fair value of financial instrument assets and liabilities of the company as of december  was billion and billion  or million and million in excess of carrying value  respectively 
the estimated fair value of financial instrument assets and liabilities as of december  was billion and billion  or million and million in excess of carrying value  respectively 
the increase in excess of fair value over the carrying value of financial instrument assets of million is attributed  in the opinion of management  to the large decline in substandard loans and resulting reduction in credit risk  and the effect of lower market interest rates from a year ago 
the slight increase in excess of fair value over carrying value of financial instrument liabilities  is attributed  in the opinion of management  to the decline in market interest rates at december   particularly deposit rates  compared with a year ago
