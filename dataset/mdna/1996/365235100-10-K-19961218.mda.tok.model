includes a benefit related to recognition of deferred tax assets of the company s restaurants experience seasonal influences  as a disproportionate amount of the company s net income is realized during the second  third and fourth fiscal quarters due to higher average sales and lower average costs 
quarterly results have been and are expected to continue to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including the timing of new restaurant openings 
as a result of these factors  net sales and net income on a quarterly basis may fluctuate and are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
liquidity and capital resources to date  the company has financed its cash requirements principally from cash flow from operating activities  the private placement of preferred stock and subordinated debt and an initial public offering of common stock 
the company does not have significant receivables or inventory  and receives trade credit based upon negotiated terms when purchasing food and supplies 
for october  through september   the company generated million in cash flow from operating activities  received million from bank debt and capital lease financing and million from subordinated debt financing and million from the company s initial public offering 
the company s principal capital requirement has been funding the development of restaurants 
historically  the company has primarily leased the land and buildings for its restaurant operations 
the company does purchase land and or buildings when favorable conditions are available 
the company currently owns the land and buildings for eight restaurants 
during fiscal  and fiscal  the company opened  and restaurants  respectively  resulting in a net increase in the company s restaurants from to at september  a total of southern california restaurants were closed during fiscal and 
capital expenditures totalled million and million  respectively  during fiscal and and million during fiscal the company currently operates restaurants 
additionally  the company has signed four leases  purchased land for three restaurants and opened escrow for one of the eight sites expected to open in fiscal the company opened one mini restaurant in california  four additional restaurants in arizona  two additional restaurants in florida and one new restaurant in new mexico during fiscal the company s average cash investment for the two restaurants opened in fiscal  excluding regional restaurant central kitchen expenditures associated with the central kitchen located at the scottsdale  arizona restaurant of approximately  and pre opening costs  was approximately million 
the company s average cash investment for the three restaurants opened in fiscal year excluding land purchases was million 
the company s average cash investment for the eight restaurants opened in fiscal  excluding land purchases was million 
pre opening costs averaged approximately  for the eight restaurants opened in fiscal year the cash investment to open a new restaurant typically includes the purchase or installation of furniture  fixtures  equipment and leasehold improvements  and in the case of an owned site  the purchase of land and a building 
in addition to budgeted capital expenditures for fiscal of million for new restaurant openings  the company has budgeted million in expenditures for fiscal for capital improvements at existing sites 
the company will need to rely on funds generated from revenues to finance a portion of the expansion currently planned for fiscal  as well as any expansion taking place after fiscal should the company s results of operations or its rate of growth fail to be adequate to finance expansion or should costs or capital expenditures rise  the company may not have the ability to open new restaurants at its desired pace or at all  and could be required to seek additional financing in the future 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to raise such capital when needed on satisfactory terms or at all 
impact of inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting the company s operations include food and beverage and labor costs 
the company does not believe that inflation has materially affected earnings during the past three years 
substantial increases in costs and expenses  particularly food  supplies  labor and operating expenses  could have a significant impact on the company s operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed along to guests 
business risks the company s business is subject to a number of risks 
a comprehensive summary of such risks can be found in the company s form s registration statement which was declared effective on may  certain operating results and consideration 
in fiscal  and  respectively  the company experienced an increase of  an increase of  and an increase of  respectively in comparable restaurant sales 
the company s newer restaurants have not historically experienced significant increases in guest volume following their initial opening period 
in addition  the company does not believe it has significant latitude to achieve comparable restaurant sales growth through price increases 
as a result  the company does not believe that the comparable restaurant sales growth in fiscal is indicative of future trends in comparable restaurant sales 
the company believes that it may from time to time in the future experience declines in comparable restaurant sales  and that any future increases in comparable restaurant sales would be modest 
expansion risks future restaurant financing capital needs 
the company opened three restaurants in fiscal and has opened eight in fiscal  and currently intends to open eight restaurants in fiscal the company s ability to achieve its expansion plans will depend on a variety of factors  many of which may be beyond the company s control  including the company s ability to locate suitable restaurant sites  negotiate acceptable leases or purchase terms  obtain required governmental approvals and construct new restaurants in a timely manner  attract  train and retain qualified and experienced personnel and management  operate its restaurants profitably and obtain additional capital  as well as general economic conditions and the degree of competition in the particular region of expansion 
the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  delays in restaurant openings from time to time 
the company incurs substantial costs in opening a new restaurant and  in the company s experience  new restaurants experience fluctuating operational levels for some time after opening 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully expand into new regions or that the company s existing or new restaurants will be profitable 
the company has encountered intense competition for restaurant sites  and in many cases has had difficulty buying or leasing desirable sites on terms that are acceptable to the company 
in many cases  the company s competitors are willing and able to pay more than the company for sites 
the company expects these difficulties in obtaining desirable sites to continue for the foreseeable future 
cost sensitivity 
the company s profitability is highly sensitive to increases in food  labor and other operating costs 
the company s dependence on frequent deliveries of fresh produce and groceries subjects it to the risk that shortages or interruptions in supply caused by adverse weather or other conditions could materially adversely affect the availability  quality and cost of ingredients 
in addition  unfavorable trends or developments concerning factors such as inflation  food  labor and employee benefit costs including increases in hourly wage and minimum unemployment tax rates  rent increases resulting from the rent escalation provisions in the company s leases  and the availability of experienced management and hourly employees may also adversely affect the company 
the company believes recent relatively favorable inflation rates and part time labor supplies in its principal market area have contributed to relatively stable food and labor costs in recent years 
however  there can be no assurance that these conditions will continue or that the company will have the ability to control costs in the future 
importance of key employees 
the company is heavily dependent upon the services of its officers and key management personnel involved in restaurant operations  purchasing  expansion and administration 
in particular  the company is dependent upon the management and leadership of its three executive officers  michael mack  dave qualls and greg keller 
the loss of any of these three individuals could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and its financial results of operations 
the success of the company and its individual restaurants depends upon the company s ability to attract and retain highly motivated  well qualified restaurant operations and other management personnel 
the company faces significant competition in the recruitment of qualified employees 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations 
the company s business experiences seasonal fluctuations as a disproportionate amount of the company s net income is generally realized in the second  third and fourth fiscal quarters due to higher average sales and lower average costs 
quarterly results have been and are expected to continue to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including the timing of new restaurant openings 
as a result of these factors  net sales and net income on a quarterly basis may fluctuate and are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
geographic concentration in california  restaurant base 
twenty nine of the company s existing restaurants are located in california 
accordingly  the company is susceptible to fluctuations in its business caused by adverse economic or other conditions in this region  including natural disasters or other acts of god could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company s significant investment in  and long term commitment to  each of its restaurant sites limits its ability to respond quickly or effectively to changes in local competitive conditions or other changes that could affect the company s operations 
in addition  the company has a small number of restaurants relative to some of its competitors 
consequently  a decline in the profitability of an existing restaurant or the introduction of an unsuccessful new restaurant could have a more significant effect on the company s result of operations than would be the case in a company with a larger number of restaurants 
volatility of stock price 
the market price of the company s common stock has fluctuated since the initial public offering of the common stock in may quarterly operating results of the company and other restaurant companies  changes in general conditions in the economy  the financial markets or the restaurant industry  natural disasters or other developments affecting the company or its competitors could cause the market price of the common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  in recent years the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
this volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies
