item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial overview regent recorded a net loss of million or per share for the year ended december  compared to net income of  or 
per share for the year ended december  the loss in was primarily the result of an increase in the provision for loan losses of million that was attributable to delinquent automobile insurance premium finance ipf loans to individuals 
in addition  other expenses were million higher in than in an improvement in net interest income of million partially offset the increase in the provision for loan losses and in other expenses 
the increases in other expenses and net interest income were primarily attributable to the ipf loan program 
at december  and  a substantial portion of the bank s consumer loans  million and million net of  and  of unearned interest  respectively  consisted of ipf loans 
the loans have repayment terms of nine months and are secured by the unearned premium balance on the individual automobile insurance policies 
the ipf loans are serviced for the bank by an independently owned and operated servicing company the servicer under a processing  servicing  marketing and consulting agreement the agreement 
the agreement provides  among other things  that the servicer is to solicit ipf loans  maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations and process and service the ipf loans including the collection of repayments from borrowers and of unearned premium balances from insurers on canceled insurance policies 
under the agreement  the bank receives all collections and pays the servicer a fee equal to a specified initial per loan charge plus one half of pre tax profits  as defined in the agreement  from the ipf loan portfolio 
for the years ended december  and  the bank recorded interest and fee income from the ipf loan portfolio of million and  respectively  and paid the servicer fees of million and  respectively 
during the preparation of regent s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   management of the bank became aware of several matters which caused management of the bank to believe that the servicer may have reported interest and fee income from ipf loans in default and may not have cancelled insurance policies securing defaulted loans or collected insurance premium balances on such policies on a timely basis 
as a result  management began the process of estimating the ultimate expected loss that existed as of december   which amount is material to the consolidated financial statements 
in order to assess the risk of loss on the ipf loan balance at december  and the amount thereof  the bank identified delinquent ipf loans based upon the payment history of the ipf loan portfolio during and the first quarter of these delinquent ipf loans totaled approximately million net of unearned interest as of december  the bank has applied all cash receipts from ipf borrowers and related insurers during the period january  to may   to the principal balances of such delinquent loans  thereby reducing the bank s possible loss exposure on the december  ipf loan balance to approximately million  which was recorded as part of the bank s provision for loan losses for the year ended december  the bank believes that this loss exposure will be substantially reduced by additional cash receipts to be collected from the borrowers and insurance companies during the servicer has agreed that a portion of the losses incurred by the bank on the ipf loan balance at december  will be borne by the servicer 
accordingly in  the servicer has executed a promissory note payable to the bank in the amount of million  secured by commercial real estate  receivables  and personal assets and guarantees of the principals of the servicer 
in determining the million charge to earnings and the resulting specific allocation to the allowance for loan loss reserve  no credit has been taken for any future collection of the million of return premiums due from insurance companies and other credit sources 
this conservative approach has been taken even though approximately million has been collected from january  to may  of the total gross receivables in the approximate amount of million outstanding as of december  and notwithstanding the million note from the servicer or the personal guarantees of its principals 
collections and credits continue on a daily basis as a result of increased collections efforts 
although it is possible that a change in estimated losses on the ipf portfolio will occur and that the bank s actual losses on the ipf portfolio at december  may differ from the estimated loss exposure of million  management believes that the likelihood of a loss by the bank on the ipf loan portfolio in excess of the estimated loss is remote and that collection efforts and the million note will reduce the amount of actual loss associated with ipf loans 
total assets at december  were million which were million higher than total assets at december  of million 
the increase was comprised primarily of growth in lending volume as total loans held for the portfolio and loans held for sale at december  were above december  total loans held for the portfolio and loans held for sale by million 
the rise in loans was attributable to higher commercial activity and ipf loans 
a continuing emphasis has been placed on loan growth by reinvesting the cash flow from the mortgage backed securities portfolio into the commercial and installment programs 
the mortgage backed securities portfolio decreased by million from december  to december  the principal funding source for asset growth in was deposit activity  partcularly certificates of deposit 
total deposits at december  were million higher than at december  and the increase was comprised of higher certificates of deposit of million which offset a decrease in savings balances of million 
the higher certificates of deposit balances also enabled regent to reduce its advances from the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh fhlb by million from year end to year end regent recorded net income of  or 
per share  in compared to the net income of million  or 
per share  earned in in  the bank introduced a new lending program directed to the mortgage banking industry 
as an alternative to a warehouse credit line  the bank participates in the funding of individual residential mortgage loans originated by mortgage bankers 
during late  two of the mortgage banking companies involved in this program experienced financial difficulties and subsequently filed for bankruptcy protection 
at or about the same time  the bank learned that irregularities occurred in the origination process at the mortgage banking companies which negatively impacted the underlying real estate collateral of certain loans that had been funded 
as a result of these conditions  the bank recorded charges totaling million on a pre tax basis per common share in the fourth quarter  which included an additional provision for loan losses of  management of the bank is aggressively pursuing the recovery of a substantial portion of these charges through insurance claims and other courses of action 
such recoveries  if realized  will be recorded in future periods when received 
offsetting the effects of this non recurring incident was an increase in net interest income of  which resulted from a higher level of average earning assets 
the results of operations and per share information is summarized in the following table net interest income    provision for loan losses    other income    other expenses    pre tax loss income    benefit provision for income taxes    net loss income    loss earnings per share primary 

financial condition capital adequacy economic conditions and the regulatory environment have placed an increasing emphasis on the capital strength of financial institutions 
capital strength is a primary determinant in a financial institution s ability to grow  make acquisitions and protect against any unforeseen loss or adverse economic condition 
an evaluation of capital strength assesses how an institution s inherent risks impact its ongoing financial net worth and focuses particularly on asset quality  interest rate sensitivity  earnings and liquidity 
total shareholders equity at december  was million or million lower than shareholders equity of million at december  the decline was a result of the net loss of million and a decrease in the net unrealized loss on securities available for sale of million 
no cash dividends were paid in or as it is management s intention to retain its earnings for the foreseeable future in order to maintain its capital strength and allow for growth 
capital adequacy standards adopted by federal banking regulators make capital more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking organizations and consider off balance sheet exposures in determining capital adequacy 
various levels of risk are assigned to different categories of assets and off balance sheet activities 
these standards define capital as tier i and tier ii capital 
all banks are required to have tier i capital of at least of risk weighted assets and total capital of at least of risk weighted assets 
tier i core capital consists of common shareholders equity  non cumulative preferred stock  and retained earnings and excludes the effects of unrealized gains or losses on securities available for sale 
tier ii or total capital includes tier i capital  cumulative preferred stock  qualifying subordinated debt  and the allowance for possible loan losses of up to a maximum of of total risk weighted assets 
the following table presents the components of regent s assets and tier i and ii capital ratios at december  and tier i capital   tier ii allowance for possible loan losses   qualifying subordinated debt   total tier ii capital   total risk adjusted assets   tier i ratio tier ii ratio in addition to the risk based requirements  regulations have been adopted that establish a minimum leverage capital ratio of of tier i capital to total assets 
the level applies to only those banks that are given the highest composite rating under the regulators rating system while all other banks are expected to have plus an additional cushion of at least to basis points 
at december  and  regent s leverage ratio was and  respectively 
additionally  the bank s tier i leverage capital ratio approximated at december  and at april  which is below the discretionary ratio established by the occ for the bank 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
asset and liability management asset and liability management is the process of maximizing net interest income within the constraints of maintaining acceptable levels of liquidity  interest rate risk and capital 
to achieve this objective  policies and procedures have been implemented that utilize a combination of selected investments and funding sources with various maturity structures 
liquidity liquidity represents the ability to generate funds at reasonable rates to meet potential cash outflows from deposit customers who need to withdraw funds or borrowers who need available credit 
the primary source of the bank s liquidity has been the bank s ability to generate deposits 
supplementing the deposit base  liquidity is available from the investment portfolio  which consists primarily of mortgage backed securities issued by us government agencies and corporations 
these securities enhance liquidity not only by their marketability  but they also provide monthly principal and interest payments 
the liquidity position is also strengthened by the establishment of credit facilities with other banks and the fhlb 
investment securities are required to be pledged as collateral for transactions executed under these facilities and provide for an availability of funds on an overnight basis 
the fhlb also provides for borrowings on a fixed or floating rate basis with specified maturities up to years at costs that would be less expensive than through the bank s deposit generation process 
investment portfolio the investment portfolio  consisting principally of mortgage backed securities  is coordinated with the liquidity and interest rate sensitivity position of the bank 
with an emphasis on minimizing credit  capital and market risk  the investment portfolio is considered an extension of loans with the objectives of enhancing liquidity and earning a fair return 
the investments in mortgage backed securities consist of a combination of adjustable and fixed rate securities with an emphasis on investments with relatively short weighted average lives 
of the total mortgage backed portfolio with an amortized cost of million at december   million were adjustable rate and million were fixed rate 
the estimated weighted average life for the mortgage backed securities portfolio at december  approximated years 
interest rate sensitivity interest rate sensitivity is closely related to liquidity since each is directly affected by the maturity of assets and liabilities 
interest rate sensitivity also deals with exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and its effect on net interest income 
it is management s objective to maintain stability in the growth of net interest income by appropriately mixing interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
one tool used by management to gauge interest rate sensitivity is a gap analysis which categorizes assets and liabilities on the basis of maturity date  the date of next repricing and the applicable amortization schedule 
this analysis summarizes the matching or mismatching of rate sensitive assets versus rate sensitive liabilities according to specified time periods  and provides management with an indication of how interest income will be impacted by changing rate scenarios 
for example  an institution with more interest sensitive assets than liabilities is said to have a positive gap 
in this example  as interest rates rise  the greater volume of assets should reprice more rapidly than the liabilities 
the net result should be an increase in the net interest margin 
conversely  in a declining rate environment the net interest margin should decline 
if the institution has a greater volume of interest sensitive liabilities than assets  it is said to have a negative gap 
in this event  increased interest rates would cause the greater volume of liabilities to reprice more rapidly than assets 
the net result should be a decline in the net interest margin 
conversely  in a declining rate environment the net interest margin should increase 
in addition to the gap analysis  computer simulations are used to evaluate the impact of a change in interest rates on liquidity  interest rate spreads margins and operating results 
the simulation model is a more effective tool than a gap analysis since the simulation analysis can more accurately reflect the impact of rising and declining rates on each type of interest earning asset and interest bearing liability 
the simulation is particularly more beneficial as it can better evaluate the effects of prepayment speeds on the bank s portfolio of mortgage backed securities and what impact that would have on the bank s liquidity and profitability 
using the result of the simulation analysis  the bank strives to control its interest rate risk exposure so that net interest income does not fluctuate by more than assuming that interest rates increase or decrease by basis points 
the blending of fixed and floating rate loans and investments to match the repricing and maturity characteristics of the various funding sources is a continuous process in an attempt to minimize fluctuations in net interest income 
an effective tool used by the bank in this process has been the availability and flexibility of the various fhlb advance programs  which enable the bank to lock in spreads when appropriate and provide an effective method of matching fixed rate assets with a fixed rate funding source 
the bank s objective is to structure its balance sheet  as outlined in the following interest sensitivity table  to minimize any significant fluctuation in net interest income 
the distribution in the table is based on a combination of maturities  repricing frequencies and prepayment patterns 
floating rate assets and liabilities are distributed based on the repricing frequency of the instrument while fixed rate instruments are based on maturities 
mortgage backed securities are distributed in accordance with their repricing frequency and estimated prepayment speeds 
deposit liabilities are distributed according to repricing opportunities for now and money market accounts  maturities for certificates of deposit and savings deposits reflect the earliest period in which balances can be withdrawn 
as the table shows  the bank has a cumulative negative gap for all time periods 
this indicates that future liquidity  interest rate margins and operating results should be positively impacted in a falling rate environment and negatively impacted in a rising rate environment

gross unrealized gains and losses on mortgage backed securities held to maturity at december  were  and  respectively and gross unrealized gains and losses on mortgage backed securities available for sale at december  were  and  respectively 
there were no sales of mortgage backed securities during or unrealized losses on the securities generally are the result of lower than market interest rates on the underlying mortgages contained in the securities 
at december   the contractual maturity of substantially all of the bank s mortgage backed securities was in excess of ten years 
the actual maturity of a mortgage backed security is less than its stated maturity due to prepayments of the underlying mortgages 
prepayments that are different than anticipated will affect the yield to maturity 
the yield is based upon the interest income and the amortization of any premium or discount related to the mortgage backed security 
in accordance with gaap  premiums and discounts are amortized over the estimated lives of the loans  which decrease and increase interest income  respectively 
the prepayment assumptions used to determine the amortization period for premiums and discounts can significantly affect the yield of the mortgage backed security  and these assumptions are reviewed periodically to reflect actual prepayments 
although prepayments of underlying mortgages depend on many factors  including the type of mortgages  the coupon rate  the age of mortgages  the geographical location of the underlying real estate collateralizing the mortgages and general levels of market interest rates  the difference between the interest rates on the underlying mortgages and the prevailing mortgage interest rates generally is the most significant determinant of the rate of prepayments 
during periods of falling mortgage interest rates  if the coupon rate of the underlying mortgages exceeds the prevailing market interest rates offered for mortgage loans  refinancing generally increases and accelerates the prepayment of the underlying mortgages and the related security 
under such circumstances  the bank may be subject to reinvestment risk because to the extent that the bank s mortgage backed securities amortize or prepay faster than anticipated  the bank may not be able to reinvest the proceeds of such repayments and prepayments at a comparable rate 
mortgage backed securities generally increase the quality of the bank s assets by virtue of the insurance or guarantees that back them  are more liquid than individual mortgage loans and may be used to collateralize borrowings or other obligations of the bank 
lending total loans  consisting of loans held for the portfolio and mortgage loans held for sale  amounted to million at december  compared to million at december  and million at december  the increases of and in outstanding year end and loan balances  respectively  resulted primarily from higher commercial and industrial and commercial real estate balances  and ipf loans 
the mix of the loans held for the portfolio has shifted and the portfolio became more diversified in commercial and industrial and real estate loans comprised and  respectively  of the total loans held for the portfolio at december  compared to commercial and industrial amounting to and real estate loans of total loans held for the portfolio at year end this shift reflects primarily the expansion of the commercial and industrial segments  the growth of the insurance premium finance balances  and a reduction in the residential mortgage portfolio 
the residential mortgage portfolio decreased as a result of transferring approximately million to mortgage loans held for sale 
the mortgages transferred represented those mortgages which had been originated through the mortgage participation program and had been retained in the portfolio at the end of as a result of the bankruptcy of the two mortgage banking companies 
the underlying collateral for real estate loans is primarily located in the bank s market area and a significant portion is secured by residential property 
the following table details the types of loans outstanding at december for each of the past five years commercial industrial      real estate construction      mortgage residential      mortgage commercial      consumer      mortgage loans held for sale    real estate loans are secured primarily by first mortgages on commercial property in which the loan to value ratio is or less and residential properties with a loan to value ratio of or less 
consumer loans are collateralized primarily by unearned automobile insurance premiums 
to meet its asset liability objectives and to control its interest rate sensitivity exposure  the bank s strategy is to originate loans with floating rates and with maturities less than five years

loans are underwritten to match lease terms  and large tenants are subject to credit review 
the bank monitors such loans quarterly or annually with updated inspections  lease analysis and financial analysis 
consumer loans consumer loans consist primarily of loans to individuals to finance automobile insurance premiums on the insurance policies 
ipf loans have repayment terms of nine months and are secured by the insurance policy s unearned premiums 
risk factors include economic risk which may affect the borrower s ability to maintain a job and financial stability  the financial strength and stability of the insurance company underwriting the insurance and insurance agents that originate the loans  the effectiveness of the internal control structure to cancel the insurance on delinquent accounts in a timely and effective manner  collection efforts in obtaining the cancelled policy s unearned premiums from the insurance company  and legal risk in properly documenting and perfecting the collateral 
the level of non performing assets  consisting of non accrual loans  accruing loans past due days or more  and other real estate owned  amounted to million or  of total assets at december  compared to million or of total assets at december  the increase in non performing assets in was attributable to higher amounts of loans past due days or more as the level of non accruing loans at year end of million was comparable to non accruing loan balances at december  the rise in day or more delinquent loans was primarily related to past due ipf loans 
given the limitation of the servicer s records associated with ipf loans  the bank was unable to obtain an accurate aging of such loans 
in connection with the bank s determination of the loss exposure on ipf loans see note to the consolidated financial statements  the bank determined that delinquent ipf loans approximated million and the loss exposure was estimated at million 
accordingly  for purposes of determining the amount of non performing ipf loans  the bank included the loss exposure amount of million in accruing loans days or more past due 
although the allowance for loan losses includes a specific reserve of million for these delinquent ipf loans  management believes that concerted efforts recently initiated to collect unearned premiums on the cancelled policies from the insurance companies and the secured promissory note of million obtained from the servicer of the ipf loans to protect the bank from loss on the ipf loans will substantially reduce the amount of actual loss associated with the ipf loans

under the new standard  the allowance for credit losses related to loans that are impaired as defined by sfas no

 is evaluated based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  at the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans 
commercial  industrial  and mortgage loans are evaluated on an individual basis 
consumer loans are comprised primarily of ipf loans 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
prior to  the allowance for credit losses related to these loans was evaluated based on undiscounted cash flows or the fair value of the collateral for collateral dependent loans 
factors influencing management s recognition of impairment include decline in collateral value  lack of performance under contract loan agreement terms  including evaluation of late payments or non payment  lack of performance under other creditor s agreements or obligations ie non payment of taxes  non payment of loans to other creditors  financial decline significantly different from status at loan inception  litigation or bankruptcy of borrower  significant change in ownership or loss of guarantors to the detriment of credit quality 
loans aggregated for evaluation under sfas no 
and sfas no 
are those loans risk rated by the bank as special mention  substandard and doubtful  as well as any troubled debt restructuring which may not be so risk rated 
as noted above  as of december   there are no restructured loans 
at december   the recorded investment in loans that are considered to be impaired as defined by sfas no 
and sfas no 
was million  of which million were non accrual loans and million were delinquent ipf loans 
the related allowance for credit losses for these impaired loans is million 
for approximately million of impaired loans  the reserve evaluation was based on the expected future cash flows and the remaining million was based on the fair value of the collateral 
as part of the quarterly review of the risk elements of the portfolio  an evaluation is also made of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
in making an assessment of the quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management takes into consideration such elements as general economic conditions  industry trends  the volume of delinquencies  specific credit review  the value of underlying collateral and other pertinent information 
based on this evaluation  the allowance for loan losses is adjusted by the provision which is charged against income 
the following table summarizes the activity from through in the allowance for loan losses balance  beginning of year      charge offs commercial industrial      real estate construction   real estate commercial   real estate residential   installment  total charge offs      recoveries commercial industrial    real estate commercial   real estate residential  installment  total recoveries     net charge offs      provision charged to operations      balance  end of year      net charge offs as a of average loans and loans held for sale 




allowance for loan losses as a of year end loans and loans held for sale the allowance for loan losses increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase in the allowance resulted primarily from the additional provision associated with ipf loans 
additions to the allowance for loan losses in the years ended december  through december  were based upon  among other things  the amount of net charge offs  loan growth  and the level of non performing loans during each period 
management believes that those loans identified as non performing are adequately secured and the allowance for loan losses is sufficient in relation to the potential risk of loss that has been identified in the loan portfolio 
management believes the bank s concerted efforts to collect unearned premiums on the delinquent ipf loans from insurance companies and the secured promissory note of million obtained from the servicer of the ipf loans to secure the bank against loss on the ipf loans will substantially reduce the amount of actual loss that the bank will ultimately recognize 
management has allocated the allowance based on an assessment of risks within the loan portfolio and the estimated value of underlying collateral 
prior to  management generally did not allocate the loan loss reserve across the various loan categories 
in  in connection with the adoption of sfas and  management began formally allocating the reserve to specific loan categories 
the following table sets forth the allocation of the bank s allowance for loan losses for each of the five years ended december  of of of of loans to loans to loans to loans to amount total loans amount total loans amount total loans amount total loans commercial industrial  real estate construction  mortgages residential   mortgages commercial consumer  unallocated  n a  n a  n a  n a of loans to amount total loans commercial industrial real estate construction mortgages residential  mortgages commercial consumer unallocated  n a it is not expected that the level of net charge offs for real estate and commercial and industrial loans during the next full year will vary significantly from historical levels 
the amount of net charge offs associated with consumer loans will be dependent upon the success of collection efforts in reducing the delinquent ipf loans 
deposits total deposits at december  aggregated million  which was million higher than the december  balance of million 
this increase was attributable to higher certificate of deposit balances of million which offset the decline in statement savings balances of million 
as illustrated in the table below  the mix of deposits at december  has shifted to a greater reliance on certificates of deposit as a funding source 
of of of total total total demand    now    savings    money market    certificates of deposit    certificates of deposit of thousand or more at december  of million had the following maturities three months or less  three months through six months  six months through twelve months  over twelve months  short term borrowings short term borrowings are used to supplement the deposit base of the bank  to support asset growth  to fund specific loan programs  and as a tool in the bank s asset liability management process 
during  and  the bank utilized its credit facilities with its correspondent banks and with the fhlb 
the borrowings under these facilities are secured by the bank s mortgage backed securities

per share for the loss in resulted from a higher provision for loan losses of million  due principally to delinquent ipf loans  and an increase in other expenses of million which more than offset an increase in net interest income of million 
the bank anticipates that it will recover a substantial majority of the ipf loans for which the specific loan loss provision of million was made in net income for amounted to thousand or 
per share compared to million or 
per share in the decrease in profitability resulted from a higher provision for loan losses of thousand and higher other expenses of million  but benefited from an increase in net interest income of thousand 
net interest income a key component of regent s profitability is net interest income which represents the difference between interest earned on loans  securities and other interest earning assets and the interest paid on deposits  borrowings and debt instruments 
net interest income is coordinated with the asset liability management process and emphasizes maintaining acceptable levels of liquidity  interest rate risk  and capital 
net interest income for the year ended december  totaled million which was million higher than net interest income for the comparable period of million 
the increase was attributable to an improved net interest margin which offset a decline in the amount of average interest earnings assets from million in to million in the net interest margin rose to in from in and benefited from the yields on earning assets rising faster than the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
the yields on earnings assets of in compared to in were higher primarily as a result of the significant yield on the bank s ipf loan portfolio which exceeds the yield on the bank s other lending activity 
the average ipf loan balance in was million compared to thousand in however  management believes that the yields on ipf loans are higher  due in part  to the reporting by the servicer of interest and fees on defaulted ipf loans 
this income on defaulted loans is not readily determinable but is included in the ipf loan balance and  therefore  has been considered in the provision for loan losses 
the yields on earning assets in also benefitted from lower amortization of securities portfolio premiums  the higher prime lending rate that prevailed in  and the reinvestment of the cash flow from the mortgage backed securities portfolio into higher yielding lending activity 
as a result of this reinvestment  a greater percentage of interest income was derived from higher yielding lending activity in versus for the year ended december   interest and fees on loans represented of total interest income compared to for the same period while investment income decreased from in to in the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased to in from in and reflected a shift in funding sources from savings balances to higher costing certificates of deposit 
average certificate of deposit balances represented of s total average interest bearing liabilities with an average rate paid of versus a cost of in on balances which comprised of total average interest bearing liabilities 
the cost of interest bearing liabilities was also impacted by the higher rates paid on short term fhlb advances which rose to an average rate in of from in net interest income of million in was thousand  or  higher than net interest income in of million 
the increase was attributable to higher average balances in the investment securities and lending portfolios  which offset a drop in yield on earning assets
