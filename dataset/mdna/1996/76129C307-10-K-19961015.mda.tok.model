management s objective is to acquire only those facilities it believes will be able to generate sufficient revenue to pay all operating costs  management fees  lease payments or debt service  and still return a to cash flow 
management believes that the company s cash flow from operations  together with lines of credit and the sale of securities described below  will be sufficient to meet the company s liquidity needs for the current year 
the company maintains various lines of credit with interest rates ranging from prime plus 
to prime plus 
at june   the company had approximately  in unused credit available under such lines 
subsequent to year end  the company raised approximately  in net proceeds from the sale of convertible preferred stock in a private offering to foreign investors 
the proceeds of this offering are being used for working capital purposes 
on september   the company purchased a majority of the stock of contour medical  inc in exchange for shares of the company s common stock and preferred stock 
the company is obligated to redeem the preferred stock issued in the transaction over the five years for  in cash 
 was paid on september  pursuant to this obligation 
management intends to fund these redemptions from cash flow generated from operations 
the company believes that its long term liquidity needs will generally be met by income from operations 
if necessary  the company believes that it can obtain an extension of its current line of credit and or other lines of credit from commercial sources 
except as described above  the company is not aware of any trends  demands  commitments or understandings that would impact its liquidity 
the company intends to use long term debt financing in connection with the purchase of additional retirement care facilities and nursing homes on terms which can be paid out of the cash flow generated by the property 
the company intends to continue to lease or purchase additional retirement care and or nursing home facilities in the future 
impact of inflation and pending federal health care legislation management does not expect inflation to have a material impact on the company s revenues or income in the foreseeable future so long as inflation remains below the level 
the company s business is labor intensive and wages and other labor costs are sensitive to inflation 
management believes that any increases in labor costs in its management services segment can be offset over the long term by increasing the management fees 
with respect to the operations segment  approximately of the company s net patient service revenue is received from state medicaid programs 
the two states which make medicaid payments to the company have inflation factors built into the rates which they will pay 
georgia s inflation factor is nine percent and tennessee s inflation is eleven percent 
therefore  increases in operating costs due to inflation should be covered by increased medicaid reimbursements 
management is uncertain what the final impact will be of pending federal health care reform packages since the legislation has not been finalized 
however  based on information which has been released to the public thus far  management doesn t believe that there will be cuts in reimbursements paid to nursing homes 
legislative and regulatory action  at the state and federal level  has resulted in continuing changes in the medicare and medicaid reimbursement programs 
the changes have limited payment increases under these programs 
also  the timing of payments made under the medicare and medicaid programs are subject to regulatory action and governmental budgetary constraints 
within the statutory framework of the medicare and medicaid programs  there are substantial areas subject to administrative rulings and interpretations which may further affect payments made under these programs 
further  the federal and state governments may reduce the funds available under those programs in the future or require more stringent utilization and quality review of health care facilities

the company has adopted this standard in fiscal in management s opinion  adopting sfas no 
did not materially affect the company s financial statements for the year ended june
