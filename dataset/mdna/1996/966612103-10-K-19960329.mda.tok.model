also contributing to this decrease was the shift in the asset mix from investments to loans  because loans are generally assigned a risk weighting higher than investment securities in the capital ratio calculations 
the company s regulatory capital ratios are shown above compared to the minimums that are currently required to be eligible for regulatory classification as a well capitalized institution 
the regulatory capital ratios for the banks were also in excess of minimum requirements at december  regulatory agencies will assess an institution s exposure to interest rate risk as part of their overall procedures performed to evaluate an institution s capital adequacy 
these agencies have also proposed rules to incorporate a measure of interest rate risk into an institution s required level of regulatory capital 
management believes that implementation of these procedures and proposed rules will not have a significant impact on the company s or the banks regulatory capital requirements

a combination of factors contributed to this increase  the components of which are detailed in the following tables analyzing changes in interest income and expense 
taxable equivalent loan interest income increased million or in as compared to approximately of this increase was driven by the growth in average loans outstanding during  with the remaining portion driven by the rise in the effective yield of the company s loan portfolio 
market interest rates generally rose throughout and then moderated during  and weighted average bank prime rates were approximately percentage points higher in compared to the effective yield on the company s loan portfolio  approximately of which reprices with changes in prime  increased of a percentage point over this same period 
in  taxable equivalent interest income on investment securities decreased million or from the previous year 
this decrease is consistent with the reduction in the average investment in securities outstanding between and of million 
because of its maturity structure  the effective yield on the company s investment securities portfolio is not as immediately responsive to rising or falling market rates as are its loan yields 
the effective portfolio yield was in or an increase of basis points over the effective yield of in the net increase in total taxable equivalent interest income between and was million or 
the overall effective earning asset yield in was  an increase of basis points from in interest expense increased approximately million or in as compared to the increase in interest expense came despite a million decrease in average interest bearing liabilities outstanding between these periods 
the increase reflects the impact of rising rates during  the rate structures of the markets in which the company has made recent acquisitions  and a shift in the deposit mix toward time deposits  a shift which is also partly attributable to recent acquisitions 
the overall cost of funds rate on interest bearing liabilities was in as compared to in  an increase of basis points 
other income and expense non interest income  adjusted to exclude securities gains and net gains from oreo sales  increased million or to million in from million in this followed an increase of million or from to income from service charges on deposits accounts  which accounted for more than half of adjusted non interest income in both and  decreased sightly  largely as a result of increases in the earnings credit rate applied to business account balances that accompanied the generally higher average interest rates experienced in the decrease in business account charges was partly offset by an increase in personal account service charge income which was largely attributable to the addition of the alabama operations in fee income from credit card related operations increased in compared to  while income from services which support the international activities of the company s customers increased 
these increases reflect both economic conditions as well as the successful marketing of existing and new banking products and services 
increased fees from trust investment management services  reflecting in part the strong performance of the financial markets in  supported an overall increase of in trust services income over the loss of several correspondent bank relationships to industry consolidation and the moderation of market interest rates in both led to a lessened demand for the services of the company s investment department and income from these services decreased from s level

excluding personnel related expenses  the alabama bank acquisition in added approximately million to non interest operating expenses  with the largest impact on the amortization of intangible assets  marketing expense  and the expense of bank premises and furnishings and equipment 
continued enhancements to the company s data processing systems and automation capabilities in as well as further expansion of its atm network also contributed to the increase over in the expense for furnishings and equipment 
credit card operating expenses for grew at a rate consistent with the growth in income from these operations as discussed above 
taxes and insurance expense increased in almost entirely as a consequence of the addition of the company s earnings and increased equity to the assessment base used to compute certain state ad valorem taxes 
the increase in legal and other professional services for relates mainly to data processing consulting services on important system upgrades 
a significant decrease in the premium rate schedule for fdic deposit insurance  which was effective for the third quarter of  is directly responsible for the million or reduction in the company s annual deposit insurance expense as compared to the added expense from amortizing intangible assets acquired in and was more offset in by a million decrease in the amortization of intangibles from earlier acquisitions resulting in a net decrease of million in this expense category

accounting changes effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 which addresses the accounting by creditors for impairment of certain loans 
the company s reserve for possible loan losses at december  includes a measure of impairment related to those loans identified for evaluation under the new standard 
this measurement is based on a comparison of the recorded investment in each impaired loan with either the expected cash flows discounted using the loan s original effective interest rate or  in the case of certain collateral dependent loans  the fair value of the underlying collateral 
adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
asset liability management the asset liability management process has as its focus the development and implementation of strategies in the funding and deployment of the company s financial resources which are expected to maximize soundness and profitability over time 
these strategies reflect the goals set by the company for capital adequacy  liquidity  and the acceptable level of risk established in company policies 
interest rate risk interest rate sensitivity the company s financial assets and liabilities are subject to scheduled and unscheduled repricing opportunities over time 
both the company s potential for generating net interest income and the current market values of its financial assets and liabilities depend in part upon the prevailing levels of market interest rates when these repricing opportunities arise 
interest rate risk is a measure of this potential change in earnings ability and market values 
page of as part of the asset liability management process the company uses a variety of tools  including an earnings simulation model  to measure interest rate risk and to evaluate the impact of possible changes in rates on its internal strategies 
the interest rate sensitivity gap analysis  shown in the accompanying table  compares the volume of repricing assets against repricing liabilities over time 
this analysis is a relatively simple tool which is useful mainly in highlighting significant short term repricing volume mismatches 
the table presents the rate sensitivity gap analysis at december  the interest rates on a substantial portion of the outstanding commercial loans vary with changes in the banks prime lending rates or the prime rates of certain money center banks 
these loans are assigned to the earliest repricing period in the rate sensitivity analysis 
a sizable portion of loans shown in the analysis as repricing after one year is made up of fixed rate real estate loans 
in preparing this analysis  deposit funding sources with no scheduled maturity or contractual repricing date are assigned to a particular repricing period after consideration of past and expected customer behavior in response to general market rate changes 
in the twelve month period from december   the analysis indicates that the company is in a slightly liability sensitive position on a cumulative basis

traditionally these liquidity needs have been met by maintaining a strong base of core deposits and by carefully managing the maturity structure of the investment portfolios 
the funds provided by current operations and forecasts of loan repayments are also considered in the liquidity management process 
the banks enter into short term borrowing arrangements by purchasing federal funds and selling securities under repurchase agreements  both as a source of funding for certain short term lending facilities and as part of their services to correspondent banks and certain other customers 
neither the company nor the banks have accessed long term debt markets as part of liquidity management

as of december   approximately million or of the portfolio of investment securities held to maturity was scheduled to mature within one year 
an additional million of investment securities was classified as available for sale at the end of  although management s determination of this classification does not derive primarily from liquidity considerations 
the banks had approximately million in unfunded loan commitments outstanding at december   an increase of million from the level at december  contingent obligations under letters of credit and financial guarantees increased moderately between these dates to a total of million at december  available credit card lines were million at december   slightly above the level at year end draws under these financial commitments should not place any unusual strain on the company s liquidity position
