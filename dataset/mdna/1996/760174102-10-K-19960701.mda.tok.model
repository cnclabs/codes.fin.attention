the company has established a retailer financing program whereby the company will provide  on a selective basis  financing to video retailers who the company believes have the potential for substantial growth in the industry 
in connection with these financings  the company typically makes a loan to and or an equity investment in the retailer 
in some cases  a warrant to purchase stock may be obtained 
as part of such financing  the retailer typically agrees to cause all of its current and future retail locations to participate in the ppt system for a designated period of time 
under these agreements  retailers are typically required to obtain all of their requirements of cassettes offered under the ppt system or obtain a minimum amount of cassettes based on a percentage of the retailer s revenues 
notwithstanding the long term nature of such agreements  both the company and the retailer may  in some cases  retain the right to terminate such agreement upon days prior written notice

pro image is currently operating with minimal cash and has developed a new business plan which incorporates certain store closures  staff reductions  and other measures

see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  certain guarantees previously made to blowout 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
and any funding covered by the financing guarantee discussed above 
the company believes it will be able to fulfill these obligations and does not believe that the issues faced by pro image and blowout will have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s sources of liquidity include its cash balance  cash generated from operations and its available credit facilities assuming such facilities are extended or new ones obtained 
although its operations generated negative cash flow during fiscal and substantial losses from discontinued operations  the sources of liquidity referred to above  along with the flexibility that the company has in adjusting operating levels  are expected to be sufficient to fund the company s operations for the year ending march
