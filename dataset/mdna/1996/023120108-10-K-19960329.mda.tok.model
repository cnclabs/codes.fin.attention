item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary amax gold reported a net loss of million in  a year of transition from mines in the later stages of their producing lives toward three new  major low cost projects 
the company s primary focus in was financing and constructing the refugio and fort knox mines and negotiating the acquisition of the kubaka project from cyprus amax 
the addition of these properties should nearly triple amax gold s annual production over the next two years 
approximately million borrowed in was used to repay existing debt and to fund over million of capital expenditures 
the first gold pour at refugio is expected in early while the fort knox project is anticipated to commence production around the beginning of in october the company announced that it would acquire  subject to certain conditions  cyprus amax s percent interest in omolon gold mining company  which is developing the kubaka project in the russian federation 
the acquisition of kubaka will increase amax gold s reserves by approximately percent to million contained ounces of gold 
these three projects are expected to provide the company with a source of low cost reserves and allow for continued growth 
in the first quarter of  the company projected certain capital cost increases at the fort knox project which may exceed million 
final estimates are being developed 
as a result of these projected increases and other anticipated cash needs in  the company has renegotiated the fort knox loan agreement and entered into certain financing arrangements with cyprus amax 
in addition  final project estimates are being developed for the kubaka project  where higher capital costs are now estimated 
see liquidity and capital resources and note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the net loss of million compared to losses of million in and million in the loss attributable to common shares in was 
per share compared to a loss of 
per share  including dividends on the company s series b convertible preferred stock issued in august  and a loss of per share 
results in included a million after tax asset writedown  primarily for the hayden hill mill  partially offset by a million cumulative after tax benefit from a change in accounting for heap leach inventory and a million deferred tax benefit 
results in reflected an after tax asset write down of million for reductions in reserves at the hayden hill mine in california and the sleeper mine in nevada  a million after tax charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for exploration expenses and the adoption of a new accounting standard for postemployment benefits  and an after tax gain of million from the realization of the future economic benefit in the waihi mine in new zealand 
revenue improved to million in from million in and million in the increases are attributed to higher realized prices and gold sales 
amax gold s average realized price was per ounce in  per ounce in and per ounce in compared to average comex prices of in and and in the company sold  ounces of gold during compared to  ounces in and  ounces in the increased sales volumes resulted from increased production in both and at hayden hill and guanaco 
sleeper s gold production and sales declined in compared to as reserves neared depletion 
lower mill head grades and recovery rates are expected as mining is completed in early and residual leaching commences 
production at sleeper increased from to due to higher mill head grades and recovery rates 
gold production was  ounces in compared to  ounces in and  ounces in increases in production at hayden hill and guanaco were offset by a decline in production at wind mountain and sleeper  which is nearing the end of its mine life 
significant operating improvements were made in at both hayden hill and guanaco 
production at hayden hill increased by percent to  ounces in from  ounces in while guanaco s production increased percent to  ounces in compared to  in the processing of higher grade ores which increased from 
ounces per ton in to 
ounces per ton in at hayden hill and from 
ounces per ton in to 
ounces per ton in at guanaco contributed significantly to the increase in production 
improved crusher throughput at hayden hill and an increased recovery rate at guanaco also contributed 
the decline in production at sleeper was attributed to lower head grades and mill recovery rates 
the percent increase in production from to was primarily due to a full year of operations at guanaco in versus only nine months during  when the mine commenced production in april  as well as the successful conversion of hayden hill to a heap leach only operation during the latter part of amax gold expects production to increase significantly in both and as refugio  fort knox and kubaka are brought on line 
cost of sales represents mining and processing costs for gold sold during the year including labor  materials and supplies  repairs and maintenance  fuel and utilities  proceeds taxes  royalties and by product credits 
also included are estimated reclamation costs at each of the company s mines  which are accrued over the expected mine life using the units of production method 
reclamation costs are estimates based on current federal  state and chilean laws and regulations 
changes in these laws and regulations could increase future reclamation costs 
even with slight increases in sales volumes in each year  cost of sales declined to million during from million in and million in  primarily due to lower cash costs 
cash production costs declined to per ounce in from per ounce in and in cash costs at hayden hill were reduced from per ounce in to per ounce in  despite the negative impact of unusually high precipitation during the first part of  due to the use of existing ore stockpiles  higher silver credits resulting from the processing of ore with higher silver grades and reduced overhead spending 
mine management also implemented numerous operational efficiencies during  resulting in additional savings 
cash costs at guanaco declined from per ounce in to per ounce in despite lower crusher throughput 
performance at guanaco continues to be disappointing and management is evaluating additional cost saving opportunities and operational efficiencies which are expected to lower expenses further and increase production during the decrease in cash costs at hayden hill and guanaco partially was offset by an increase in cash costs at sleeper due to percent lower production in lower recoveries of mill ore processed and lower volumes of leach ore available for processing caused the decline in production at sleeper as reserves are depleted during the first half of consolidated cash costs decreased from to primarily as a result of a full year of operations at guanaco and the reconfiguration of the hayden hill mine to a heap leach only operation 
management anticipates the decline in cash costs to continue at the current operating properties as well as company wide as refugio  fort knox and kubaka commence production 
the new properties are expected to be substantially lower cost mines than the company s currently producing properties 
depreciation and depletion decreased to million during mainly as a result of lower depletion rates at sleeper and hayden hill in  partially offset by increased production at guanaco which has a higher depreciation rate 
increased estimates of future production caused the decline in the sleeper depletion rate  while at hayden hill the write off of the mill during the fourth quarter of and the reduction in the estimate of capital expenditures required to produce the remaining ounces resulted in a lower depletion rate 
depreciation and depletion rates decreased from per ounce in to per ounce in depreciation and depletion decreased slightly in compared with significant factors for the decrease were the write down of assets at sleeper in december and at hayden hill in june  partially offset by the full year of production at guanaco in general and administrative costs increased by million in primarily as a result of higher litigation  financing  relocation and severance costs 
staff reductions in resulted in a decline in general and administrative costs from million in to million in exploration expense was million in compared to million in the primary reason for the decrease in was reduced exploration activity at the cerro quema property in panama  an advanced stage exploration project which the company had an option to purchase from cyprus amax 
during the third quarter of  amax gold decided not to acquire cerro quema 
the decrease in spending at cerro quema partially was offset by higher spending on the robertson project in nevada relating to exploratory drilling and the preparation of a feasibility study 
exploration expense increased by million in compared with due to increased activity in north  central and south america  partially offset by savings realized by the company s agreement to pool efforts with cyprus amax to discover new gold properties 
during  exploration costs are expected to be approximately million 
interest expense decreased by million in as interest costs associated with higher debt levels related to the refugio and fort knox financings were capitalized 
capitalized interest was million in compared with million in interest expense was million in compared with million in due to higher interest rates during  partially offset by a higher average debt balance in interest income was million in compared with million in and million in the increases are attributed to interest earned on a million loan to the company s refugio joint venture partner and on the refugio and fort knox borrowings in and the cash from the preferred share offering in  held prior to investment in capital projects 
other income and expense increased to million in primarily as a result of expensing costs related to the company s percent joint venture interest in the haile gold property 
prior to such costs were capitalized 
liquidity and capital resources working capital was million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease in working capital was a result of the drawdown of cash and increase in accounts payable due to spending of approximately million on the construction of refugio and fort knox which were funded through external borrowings  partially offset by a decline in the current portion of debt resulting from refinancing 
cash generated from operations was million during compared to million of cash used in operations during capital expenditures were nearly ten times higher in than due to the construction of fort knox and refugio 
construction substantially was completed by year end at refugio where the company s share of capital spending  excluding capitalized interest  totalled approximately million in at refugio crushing is underway  the leach pads are currently being loaded with ore and irrigation has commenced 
the initial gold pour is expected early in at fort knox  capital spending during excluding capitalized interest was approximately million 
due to more difficult site conditions  design enhancements and expanded excavation work  the remaining capital costs estimates at fort knox are expected to increase and could exceed the revised estimate of million 
final estimates for completion are being developed and the timing of start up may influence total costs 
a portion of the projected capital increase should reduce cash operating costs to levels below those in the initial design 
in addition  higher capital costs now are estimated to complete the kubaka project  reflecting a possible delay in start up and certain higher local costs and contingency provisions 
final project estimates currently are being developed 
net financing activities in generated cash of million 
during the first quarter  compania minera maricunga  a percent owned subsidiary of the company which is developing the refugio mine  borrowed million million for the company s share drawn in gold under a project financing arrangement with a group of banks 
in addition  the company loaned million to its refugio joint venture partner to be held in escrow as support for the partner s loan guarantee 
amax gold borrowed million from cyprus amax under a convertible line of credit to fund initial construction at fort knox and to repay approximately million in outstanding indebtedness during the second and third quarters of in the third quarter of  cyprus amax converted the outstanding amount  plus interest  into approximately million shares of amax gold common stock in accordance with the credit agreement 
the company secured million in project financing from a group of banks for the fort knox project during the fourth quarter of and had borrowed million of that amount at year end 
loans of approximately million were repaid with proceeds from the fort knox financing 
in june the company borrowed million under the million convertible line of credit with cyprus amax 
preferred dividends totalling million were paid during cash flows from operations during are expected to be sufficient to fund operating and administrative expenses  exploration expenditures and interest payments on outstanding debt 
the company anticipates that further funding will be necessary for remaining capital expenditures  working capital build up associated with start up at fort knox and debt repayments and expects to complete additional debt and or equity financings during currently million of equity and or subordinated debt securities are available to amax gold under a universal shelf registration statement 
as a result of projected cost increases in completing the fort knox project and other projected cash needs in  the company has renegotiated the million fort knox loan which cyprus amax has guaranteed until economic completion 
until economic completion  the company will not make additional draws under the million line of credit without cyprus amax prior consent 
amax gold will consider various options for additional funding  including the possibility of accessing the equity markets 
in addition  cyprus amax has informed the company it intends to make additional needed financing available to amax gold 
the company will pay cyprus amax a fee of percent based upon the total of financings and guaranties made available 
all fees  interest and repayments of advances from cyprus amax may be paid at the election of cyprus amax in cash or  following approval by the company s stockholders  in the company s common stock valued at the average closing price for the five day period prior to such election
