item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction effective january   the company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of afl and hmg in exchange for approximately and of the outstanding common shares of allied digital  respectively 
subsequently  on march   allied digital changed its fiscal year end from december to july consequently  the results of operations i for the twelve months ended july  include the consolidated operations of afl and hmg for such period  ii for the twelve month period ended july  include the earnings of afl for the twelve months ended july  and the earnings of hmg for the period january  through july   and iii for the seven months ended july  include only the earnings of afl 
therefore  the results of operations for the twelve month period ended july  and the seven month period ended july  are not necessarily indicative of the performance of afl and hmg expected for a full month year 
results of operations year ended july  compared to year ended july net sales for the twelve month period ended july  fiscal were million  an increase of million compared to the twelve month period ended july  fiscal 
such increase was attributable primarily to the full year inclusion of hmg s operations in the fiscal results million and increased sales volume in fiscal resulting primarily from the commencement of videocassette duplication and order fulfillment services under a five year sales contract entered into with a customer in june gross margin for fiscal increased million to million  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales for fiscal the increase in gross margin dollars was primarily due to the full year inclusion of hmg margin of million in the fiscal results as compared to a margin contribution in fiscal by hmg of million for the period january  through july  this net million gross margin increase was partially offset by a million non recurring charge in fiscal resulting from a sales contract signing allowance with a large customer 
the gross margin was further reduced by the start up efforts commencing in june in preparing to process orders for this large customer in the company s tennessee manufacturing plant 
moreover  declining unit prices to customers due to continuing price pressures and a change in the company s sales mix which includes the adverse impact on average margins caused by a production and fulfillment sales contract with a large customer further contributed to the gross margin decline in fiscal operating expenses for fiscal were million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales for fiscal of the million increase  million resulted from a current year restructuring charge in connection with the company s june plan to streamline and reduce resources utilized in the business and the full year inclusion of hmg operations in fiscal resulting in an incremental increase of approximately million in operating expenses over fiscal of which million results from the full year inclusion of the amortization of the excess cost over fair value of the net assets acquired associated with the reorganization 
operating expenses for fiscal also included a million increase in bad debt expense over the prior year 
allied digital s non operating expenses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this million increase was due to increased interest expense primarily associated with the full year inclusion of hmg in fiscal results together with increased average borrowings for allied digital related to the additional debt required to finance capital expenditures 
for fiscal  allied digital reported a pre tax loss of million  compared to pre tax earnings of million for fiscal the decrease in income of million occurred for the reasons noted above 
a net credit for federal  state and local income taxes of million was recognized for fiscal compared to a net credit for federal  state and local income taxes of million for fiscal this million net credit relates primarily to a net operating loss  restructuring costs and a non recurring charge which will be deductible in future periods  as well as state investment tax credits realized during this period 
the effective tax rate was approximately 
non deductible expenses related to the amortization of excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired arising from the reorganization were offset in part during the period by state income tax benefits and investment tax credits resulting from purchase of equipment in the state of new york 
the effective tax rate is expected to be higher in future periods due to the non deductible amortization of costs in excess of net assets acquired  net of non recurring benefits from investment tax credits 
after recognition of applicable income taxes  allied digital reported a net loss in fiscal of million as compared to net income of million in fiscal for the reasons noted above 
results of operations year ended july  compared to seven month period ended july  net sales of allied digital for the twelve month period ended july  fiscal were million  an increase of million compared to the seven month period ended july  such increase was attributable to the inclusion of an additional five months in the period for afl million and the inclusion of post acquisition hmg revenues million 
included in these increases are intercompany sales of millon primarily attributable to duplication of videocassettes by afl for hmg subsequent to the reorganization on january  revenues for the twelve month period ended july  and seven month period ended july  include pre reorganization revenues from certain video reproduction work undertaken by afl on a subcontract basis for hmg 
for the period august  through january   approximately million units were produced by afl on this basis 
the subcontract work was performed by afl at an agreed upon rate that was determined in arm s length negotiations 
for the period august  through january   afl received revenues from hmg of approximately million under such arrangements or approximately of afl net sales for such period 
gross profit from such revenues was approximately million 
for the period january  through july   afl sales to hmg amounted to approximately million or approximately of net sales of afl for such period 
on a stand alone basis  afl revenues for fiscal were million  slightly greater than net sales of million for the twelve month period ended july  fiscal 
revenues from two large customers declined by million during fiscal due  in one case  to combination of the customer s business with that of another competitor and  in the other  to competitive preferences 
such revenues were replaced by new business and by an increase of million in intercompany revenues  to million 
hmg revenues were million for the week period ended july  fiscal  up million compared to the week period ended july  fiscal 
the increase was primarily due to an increase of million in sales to three large audio and video customers and a million increase in compact disc sales 
allied digital s gross margin for the twelve month period ended july  increased million to million  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales for the seven month period ended july  the increase in gross margin dollars was primarily due to the longer reporting period for afl and the inclusion of hmg margin of million for the period january  through july  the decline in percentage margin of in fiscal is the result of continued competitive price pressures  a change in customer and product mix associated with the inclusion of post acquisition hmg margin and additional costs of approximately million associated with the transfer of the major portion of the high volume videocassette replication equipment and the related customer accounts from the company s hauppauge  new york facility to the clinton  tennessee manufacturing plant 
the special procedures required in connection with this additional business and the start up of a major new account put a strain on the material handling and packaging capacity of the facility resulting in delays in delivery and manufacturing inefficiencies 
allied digital believes that these problems have been resolved by new plant management and by the relocation of a portion of the equipment business back to the hauppauge  new york facility 
on a stand alone basis for fiscal  gross margin as a percent of sales for both afl and hmg declined from fiscal afl margins declined to of net sales from and hmg margins declined to of net sales from 
the decrease for afl of approximately million  or on comparable sales dollars  was primarily due to the decline in sales to the two large customers noted above and the million increase in low margin intercompany sales 
the sharing of margins on intercompany sales affected hmg margins negatively to a much lesser extent 
the margins of both companies were also reduced by declining unit prices to external customers 
operating expenses of allied digital for the twelve month period ended july  were million or of sales compared to million or for the seven month period ended july  of the million increase  million was primarily the result of the inclusion of five additional months of expenses in the reporting period for afl and the inclusion of hmg expenses of million for the period january  through july  amortization of the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired  primarily associated with the reorganization  accounted for million of the increase 
offsetting these increases was a decline in discretionary management bonuses 
the reduction in allied digital s operating expenses as a percentage of sales of from to is primarily due to the inclusion of hmg business operations in fiscal results 
hmg  because of its different market and customer mix compared to that of afl  has historically had relatively lower percentage operating expenses and higher percentage attributable to manufacturing costs than afl 
on a stand alone basis  afl operating expenses for fiscal decreased approximately million from fiscal of this amount  approximately million was due to decreased discretionary profit sharing contributions and management bonuses 
other favorable factors include the capitalization in fiscal of million of costs associated with internally developed software  reduced temporary help of million  lower employee insurance costs of million  reduced depreciation of million resulting primarily from the switch from accelerated to straight line methods and reduced property taxes and other costs of million 
offsetting these reductions were increases in bad debt expense of million and professional fees of million 
hmg s operating expenses increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal of this increase  million was attributable to amortization of the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired associated with the reorganization 
in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 push down accounting has been applied to the separate financial statements of hmg effective january  push down accounting reflects in the subsidiary hmg financial statements the new basis of accounting arising from allied digital s acquisition of hmg 
accordingly  the assets and liabilities of hmg at january  have been adjusted to reflect allied digital s allocation of its cost to acquire hmg to the various assets and liabilities of hmg 
other significant items included million of higher selling expenses due to increased sales  million attributable to the termination and payout of an employee contract and million for discretionary management bonuses 
allied digital s income from operations increased million to million for the twelve month period ended july  from million for the seven month period ended july  of this increase  million was due to the longer reporting period for afl and million was attributable to the inclusion of hmg results from january  through july   net of a million charge for amortization relating to the reorganization  as described above 
on a stand alone basis  for the reasons noted above  afl s income from operations for fiscal declined million to million from million for fiscal hmg s fiscal operating income rose million over fiscal to million  net of a million charge for amortization of the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired associated with the reorganization 
allied digital s non operating expenses increased to million for the twelve month period ended july  from million for the seven month period ended july  this million increase was due to increased interest expense of million primarily associated with the longer reporting period and increased average borrowings for afl and the inclusion of post acquisition hmg interest expense of million 
the increased average borrowings for afl relate to the additional debt required to finance the million shareholder distribution of april  increased interest expense was partially offset by an increase in other income of million  of which million represents interest income paid by customers on their past due accounts during the additional five months in the reporting period for afl 
for the twelve month period ended july   allied digital realized income before taxes of million  compared to a loss of approximately  for the seven month period ended july  fiscal income before taxes is comprised of a pre tax loss of million for afl offset by post reorganization income before taxes for hmg of million  net of push down accounting adjustments 
a net credit for federal  state and local income taxes of million was recognized for the twelve months ended july  compared to expense for state and local income taxes of million for the seven months ended july  because prior to january  afl elected to be treated as an s corporation under the internal revenue code  no provision for federal income taxes has been included in the financial statements for the seven months ended july  pursuant to the reorganization  on january   afl became disqualified as an s corporation 
in connection with this disqualification  a net deferred tax asset of million was established 
the additional million net credit recognized primarily relates to a net operating loss generated by afl during the period from january  to july  as well as state investment tax credits realized during this period 
the effective tax rate subsequent to the reorganization was approximately 
non deductible expenses related to the amortization of cost in excess of net assets acquired arising from the reorganization were offset during the period by state investment tax credits resulting from purchase of equipment in the state of new york 
after recognition of applicable income taxes allied digital recognized income for the twelve months ended july  of million  compared to a net loss of million for the seven months ended july  for the reasons noted above 
results of operations seven month period ended july  compared to seven month period ended july  net sales for the seven month period ended july  were million  a decrease of million or as compared to the seven month period ended july  such decrease was primarily due to a decrease in video unit sales  most of which is attributable to decreased volume from three significant customers during the period 
in addition  the average program length of video sales units in the first seven months of increased from that in the comparable period in  resulting in increased unit revenues 
however  revenues on comparable length video sales units declined  as a result of continued price pressures 
the decline in sales to three large customers described above for the seven months ended july  is due  in two cases  to decreased customer demand of video products and  in the third case  to the sale of a customer s assets to a company with affiliated video duplication capabilities 
this decline is consistent with cycles of sales to large customers experienced by afl in the past 
revenues for the seven month period ended july  included revenues from certain video reproduction work undertaken by afl on a subcontract basis for hmg 
for the seven months ended july   approximately million units were produced by afl on this basis 
the subcontract work  most of which was performed after june   was performed by afl at an agreed upon rate that was determined in arms length negotiations 
for the period ended july   afl received revenues of approximately million from hmg under such arrangements or approximately of net sales of afl for such period 
gross margin for the seven month period ended july  decreased to million  or of sales  from million  or of net sales for the seven month period ended july  reduced video unit sales were responsible for the decline in gross margin 
operating expenses for the seven month period ended july   decreased to million  compared to million for the seven month period ended july  due to high sales and earnings  the seven months ended july  included expenses for discretionary management and supervisory bonuses  profit sharing plan contributions and bad debts which were higher than those for the comparable period in by million  million and million  respectively 
however  the seven months ended july  also included a nonrecurring charge of million for bonus expense representing the difference between the cash proceeds received from afl common stock issued on march  and june  to certain management employees under the afl management bonus program and the estimated fair market value of the shares 
this expense had no cash impact 
operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to from for the seven months ended july  compared to the seven months ended july  this disproportionate increase was due to the fixed nature of general and administrative expenses such as labor and depreciation spread over lower net sales 
income from operations decreased to million for the seven month period ended july  from million for the seven month period ended july  this decrease was due to lower sales volumes and resulting lower margins which were only partially offset by reduced discretionary bonus and profit sharing costs 
non operating expenses increased to million for the seven month period ended july  from million for the seven month period ended july  this increase was primarily due to the increased interest expense of million primarily associated with the million subordinated shareholder notes issued by afl in april  which was partially offset by interest income of million paid by customers on their past due accounts 
for the seven month period ended july   afl realized a loss before income taxes of  a million decrease from the seven month period ended july  because afl elected to be treated as an s corporation under the internal revenue code  no provision for federal income taxes has been included in the financial statements 
after recognition of applicable state income taxes based upon reduced taxable income  afl recognized a net loss for the seven months ended july  of million  compared to net income of million for the seven months ended july  for the reasons noted above

restrictions contained in the anb loan agreement impose limitations on the amount of distributions that hauppauge records may make to allied digital and prohibit allied digital from using any such distributions to pay dividends to its stockholders 
impact of inflation during recent years  allied digital has experienced decreasing margins as a result of competitive pressures in its market segment 
allied digital believes that  historically  the decline in its margins has been partially offset by increases in volume as well as decreases in the cost of components 
allied digital from time to time experiences increases in the costs of material and labor  as well as other manufacturing and operating expenses 
allied digital s ability  consistent with that of its competitors  to pass along such increased costs through increased prices has been difficult due to competitive pressures 
by attempting to control costs  allied digital attempts to minimize any effects of inflation on its operations
