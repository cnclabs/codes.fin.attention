item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following financial review discusses the performance of first of america  on a consolidated basis  for the three years ended december   and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
mergers and acquisitions table i below and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included later in this document  summarize first of america s business combinations for the past three years

also during  first of america acquired underwriting consultants  inc and west suburban financial corporation renamed first of america insurance group illinois  inc  insurance companies which specialize in personal and commercial life and casualty insurance 
these acquisitions provide opportunities for further diversification of revenue sources 
highlights net income for was million  up percent compared with the million earned in  and earnings per share were versus 
the current year s results reflected the impact of increased non interest income  million in branch sale gains  and controlled expense levels 
non interest expense was virtually level with a year ago  as benefits achieved from the internal restructuring and reduced fdic premiums offset additional expense from acquisitions completed on december   and million in restructuring charges 
in record gains on the sale of mortgages and securities contributed to that year s net income of million  or per fully diluted share 
return on average assets was percent for full year and improved as the year progressed  beginning at percent for the first quarter and ending the year at percent for the fourth quarter 
return on average assets for was percent and percent for return on average equity was down for the year over year comparison  percent compared with percent  as growth in equity offset the higher earnings 
return on average equity was percent in asset quality remained strong  showing only slight deterioration from s record measures 
nonperforming assets were percent of total assets  up slightly from percent at december   but lower than the percent reported at year end net charge offs as a percent of average loans followed the same trend and was percent  percent and percent  respectively  for  and the allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans did increase  however  to percent at year end compared with percent at year end  as the provision for loan loss expense covered net charge offs by percent and total loans decreased percent 
the allowance as a percent of total loans was percent at december total assets were billion at december   a percent decrease compared with the billion reported at december  the decrease can be attributed to strategies aimed at trimming the balance sheet and to the securitization of million in credit card receivables during june total assets were billion at december  excluding the credit card securitization  total loans decreased percent due to pricing strategies implemented to improve the profitability of the installment and residential mortgage portfolios 
the commercial and commercial mortgage portfolios  however  experienced steady growth during  up percent from the previous year 
total shareholders equity increased percent to billion at december  the increase resulted from earnings retention of million and the million positive change in the adjustment to equity for available for sale securities 
the higher equity level resulted in an increase in the book value per share  which was at december  compared with and for year ends and the risk based capital ratio of percent at year end was the highest reported by first of america since it began computing risk based ratios in the regulatory requirement for this ratio is percent 
in august  the board of directors increased the annual cash dividend paid per common share by percent to 
this increase indicated the board s continued confidence in first of america s profitability and represents the thirteenth year in a row that the dividend was increased

income analysis net interest income 
net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent fte basis was million  down percent from million in the lower net interest margin for  percent versus percent  offset the percent increase in average earning assets which was primarily the result of the acquisitions completed at year end net interest income for was also reduced by the securitization of million in credit card receivables during june  which shifted revenue from interest income to non interest fee revenue 
for compared with  net interest income fte increased percent due to a higher level of average earning assets offsetting the impact of a lower net interest margin 
total interest income fte grew percent in as illustrated in table iii  the increase resulted from both a higher volume of earning assets and higher asset yields 
on the other hand  interest expense was up percent mainly as a result of increased rates on interest bearing liabilities 
the combination of the changes in interest income fte and interest expense resulted in the percent decrease in net interest income fte

net interest margin 
the net interest margin was percent in lower than the percent reported in  due in part to the acquisition of higher priced thrift deposits at december  the margin was also reduced by approximately basis points as a result of the securitization of million in credit card receivables completed in june during management implemented specific strategies to improve the core margin  such as steps to increase the interest spread on newly originated installment and residential mortgage loans  changes to deposit product pricing and mix and decreased reliance on short term borrowings 
as a result of these strategies  the core margin showed improvement during the last six months of if the first and second quarter margins are normalized for the impact of the credit card securitization  the margins would have been as follows first quarter  percent  second quarter  percent  third quarter  percent  fourth quarter  percent 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses is based on the current level of net charge offs and management s assessment of the credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio 
for  the provision for loan losses was increased percent to million from million in to adequately cover net charge offs and the higher risk of loss beginning to be experienced in the credit card and installment loan portfolios 
the provision was million 
the percent coverage of net charge offs by the provision for loan losses and the securitization of the million in credit card receivables contributed to the higher allowance as a percent of total loans ratio which was percent  up from percent at december  and percent at december  as a percent of average assets  the provision was percent compared with the percent and percent reported for and  respectively 
additional information on the provision for loan losses  net charge offs and nonperforming assets is provided in tables ix and xi and under the caption  credit risk profile  presented later in this discussion 
non interest revenue 
non interest revenue of million was up percent over included in this total were million in branch sale gains related to internal restructuring and million in net servicing fees from the credit card securitization 
excluding these two components  total non interest revenue would have increased percent over non interest revenue totaled million in and million in record gains on the sale of securities and mortgages during were the primary reasons for the higher level of non interest revenue in compared with table v presents the trends in the major components of non interest revenue from to non interest income and non interest expense table v in thousands change amount percent non interest revenue service charges on deposits       trust and financial services revenue       investment securities transactions      other operating revenue       total non interest revenue       non interest expense personnel      occupancy  net       equipment       data processing       amortization of intangibles       fdic premiums       other operating expense       total non interest expense       non interest revenue as a percent of average assets non interest expense as a percent of average assets burden ratio efficiency ratio efficiency ratio  excluding fdic premiums service charges on deposit accounts remained the largest component of non interest revenue in new fee structures initiated during the year and a slightly higher volume of non interest transaction deposits  accounted for the percent increase over a year ago 
in total  trust and financial services revenue increased percent over a year ago 
traditional trust fees increased percent as a result of the additional million in managed assets acquired with the new england trust company and the higher market value of managed assets upon which fees are assessed 
other financial services fees  derived from brokerage services and investment advisory services  increased percent as investment activity rebounded from total revenue from the sale of parkstone and other mutual funds and annuities was million compared with million in net gains on the sales of investment securities totaled million compared with million in and million in during december  first of america transferred all of its held to maturity securities into the available for sale classification 
more detail on that reclassification is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included later in this document 
at december   the amortized cost of available for sale securities totaled billion and had a corresponding market value of billion which resulted in a million positive adjustment to shareholders equity 
bank card revenue totaled million  up percent over the million earned in the total included million in net fees from the credit card securitization 
excluding these fees  bank card revenue would have been level with a year ago 
the securitization  completed during june  shifted revenue from interest income to fee revenue but had minimal impact on net income  its benefit was that the funds it provided allowed the company to reduce short term borrowings 
bank card revenue totaled million in the managed credit card portfolio  which includes the million in receivables remaining on the balance sheet and the securitized receivables  was billion at december   level with a year ago as fewer promotional initiatives were implemented in mortgage banking revenue of million increased percent over the main reasons for the increase were a million gain on the sale of servicing rights and million in additional gains on the sale of mortgage loans from the adoption of financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for mortgage servicing rights an amendment of fasb statement no 
fas 
impairment expense on the capitalized originated mortgage servicing rights was  mortgage originations totaling billion were down percent from  but increased each quarter throughout despite the sale of servicing rights  first of america s outside servicing portfolio was up slightly over a year ago totaling billion and added million in servicing revenue 
other operating revenue increased percent over the largest component of this category  gains on branch sales  totaled million and added to earnings per share 
the review of branch offices to determine their fit with the company s marketing strategies is an ongoing activity  but such scrutiny was intensified during the internal restructuring effort 
excluding branch sale gains  other operating revenue increased percent over a year ago 
included in this total were nonaffiliate corporate services at million  up percent  atm network fees at million  up percent  and credit life income at million  up percent 
non interest expense 
as detailed in table v  non interest expense was million in  up only percent from operating efficiencies generated by the internal restructuring and reduced fdic premiums  down million for the year  offset the additional operating expense from acquisitions completed at year end and million in restructuring charges incurred during non interest expense was percent of average assets for and percent for total personnel cost was million in compared with million in and million in excluding severance charges  personnel costs were down percent from and represented percent of average assets compared with percent in this improvement demonstrates the positive impact the restructuring had on personnel cost  the largest component of non interest expense 
total full time equivalent employees ftes were  at december  compared with  in august when the restructuring was announced 
the lower level of ftes was achieved even with the addition of ftes from acquisitions completed since september  two ratios which measure the progress made through internal efficiencies are the number of ftes per one million dollars of average assets and net income per fte 
for  there were ftes per one million dollars of average assets compared with a year ago  and  of net income per fte versus  a year ago 
these ratios were and  for net occupancy and equipment costs increased percent in to million compared with million in and million in the growth in this expense was largely the result of acquisitions completed late in and early in other operating expense  which includes all the other costs of doing business such as advertising  supplies  travel  telephone  professional fees and outside services purchased  was million in  up percent from s total of million 
as a percent of average assets  other operating expense was percent compared with percent in and percent in efficiency ratio and burden ratio 
the efficiency ratio measures non interest expense as a percent of the sum of net interest income fte and non interest income 
the lower the ratio  the more efficiently a company s resources produce revenue 
table v presents the efficiency ratio over the last five years 
the improvement in this ratio to percent for compared with percent a year ago is directly related to revenue growth since total non interest expense was basically level with a year ago 
the growth in non interest revenue offset the impact of a lower net interest margin and resulting lower net interest income 
the higher level of non interest revenue also directly impacted the burden ratio as non interest revenue was percent of average total assets compared with percent a year ago 
the lower fdic premiums in also served to improve the burden ratio to percent  one of first of america s long term goals is to maintain this ratio at or below percent 
income tax expense 
income tax expense was million in compared with million in and million in the increased income tax expense was primarily related to the percent increase in income before taxes 
a summary of significant tax components is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included later in this document 
pro forma results cash approach the calculation of cash earnings provides an alternative analysis of first of america s results 
cash earnings adds back the amortization of intangibles and assumes that all intangibles were charged off against retained earnings upon the original acquisition date of all mergers accounted for as purchases 
these pro forma results  as detailed below  indicate that first of america s underlying return on equity for the last two years would have been within the to percent range  which has been the company s stated long term goal 
also earnings per share and return on assets would have been higher than reported 
the book value per share  while lower than the reported for year end  would be the equivalent of a reported tangible book value per share 
in fact  the tier i leverage ratio  the strictest regulatory capital ratio  remains unchanged under these assumptions since it already excludes intangibles from its computation

line of business analysis an objective of first of america s recent restructuring effort was to define specific lines of business which would cross legal entity lines and focus its management and accounting systems accordingly 
as a result  first of america now measures the individual performance of four business lines community banking  bank card  mortgage banking and trust and financial services as well as the performance of certain product lines within those businesses 
in developing the management accounting system for line of business reporting  certain assumptions and allocations were necessary 
equity was allocated on the basis of required regulatory levels  inherent operational risk or market determined factors as evidenced by similar independent single business line companies 
support services which were centrally provided were allocated on a per unit cost basis or in proportion to the balances of assets and liabilities associated with a particular business line 
funds transfer pricing was used to allocate a cost of funds used or a credit for funds provided from market determined indices 
because of the assumptions and allocations utilized  the financial results of the individual business lines might vary from the actual results if those lines were in fact separate operating entities 
while no comparative results from previous years are available  table vi presents a summarized income statement  performance ratios and selected quarterly information from for the four business lines identified above 
community banking 
the community banking business line is responsible for gathering and managing deposits  lending to commercial and consumer installment customers  and managing the four state branch networks for the delivery of first of america s products and services 
it also provides customers with home equity and student loans  international banking services and other general banking services  such as atm operations and safety deposit boxes 
community banking is the core of first of america s business activities  and its contribution to the consolidated net income is the largest of the business lines 
in community banking benefited from the reduction of fdic premiums at mid year as evidenced by the increase in its net income from second to third quarter and by the improvement in its efficiency ratio between those same quarters 
for the full year  community banking earned a return on allocated equity of percent 
excluding the indirect lending product line and the start up effort in florida  it would have earned percent on its allocated equity 
investment in florida s physical franchise  advertising and other developmental activities significantly affected its results  however  progress was made on re mixing its customer base and changing its product offerings 
the performance of the indirect lending product line was lowered by the lingering effect of pricing competition in and the deterioration of credit quality during which necessitated a higher provision for loan losses particularly in the fourth quarter 
further credit quality problems are not anticipated  and management has taken steps to improve the interest spreads on newly originated indirect installment loans 
community banking s non interest expense included virtually all of the goodwill amortization included in the corporation s consolidated financial results  a total of million in without that amortization  its efficiency ratio and return on allocated equity would have been percent and percent  respectively 
bank card 
bank card is responsible for managing and servicing first of america s billion managed portfolio of credit card and other revolving loans  as well as the merchant services operation 
in addition to the managed portfolio of visa mastercard credit cards  bank card manages affinity cards for groups and offers a firstair card 
the revolving portfolio remained relatively level with as fewer customer promotions were initiated than in previous years 
in  renewed emphasis will be placed on promoting the visa mastercard portfolio 
this business line was a strong performer during with an efficiency ratio of percent and a return on allocated equity of percent 
as the year progressed  the provision for loan losses was increased in order to provide for net charge offs which also rose 
this reflected a trend in consumer debt which was generally experienced across the industry 
as a result  the bank card s quarterly net income and return on allocated equity declined over the second half of the year as indicated in table vi 
mortgage banking 
mortgage banking originates all residential mortgages across first of america s four community banking states and in separate origination offices in arizona  missouri  north carolina and south carolina 
the loans are originated both for portfolio retention and sale to the secondary market 
mortgage banking also provides servicing for first of america s entire portfolio and a billion portfolio for external investors 
since mortgage banking is responsible for originating  servicing and managing first of america s residential loan portfolio  the portfolio s interest income and related funds transfer charge are included in mortgage banking s net income 
mortgage banking earned the lowest return on allocated equity of the four business lines in its results can vary substantially from period to period since origination activity is rate sensitive  and gains on loan sales vary directly with the volume of originations 
some seasonality was evident in the results with net income highest during the second and third quarters when origination activity was at its peak 
fas added million in pre tax gains during the year and a sale of servicing rights contributed million in pre tax gains during the second quarter 
trust and financial services 
trust and financial services provides traditional trust services to individuals and institutions  as well as investment management and brokerage services 
it also manages first of america s proprietary mutual funds  the parkstone group of funds and recently began offering certain insurance services and annuity products 
this business line earned the highest return on allocated equity at percent 
the nature of its business activity fee generating and personnel intensive will generally result in comparatively higher returns on equity and higher efficiency ratios 
net income climbed steadily over the year  in part due to the increasing market value of its managed assets upon which fees are assessed 
its managed assets totaled billion at year end  up percent from the previous year 
credit risk profile first of america s community banking structure helps minimize its credit risk exposure 
community banking means that loans are made in local markets to consumers and small to mid sized businesses from deposits gathered in the same market 
a centralized  independent loan review staff evaluates the loan portfolio of each line of business on a regular basis and shares its evaluation with the management of the business line as well as corporate management 
first of america s loan portfolio includes a large percentage of loans with balances less than  which effectively reduces total portfolio risk 
at year end  consumer installment and revolving loans totaled percent of the total portfolio  one to four family residential mortgages and home equity loans accounted for percent  commercial loans totaled percent  and commercial mortgages totaled percent 
first of america does not have any concentrations of credit to any specific borrower or within any geographic area 
the total loan portfolio  as presented in table vii  was billion at year end  down slightly from the billion a year ago 
components of the loan portfolio table vii in thousands december  consumer  net      commercial  financial and agricultural      real estate construction      real estate mortgage      total loans      consumer loans 
first of america s consumer loan portfolio  which includes indirect and direct installment loans  credit cards and other revolving loans  declined percent from s level 
the managed credit card portfolio at billion remained level with first of america offers its credit card products in all fifty states  the largest portion of the portfolio  percent  was to customers in its four operating states 
as a percent of average loans  the net charge offs for the managed portfolio were percent in compared with percent in the consumer installment portfolio was billion at december   down percent from the previous year due to the combination of intense competition within the industry and first of america s more stringent pricing policies 
first of america s consumer installment loans originate primarily from its four state operating area 
the net charge offs as a percent of average consumer installment loans were percent in and percent in management increased the provision for loan losses in to adequately cover the estimated risk of loss in this portfolio and  unless there is a serious economic downturn  does not expect further significant deterioration in its credit quality 
residential mortgage loans 
at december   residential mortgage loans totaled billion compared with billion at year end originations of residential mortgage loans during were billion compared with billion in the average loan size in the balance sheet portfolio was  and the loans in portfolio were originated within first of america s four home states 
first of america s portfolio continued to have excellent credit quality measurements 
net charge offs as a percent of average residential mortgage loans were percent in and in at december   residential mortgage loans held for sale  originated at prevailing market rates  totaled million with a market value of million 
these residential mortgages are closed and therefore included in outstandings on the balance sheet 
in addition  first of america has entered into commitments to originate residential mortgage loans  at prevailing market rates  totaling million 
mandatory commitments to deliver mortgage loans to investors  at prevailing market rates  totaled million as of december commercial and commercial mortgage loans 
first of america s commercial and commercial mortgage loan portfolio is comprised primarily of loans to small and mid sized businesses within the local markets of its four operating states 
evidence of this philosophy is the average loan size within this portfolio at year end which was  for commercial loans and  for commercial mortgages  allowing for a more diverse customer base and limiting the exposure from any one borrower 
first of america has no foreign loans  no highly leveraged transactions and no syndicated purchase participations 
maturity and rate sensitivity of selected loan categories is presented in table viii 
first of america s commercial and commercial mortgages demonstrated the highest growth of any of the portfolios during this portfolio grew percent to billion compared with billion at year end total non performing commercial and commercial mortgage loans as a percent of outstandings decreased to percent from percent a year ago  and net charge offs as a percent of average loans was percent compared with percent for maturity and rate sensitivity of selected loans table viii in thousands one year to after one year five five december  or less years years total commercial  financial and agricultural     commercial tax exempt     real estate construction     total     total loans above due after one year with predetermined interest rate    with floating or adjustable interest rates    total    asset quality

while management has identified these loans as requiring additional monitoring  they do not necessarily represent future non performing loans 
the allowance for loan losses is determined by management taking into consideration past charge off experience  estimated loss exposure on specific loans and the current and projected economic climate 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses quarterly based on information compiled by the corporate loan review area 
management s allocation of the allowance for loan losses over the last five years is presented in table x 
the amounts indicated for each loan type include amounts allocated for specific loans as well as a general allocation 
the allowance coverage of non performing loans at year end was percent compared with percent at year end and percent at year end it was management s determination that the level of the allowance was adequate to absorb potential loan losses 
other ratios measuring asset quality and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses are presented in table xi 
on january   first of america identified million of impaired loans under the guidelines of financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended by statement no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures fas 
this resulted in a specifically identified allowance for impaired loan losses of million which was transferred from the general allowance 
at year end  the allowance for impaired loan losses was million 
the adoption of fas did not significantly impact the comparability of the allowance related tables included in this report

funding is achieved through growth in core deposits and accessibility to the money and capital markets 
deposits 
first of america s primary source of funding is its core deposits which include all deposits except negotiated certificates of deposit 
as a percent of total deposits  core deposits were percent at year end and percent at year end first of america does not issue negotiated cd s in the national money markets  and the level of purchased funds is strictly limited by corporate policy to less than percent of assets 
the majority of negotiated cd s and purchased funds originate from the core deposit customer base  including downstream correspondents 
the loans to deposits ratio measures how well a company is using its lowest cost source of funding which is typically its deposit base 
as a percent of total deposits  total loans were percent compared with percent and percent for and  respectively 
since loans are generally a higher yielding asset than securities  this is a positive trend and represents a more efficient use of funds 
the average deposit balances outstanding and the rates paid on those deposits for the three years ended december   are presented in table xii 
the maturity distribution of time deposits of  or more at year end is detailed in table xiii 
in addition to deposits  first of america s sources of funding include money market borrowings  capital funds  securitizations and long term debt 
first of america entered into a three year competitive advance and revolving credit facility agreement dated as of march  and amended by its first amendment dated december  and the second amendment dated february  collectively  the credit agreement 
the credit agreement allows first of america to borrow up to  on a standby revolving credit basis and an uncommitted competitive advance basis 
the proceeds of all borrowings made pursuant to the credit agreement will be used to provide working capital and for other general corporate purposes 
at december   there was no outstanding balance under the credit agreement 
in june  first of america securitized million in credit card receivables 
this transaction was an effective management balance sheet tool since it had no impact on net income  but released funds which were used to reduce short term borrowings 
on july   first of america issued million of subordinated notes due july   which are not subject to redemption prior to maturity and which qualify as tier ii capital under the federal reserve board s capital guidelines 
the proceeds received from the notes were used to discharge indebtedness incurred to fund the acquisition of the goldome federal branches  to fund the repurchase of common stock and for other general corporate purposes 
during august  certain first of america bank subsidiaries began issuing bank notes due from days to years from date of issue 
the proceeds from the sale of the notes were used for general corporate purposes by the issuing banks

first of america s interest rate risk policy is to attempt to minimize the effect on net income resulting from a change in interest rates through asset liability management at all levels in the company 
each banking affiliate completes an interest rate analysis every month using an asset liability model  and a consolidated analysis is then completed using the affiliates data 
the asset and liability committees  which exist at each banking affiliate and at the consolidated level  review the analysis and as necessary  appropriate action is taken to maintain the net interest spread  even in periods of rapid interest rate movement 
interest rate swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payment obligations without the exchange of the underlying financial instrument 
the company becomes a principal in the exchange of interest payments with other parties and  therefore  is exposed to the loss of future interest payments should the counterparty default 
the company minimizes this risk by performing normal credit reviews of its counterparties and collateralizing its exposure when it exceeds a predetermined limit 
first of america had outstanding interest rate swap agreements at december   totaling million in notional amounts versus million at december  this total included notional amounts of million as a hedge against the parent company s subordinated notes due february   million against various fixed rate bank notes  million against certain firstrate fund deposits  and million as a hedge against certain market rate certificates of deposit 
first of america had swaps of variable rate instruments for fixed rate instruments with notional amounts totaling million  million of fixed rate instruments for variable rate instruments and million representing basis swaps 
the aggregate market value of interest rate swaps at year end was a positive thousand 
the full year impact from swap activity on net interest income was a negative million versus a negative million impact for if interest rates increased one hundred basis points  first of america would increase net interest income thousand over the next twelve months from its current interest rate swap agreements 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included later in this document provides further detail on first of america s interest rate swap agreements 
during  first of america also entered into interest rate cap agreements as a means of managing interest rate risk 
these caps were agreements to receive payments for interest rate differentials between an index rate and a specified maximum rate  computed on notional amounts 
at december   first of america had no outstanding interest rate caps compared with million in interest rate cap agreements at year end interest rate sensitivity of assets and liabilities is represented in a gap report  gap being the difference between rate sensitive assets and liabilities and includes the impact of off balance sheet interest rate swap and cap agreements 
table xvi presents first of america s gap position at december   for one year and shorter periods  and table xvii details the company s five year gap position 
the gap reports reliability in measuring the risk to income from a change in interest rates is tested through the use of simulation models 
at year end simulation models showed that less than two percent of first of america s annual net income was at risk if interest rates were to move up or down by one percent in a parallel fashion 
however  changing economic conditions affect results  therefore  the management of first of america s interest rate sensitivity is an ongoing process 
management has determined that these simulations provide a more meaningful measurement of the company s interest rate risk positions than the following gap tables

capital strength regulatory requirements 
first of america s capital policy is to maintain its capital levels above minimum regulatory guidelines 
at december   the federal reserve required a tier i risk based capital ratio of percent and a total risk based capital ratio of percent 
in  the federal reserve also adopted a new leverage capital adequacy standard 
this ratio compares tier i capital to reported total assets and requires a minimum ratio of percent in order to be categorized as adequately capitalized 
as shown in table xviii  at december   first of america s capital ratios exceeded required regulatory minimums with a tier i risk based ratio of percent  a total risk based ratio of percent and a tier i leverage ratio of percent 
capital ratios exclude the mark to market adjustment for available for sale securities in accordance with the federal reserve s regulations 
the long term debt which qualified as tier ii capital at december   consisted of million in subordinated notes due february   a million subordinated note which matures ratably over a five year period beginning december   million in subordinated notes due in equal installments through and the above mentioned million in subordinated notes due july  this debt is included in tier ii capital on a weighted maturity basis 
additional information relating to first of america s various long term debt agreements is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included later in this document

total shareholders equity 
first of america s total shareholders equity increased percent to billion at year end the increase in equity was the result of million in earnings retention and the million positive change in the adjustment to equity for available for sale securities 
in conclusion in the effort to fully fund the savings association insurance fund saif  the us congress has been considering legislation which would assess a one time premium on thrift deposits insured by saif of which first of america has approximately billion 
when this legislation is finally enacted which is expected during  first of america will accrue the required liability which could result in a maximum  one time expense of million  or per share 
after the one time charge  the premium rate on thrift deposits is expected to match the lower bank deposit rate 
first of america s management remains committed to its long term goals of a return on assets of percent  an efficiency ratio below percent and a return on equity of to percent 
the benefits of its internal restructuring effort  combined with a company wide emphasis on pricing products by market and customer type and a focus on the business lines which drive higher profitability  provide the fundamentals for the achievement of these goals in the future
