also on january   sli purchased a common stock interest in business exchange international corporation bxi  a nevada corporation  pursuant to rights to purchase such interest that had been assigned to sli by the former shareholders of sli 
sli paid  for the common interest in bxi by the purchase of newly issued common stock of bxi and  in addition  sli loaned  to bxi 
bxi owns and operates one of the leading organized barter exchanges in the united states 
subsequent to the transactions described above  the owner of the other interest in bxi issued a series of press releases and widespread communications throughout the commercial barter industry stating  among other things  that bxi was not the owner of the assets of the bxi barter exchange  which assertion is in direct contradiction to explicit contractual representations made by that party 
despite having made such assertion and despite having made what the company considers to be unjustified negative statements about the company  the owner of the other and the company engaged in extensive negotiations with regard to one party purchasing a interest from the other and future management and operation of the bxi barter exchange 
on several occasions  the company believed that resolution was imminent 
however  each time  the subsequent actions of the owner of the other interest in bxi demonstrated unwillingness to abide by the contractual terms of the applicable agreement  accompanied by the contradictory action of unwillingness to refund to the company the funds that had been paid for the interest in bxi and the loan that was made to bxi 
also  the owner of the other interest in bxi continued to publicly make what the company considers to be hostile and unjustified allegations about the company and its actions 
on february   the company filed suit in the circuit court of multnomah county  oregon against bxi  bx international  inc  the company which bxi alleged in its press releases was the actual owner of the bxi trade exchange  saul yarmak  president of bxi and author of the hostile allegations against the company and stephen friedland  an officer of bxi 
the suit seeks damages for breach of contract  fraud  business defamation disparagement  unlawful trade practices and interference with economic relationships and includes claims for specific performance of the contract to acquire the interest in bxi and a request for a declaratory judgment 
the defendants answered the complaint on april  by denying all allegations and asking for their attorney s fees 
on october   itex corporation moved for dismissal of its claims business defamation  unlawful trade practices and interference with economic relationships  without prejudice  against defendants 
on that same date the motion was granted and leave granted to file an amended complaint 
that complaint is styled sli  inc v 
saul yarmak  stephen friedland  business exchange international corp 
and bx international  inc the amended complaint restates the claims against defendants for breach of contract  specific performance  declaratory judgment and fraud 
by dismissing itex corporation s claims without prejudice  itex may  if it chooses  reinstitute its claims for business defamation  unlawful trade practices and interference with economic relationships 
proceeding under the amended complaint permits an expedited determination of the core contract issues raised  that is  whether bxi breached its contract with sli by asserting that the bxi trade exchange is not an asset of bxi 
as with all litigation  the potential outcome of this lawsuit is uncertain 
however  the company believes that sli has meritorious arguments in favor of its contract positions 
the company believes that a solution will be reached either through negotiation or through completion of the litigation process 
based upon the docket in multnomah county  oregon  circuit court  the matter must go to trial within one year of the filing of the original complaint 
in any event  this litigation does not present scenarios which would be expected to result in a materially adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations

during fiscal  troc canada  the largest barter exchange in canada  took steps to join the itex barter system as an independent licensee 
troc is located in montreal  quebec with most of its operations in eastern canada 
subsequently  the company entered into an international license agreement with canada  inc  governing the use of the itex system in canada 
these two actions thus gave itex coast to coast name recognition in canada as well as in the us acquisition of travel agents hotel guide 
in february the company acquired the travel agents hotel guide  a directory of hotels and resorts across north america and the caribbean that the company uses to acquire room nights on trade in exchange for advertising in the guide
