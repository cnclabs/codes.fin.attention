net earnings net earnings for increased over including the effects of after tax restructuring charges recorded in see net earnings discussion below 
excluding the effect of these restructuring charges  net earnings increased year over year 
this increase was less than the sales increase primarily due to operating expenses increasing at a faster rate than net sales offset by slightly higher gross profit margins 
operating expenses increased faster than sales primarily due to the company s continuing investment in the business infrastructure needed to support its market initiatives  increased employee benefits costs  and increased freight out expenses 
increased freight out expenses resulted from proportionally more shipments qualifying for prepaid freight and proportionally more orders being transferred within the zone distribution facilities branch network 
this partially resulted in orders being shipped longer distances 
these incremental expenses  by policy  were not billed to customers 
partially offsetting these increases were lower bad debt expenses  payroll costs increasing somewhat slower than the rate of sales growth  and decreased amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related costs associated with acquired and start up businesses 
the company s gross profit margin increased by percentage points when comparing the full years of and  excluding the effects of a restructuring charge of  percentage points of gross profit associated with inventory write downs taken during this slight increase was principally related to a favorable product mix as sales of non seasonal products grew at a higher rate than the sales of seasonal products 
the sales of seasonal products have historically had lower than average gross profit margins 
partially offsetting the favorable impacts was an unfavorable change in selling price category mix  which primarily resulted from the growth in sales to national accounts

this increase was greater than the sales increase primarily due to operating expenses increasing at a slower rate than sales  partially offset by lower gross margins 
the lower than sales increase for operating expenses was primarily the result of leveraging payroll and related benefit costs  lower amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related costs  and lower advertising expenses  partially offset by increased data processing expenses related to the ongoing significant upgrade of the grainger branch computer systems 
excluding restructuring charges  operating expenses increased on a year over year basis 
the company s gross margin was negatively affected by a restructuring charge of  associated with inventory write downs 
excluding the effect of the restructuring charge  the company s gross margins decreased by percentage points in compared with the gross margin decrease primarily resulted from a change in the selling price category mix and the level of cost increases exceeding the level of selling price increases 
the change in the selling price category mix was primarily the result of increased sales to grainger national accounts  and by a strategic repricing applicable to the contractor customer segment 
financial condition working capital was  at december  compared to  at december  and  at december  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was   and at such dates 
net cash flows from operations of  in   in  and  in have continued to improve the company s financial position and serve as the primary source of funding for capital requirements 
in each of the past three years  a portion of working capital has been used for additions to property  buildings  and equipment as summarized in the following table 
in thousands of dollars land  buildings  structures  and improvements    furniture  fixtures  and other equipment    total    the company did not repurchase any shares of common stock during or the company did repurchase  shares in approximately  shares of common stock remain available for repurchase under the existing authorization 
the company may resume share repurchases at any time 
dividends paid to shareholders were  in   in  and  in internally generated funds have been the primary source of working capital and funds for expansion including capital expenses relating to the facilities optimization program  supplemented by debt as circumstances dictated 
in addition to continuing facilities optimization efforts and infrastructure development to support current initiatives  long term cash requirements are anticipated for the consolidation of chicago area offices in the office facility to be constructed in lake county  illinois 
the company had no material financing commitments outstanding at december  the company continues to maintain a low debt ratio and strong liquidity position  which provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and long term cash requirements 
in addition to internally generated funds  the company has various sources of financing available  including commercial paper sales and bank borrowings under lines of credit and otherwise 
total debt as a percent of shareholders equity was   and  at december    and  respectively 
inflation and changing prices inflation during the last three years has not been a significant factor to operations 
the use of the last in  first out lifo method of accounting for inventories and accelerated depreciation methods for financial reporting and income tax purposes result in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in the primary financial statements 
the major impact of inflation is on buildings and improvements  where the gap between historic cost and replacement cost continues to be significant for these long lived assets 
the related depreciation expense associated with these assets increases significantly when adjusting for the cumulative effect of inflation 
the company believes the most positive means to combat inflation and advance the interests of investors lies in continued application of basic business principles  which include improving productivity  increasing working capital turnover  and offering products and services which can command proper price levels in the marketplace
