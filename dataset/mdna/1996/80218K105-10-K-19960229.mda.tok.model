item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general as an independent oil and gas producer  the company s results of operations are dependent upon the difference between the prices received for oil and gas and the costs of finding and producing such resources 
a material portion of the company s crude oil production is from long lived fields in the san joaquin valley of california where eor methods are being utilized 
the market price of the heavy ie  low gravity  high viscosity and sour ie  high sulfur content crude oils produced in these fields is lower than sweeter  light ie  low sulfur and low viscosity crude oils  reflecting higher transportation and refining costs 
in addition  the lifting costs of heavy crude oils are generally higher than the lifting costs of light crude oils 
as a result of these narrower margins  even relatively modest changes in crude oil prices may significantly affect the company s revenues  results of operations  cash flows and proved reserves 
in addition  prolonged periods of high or low oil prices may have a material effect on the company s financial position 
the lower price received for the company s domestic heavy and sour crude oil is reflected in the average sales price of the company s domestic crude oil and liquids excluding the effect of hedging transactions for of per barrel  compared to per barrel for west texas intermediate wti crude oil an industry posted price generally indicative of prices for sweeter light crude oil 
in the company s average sales price for california heavy crude oil was per barrel  approximately of the annual average posted price for wti 
crude oil prices are subject to significant changes in response to fluctuations in the domestic and world supply and demand and other market conditions as well as the world political situation as it affects opec  the middle east and other producing countries 
during and the actual average sales price unhedged received by the company ranged from a high of per barrel in the second quarter of to a low of per barrel for the first quarter of based on operating results for the year  the company estimates that a per barrel increase or decrease in its average domestic crude oil sales prices would result in a corresponding million change in income from operations and a million change in cash flow from operating activities 
the foregoing estimates do not give effect to changes in any other factors  such as the effect of the company s hedging program or depreciation and depletion  that would result from a change in oil prices 
the price of natural gas fluctuates due to weather conditions  the level of natural gas in storage  the relative balance between supply and demand and other economic factors 
the actual average sales price unhedged received by the company in for its natural gas ranged from a high of per mcf in the fourth quarter to a low of per mcf in the first quarter 
based on operating results for the year  the company estimates that a per mcf increase or decrease in its average domestic natural gas sales price would result in a corresponding million change in income from operations and a million change in cash flow from operating activities 
the foregoing estimates do not give effect to changes in any other factors  such as the effect of the company s hedging program or depletion and depreciation  that would result from a change in natural gas prices 
from time to time the company hedges a portion of its oil and gas sales to provide a certain minimum level of cash flow from its sales of oil and gas 
while the hedges are generally intended to reduce the company s exposure to declines in market price  the company s gain from increases in market price may be limited 
the company uses various financial instruments whereby monthly settlements are based on differences between the prices specified in the instruments and the settlement prices of certain futures contracts quoted on the new york mercantile exchange nymex or certain other indices 
generally  in instances where the applicable settlement price is less than the price specified in the contract  the company receives a settlement based on the difference  in instances where the applicable settlement price is higher than the specified price  the company pays an amount based on the difference 
the instruments utilized by the company differ from futures contracts in that there is no contractual obligation which requires or allows for the future delivery of the product 
gains or losses on hedging activities are recognized in oil and gas revenues in the period in which the hedged production is sold 
at december  the company had open crude hedges on i an average of  barrels per day for the period january to april at an average nymex wti price of per barrel and ii provided that the nymex wti price is greater than per barrel  up to an additional  barrels per day for the period january through march at an average nymex wti price of per barrel 
the approximate break even price the average of the settlement prices which result in no settlement being due to or from the company with respect to all such contracts is approximately per barrel 
the following table reflects estimated amounts due to or from the company assuming the stated settlement prices are in effect for the entire period the aforementioned hedges are in effect 
settlement price due to from company dollars per barrel millions of dollars during crude oil hedges resulted in a million increase in revenues 
subsequent to year end the company hedged an additional  barrels per day for the second quarter of and  provided that the settlement price is above  up to an additional  barrels per day for the second quarter of and  barrels per day for the third quarter of the approximate break even price is per barrel for the second quarter hedges and per barrel for the third quarter hedges 
at december  the company had open natural gas hedges on i an average of approximately mmcf per day of its gulf coast production for the entire year of at an approximate break even price of per mcf and ii an average of approximately mmcf per day of its permian basin production for the entire year of at an approximate break even price of per mcf 
due to its location  permian basin gas sells at a discount to gulf coast gas 
natural gas hedges resulted in decreases in revenues of million in and million in with respect to the gulf coast production hedges  a per mcf decrease or increase in the average settlement price for a month results in a  increase or decrease in revenues  respectively 
with respect to the permian basin production hedges  a per mcf decrease or increase in the average settlement price for a month results in a  increase or decrease in revenues  respectively 
in addition to its oil and gas sales hedges for the first six months of the company has hedged mmcf per day of the natural gas it purchases for use in its steam generation operations in the san joaquin valley of california 
monthly settlements are based on the difference between the settlement price quoted on the nymex and the index price for san juan basin natural gas 
gains or losses are recognized in production and operating costs in the period in which the hedged gas is consumed in operations 
in instances where the difference between the nymex price and the san juan basin index price is greater than  the company pays an amount based on the difference and in instances where the difference is less than  the company receives a payment based on the difference 
each per mcf change in the spread between the nymex price and the san juan basin index price results in a monthly increase or decrease in revenues of  results of operations revenues the following table reflects the components of the company s crude oil and liquids and natural gas revenues year ended december  crude oil and liquids revenues millions sales domestic california heavy other argentina indonesia hedging net profits payments volumes mbbls day domestic california heavy other argentina indonesia sales prices bbl domestic california heavy other total argentina indonesia total total hedged natural gas revenues millions sales domestic foreign hedging net profits payments volumes mmcf day domestic foreign sales prices mcf unhedged domestic foreign total hedged total revenues increased from million in to million in crude oil and liquids revenues increased million  primarily reflecting the effect of increased sales prices million and increased volumes million

accounting for stock based compensation fas  which established financial accounting and reporting standards for stock based employee compensation plans 
fas encourages companies to adopt a fair value based method of accounting for such plans but continues to allow the use of the intrinsic value based method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees opinion 
companies electing to continue accounting in accordance with opinion must make pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if the fair value based method defined in fas had been applied 
the company will continue to account for stock based compensation in accordance with opinion and will make pro forma disclosures in accordance with the provisions of fas beginning in its financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash flow from operating activities is a function of the volumes of oil and gas produced from the company s properties and the sales prices received therefor 
since crude oil and natural gas are depleting assets  unless the company replaces the oil and gas produced from its properties  the company s assets will be depleted over time and its ability to incur debt at constant or declining prices will be reduced 
the company increased its proved reserves net of production and sales by approximately over the five years ended december   however  no assurances can be given that such increase will occur in the future 
historically  the company has generally funded development and exploration expenditures and working capital requirements from cash provided by operating activities 
depending upon the future levels of operating cash flows  which are significantly affected by oil and gas prices  the restrictions on additional borrowings included in certain of the company s debt agreements  together with debt service requirements and dividends  may limit the cash available for future exploration  development and acquisition activities 
net cash provided by operating activities and net proceeds from sales of properties including million from the sale of hadson totalled million in  net cash used for capital expenditures and producing property acquisitions in such period totalled million 
the increase in accounts receivable from million at december  to million at december  primarily reflects a million receivable at december  related to a refund with respect to the audit of the company s federal income tax returns for through the decrease in amounts payable from million at december  to million at december  primarily reflects lower amounts payable with respect to capital projects in progress 
the decrease in accounts receivable from million at december  to million at december  primarily reflects lower receivables with respect to natural gas sales due to lower prices and an acceleration of the collection of such receivables resulting from the marketing arrangement with hadson and the collection of certain amounts with respect to the property sale to vintage which had been held in escrow  partially offset by an increase in receivables for oil sales  primarily due to higher sales prices 
the company s capital program totalled approximately million  a level which allowed the company to more than replace its production 
the company expects to expend approximately million on its program 
however  the actual amount expended by the company in will be based upon numerous factors  the majority of which are outside its control  including  without limitation  prevailing oil and natural gas prices and the outlook therefor and the availability of funds 
effective april  the company entered into the second amended and restated revolving credit agreement the credit agreement  an unsecured revolving credit agreement which matures december  the maximum borrowing limits under the credit agreement are initially million  million beginning february   million beginning february  and million beginning february  interest rates under the credit agreement are tied to libor or the bank s prime rate with the actual interest rate based upon certain ratios and the value and projected timing of production of the company s oil and gas reserves 
at december   million in letters of credit were outstanding under the terms of the credit agreement 
the company has three short term uncommitted lines of credit totalling million which are used to meet short term cash needs 
interest rates on borrowings under these lines of credit are typically lower than rates paid under the bank facility 
at december  no amounts were outstanding under these lines of credit 
certain of the company s credit agreements and the indenture for the debentures include covenants that restrict the company s ability to take certain actions  including the ability to incur additional indebtedness and to pay dividends on capital stock 
under the most restrictive of these covenants  at december  the company could incur up to million of additional indebtedness and pay dividends of up to million on its aggregate capital stock including its common stock  convertible preferred stock and series a preferred with the amount payable on its common stock limited to million 
environmental matters almost all phases of the company s oil and gas operations are subject to stringent environmental regulation by governmental authorities 
such regulation has increased the costs of planning  designing  drilling  installing  operating and abandoning oil and gas wells and other facilities 
the company has expended significant financial and managerial resources to comply with such regulations 
although the company believes its operations and facilities are in general compliance with applicable environmental regulations  risks of substantial costs and liabilities are inherent in oil and gas operations 
it is possible that other developments  such as increasingly strict environmental laws  regulations and enforcement policies or claims for damages to property  employees  other persons and the environment resulting from the company s operations  could result in significant costs and liabilities in the future 
as it has done in the past  the company intends to fund its cost of environmental compliance from operating cash flows 
see items and business and properties other business matters environmental regulation and note to the consolidated financial statements 
dividends dividends on the company s convertible preferred stock and series a preferred stock are cumulative at an annual rate of per share and per share  respectively 
no dividends may be declared or paid with respect to the company s common stock if any dividends with respect to the convertible preferred stock or series a preferred stock are in arrears 
none of the dividends with respect to the company s convertible preferred stock and series a preferred stock are in arrears 
the determination of the amount of future cash dividends  if any  to be declared and paid on the company s common stock is in the sole discretion of the company s board of directors and will depend on dividend requirements with respect to the preferred stock  the company s financial condition  earnings and funds from operations  the level of capital and exploration expenditures  dividend restrictions in financing agreements  future business prospects and other matters the board of directors deems relevant
