fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  the company experienced a net loss of million on revenues of million as compared to a net loss of million on revenues of million for fiscal the company s quad and quad mri scanners  together with other research and development projects  are intended to significantly improve the company s competitive position 
having received fda approval for its quad scanner in the fourth quarter of fiscal and for its quad scanner in the first quarter of fiscal  the company believes it is in a position to aggressively seek new sales 
the quad scanners are highly competitive and totally new non claustrophobic scanners not previously available in the mri market 
at 
tesla field strength  the quad magnet is the highest field open mri in the industry  offering non claustrophobic mri together with high field image quality for the first time 
the company expects vigorous sales from its new products 
as the company has expanded its operations and productive capacity to meet and anticipate new orders  costs and expenses increased in fiscal although cost of revenues remained at approximately million in  research and development  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to approximately million for fiscal from approximately million for fiscal the company has continued its program for upgrading previously installed scanners 
the versatility and productivity of mri technology creates the impetus for new uses 
as a result  new features are developed and sold to the company s customer base thereby extending the useful life of their equipment  avoiding obsolescence and minimizing capital expenditures 
upgrades consist of hardware  software and pulse sequences designed to maximize throughput while maintaining image quality and patient comfort 
as part of its marketing program  the company attended the industry s annual trade show  rsna radiological society of north america in november  and plans to do so again in november at the rsna show in  the company exhibited its new quad and quad scanners 
the company believes that it is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the rapidly expanding open mri market  as the manufacturer of the only high field open mri in the industry 
the company expects marked demand for this product since image quality increases as a direct proportion to magnetic field strength 
in addition  the company s new scanners provide improved image quality and high speed imaging at costs that are significantly less than the competition and more in keeping with the medical cost reduction demands being made by our national leaders on behalf of the public 
the company also believes that efforts to reduce infringement of its intellectual property rights by competitors have begun to produce material benefits  as reflected in the million judgment rendered in its favor against general electric company 
during the fiscal year the company commenced similar patent infringement suits against other major competitors see litigation 
as at september   the company s backlog of unfilled orders was approximately million  as compared to approximately million at september  the company continued to benefit as a result of programs set in motion in fiscal  namely strict cost containment initiatives and expanding the corporate business into other profitable enterprises within the mri industry 
as a result of this expansion  the percentage of the company s revenue derived from sources other than scanner sales customer service and upgrades was approximately for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the company believes  however  that this trend may have peaked in fiscal and when the percentage was approximately 
the percentages for fiscal  and were  and  respectively 
management expects that the percentage of revenue derived from scanner sales will continue to expand as a result of the introduction into the market of its new quad scanner products 
customer service and upgrades  however  are and will continue to be priorities for the company 
the company derived approximately million in upgrades income in  million in   in   in and  in significant research and development of new programs have been undertaken  which emphasize the development of new features for the company s scanner upgrade program 
continuing its tradition as the originator of mri the company remained committed to maintaining its position as the leading innovator of the industry through aggressive investing in research and development 
in fiscal the company continued its investment in the development of its new mri scanners together with software and upgrades  with an investment of  in research and development  of which was capitalized as compared to   of which was capitalized in fiscal the research and development expenditure was approximately of revenues in and of revenues in the company has continued its efforts to increase scanner sales in foreign countries as well as domestically

fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal the company experienced a loss of million on gross revenues of million  while in fiscal a loss of  was reported on gross revenues of million 
contributing to the company s net loss were the recognition in the fourth quarter of unfavorable judgments in excess of million in the aggregate 
the most significant of these actions were the  judgment against fonar s subsidiary amd in the kivitz et ano v 
amd et al 
action approximately million with accrued interest and the  judgment rendered against the company in myheal technologies et ano 
v 
fonar approximately  with accrued interest 
see litigation 
also significantly contributing to the company s net loss for the year were the continuing losses of its israeli subsidiary  medical sni formerly vonar ltd these losses were in the amount of  for fiscal and  for fiscal after giving effect to the minority interest 
lower revenues experienced in fiscal  as in fiscal  were the principal reason for the operating losses experienced in both fiscal years million in fiscal and million in fiscal 
lower revenues reflected strong competition and a continued weak domestic demand for mri scanners in a marketplace eager to see new products that would address both the heightened cost pressures on mri and the patient demand for non claustrophobic scanners 
as at september   the company s backlog of unfilled orders was approximately million  as compared to million at september  lower service and repair fees in fiscal  as in fiscal approximately million in fiscal as compared to approximately million in fiscal indirectly resulted from reduced sales  as well as from competition  as older scanners were retired 
overall  expenses increased from approximately million in fiscal to million in fiscal general and administrative expenses decreased from approximately million in fiscal to approximately million in fiscal  but research and development expenses increased from approximately million in fiscal to million in fiscal exclusive of the portion of such expenses capitalized  and selling and marketing expenses increased from approximately million in fiscal to million in fiscal the greatest part of the overall increase in expenses resulted from an increase in the compensatory element of stock issuances from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this increase resulted mostly from non recurring bonuses granted to a large number of employees 
the company notes that maintaining or increasing expenses are necessary for the company to realize its objective to develop and market new scanner products 
in fiscal the company invested  in research and development  of which was capitalized as compared to  in research and development  of which was capitalized in fiscal the research and development expenditure was approximately of revenues in and of revenues in liquidity and capital resources at june   the company s liquidity and capital resources positions changed from the june  position as follows june  june  change working capital deficiency    the improvement in the company s working capital position resulted primarily from an increase in current assets to million at june  from million at june  and a decrease in current liabilities from million in fiscal to million in fiscal 
the increase in current assets principally reflected an expansion of inventory  resulting from the company s increased manufacturing activity and an increase in cash 
the decrease in current liabilities resulted from the payment of various taxes and other obligations 
total liabilities were reduced since june  by approximately  to approximately million at june  since june  a principal objective of the company has been to reduce and ultimately eliminate its debt 
since the inception of the plan  interest bearing debt was reduced from million in fiscal to million in fiscal from june  through june   interest bearing debt was reduced by an additional million to million and from june  through june  interest bearing debt was reduced by an additional million to million 
from june  through june   interest bearing debt was reduced by million to million  and from june  to june  by million to million 
through june   interest bearing debt was reduced by an additional million to approximately million 
at june  interest bearing debt was approximately million 
as of june   the company had no unused credit facilities with banks or financial institutions 
while continuing to focus on new sources of income and cost containment  the company s business plan currently includes an aggressive program for manufacturing and selling its new line of quad scanners which are achieving success in the marketplace and which the company has had under development for four years 
the company expects to reduce its working capital deficiency during the current fiscal year by internally generated cash from operating profits and the refinancing and or restructuring of maturity terms of certain loans 
the company will also pursue equity financing alternatives 
the company believes that the above mentioned programs will provide the cash flows needed to achieve the sales  service and production levels necessary to support its operations 
the company offers its products for sale or lease to customers 
cash flows from leasing transactions are derived under the terms of the underlying agreements 
over the long term  the company expects enhanced cash flows and increased revenues from such transactions while in the short term  such transactions impair cash flow 
in order to mitigate the short term effect on cash flow  the company previously had borrowed money secured by the leases and the underlying equipment 
such debt comprises substantially all of the remaining long term debt in the accompanying financial statements 
since the company has restructured various long term loans and notes 
the significant changes included extended maturity dates  and the addition of unpaid interest to the note and loan balances 
capital expenditures for each of fiscal and approximated million  and substantially consisted of capitalized computer software costs in connection with the development of scanner products  patent costs and copyright costs and production equipment 
the company s business plan initiated in september  had as its objective the enhancement and stabilization of revenue streams through the generation of additional income from its installed base of scanners and leasing programs 
in addition  the company instituted strict cost containment programs 
while continuing to focus on new sources of income  the company now has commenced aggressive sales and manufacturing of its new generation of open mri scanners  the quad scanners and is reemphasizing mri scanner sales 
cost containment programs continue in force notwithstanding an increase in costs and expenses resulting from increased manufacturing activity and marketing of its mri scanners 
these programs  which include increasing the portion of manufacturing conducted on the company s premises  have enabled the company to achieve significantly lower manufacturing costs than would have otherwise been experienced in the production of its quad scanners 
this has enabled the company to pass on to customers a much needed reduction in the sales price of mri scanners 
the company s plan calls for a continuing emphasis on providing its customers with enhanced equipment service and maintenance capabilities and delivering state of the art  innovative and high quality equipment upgrades at competitive prices 
fees for on going service and maintenance from the company s installed base of scanners were million for the year ended june  and million for the year ended june  the company will continue to aggressively develop and market upgrades and enhancements for previously installed scanners 
the company s working capital deficiency as of june  approximates million  down from million as of june  and million as of june  the company expects to reduce this deficiency further 
this is to be accomplished by internally generated cash from operating profits and the refinancing and or restructuring of maturity terms of certain loans now classified as short term obligations 
the company also will pursue equity financing alternatives 
the company believes that the above mentioned financing arrangements and programs will provide the cash flows needed to achieve the sales  service and production levels necessary to support its operations 
in addition  the company is exploring other more permanent financing alternatives which may become available as the success of the previously described programs accelerates
