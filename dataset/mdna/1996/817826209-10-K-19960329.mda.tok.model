management strategies since  the company has been committed to several key strategies that it believes  over the long term  will further differentiate it from its competitors and allow eleven to maintain its position as the premier convenience store chain in the industry 
these strategies include an upgraded store base  a customer driven approach to product selection  an everyday fair pricing policy on all items  daily delivery of fresh perishable items  introduction of high quality  ready to eat fresh foods  and the implementation of a retail automation system 
the company plans to upgrade its store base by remodeling existing stores  closing underperforming stores and developing new sites 
over the last few years  the company has devoted the majority of its capital resources toward the most extensive remodeling of its store base ever undertaken 
in conjunction with the remodeling program  the company has been pruning its store base by closing or disposing of those stores that are not expected to achieve an acceptable level of profitability in the future 
as a result  the company closed stores in  in and in the company expects to complete its remodeling program by the end of this year  however  it will continue to refurbish its store base as necessary 
the planning process for new store sites is well under way 
the company s capital investment focus will shift to store development see liquidity and capital resources capital expenditures 
initial plans are to strengthen its position by expanding the store base in existing markets  with store openings in expected to offset store closings dispositions 
however  by the company expects new store openings to significantly outpace closures each year 
the customer driven approach to merchandising  which was adopted by the company in  continues to focus on providing the customer an expanded selection of quality products at a good value 
this is being accomplished by emphasizing the importance of ordering at the store level  removing slow moving items and aggressively introducing new products in the early stages of their life cycle 
this process  which has contributed to improved sales and profits  will be an ongoing part of managing our business in a continual effort to satisfy the everchanging preferences of our customers 
the company s everyday fair pricing strategy  which was introduced in  has provided consistent prices on all items by reducing its reliance on discounting 
as a result  some product prices were increased  while others were lowered to achieve more consistent pricing on all products 
going forward  the company plans to migrate toward lower retail prices as lower product costs are achieved through contract negotiations or strategic alliances with suppliers and distributors 
daily delivery of fresh perishable items and high quality ready to eat foods is another key management strategy 
implementation of this strategy includes third party development and operation of combined distribution centers cdc  fresh food commissaries and bakery facilities in most of the company s markets around the country 
the commissary and bakery ready to eat items  like fresh sandwiches and pastries  along with goods from multiple vendors such as dairy products  produce and other perishable goods  are combined at a distribution center and delivered daily to each store 
in addition to providing fresher products and improving in stock conditions from daily deliveries  the combined distribution is also intended to provide lower product costs  in part from vendors savings  through this approach 
the company expects the improved freshness and lower cost of the products from these operations to improve sales and gross profits 
at the end of  over stores were serviced by the cdc s and carried fresh food products manufactured by the commissaries 
further expansion of these programs is anticipated in in the following markets denver colorado springs  baltimore  richmond norfolk  san jose  orlando tampa  and chicago 
when operational  cdc s in these markets will make daily delivered fresh food available to nearly one half of the company s stores 
the development of a retail automation system began in the initial phase  which will be completed in early  involves installing in store processors isp in each store that will automate accounting and other store level tasks 
the second phase involves installing cash registers which  among other things  will feed data directly to the isp 
after future phases are complete  the system will provide each store and its suppliers and distributors with on line information to make better decisions in anticipating customer needs 
sales the company recorded net sales of billion for the year ended december   compared to sales of billion in and billion in to strengthen its store base see management strategies  the company has closed more than underachieving stores over the last three years 
same store merchandise sales increases since have minimized the lost sales from store closings  resulting in total sales remaining flat during this time period 
in addition  and merchandise sales results were adversely impacted by the deflationary effect of cigarette price reductions on certain premium brands associated with manufacturers cost reductions starting in august  the total sales increase in was primarily due to higher gasoline gallons and retail sales price per gallon

overall  domestic same store merchandise sales growth continued its positive trend in  however  results varied by geographic region 
the largest increases occurred in those areas with the highest percentage of completed remodels florida  texas colorado

in addition  this is the area where the lowest percentage of remodels has been completed 
gasoline sales dollars per store increased  and in  and  respectively 
this improvement is primarily due to per store gallonage improvement of in  in and in  reflecting the impact of several successful business strategies 
gallon volumes in did not sustain the high growth levels experienced in and as a result of market factors which affect the way the company manages its gasoline business 
other income other income of million for was million higher than and million higher than the improvement is primarily the result of increased royalty income from licensed operations 
gross profits merchandise gross profit data years ended december merchandise gross profit dollars in millions    increase decrease from prior year average per store gross profit dollar change margin percentage point change 

average per store merchandise sales even though total merchandise gross profits have declined primarily from fewer stores  merchandise gross profit per store has consistently improved over prior year results for each of the last twelve quarters 
merchandise gross profit margins in increased as a result of the company s implementation of its everyday fair pricing strategy  which reduced discounting and promotional activities see management strategies 
margins have also been favorably affected by lower cigarette costs beginning in august and lower product costs under the company s supply agreement with mclane 
in  with the reduction of discounting in place  the company tested lower prices in certain parts of the country as part of a more aggressive everyday fair pricing strategy 
these lower prices  combined with increased costs for disposal of slow moving merchandise  was primarily responsible for the decrease in merchandise margins 
during  merchandise margin declined slightly compared to while some higher margin categories  such as services  showed good growth throughout the year  overall merchandise margin declined in the fourth quarter almost 
percent compared to the same period last year 
this decline was the result of several factors including rising costs that were not entirely passed on to the consumer  initial introductory costs associated with new fresh food products and increased focus on deleting slower moving items 
management is actively working to maintain a merchandise margin level consistent with last year 
gasoline gross profit data years ended december gasoline gross profit dollars in millions increase decrease from prior year average per store gross profit dollar change margin point change in cents per gallon

the company continues to review the functions necessary to enable its stores to respond faster and more cost efficiently to rapidly changing customer needs and preferences 
in conjunction with this review  the company continues to realign and reduce personnel and office facilities  in order to eliminate non essential costs
