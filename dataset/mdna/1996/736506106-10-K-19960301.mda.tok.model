item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
regulation pge is subject to regulation by the opuc  which consists of a three member commission appointed by the governor 
the opuc approves pge s retail rates and establishes conditions of utility service 
the opuc ensures that prices are fair and equitable and provides pge an opportunity to earn a fair return on its investment 
in addition  the opuc regulates the issuance of securities and prescribes the system of accounts to be kept by oregon utilities 
pge is also subject to the jurisdiction of ferc with regard to the transmission and sale of wholesale electric energy  licensing of hydroelectric projects and certain other matters 
construction of new generating facilities requires a permit from efsc 
the nrc regulates the licensing and decommissioning of nuclear power plants 
in the nrc issued a possession only license amendment to pge s trojan operating license 
trojan will be subject to nrc regulation until trojan is fully decommissioned  all nuclear fuel is removed from the site and the license is terminated 
the oregon department of energy also monitors trojan 
oregon regulatory matters regulatory environment the opuc is presently approaching issues of retail competition on an informal  utility by utility basis  rather than through generic  broad based proceedings such as other states are pursuing 
the opuc has long had a policy of allowing special contracts for customers that have competitive options  and many of pge s largest customers receive power under such contracts 
in addition  the opuc last year approved an innovative rate schedule under which pge is sharing some of the risks and rewards of a more competitive wholesale market with large industrial and commercial customers not already under special contract 
the opuc is currently exploring performance based ratemaking in a rate case for another oregon investor owned utility and  with regard to pge  has expressed interest in receiving proposals for accelerated recovery of regulatory assets 
recent rate orders have significantly reduced the uncertainty associated with pge s recovery of various regulatory assets  as well as reduced the overall total of such assets 
the opuc approved recovery of most of pge s remaining investment in trojan and full recovery of trojan s decommissioning costs 
the opuc also authorized pge to simultaneously reduce certain regulatory assets and liabilities see discussion of recent rate orders below 
general rate order in march the opuc issued an order on pge s general rate request after an month process 
the order  based on a two year test period  authorized a single average rate increase of representing additional revenues of million in and million in the tariff change  which increased residential rates  commercial rates and industrial rates  became effective april  the order established pge s return on equity at  a decrease from the previously authorized 
the order authorized pge to recover all of the estimated trojan decommissioning costs and of its remaining investment in trojan 
these amounts will be collected over trojan s original license period ending in the order also adopted a mechanism to decouple short term profits from retail kilowatt hour sales during the two year test period decoupling 
the disallowed portion of the trojan investment  on a net of tax basis  is comprised of million of post capital expenditures  primarily related to steam generator repair activities  and million of general trojan investment 
as a result of this disallowance  pge recorded a first quarter after tax charge to income of million 
the decoupling mechanism adopted by the opuc set revenue targets associated with retail loads for each month beginning april through december if actual weather adjusted retail revenues exceed or fall short of target revenues  pge will refund or collect the difference from customers over an month period 
the adjustment at any time during the two year period cannot result in an overall increase or decrease in rates  due solely to decoupling  of more than in total 
adjustments to rates  if necessary  can be made every six months 
large commercial and industrial customers are excluded from the decoupling mechanism 
new rates  effective april  included approximately million of variable power cost savings expected from the future commercial operation of coyote springs 
the order did not include projected capital and fixed costs associated with coyote springs nor the collection of pge s power cost deferrals which were addressed in a subsequent rate proceeding discussed below 
legal challenges have been filed against the opuc s rate order see item  legal proceedings  for further discussion 
power cost recovery and coyote springs order in november the opuc issued an order authorizing pge to increase rates by an average to recover the capital and fixed costs associated with coyote springs and an october bpa price increase 
the order resulted in a million increase in annual revenues for the company 
new prices became effective in late november concurrent with the commercial operation of coyote springs 
the order addressed recovery of approximately million of incremental power costs incurred after the closure of trojan 
while the order authorized full recovery of million of power costs deferred in early  it allowed recovery of only million of the million of excess power costs deferred from july through march the order also authorized the immediate recovery of approximately million in incentive revenues associated with prior years achievements of the company s energy efficiency programs 
pge recorded a million after tax charge to income in the third quarter of to reflect the write off of unrecoverable costs 
the order implemented the company s proposal to offset certain regulatory assets including the uncollected balance of all power cost deferrals  incentive revenues and a portion of the remaining trojan investment  against pge s unamortized gain on the prior sale of a portion of boardman 
the offset allowed for recovery of the deferred power costs and incentive revenues and the elimination of approximately million of regulatory assets and liabilities from the company s balance sheets without increasing customer rates 
a party to the rate proceeding has requested that the opuc reconsider the order 
a decision on the motion is pending from the opuc 
under the terms adopted in the order  pge withdrew its appeal of the boardman gain issue in pge v 
ronald eachus  myron katz  nancy ryles and the opuc  marion county circuit court see item  legal proceedings  for further discussion 
residential exchange program the rpa  passed in  attempted to resolve growing power supply and cost inequities between customers of government and publicly owned utilities  who have priority access to the low cost power from the federal hydroelectric system  and the customers of ious 
the rpa residential exchange program exists to ensure that all residential and farm customers in the region  the vast majority of which are served by ious  receive similar benefits from the publicly funded federal power system 
exchange program benefits are passed directly to residential and farm customers 
the exchange benefit for pge residential and small farm customers totaled million for calendar year in july  the bpa released its rate proposal  which included a significant reduction in the benefits to pge s customers from the residential exchange program under the rpa 
under recent congressional legislation  this exchange benefit will decline by to million  annually  on october  the amount of the residential exchange benefit beginning october  is among the subjects of current regional discussions regarding bpa s role in the region 
in the opuc allowed pge to pass through a bpa price increase which reduced exchange benefits million  resulting in a corresponding increase in electricity prices to residential and small farm customers 
energy efficiency pge has promoted the efficient use of electricity for over two decades 
jointly  pge and the opuc have worked together to provide appropriate financial incentives for pge s energy efficiency programs 
in  pge and the opuc first implemented the share all value equitably save program 
the program was designed to remove the financial disincentive to the company of pursuing cost effective demand side management dsm measures 
during the four year program  which ended in  pge invested million in dsm measures and achieved an annualized mwa of saved energy 
pge invested an additional million during in dsm programs resulting in an additional mwa in annual energy savings 
the company is allowed a return of and a return on its energy efficiency program expenditures 
current dsm programs provide a range of services to all classes of pge customers 
these programs seek to capitalize on windows of opportunity in which dsm measures are most cost effective  such as new residential and commercial construction  and the replacement and renovation markets 
pge continues to provide a weatherization program for eligible low income families 
pge recognizes the value of and remains committed to encouraging the efficient use of energy 
with the prospect of increased competition and customer choice  pge is focusing its dsm efforts more toward customer needs and wants 
the goal is to allow more customer choice in determining what amount of energy efficiency is appropriate to satisfy business and lifestyle choices 
pge will meet these needs through cost effective dsm services to its customers in the form of energy expertise and information  project facilitation and financing support 
least cost energy planning the opuc adopted least cost energy planning for all energy utilities in oregon with the goal of selecting the mix of options that yields an adequate and reliable supply of energy at the least cost to the utilities and customers 
demand side options ie  conservation and load management as well as traditional supply side options ie  generation and purchase of power are evaluated 
although utility management continues to be fully responsible for decision making  the process allows the opuc and the public to participate in resource planning 
ratemaking decisions are not made in the planning process 
however  participation by the opuc and the public may reduce the uncertainty regarding the ratemaking treatment of actions consistent with a plan acknowledged by the opuc 
in november  pge s integrated resource plan irp was submitted to the opuc for review and acknowledgment in fulfillment of its least cost planning obligation 
under the irp  pge will rely on the increasingly competitive energy marketplace to meet near term load growth and reliability needs 
pge will make economical use of existing assets and engage in system efficiency improvements 
pge s just in time resource acquisition strategy calls for reducing the lead time required for new generating capacity by completing the siting and permitting process in advance of a need for additional resources 
as noted above  pge will refocus dsm activities to deliver customer value and choice while emphasizing the economic viability of each program 
pge anticipates acknowledgment of its irp by the opuc by mid competition and marketing progress toward greater customer choice and direct access to customers by all competitors has been dramatic in the last two years 
the national energy policy act of energy act allows the ferc to order wholesale wheeling between utilities 
the energy act reserved the right to order true retail wheeling to the individual states 
retail wheeling is the movement of electric energy produced and sold by another entity over an electric utility s transmission and distribution system  to a retail customer in the utility s service territory 
retail wheeling would permit retail customers to purchase electric capacity and energy from any electric utility or power supplier 
recently  michigan ordered utilities in that state to test mw of retail wheeling 
california has proposed a comprehensive restructuring of electric utility regulation that would lead to intense competition for customers and free choice for all customers by although the opuc has not yet considered similar measures  in the coming years the company s growth will increasingly be influenced by competitive factors rather than within the traditional regulatory framework 
the electric industry is in the early stages of an increasingly competitive climate that is already making dramatic differences in the way the company produces  transmits  distributes and markets electric energy and associated services 
during pge aligned the company along its major business lines energy services encompassing retail sales  marketing and customer service  wholesale marketing  and power supply encompassing hydro and thermal power operations 
trading floor operations in pge established its trading floor operations which fully integrates the company s wholesale marketing  energy supply  financial risk management and power operations functions 
the trading floor activities seek to enhance pge s competitive position in retail and wholesale markets by assuring a reliable  low cost supply of energy to meet retail and wholesale loads and enhance the company s ability to profitably market to current and emerging wholesale markets 
retail competition and marketing pge operates within a state approved service area and under current regulation is substantially free from direct retail competition with other electric utilities 
pge s competitors within its oregon service territory include other fuel suppliers  such as the local natural gas company  which compete with pge for the residential and commercial space and water heating market 
in addition there is the potential of a loss of pge service territory to the creation of public utility districts by voters 
in the near term much of the company s business is likely to remain regulated with progress toward increased retail competition taking place in stages 
for example  basic residential electric service is likely to remain highly regulated with little competition  while industrial service may see rapid development of competition 
deregulation of other industries such as telecommunications has led to a host of new suppliers  products and services 
the same is expected for the electric industry as more and more groups of customers will have increasing degrees of choice and alternative suppliers from whom to purchase 
increased competition presents both a threat and an opportunity 
pge is preparing to meet varying levels of competition from traditional and non traditional sources in the various retail markets within its service territory as well as throughout the western united states 
much of the company s growth potential may no longer be limited by service territory boundaries 
the company plans to look beyond traditional boundaries at opportunities to serve customers with energy related products and services allowable in the current regulated markets and to be prepared to further expand as greater access to these markets emerges 
within the core markets that make up pge s current service territory  the company will continue to deliver quality electric service by focusing on traditional values like reliability  cost management  resource acquisition  effective energy efficiency services  safe operations and responsive customer oriented service 
in addition  the company plans to provide an array of new products and services to its existing and prospective customers 
for instance  pge launched its power smart marketing campaign to encourage the wise use of beneficial electro technologies 
other services currently being offered or under development include distribution services  such as power quality related services and lighting maintenance  power services  such as load following and system control  utility services  such as automated billing services and outage management  and retail services  such as power quality and time of day rates 
wholesale competition and marketing during the last few years  the western united states has become a vibrant marketplace for the trading of electricity in which pge has become an active participant 
wholesale sales continue to make a significant contribution to company revenues 
during pge s wholesale sales increased over levels and accounted for of total revenues and of total sales 
however  a surplus of energy  in conjunction with the entrance of numerous marketers brokers  independent power producers and affiliates of electric utilities  has increased the competition for market share and is resulting in lower prices and profit margins 
during  the average price of pge s wholesale sales decreased 
pge plans to utilize its wholesale marketing experience to expand its presence in the western united states 
wholesale activities are focused on both bulk energy markets and large end user customers that can purchase energy directly from the market 
as part of this effort  pge recently established wholesale power marketing offices in other western states 
in ferc is expected to issue new rules creating open access to the nation s electric transmission grid 
the new rules could create even higher levels of competition in the bulk power markets as all wholesale buyers and sellers have equal access to transmission resources 
utilities such as pge will be required to make their transmission systems available to anyone on the same terms and costs that they offer to themselves 
in november  pge filed an open access transmission tariff with ferc in response to the ferc notice of proposed rulemaking 
the company s transmission system connects winter peaking utilities in the northwest and canada  which have access to low cost hydroelectric generation  with summer peaking wholesale customers in california and the southwest  which have higher cost fossil fuel generation 
pge has used this system to purchase and sell in both markets depending upon the relative price and availability of power  water conditions  and seasonal demand from each market 
under its open access tariff the company will lose any competitive advantage it may have had through the use of its transmission assets for wholesale transactions 
open access may provide new opportunities as the company has equal access to the transmission capabilities of other utilities 
the company has actively participated in the development of a nymex electric futures contract and promoted cob as the preferred physical delivery point for pricing purposes 
a nymex contract has been approved to facilitate electric futures trading by april pge is prepared to be an active participant in the market 
power supply growth within pge s service territory as well as its aggressive wholesale marketing plans have underscored the company s need for sources of reliable  low cost energy supplies such as the abundant hydro resources of the pacific northwest 
the demand for energy within pge s service territory has experienced an average annual growth rate of approximately over the past years 
during pge expects an even greater level of load growth due to a vibrant economy and the expansion plans of the high tech industry in the region 
the emerging wholesale energy marketplace has caused pge to postpone the acquisition of significant additional new generating resources and capacity for the foreseeable future 
rather pge will rely on the purchase of power in the wholesale market to supplement its existing base of hydro and thermal generating resources 
generating capability pge s existing hydroelectric  coal fired and gas fired plants are key resources for the company  providing  mw of generating capability see item  properties  for a full listing of pge s generating facilities 
pge s lowest cost producers are its eight hydroelectric projects on the clackamas  sandy  deschutes  and willamette rivers in oregon 
in generation from pge s hydroelectric facilities met of the company s total load 
in pge completed construction of coyote springs  a mw  gas fired facility 
coyote spring is the company s first plant addition since boardman in and adds a state of the art combined cycle combustion turbine plant to its thermal generating resources 
its initial operation during the fourth quarter of provided over  mwh of generation at a cost below the average cost of company spot market purchases 
purchased power pge has long term power contracts with four hydro projects on the mid columbia river which provide pge with mw of firm capacity 
pge also has firm contracts  ranging in term from one to years  to purchase energy  primarily hydro generated  from other pacific northwest utilities for mw 
in addition  pge has long term exchange contracts with summer peaking southwest utilities to help meet its winter peaking requirements 
in total  the above contracts provide pge  mw of firm capacity to serve pge s peak loads 
pge has increasingly utilized short term purchases to meet its energy needs 
short term contracts include all spot  or secondary  purchases as well as firm purchases for periods less than one year in duration 
during  of pge s power purchases were under short term agreements compared to in short term energy prices have remained at levels which make long term power and capacity contracts unattractive 
pge s short term purchases averaged less than the cost of energy bought under long and intermediate term firm power contracts 
a continued surplus of energy within the region  the emergence of a nymex electric futures contract and open transmission anticipated during are expected to continue to place competitive pressures on the market price of short term power 
pge is susceptible to wholesale price increases due to its reliance on purchased power 
system reliability and the wscc pge relies on wholesale market purchases within the wscc in conjunction with its base of generating resources to supply its resource needs and maintain system reliability 
the wscc is geographically the largest of the nine regional electric reliability councils 
the wscc performs an essential role in developing and monitoring established reliability criteria guides and procedures to ensure continued reliability of the region s electric system 
during the last few years  the area covered by wscc has become a dynamic marketplace for the trading of electricity 
this region  which includes the western states  is very diverse in climates 
peak loads occur at different times of the year in the different regions 
energy loads in the southwest peak in summer due to air conditioning  northern loads peak during winter heating months 
further  according to wscc forecasts  the electric organizations participating in the wscc  which include utilities  independent power producers and transmission utilities  have sufficient generating capacity to cover loads to greater than anticipated peak loads for each month of the year beyond the year assuming adverse water conditions 
favorable water conditions have the ability to even further increase energy supplies with inexpensive hydro generated power 
during pge s peak load was  mw of which over was met through economical short term purchases 
the remaining load was met through a combination of company owned generation and firm power purchase contracts discussed above 
pge s firm resource capacity totaled  mw as of december  pge reached a new system record in february of  mw 
the availability of wholesale power has made the traditional utility reserve margin less relevant 
the need for an individual utility to maintain a reserve margin of or higher in order to assure that it has the capacity to meet  without interruption  customer peak energy needs is no longer necessary 
year in review pge generated of its load requirements in compared with in firm and secondary purchases met the remaining load 
regional water conditions were about of normal 
average precipitation in the columbia river basin increased the availability of inexpensive hydropower on the secondary market in mild weather  lower gas prices and increased competition also contributed to the availability of inexpensive power 
outlook the early predictions of water conditions indicate they will be about normal in while this should result in similar levels of hydro generation as in  efforts to restore salmon runs on the columbia and snake rivers may affect the supply and price of purchased power 
restoration of salmon runs several species of snake river salmon are protected as threatened under the endangered species act esa 
in an attempt to save the endangered fish  the federal government has taken actions that have reduced the amount of electricity generated at the columbia and snake river dams 
in early  the national marine fisheries service nmfs will release its recovery plan  which is expected to be similar to the draft plan released in nmfs is empowered by the esa to require salmon protection measures by the bureau of reclamation and the army corps of engineers  the agencies that operate the federal dams on these rivers 
certain measures contained in the draft plan were implemented during river flows were boosted and water was released over spillways while young salmon were migrating during the spring and summer in an attempt to protect the fish from entering the turbines 
if this practice is continued it could mean less water available in the fall and winter when demand for electricity in the pacific northwest is highest 
although pge does not have any hydro electric facilities on rivers affected by the plan  it does buy large amounts of energy from the agencies which do 
pge s fish biologists are working with state and federal agencies to ensure that pge s hydro operations located on several columbia river tributaries are compatible with the survival of wild salmon and other wildlife 
pge does not expect the esa process to significantly impact its own hydro generation 
however  pge is working cooperatively with federal and state agencies  tribes  and the public to return salmon and steelhead to their historic habitat above dams built on the deschutes river 
new resources the company does not plan to build new generating resources in the forseeable future but will rely on the current surplus of wholesale energy to meet its growing power needs 
accordingly  the company has developed a resource strategy which combines flexibility and a just in time acquisition philosophy to provide a response to potential persistent increases in wholesale prices 
specifically  pge plans to complete the siting and permitting process for the construction of additional new combined cycle combustion turbine projects 
this two step process separates siting and engineering from the decision to construct a new resource and significantly reduces the lead time for a new plant by as much as two years 
this process also moves decisions involving large capital commitments as close as possible to the anticipated time the power will be needed 
pge is also evaluating efficiency improvements at its existing facilities including the repowering of beaver and upgrades at the company s hydro facilities 
fuel supply pge manages its fuel supply contracts as part of its trading floor operations 
fuel supply contracts are negotiated to support annual planned plant operations 
flexibility in contract terms is sought to allow for the most economic dispatch of pge s thermal resources in conjunction with the current market price of wholesale power 
coal boardman pge has an agreement to supply coal to boardman through the year which does not require a minimum amount of coal to be purchased  allowing pge to obtain coal from other sources 
during pge did not take deliveries under this contract but purchased coal under favorable short term agreements 
coal purchases in contained less than of sulfur by weight and emitted less than the epa allowable limit of pounds of sulfur dioxide per mmbtu when burned 
the coal  from surface mining operations in the powder river basin  was subject to federal  state  and local regulations 
coal is delivered to boardman by rail under a contract which expires in colstrip coal for units and  located in southeastern montana  is provided under contract with western energy company  a wholly owned subsidiary of montana power company 
the contract provides that the coal delivered will not exceed a maximum sulfur content of by weight 
the colstrip plant has sulfur dioxide removal equipment to allow operation in compliance with epa s source performance emission standards 
centralia coal for units and  located in southwestern washington  is provided under contract with pacificorp doing business as pacificorp electric operations 
most of centralia s coal requirements are expected to be provided under this contract for the foreseeable future 
sulfur type of pollution plant content control equipment boardman  or electrostatic precipitators centralia  wa electrostatic precipitators colstrip  mt scrubbers and precipitators natural gas in addition to the agreements discussed below  the company utilizes short term agreements and spot market purchases to secure transportation capacity and gas supplies sufficient to fuel plant operations 
beaver pge owns of a pipeline which directly connects beaver to northwest pipeline  an interstate gas pipeline operating between british columbia and new mexico 
during  pge had access to  mmbtu per day of firm transportation capacity  or enough to operate beaver at approximately capacity 
coyote springs in november of  pge began service to its coyote springs project utilizing firm transportation capacity of  mmbtu day on the interconnected systems of various shippers 
two year contracts expiring in supply natural gas to coyote springs at a load factor 
pge also obtained the required licenses and certificates necessary for the company to independently bring natural gas from canada which will provide pge with the opportunity to contract directly with canadian suppliers of natural gas to support coyote springs operations 
environmental matters pge operates in a state recognized for environmental leadership 
pge s environmental stewardship policy emphasizes minimizing waste in its operations  minimizing environmental risk and promoting energy efficiency 
environmental regulation pge is subject to regulation by federal  state  and local authorities with regard to air and water quality  noise  waste disposal  and other environmental issues 
pge is also subject to the rivers and harbors act of and similar oregon laws under which it must obtain permits from the us army corps of engineers or the oregon division of state lands to construct facilities or perform activities in navigable waters of the state 
the epa regulates the proper use  transportation  clean up and disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs 
state agencies or departments which have direct jurisdiction over environmental matters include the environmental quality commission  the deq  the oregon department of energy and efsc 
environmental matters regulated by these agencies include the siting and operation of generating facilities and the accumulation  cleanup and disposal of toxic and hazardous wastes 
air water quality congress passed amendments to the clean air act act that will renew and intensify national efforts to reduce air pollution 
significant reductions in emissions of sulfur dioxide  nitrogen oxide and other contaminants will be required over the next several years 
coal fired plant operations will be affected by these emission limitations 
federal implementing standards under the act are being drafted at the present time 
state governments are also charged with monitoring and administering certain portions of the act 
each state is required to set guidelines that at least equal the federal standards 
in  the epa issued its final allocation of emission allowances 
boardman was assigned sufficient allowances to operate after the year at a to capacity factor without having to further reduce emissions 
pge has purchased additional allowances and anticipates being able to operate the plant at a normal capacity factor 
centralia will be required to reduce emissions by the year  and the owners are examining several options such as installing scrubbers  converting to lower sulfur coal or natural gas  or purchasing emission allowances 
it is not anticipated that colstrip will be required to reduce emissions because it utilizes scrubbers 
however  future legislation  if adopted  could affect plant operations and increase operating costs or reduce coal fired capacity 
boardman s air contaminant discharge permit  issued by the deq  has no limitations on power production 
this permit expires in the year the water pollution control facilities permit for boardman expired in may the deq is processing the permit application and renewal is expected 
in the interim  boardman is permitted to continue operating under the terms of the original permit 
deq air contaminant discharge permits for the combustion turbine generators at bethel expired in and were replaced by new federal permits 
bethel was one of the first plants in the nation to successfully pass the more rigorous federal permitting process 
deq still limits night operations to one unit due to noise considerations 
maximum plant operations are allowed during the day 
the combustion turbines are allowed to operate on either natural gas or oil 
pge is no longer accepting oil shipments by river for its beaver plant in order to eliminate the risk of an oil spill into the columbia river 
instead  the rail off loading facility has been upgraded 
this plant is normally fired by natural gas  and only small amounts of oil are used 
environmental cleanup pge is involved with others in the environmental clean up of pcb contaminants at various sites as a potentially responsible party prp 
the clean up effort is considered complete at several sites which are awaiting consent orders from the appropriate regulatory agencies 
future clean up costs associated with these sites are not expected to be material

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations general portland general reported earnings of million or per share  compared to million or per share for results include a million after tax charge to income related to the opuc s rate orders disallowing certain deferred power costs and of pge s remaining investment in trojan 
earnings include the restoration to income of million  after tax  of previously recorded real estate reserves 
excluding the effect of the regulatory disallowances  income from continuing operations would have been million compared to million in pge accounts for substantially all of portland general s assets  revenues and net income 
the following discussion focuses on pge utility operations  unless otherwise noted 
compared to strong operating earnings reflected the benefits of low variable power costs due to improved hydro conditions  lower natural gas prices and a competitive wholesale market 
the company also benefited from continued sales growth and a retail price increase 
retail revenues increased million  or nearly  due largely to the company s general rate increase and continued load growth 
an average general rate increase effective april  coupled with a  mwh increase in energy sales  resulted in million of additional revenue 
an increase in retail customers of  and a continuing strong local economy resulted in weather adjusted load growth of 
industrial customers contributed the major portion of load growth for the year due to the recent expansion of high technology and supporting industries in the region 
weather adjusted load for residential customers increased over last year 
over  residential customers were added during retail revenue increases were partially offset by warmer than normal weather during winter heating months which decreased residential demand for energy  and a decrease in accrued revenues  a result of fewer power cost deferrals and save incentive revenues 
wholesale sales contributed million or approximately of total operating revenues 
the company s aggressive marketing efforts resulted in a increase in sales  however  revenues declined million as average prices decreased 
variable power costs fell million  or  despite increased company load as the average cost of power decreased from to mills mills cent 
improved hydro conditions  mild weather  cheaper natural gas  and competition among suppliers all contributed to abundant and low cost supplies of secondary energy in the region 
company hydro generation increased  or  mwh  reflecting good water conditions on the clackamas river system similar to those experienced throughout the west 
energy purchases were up due to increased loads and thermal displacement  while abundant supplies of energy drove secondary prices below levels 
secondary purchases averaged mills  ranging from to mills  compared to an average mills in throughout the year pge was able to economically dispatch or displace thermal generation in response to movements in the cost of short term power 
low cost hydro significantly displaced pge thermal generation  which decreased from beaver generated electricity at lower cost due to favorable gas prices 
resource mix variable power costs average variable resource mix power cost mills kwh generation firm purchases secondary purchases total operating expenses excluding variable power costs  depreciation and income taxes were million  or  higher primarily due to storm damages incurred in december a combination of wind and ice storms caused a record number of customer outages in pge s service territory 
repair efforts to restore customers service included around the clock efforts from pge personnel and contract crews at a total cost exceeding million  of which pge is self insured for the first million 
a march general rate order disallowed recovery of of pge s trojan investment resulting in a million after tax charge to income 
pge also recorded a million after tax third quarter loss as a result of an opuc order which disallowed recovery of a portion of the company s deferred power costs 
for further information on the opuc order  see note  regulatory matters 
depreciation increased million  or  largely due to higher depreciation rates effective with the company s general rate increase 
income taxes increased million primarily due to an increase in before tax operating income 
the company benefited from a one time state tax refund of approximately million which contributed to a lower effective tax rate for the year 
the construction of coyote springs accounted for the increases in capitalized interest during each year  which partially offset a corresponding increase in interest expense 
income also includes a million charge for increased charitable donations 
compared to portland general s earnings of million  per share  compared favorably to earnings of million  per share 
in previously recorded real estate reserves of million  after tax  or 
per share  were restored to income as a result of the substantial completion of divestiture of real estate investments 
income from continuing operations was million compared to million in customer growth and increased wholesale activity resulted in strong energy sales for the year 
kwh sales increased over the prior year  adding million to revenues 
weather adjusted retail load grew approximately with the addition of nearly  retail customers 
wholesale kwh sales escalated reflecting the availability of low cost power for resale and the company s active wholesale marketing of energy throughout the western united states 
accrued revenues of million  relating to power cost deferrals  were down substantially from million in pge deferred for later collection a portion of incremental trojan replacement power costs for nine months during nuclear cost savings allowed pge to operate the last nine months of without the need for additional power cost deferrals 
an increase in total sales combined with a decline in pge s hydro generation contributed to a million increase in variable power costs 
strong performance at pge s thermal generating facilities allowed pge to generate of its total system load compared to in generation at coal fired plants increased  with all plants producing above levels 
despite the increased generation at its thermal plants  average fuel costs decreased by due to low natural gas prices 
these factors contributed to a reduction in total average variable power costs to mills kwh from mills kwh in operating expenses excluding variable power costs  depreciation  and amortization decreased by million 
continued emphasis on cost reductions at trojan resulted in million in decreased nuclear operating expenses 
since plant closure in  the number of pge nuclear employees has dropped from to and correspondingly annual nuclear operating expenses have declined from approximately million to million 
increases in operating costs on pge s distribution system partially offset nuclear cost savings 
the million increase in other income reflected an increase in accrued interest on deferred power costs and a gain on the sale of non utility property  partially offset by provisions for litigation costs 
allowance for funds used during construction increased million  primarily due to the level of construction expenditures at coyote springs in  which helped offset increased interest costs on short term borrowings 
financial condition during regulatory actions resulted in the write down and elimination of certain regulatory assets and liabilities 
the march general rate order  discussed in note  regulatory matters  resulted in the write down of of pge s investment in trojan 
continued amortization and the regulatory offset of million  discussed below  also contributed to the decrease in the trojan investment balance 
in november the company placed coyote springs in service 
concurrently  a rate proceeding was finalized which provided recovery of the fixed and capital costs of the plant 
the november proceeding also approved partial recovery of pge s outstanding power costs deferrals  recorded as unbilled and accrued revenues 
the order adopted the company s proposal to offset the uncollected balances of all power cost deferrals approved for recovery  a portion of the trojan investment  and certain other regulatory assets against the company s million deferred gain remaining from the sale of a portion of boardman and the intertie 
see note  regulatory matters  in the notes to the financial statements for additional discussion regarding the november order 
cash flow portland general corporation portland general requires cash to pay dividends to its common stockholders  to provide funds to its subsidiaries  to meet debt service obligations and for day to day operations 
sources of cash are dividends from pge  asset sales  leasing rentals  short and intermediate term borrowings  and the sale of portland general s common stock 
during  portland general discontinued its commercial paper program 
in order to meet periodic liquidity and operational needs  portland general has maintained a one year credit facility of million from which no borrowings were made during as of year end portland general had million of debt which matures in portland general received million in dividends from pge 
in addition  portland general received million in proceeds from the issuance of new shares of common stock under its dividend reinvestment and optional cash payment plan drip 
beginning in november portland general began open market purchases of common stock for the drip program rather than issuing new shares 
portland general electric company cash provided by operations is used to meet the day to day cash requirements of pge 
supplemental cash is obtained from external borrowings as needed 
a significant portion of cash from operations comes from depreciation and amortization of utility plant  charges which are recovered in customer revenues but require no current cash outlay 
changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable can also be significant contributors or users of cash 
improved cash flow for the current year reflects the company s general price increase and lower variable power costs 
cash flows were not adversely affected by the million non cash charge to income for regulatory disallowances 
cash flows were affected by a million tax prepayment related to a wnp abandonment loss deduction which was challenged by the irs 
during portland general reached a settlement with the irs regarding the deduction 
the settlement did not materially affect the company s cash requirements see note  income taxes  for further information 
investing activities include generation  transmission and distribution facilities improvements  as well as energy efficiency programs 
capital expenditures of million were primarily for the expansion and upgrade of its transmission and distribution system and completion of coyote springs 
annual capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million over the next few years 
the majority of anticipated capital expenditures are for improvements to the company s expanding distribution system to support the addition of new customers to pge s service territory 
the company plans to proceed with obtaining required site permits for potential new generating resources but does not anticipate new construction in the foreseeable future 
the company will continue to make energy efficiency expenditures but at approximately of levels 
financing activities provide supplemental cash for day to day operations and capital requirements as needed 
during internal funding is expected to cover the company s capital expenditures 
pge maintains varying levels of short term debt  primarily in the form of commercial paper  which serve as the primary form of daily liquidity with balances ranging from million to million 
pge has committed borrowing facilities totaling million which are used primarily as backup for pge s million commercial paper facility 
in july  pge extended the life of its million credit facility to five years and reduced the annual commitment fee to ensure adequate liquidity and take advantage of an attractive market for credit 
in pge redeemed million of preferred stock including a million sinking fund payment 
to fund the redemption  pge issued million of junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures due  which are listed on the nyse 
in may pge issued million of medium term notes secured by its first mortgage bond indenture with maturities ranging from to years 
concurrently with the issuance of the debt  pge settled two outstanding forward interest rate swap agreements  each with a notional amount of million  which were initiated in november the termination resulted in a million payment which was deferred and will be amortized over the average life of the bonds issued 
pge filed a shelf registration statement for million providing for the issuance of secured debt as well as unsecured senior and junior debentures 
the registration statement allows for the debt to be issued for terms ranging from nine months to years as either fixed or floating rate debt 
with the issuance of the million of debentures discussed above  pge currently has million of debt issuance capacity under its existing shelf registration 
the issuance of additional preferred stock and first mortgage bonds requires pge to meet earnings coverage and security provisions set forth in the articles of incorporation and the indenture securing its first mortgage bonds 
as of december   pge could issue million of preferred stock and million of additional first mortgage bonds 
in january the company issued a million variable rate note to a commercial bank maturing in january to fund the early redemption of and first mortgage bonds 
financial and operating outlook competition the energy policy act of energy act set the stage for change in federal and state regulations aimed at increasing both wholesale and retail competition in the electric industry 
the energy act eased restrictions on independent power production and granted authority to ferc to mandate open access for the wholesale transmission of electricity 
ferc has taken steps to provide a framework for increased competition in the electric industry 
in march it issued a notice of proposed rulemaking nopr regarding non discriminatory open access transmission requirements for all public utilities 
the proposed rules address several issues including stranded asset recovery and open access transmission of electricity 
if adopted  the proposed open access transmission requirements would give wholesale competitors access to pge s transmission facilities and  in turn  give pge access to others transmission facilities 
pge filed an open access transmission tariff with ferc but has not yet received an order 
since the passage of the energy act  various state utility commissions have addressed proposals which would gradually allow customers direct access to generation suppliers  marketers  brokers and other service providers in a competitive marketplace for energy services 
although presently operating in a cost based regulated environment  pge expects increasing competition from other forms of energy and other suppliers of electricity 
while the company is unable to determine the future impact of increased competition  it believes that ultimately it will result in reduced wholesale and retail prices 
oregon regulatory environment the opuc is approaching the issues of retail competition on an informal  utility by utility basis  rather than through generic  broad based proceedings 
the opuc has had a long standing policy of allowing special contracts for customers that have competitive options  and many of pge s largest customers receive power under such contracts 
in addition  the opuc approved an innovative rate schedule under which pge is sharing some of the risks and rewards of a more competitive wholesale market with large industrial and commercial customers not already under special contract 
the opuc is exploring performance based ratemaking in a rate case for another oregon investor owned utility and  with regard to pge  has expressed interest in receiving proposals for accelerated recovery of regulatory assets 
recent rate orders have substantially reduced the company s regulatory risks  particularly the uncertainty associated with the recovery of various regulatory assets 
the opuc approved recovery of of pge s remaining investment in trojan and full recovery of trojan s decommissioning costs see item  legal proceedings  for discussion on legal challenges to the opuc s authorization 
the opuc also approved a proposal under which pge simultaneously eliminated certain regulatory assets and liabilities see note  regulatory matters  for further discussion of rate orders 
it remains to be determined what effect future competitive factors may have on retail rates in oregon and the company s ability to fully recover remaining regulatory assets 
customer growth and energy sales the growth of pge s retail customer base by over  contributed to an average increase in weather adjusted retail kwh sales 
the company continues to benefit from consistent growth in its residential customer class 
during  the addition of approximately  residential customers resulted in a load growth for this customer class 
over the past years increases in the number of residential customers has resulted in an average annual residential load growth of 
in  industrial customers expanded their demand for energy by  making them the most rapidly growing customer class within pge s service territory 
above average growth in this class is expected to contribute to an overall retail load growth of approximately in commodity price risk management the company is exposed to market risk arising from the need to purchase fuel for its generating units both natural gas and coal as well as the direct purchase and sale of wholesale electricity in support of its retail and wholesale markets 
pge operates without a power cost adjustment tariff  and therefore adjustments for power costs above or below those used in existing general tariffs are not automatically reflected in retail customers rates 
through the formation of the trading floor  pge has integrated its wholesale marketing  fuels  power operations and price risk management functions 
this has led to a more efficient energy production and procurement process  as well as an expansion of the company s ability to offer its customers a variety of energy solutions and pricing 
this expansion of product offerings  in conjunction with the development of a broader  more competitive wholesale electricity market  means the company must actively manage its market price risk 
the company uses financial instruments  such as commodity futures  options  forwards and swaps  to hedge the price of natural gas and electricity and reduce the company s exposure to market fluctuations in the price of natural gas and electricity 
in addition to hedging activities  company policy has been expanded to allow for the use of financial instruments for trading purposes in support of company operations although no trading of financial instruments was done during the year 
in  transactions consisted primarily of fixed for floating swap agreements where the company receives or makes payments based on the differential between a specified price and the actual price of natural gas or electricity 
swap contracts generally require monthly cash settlements over the term of the contract 
the company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non performance by the counterparties and has established guidelines to mitigate that risk 
power fuel supply pge s base of hydro and thermal generating capacity provides the company with the flexibility needed to respond to seasonal fluctuations in the demand for electricity both within its oregon service territory and from its wholesale customers 
pge plans to generate of its energy requirements during  approximately the same level achieved during pge maintains flexibility in fuel supply contracts to allow for the economic dispatch of pge s thermal resources in conjunction with hydro operations and the current market price of wholesale power 
the company benefits from a strategic location which places it adjacent to two competing natural gas pipelines with access to three significant producing basins 
firm transportation on both pipelines provides an adequate supply of natural gas to meet plant generating capacities 
in addition  the company maintains a flexible portfolio of physical supply which relies heavily on short term agreements and spot market purchases to fuel plant operations 
during the company relied on wholesale purchases to supply approximately of its energy needs  and pge expects to purchase approximately of its load requirements 
pge has long term power contracts with four hydro projects on the mid columbia river which provide pge with mw 
early predictions of water conditions indicate they will be about normal  however  efforts to restore salmon runs on the columbia and snake rivers may affect the supply and price of purchased power see restoration of salmon runs below 
additional factors that could affect purchased power include weather conditions in the northwest during winter months and in the southwest during summer months  as well as the performance of major generating facilities in both regions 
pge has increasingly relied upon short term purchases to meet its energy needs 
the company anticipates that an active wholesale market and surplus of generating capacity within the wscc see the power supply discussion under item  business  for further information regarding the wscc should provide sufficient wholesale energy available at competitive prices to supplement company generation and purchases under existing firm power contracts 
restoration of salmon runs several species of snake river salmon are protected as threatened under the endangered species act esa 
the federal government has taken emergency actions that have reduced the amount of electricity generated at the columbia and snake river dams in an attempt to save the endangered fish 
in january the national marine fisheries service nmfs released a draft plan calling for altering the management of federal dams and reservoirs in the columbia river basin in order to protect dwindling salmon stocks 
the plan takes steps to boost river flows while young salmon are migrating and further reduces the water available for generation 
the release of the nmfs final plan is scheduled for early and is expected to call for salmon protection measures similar to those adopted by the draft plan 
nmfs is empowered by the esa to require salmon protection measures by the us bureau of reclamation and the us army corps of engineers which operate the federal dams 
the columbia river and its tributaries produce nearly two thirds of the electricity used in the region 
pge purchases power from many sources  including the mid columbia dams 
reductions in the amount of water allowed to flow through the dams turbines reduce generation and increase the cost of power available to purchase on a non contract  or secondary  basis 
the attempt to improve fish passage by releasing more water from the reservoirs in the spring and summer could mean less water available in the fall and winter when the demand for electricity in the pacific northwest is the highest and could lead to higher power costs 
hydro relicensing pge hydro pge s hydroelectric plants are some of the company s most valuable resources supplying economical generation and flexible load following capabilities 
company owned hydro generation produced million mwh of renewable energy in  meeting of pge s load 
pge s hydroelectric plants  which operate under federal licenses  will be up for renewal between the years and the license for the mw pelton round butte project the company s largest hydro resource is the first up for renewal 
pge will file a notice of intent with ferc officially beginning the anticipated minimum five year relicensing process 
should the relicensing process not be completed prior to the expiration of the original license  annual licenses will be issued  usually under the original terms and conditions 
the relicensing process includes the involvement of numerous interested parties such as governmental agencies  public interest groups and communities  with much of the focus on environmental concerns 
pge has already performed many pre filing activities including nearly public meetings with such groups 
the cost of relicensing includes legal and filing fees as well as the cost of environmental studies  possible fish passage measures and wildlife habitat enhancements 
relicensing cost may be a significant factor in determining whether a project remains cost effective after a new license is obtained  especially for smaller projects 
although ferc has never denied an application or issued a license to anyone other than the incumbent licensee  this is no assurance that a new license will be granted 
mid columbia hydro pge s long term power purchase contracts with certain public utility districts in the state of washington expire between and certain idaho electric utility co operatives have initiated proceedings with ferc seeking to change the allocation of generation from the priest rapids and wanapum dams between electric utilities in the region upon expiration of the current contracts 
ferc is expected to rule on the matter during pge will seek renewal of these contracts under terms and conditions similar to the original 
however  an unfavorable ferc ruling could result in a reduction of the amount of power from the two projects that pge could acquire beyond the expiration dates of the current contracts 
for further information regarding the power purchase contracts on the mid columbia dams  including priest rapids and wanapum  see note  commitments  in the notes to financial statements 
nuclear decommissioning in january pge submitted its trojan decommissioning plan to the nrc and efsc 
the plan  which estimates pge s cost to decommission trojan at million in nominal dollars actual dollars to be spent in each year  represents a site specific decommissioning estimate performed for trojan by an engineering firm experienced in decommissioning nuclear plants 
this estimate assumes that the majority of decommissioning activities will occur between and  beginning with the removal of certain large plant components while construction of a temporary dry spent fuel storage facility is taking place 
the plan anticipates final site restoration activities will begin in after pge completes shipment of spent fuel to a usdoe facility see note  trojan nuclear plant  for further discussion of the decommissioning plan and other trojan issues 
pge anticipates approval of its decommissioning plan during following the completion of a review process 
during  pge successfully completed the removal and burial of certain of trojan s large components 
meanwhile  the company is pursuing the licensing and planning issues in preparation for decommissioning activities to begin following plan approval 
new accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of  imposes a stricter criterion for continuing to carry regulatory assets  requiring that such assets be probable of recovery at each balance sheet date 
as of december   all regulatory assets are being collected in rates charged to customers 
the company s accounting policies conform to generally accepted accounting principles and consider the effects of ratemaking practices 
the company has recorded certain regulatory assets and is dependent upon the regulatory process to ensure that future revenues will be provided to recover these costs 
in the event that all or a portion of the company s operations are no longer subject to cost based regulation due to a change in regulation or the effects of competition  the company could be required to recognize the impairment of and write down its long lived assets to their fair value as well as write off any remaining regulatory assets 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  effective in  encourages companies to recognize compensation expense for the fair value of stock based compensation 
the company has limited use of stock based compensation and does not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations or cash flows of the company
