sfas 
for the three month period ended june   purepac s net income before income taxes resulted in the recording of an income tax provision of purepac s net loss before income tax for the twelve month current period resulted in the recording of an income tax benefit of for the acquired companies  only the net loss before income tax since acquisition can be consolidated into the company s income tax returns 
as a result  an income tax benefit of and has been included in the three and twelve month current periods  respectively 
the income tax benefit of the net losses prior to acquisition have been fully reserved against as the recovery of these losses is dependent on future taxable income of each of the respective companies  which at present cannot be assured

the nifedipine products accounted for of net sales for the year compared with for the prior year 
gross profit for the year was  compared with  for the prior year  a decline of  
the gross profit as a percent of net sales for the year ended june  was compared with for the prior year ended june  the decline was attributable primarily to lower sales due to increased competition and to a lesser extent to higher raw material costs

the expense as a percent of net sales was compared with for the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to higher personnel expenses 
the research and development expenses for the year remained relatively constant at  compared with the prior year expense of  the expense as a percent of net sales for the year ended june  was compared with for the prior year ended june  the steady level of expense reflects the continuing commitment to new product development

the effective income tax benefit rate for the year ended june  was compared with for the year ended june  before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for income taxes 
net loss for the year ended june  before preferred stock dividends was  compared with net income for the prior year before preferred stock dividends of  financial condition  liquidity and capital resources the company had  in cash and cash equivalents at june   compared with  at june  the current year s increase of resulted primarily from  in cash provided by the issuance of the class b preferred stock associated with the february  acquisitions and  provided by additions to paid in capital

a comparison of the balance sheet accounts at june  to the june  balances shows the following to be noteworthy accounts receivable increased by  due to the higher sales level  primarily in the last quarter 
included in the reserves for doubtful accounts and sales allowances is the allowance for sales returns  allowances and discounts of  at june  compared with  at june   an increase of this increase is primarily due to increases of in the provision for floor stock price adjustments and in the provision for credits owed to direct source buying groups 
the increase in the provision for such allowances had an adverse effect on net sales and operations with no effect on cash flows

this restructuring was considered necessary to prepare the company to be more competitive in the oral generic pharmaceutical industry 
also  this restructuring is expected to better position the company to integrate the acquired companies 
costs associated with this restructuring  including severance payments  totaled the company believes that its current cash resources  anticipated operating cash flows and funds available under a revolving credit and loan arrangement with a bank will be sufficient to fund its working capital needs for the next months 
in addition  it is not anticipated that the acquired companies will generate adequate revenues to finance their combined operating expenses until at least depending upon the timing of the company s cash flow requirements  which is highly dependent upon the unpredictable timing of the receipt of fda product approvals  the future cash flow needs of the company could exceed the company s current cash resources and its available credit under its existing credit facilities 
as of june   the company had  in cash  plus approximately  of available borrowings under its existing credit facilities 
accordingly  the company may need to seek additional credit facilities or to seek additional funding from sales of its securities or from other sources 
the company anticipates that it would be able to increase its credit facilities or obtain financing from other sources  should it require additional cash flow to support the commercialization of new products following receipt of fda approval therefor 
however  there can be no assurance that such financing will be available when required  if at all  or will be available upon terms the company may deem commercially reasonable
