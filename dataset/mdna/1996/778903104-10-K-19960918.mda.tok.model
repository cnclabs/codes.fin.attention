operations net sales were relatively consistent with prior year results reporting net sales of  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal fiscal was a challenging year for the company as well as the rotomolding industry in general due to tremendous fluctuations in raw material which in turn caused confusion and anxiety in the marketplace 
management was pleased that in spite of these adverse conditions it was still able to maintain its overall market share 
fiscal also continued to be a year of transition for the company 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the company closed its wisconsin facility and combined the operations into its illinois facility 
during this transition the company did realize an overall reduction in sales volumes 
however  since completion of the relocation process during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the restructured illinois facility is primed to handle increased sales volumes 
management anticipates realizing increased volumes in this region as it capitalizes on illinois facilities resources  increased capacity and growth potential 
again  due to a lackluster marketplace in fiscal  several of the company s proprietary product lines fell below fiscal sales volume levels but  the company also reported notable increases in marine  custom  customer tooling and medical waste sales which aided to minimize any shortfalls realized 
the company continues to see future growth potential in these aforementioned product lines as well as continued focus to increase market share for its material handling and agricultural product lines 
sales of refuse containers also continues to be a strong market for the company and management anticipates this trend will continue during fiscal in addition  the company is currently expanding the building and manufacturing capacity at its texas facility 
once completed the company plans to expand the manufacturing and distribution of its tank product line into this region 
net sales increased  or in fiscal compared to fiscal the company has experienced considerable growth in its refuse container  marine and custom product lines during fiscal while a portion of the increase in custom sales is attributed to the acquisition of custom rotational molding  inc crm which was effective on april   continued growth in the company s proprietary products  especially refuse containers and marine industry products  contributed to a increase in net sales 
sales also increased due to several general price increases instituted to offset the unprecedented increase in plastic resin costs  interest rates and the normal inflation increases reflected in the company s expenses 
during fiscal  the company also continued its focus on expanding its existing operations 
this included the relocation of its illinois division to a acre site purchased by the company as well as various machinery and facility expansions to keep pace with current and future manufacturing requirements 
cost of goods sold was  or of net sales in fiscal compared to  or and  or of net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
both fiscal and experienced extreme volatility in plastic resin prices which resulted in unprecedented increases in plastic resin prices approximately 
the price increases were enacted by the various resin suppliers in response to foreign market demands as well as the various natural and internal disasters experienced by the resin suppliers 
the cost of plastic resin represents a significant portion of the company s manufacturing costs and as such places an undue hardship on the company to effectively mitigate these increases 
during fiscal  the company did effectively mitigate the resin price increases by initiating customer price increases  raw material purchasing strategies and maximizing its volume rebate programs 
however  because the company could not initially completely pass these costs on to its customers  during the first months of fiscal the company experienced increased costs as it depleted lower priced resin reserves and replaced them with resin purchased at higher current market prices 
again these costs were partially mitigated during the remainder of fiscal using the above mentioned strategies coupled with temporary reductions in resin prices and improved customer buying trends 
as the company moves forward into fiscal management will continue to take defensive tactics in response to current rising resin prices 
as before  if resin prices do not stabilize and the marketplace reacts adversely to future pricing structures these factors could have an effect on the company s gross profit margin in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were  or of net sales in fiscal compared to  or in fiscal the increase is substantially attributed to approximately  in additional expenses incurred associated with the arleta  california facility which was acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal the remaining increase is attributed to increased professional fees of approximately  associated with the proposed acquisition of the company by bonar us  inc and approximately  in excess administrative expenses incurred during the wisconsin facility consolidation 
the latter costs have been partially mitigated due to improved operating efficiencies realized subsequent to the consolidation of the two plants 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  or of net sales in fiscal compared to  or in fiscal year the increase in the fiscal amount is primarily related to  in expenses relating to the arleta  california operations formally crm since the effective date of acquisition 
however  overall costs have remained consistent with prior year reflecting a decrease when compared as a percentage of net sales due to increase volumes during fiscal interest expense decreased  to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the decrease is attributed to a overall reduction in the company s debt structure of approximately million as of june  coupled with last years renegotiated interest rates and reductions in the bank s prime lending interest rate which lowered interest rates by 
if the company s bank borrowings remain consistent during fiscal and interest rates remain stable the company will continue to report lower interest costs 
interest expense increased  to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the increase is related both to an increase in the company s debt structure and a substantial increase in the bank s interest rate up over fiscal 
during fiscal the primary increase in the company s debt when compared to fiscal approximately million is attributed to the purchase of the bensenville  illinois property and the repayment of crm s bank debt of approximately  assumed in the acquisition 
as mentioned  the company also experienced an increase in the prime lending rate charged by the bank in response to increases in the discount rate imposed by the federal reserve bank 
due to these factors  the company renegotiated its entire loan facility with the bank in may under the new loan facility the company realized a savings approximately a reduction in interest rates in absolute terms in relation to the prior loan facility 
income before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for income taxes decreased  to  or 
per common share in fiscal compared to  or 
per common share in fiscal the decrease is due to slightly lower sales volumes during the current fiscal year coupled with the resin cost increase and increases in selling  general and administrative expenses outlined above 
although operating results were below prior years levels  management feels the current year s results were satisfactory when one considers the challenging events which plagued fiscal management realizes fiscal  as well as future periods  will also present their own challenges 
therefore  management s goal will be to continue to strive to increase sales volumes and profitability  in light of industry conditions  with an unwavering commitment 
income before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for income taxes reflected a notable increase of  to  or 
per common share in fiscal from  or 
per common share in fiscal the increase is due to increases in sales volumes in conjunction with the relatively consistent levels of costs associated with manufacturing  selling and administrative functions in fiscal income tax expense was  or 
per common share for fiscal compared to income tax benefits of  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
the increase is due to the recognition of deferred income taxes during fiscal which in prior years were minimized by the reversal of the company s deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
during fiscal  the company exhausted the remaining  valuation allowance reserve based on management s continuing assessment and belief that the company will continue to utilize its nols in the foreseeable future 
although the company must now record a tax provision  the company will not incur a cash flow requirement for the payment of deferred taxes  in fiscal until such time that the company fully utilizes its available net operating loss carryforwards 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for income taxes the company recorded adjustments to the july  balance sheet to reflect the impact of adopting fas  netting to  this amount was reflected in net income for fiscal as the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for income taxes 
the adjustments primarily represent the impact of recognizing a deferred tax asset for the benefit of tax operating loss carryforwards that could not be recorded under fas for further discussion relating to the adoption of fas by the company  see note to the financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources working capital increased  to  at june  compared to  at june  the increase is primarily attributed to a  increase in current deferred tax assets for the utilization of the company s net operating loss carryforwards which is expected to occur within one year  net of normal fluctuations in accounts receivables  accounts payable  accrued liabilities and inventories consistent with current operations 
cash provided by operations increased  in fiscal the increase is primarily attributed to reductions in inventory levels consistent with current operations compared to last years significant increases in inventory levels in efforts to mitigate rising raw material costs 
these results continue to substantiate the company s ability to sustain profitable operations at current sales volumes not to mention the cash flow savings obtained from the utilization of the company s nols

at june   the company has approximately  available for future borrowings under its revolving line of credit 
the company expended a total of  for property  plant and equipment during fiscal compared to  for fiscal the decrease is attributed to the purchase of the bensenville  illinois property  and various building improvements and machinery and equipment projects at the bensenville  illinois property completed in fiscal the company currently expects to spend between  and  in capital expenditures in fiscal year the company anticipates that the capital expenditures will be financed from cash flows generated from operations and the existing bank machinery equipment term loan commitment
