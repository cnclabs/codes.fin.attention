a tax benefit of  was recorded in the fourth quarter of at december   the company had a net deferred tax asset of million before valuation allowance consisting primarily of the future tax benefits from net operating loss carryforwards and their tax credits 
at december   the company had a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset as management believes  based on the available evidence  that it is more likely than not that the company will not realize any benefits from its net deferred tax asset 
realization of the net deferred tax asset and future reversals of the valuation allowance depend on the company s ability to generate future taxable income during the respective carryforward periods

revenues from the company s electronic manufacturing test products increased 
revenues from automotive electronics diagnostic systems and from the us marine corps contract decreased  both of which have overall lower margins

the proceeds from these sales approximated the carrying value of the assets sold
