the million decrease in working capital in is principally attributable to the million loss from operations for the year ended december  and million of capital expenditures which were partially offset by million of expenses which did not impact working capital 
the million increase in working capital in is principally attributable to million of proceeds from the april issuance of convertible debentures due march   the convertible debentures and million of proceeds from a private placement of common stock in december  offset by the million loss from operations for the year ended december  the company expects to incur further operating losses until the company can obtain marketing approval from the fda for additional disease indications for the prosorba registered trademark column or until sales to the company s north american distributor  baxter healthcare corporation  for the prosorba registered trademark column for its existing indication of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura increase significantly

in september  the company completed an exchange offering to holders of its convertible debentures 
the company offered to exchange the convertible debentures for common stock at a price of per share 
of the original  outstanding principal amount of the convertible debentures   was converted pursuant to the exchange offering

as part of the restructuring plan  the company  in january  notified approximately twenty employees  which was slightly greater than half of its work force  that their positions were being terminated immediately 
the annual salary savings from this reduction in the work force is expected to be in excess of million 
the company estimates it will incur approximately million of capital expenditures to consolidate its two washington manufacturing facilities 
the company believes that the funds resulting from the private placement coupled with the company s restructuring will provide the resources necessary to fund operations  including clinical trials  through the latter half of the company will require additional financing in order to fund the completion of a pivotal clinical trial in rheumatoid arthritis  initiate pivotal clinical trials using the prosorba registered trademark column in other diseases and apply the company s technology to applications beyond the prosorba registered trademark column 
the company is seeking corporate partners to fund additional clinical trials 
the principal changes in the components of working capital since december  were a million decrease in cash resulting from the excess of cash expenditures for over the million of proceeds received from debt financing  a million decrease in trade accounts receivable resulting from the lower amount of sales during the end of compared to  a decrease of million in inventory to reflect the lower sales demands of baxter  and a combined increase of million in accounts payable  accrued compensation and accrued liabilities due primarily to increasing payment cycles to suppliers to preserve the company s cash position as of december  results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal effective april   the company entered into a year exclusive distribution agreement with baxter healthcare corporation granting distribution rights for the treatment of thrombocytopenia and the first right to negotiate for new prosorba registered trademark column indications 
the agreement provided for an annual take or pay commitment from baxter to the company for the first two sales years 
these minimums were subject to the company having fda product approval for immune thrombocytopenic purpura 
the company received a response from the fda in january to a pre market application pma supplement filed in march requesting the name of the company s approved indication be changed from idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura to immune thrombocytopenic purpura 
the request was made by the company as it believed the two names are used interchangeably by the medical community 
the fda s response denied the company s request for such a change 
as a result of the fda action  baxter exercised its right to re negotiate minimums in february in march  the two companies amended the agreement whereby baxter made a take or pay payment for the first sales year of million compared to the original million due march   purchased million of product during the second quarter of  released the company from its obligation to provide marketing and promotional support for the second and third years of the agreement  gave the company the right to co market with baxter  relinquished its first right to negotiate for new prosorba registered trademark column indications  and under certain circumstances  agreed to provide advance payments to the company for baxter s purchases 
the company agreed to eliminate purchase minimums and the take or pay concept included in the original agreement and freed baxter to pursue competing thrombocytopenia therapies 
the term of the agreement remains ten years and consistent with the original agreement  both companies agreed to review the terms at the end of the third year 
both companies have the right to terminate the agreement as of september  if the parties are unable to agree on terms for the remainder of the agreement or based on performance through september  the impact of the revised baxter agreement referred to above had a variety of effects on the operations of the company during the year ended december  the company s revenue included the million take or pay payment made by baxter in march and sales and marketing costs relative to sales decreased based on baxter agreeing to assume all marketing and promotional costs 
net sales decreased from million in to million in approximately of the sales were to baxter  with the remaining primarily to international customers of the company 
the decrease in net sales was due primarily to baxter selling approximately less product to customers than when the company sold directly to health care providers 
in addition  there is a lower sales price charged to baxter than the company previously charged to its customers 
a substantial amount of the columns shipped by the company to baxter remained in baxter s ending inventory as of december  because of continued delays by baxter in fully implementing a sales and marketing program for the prosorba registered trademark column 
the company is unable to predict if shipments in will exceed those of total operating expenses  excluding million of non recurring charges  decreased from million in to million in production costs decreased from million in to million in the decrease is primarily a result of the decrease in the number of units shipped in compared to the majority of production costs in represent labor and overhead charges as no significant production occurred during the last six months of as a result of the previously discussed restructuring  the company is working to reduce its manufacturing overhead  including a reduction of personnel 
sales and marketing expenses decreased from million in to million in such expenses decreased primarily because beginning april   under the revised distribution agreement  baxter provided complete sales and marketing support for the sale of the product 
the company no longer maintains a sales force and terminated three sales employees in as part of the amended baxter agreement 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily a result of the company conducting its rheumatoid arthritis clinical trial for patients in and the commencement of a pilot clinical trial in kidney transplantation during the last six months of in  the company began its rheumatoid arthritis clinical trial during the last six months of the year and conducted no other clinical trials 
in january  the company suspended enrollment of patients in its kidney transplantation study while it evaluates the merits of continuing the study in light of other clinical opportunities 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease is principally a result of a reduction in investor relations and legal expenses partially offset by an increase in salary expenses 
this increase resulted from million of salary expenses associated with the severance agreement for the company s former chief executive officer who resigned in december and  of signing bonuses paid to the company s new chief executive officer and its new president 
general and administrative salary expenses are expected to increase in as the chief executive officer and president positions were held by one person in in  the company and celx corporation celx  the company s former majority owned subsidiary  agreed to the merger of celx into the company and the exchange of shares of celx by persons other than the company into an aggregate of  shares of the company s common stock 
the dissolution of celx resulted in a charge of  recorded as purchased in process research and development 
the charge was based on the fair market value of the company s common stock 
the company recorded a non cash expense of million in as a debt conversion expense for the conversion of the convertible debentures discussed above 
the expense represents the fair market value of the increased number of shares issued under the terms of the exchange offering compared to the original terms of the convertible debentures 
in december  the company recorded a restructuring charge aggregating  relating to the company s restructuring plan 
the restructuring charge includes approximately  related to write downs of equipment and leasehold improvements for the manufacturing facility expected to be vacated in   related to abandonment of leases  with the remainder related to a severance agreement with its former executive vice president 
costs related to the termination of employees in january as part of the company s restructuring plan were  and will be recorded as a restructuring expense and charged to operations in the quarter ending march  the annual salary savings from these terminations is in excess of million 
the company estimates it will incur approximately million in costs associated with moving the administration  research and medical departments to san diego  with most costs being attributable to relocation costs of the few members of management moving to san diego 
such costs will be expensed as incurred in the increase in net loss from million in to million in was primarily a result of the decrease in revenues 
fiscal compared to fiscal the impact of the original baxter agreement referred to above had a variety of effects on the operations of the company during the year ended december  the per unit sales price under the baxter agreement is lower than formerly charged to end users 
the company began expanding its manufacturing capacity  however  in the short term  this resulted in a lower utilization of manufacturing overhead costs 
thus the gross margin on sales to baxter was currently less than the company received when it sold directly to end users 
net sales decreased from million to million 
approximately of the sales were to baxter  with the remaining primarily to domestic customers of imre 
there were no material sales to international customers 
the decrease in net sales was due primarily to the lower sales price charged to baxter than the company previously charged to its customers 
this lower sales price did not offset the increased number of prosorba registered trademark columns shipped by imre in as compared to however  a substantial amount of the columns shipped by imre to baxter remained in their ending inventory as of december  because of delays by baxter in fully implementing a sales and marketing program for the prosorba registered trademark column in total operating expenses increased from million in to million in production costs increased from million in to million in the increase was primarily a result of an increase in the number of units shipped in compared to production costs as a percentage of sales increased to approximately in compared to in principally because the sales price charged to baxter for the nine months ended december  was less than the sales price the company formerly charged to end users 
in addition  the company began increasing its manufacturing overhead in to meet the original shipment demands of baxter 
sales and marketing expenses decreased from million in to million in such expenses decreased primarily because baxter provided partial sales and marketing support for the sale of the product during eight sales employees of the company became employees of baxter and five other company sales employees were terminated as a result of the baxter agreement thus resulting in lower salary  commission and travel costs 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in the increase was less than expected primarily as a result of the company not beginning its rheumatoid arthritis clinical trial as soon as expected 
in addition  the company did not conduct a clinical trial for the treatment of the classical form of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in as planned because of difficulties in agreeing upon an acceptable treatment protocol with the fda 
the conditions mandated by the fda would make the clinical trial too costly to perform in relation to potential investment return from product sales 
the increase is primarily a result of increased payroll costs for senior management hired in offset by a reduction in treatment data costs 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in the increase is principally a result of costs associated with the development of the company s diagnostic business plan  including expenses associated with seeking funding for the development of the diagnostics technology 
such funding has not been obtained 
the increase is also a result of costs associated with hiring the company s new chief executive officer and the annualized payroll cost effect of increasing the number of management and support personnel in interest expense increased from  in to  in because of the issuance in april of million of convertible debentures due march  the increase in total operating expenses and the decrease in revenues resulted in increasing the net loss from million in to million in
