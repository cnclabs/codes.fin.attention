item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  below 
the company is dependent for its management and important business relationships on the active participation of its president  mr 
j 
s 
whang and for general management of the technical contract personnel business on the services of mr 
eugene r 
hartman  a vice president of the company and chief operating officer of the technical contract personnel business 
semiconductor equipment business general the company is engaged primarily in the manufacture and marketing of several items of capital equipment used by customers in the manufacture of semiconductors 
semiconductors  or semiconductor chips  are made of silicon and are part of the circuitry of electronic computers 
their manufacture involves complex operations during which silicon wafers the substrates from which chips are made are inserted in a diffusion furnace and subjected to the precise flow of gases under very intense heat 
the company s products are intended to permit its customers to increase the degree of control over the manufacturing environment and to reduce exposure to contaminants by reducing the amount of human contact during the process 
following an industry trend  the size of individual chips has tended to decrease and the size of the wafers from which chips are made has tended to increase 
as a result  the value of each wafer has increased because each is the source of an increased number of chips 
as the value of wafers increase  so too does the importance of control over the manufacturing environment 
there is also a trend in the industry  related to the trend to smaller chips  to the use in new semiconductor manufacturing facilities of newer technology  vertical diffusion furnaces  which are more efficient to use than older technology horizontal diffusion furnaces in certain manufacturing processes of smaller chips on larger wafers 
vertical diffusion furnaces are  however  significantly more expensive to purchase than horizontal diffusion furnaces 
the company s products are useable with horizontal diffusion furnaces only 
the company s target market consists of customers who wish to increase the efficiency of their existing semiconductor manufacturing facilities equipped with horizontal diffusion systems 
the company s target market also includes customers who build new facilities but whose operations do not require the higher priced vertical diffusion furnace systems 
based on market information obtained through customer and market contacts  the company believes that approximately to of worldwide semiconductor manufacturing facilities are equipped with horizontal diffusion furnaces and to with vertical diffusion furnaces 
while the company estimates that over a five year period the percentage of facilities in the world equipped with each type of system will become equal  it believes that a significant demand for its present product line will continue to exist during that period  although there can be no assurance in that regard 
the company plans to increase its share of the market by expanding its product line through the manufacture of horizontal diffusion furnaces  thus adding to the number and variety of the company s products and expanding its sales  marketing and manufacturing in europe 
the expanded manufacturing and sales operations are located at a leased facility in hoogeveen  netherlands 
as further described herein  these changes are expected to result in increased worldwide sales of the company s existing products as well as increasing revenue through sales of its proposed new furnace line 
the company recently obtained a us patent on technology on which it expects to base a proposed new photo assisted cvd product for use in semiconductor manufacturing facilities  including those equipped with both vertical and or horizontal diffusion furnaces 
the company has engaged the university of california  santa cruz  to conduct a study to determine the feasibility of such a product 
if the results of the study are favorable  the company intends to design  manufacture and market a photo assisted cvd product 
the semiconductor equipment business produced approximately of the company s total revenues  of its gross profits and of the operating profits for fiscal year during fiscal year  approximately of the semiconductor equipment segment s revenues were derived from the sale of new systems  including upgrades and retrofits of previously sold systems 
the remainder of semiconductor equipment revenues approximately was derived from the sale of replacement parts and ancillary items 
existing products atmoscan r the company s atmoscan r is a patented controlled environment wafer processing system for use with horizontal diffusion furnaces 
it is comprised of a flanged quartz tube and several metal parts 
when in use  the flanged tube is loaded with wafers and inserted into the diffusion furnace under a nitrogen controlled environment 
the technology protected by the company s atmoscan r patents is a processing method that includes a cantilever tube that carries wafers and through which a purging inert gas flows during the loading and unloading of wafers into and out of the diffusion furnace 
the company believes that among the major advantages afforded by the atmoscan r product are increased control of the environment of the wafers during the gaseous and heating process  thereby increasing yields and decreasing manufacturing costs  and a decreased need for the cleaning of diffusion furnace tubes  which ordinarily involves substantial expense and equipment down time 
additional significant economies in the manufacturing process are also believed to result 
the company has manufactured and sold atmoscan r units to major semiconductor manufacturers in the united states  the pacific rim and europe  including at various times to international business machines  intel corporation  samsung  digital equipment corp  motorola  sgs thompson and others 
during fiscal  atmoscan r units were sold in a price range of approximately  for simpler models without accessories or ancillary items to approximately  for more complex models 
as discussed elsewhere  sales of atmoscan r have declined from their peak in  due to an industry trend toward use of vertical diffusion furnaces 
the company has designed and sells an open cantilever paddle system as an alternative to the closed processing method of the atmoscan r 
the per unit price is approximately  depending upon the customer s specifications 
ibal ibal is an acronym for individual boats with automated loading 
boats are quartz trays that hold silicon wafers while they are being processed in diffusion furnaces 
ibal is a device  including software  which automatically places boats into atmoscan r tubes or on open cantilever paddle systems before they are inserted in the diffusion furnace and automatically removes the trays after completion of the process 
the company has sold units of the ibal for approximately  to  each  not including the price of the atmoscan r or open cantilever paddle system 
use of the ibal products reduces human handling and  therefore  reduces exposure of wafers to contaminants during the loading and unloading of the process tubes 
the ibal butler is a robotics device which further automates the loading of wafers into the diffusion furnace by automatically transferring wafer carriers onto the ibal for loading into the atmoscan r for the appropriate furnace tube 
the unit price for the ibal butler is approximately  or on the open cantilever paddle 
the ibal queue provides a convenient staging area for the operator to place boats on a load station and automates the loading of those boats onto the ibal butler 
ibal queue was first developed and offered for sale in the fourth quarter of and the first unit was shipped during the second quarter of fiscal the unit price for the ibal queue is  load stations the products described above are offered and sometimes sold as a complete system  mounted on a device called a load station  which also includes an ultra clean environment for wafer loading by filtering and controlling the flow of air 
the company began shipping load stations in fiscal the price for the load station alone in addition to the price for the component systems described above is approximately  depending upon the complexity of a customer s requirements 
depending on configuration  which varies from order to order  complete load stations with loaders and ibal automation have been sold at prices between  and  diffusion furnaces the company offers horizontal diffusion furnaces utilizing existing industry technology for sale to customers who do not require the advanced automation of  or cannot incur the major expense of acquiring  vertical diffusion furnaces 
while the major advantage of vertical diffusion furnaces is their susceptibility to increased automation  which decreases the degree of human intervention in the manufacturing process  the use of horizontal diffusion furnaces  with less automation  is more economical for larger size chips and multi model semiconductor manufacturing 
while overall market demand for horizontal diffusion furnaces is declining  the company believes that a niche market will persist 
as of the date of this report  the company has sold six furnaces 
the company has transitioned from being a purchaser of horizontal diffusion furnaces substantially assembled by suppliers to being a manufacturer 
the company continues to acquire the frames and covers for furnaces from subcontractors 
this transition is being pursued as part of a plan to increase both the number and variety of products offered by the company and to expand its sales  marketing and manufacturing capabilities 
the company has expended approximately million in cash in the acquisition of certain assets useable in the manufacture and sale of horizontal diffusion furnaces and ancillary items to fund the start up and operation of an expanded horizontal diffusion furnace business using such assets 
those assets include items purchased from another company which had previously acquired the entire business of a bankrupt company  tempress bv  located in the netherlands 
that business involved the development  manufacture and sale of a number of different products  including a horizontal diffusion furnace 
the company also acquired from the bankrupt estate the right to use the trade name tempress in connection with such furnaces 
the right to use the tradename tempress is also held by three subsidiaries of tempress in connection with the sale of other tempress products and services unrelated to the horizontal diffusion furnace 
the company has hired a number of former tempress technical and sales personnel to design  manufacture and sell its own furnace products under the tempress name 
the company believes that the causes of the tempress bankruptcy were related to the fact that tempress was undercapitalized and that large expenditures were incurred in the development of other products  and was not related to the quality or reputation of the tempress products 
accordingly  the company believes that a diffusion furnace product designed by former tempress product engineers and sold under the tempress name will be accepted by the company s targeted market 
see engineering research and development and marketing  below 
there is  of course  no assurance of success in the company s efforts to design and market horizontal diffusion furnace products 
if the company s efforts do not succeed  the company may suffer significant losses 
the expanded manufacturing and sales operations are expected to be located at a leased facility in hoogeveen  netherlands 
the company s ability to carry out its plan is subject to risk  arising in part from the cyclical nature of the business 
there is a further risk that  as is estimated by at least one market research firm  the installation of new vertical diffusion furnaces will increase at a faster rate than is estimated by the company 
in that case  the demand for and sales of the company s horizontal diffusion furnaces may be below the company s estimates  its revenue and possible earnings may not increase as expected and the period of start up losses for the netherlands operation may extend for a period longer than the first year 
proposed new products cvd technology the company has patented a certain invention which it believes may be of significant importance to the semiconductor manufacturing industry 
it is now having a research study conducted to determine the feasibility of developing semiconductor manufacturing equipment using this patented invention 
the invention relates to an improvement to the photo assisted cvd process used in the manufacture of certain semiconductors 
the improvement uses ultraviolet light to activate the deposition reactions rather than heat  which is presently the common means in commercial cvd processing 
this photo assisted cvd process is separate and distinct from the diffusion process in which the company s existing products are used and its use is not limited to horizontal diffusion furnace facilities as are the company s existing products 
a photo assisted cvd process is potentially attractive for the manufacture of semiconductors because it allows a less severe processing environment 
first  the photo assisted cvd processes occur at lower temperatures and the lower temperature reduces the risk of defects in the deposited materials 
in this process  ultraviolet or uv light is used as the energy source to effect the deposition of chemicals on the wafers 
the photo assisted cvd processes also avoid radiation damage which can occur with currently prevalent processes 
furthermore  photo assisted cvd processes based on the company s patented method are more readily adaptable to the use of larger wafers the silicon substrates from which semiconductor chips are made than other cvd processes now in use 
the trend in the industry is to the use of larger size wafers and smaller size chips 
at present  photo assisted cvd processes are not widely used because the optical windows through which the uv light is introduced become covered by the same material that is deposited on the substrates 
the window deposition results in absorption of the uv light before the light can activate further deposition on the substrates 
the window deposition may also significantly degrade the uniformity of thickness of the deposited material 
although various other patented techniques have been used to alleviate or remedy this problem  none of them is believed by the company to be satisfactory 
uv lights currently available are not sufficiently intense for high through put manufacturing 
while the company s technology will not solve the uv light intensity problem  the second phase of the feasibility study will investigate available higher intensity light sources 
the development of a higher intensity uv light may increase the market for the product  and such development may be attempted by the company 
the concept of the company s invention is to use a battery of individually controllable uv lamps  each embedded in an elongated pipe light pipe with its own window 
the technology protected by the company s photo assisted cvd patents is described as a processing method that includes the introduction of inert purging gas into the base of each light pipe opening with sufficient velocity to flow against reactant gas molecules which are intended to be deposited on the wafers and prevent them from reaching and being deposited on the window or the lamps  thus avoiding clouding 
the company has not determined whether a commercially feasible product can be developed from this technology 
the company has entered into a research agreement with the regents of the university of california university whereunder a feasibility study is being undertaken by the university under the direction of roger w 
anderson  phd the study commenced on or about march  and has proven that the company s patented photo assisted cvd method solves the window deposition problem 
the study has been extended to february  to confirm the deposition rate and the commercial feasibility of the company s potential method 
the total cost of the study to the company is fixed at  of which  was paid in fiscal the university is to provide all necessary facilities 
necessary equipment not on hand will be purchased by the university out of the company s payment 
the equipment so purchased and the product prototype  if successfully developed  will remain the university s property subject to the company s rights to certain intellectual property developed from the study and the right to reasonable access to the equipment and the prototype for customer and other demonstrations 
the company will reimburse the university the cost of chemicals and supplies consumed in such demonstrations 
the university has agreed for a period of three years to protect as the company s confidential information all information  techniques and methods developed through the study that are related to the development  design and construction of the photo assisted cvd prototype except for i information which is or becomes common knowledge other than through a breach of the agreement  ii information as to the results of the study which does not disclose the methods whereby the results were achieved  and iii information required to be disclosed by law 
the university has the right to publish information of general scientific and academic interest without disclosing any confidential information and a copy of any such publication is to be furnished to the company in advance to assure against such disclosure 
any new inventions developed out of the study should be the property of the party whose employee is the inventor 
each party shall have an undivided interest in any invention made jointly by employees of both parties 
it is acknowledged in the agreement that the university also claims rights in certain pre existing intellectual property related to the photo assisted cvd process 
while it is understood that the company s patented technology is to be the primary focus of the study  it is contemplated that inventions based on the university s claims may result from the study 
if so  the company will have a period of days after disclosure to it by the university of such an invention in which to elect to obtain an exclusive  royalty bearing license to make  use and sell any such invention first actually reduced to practice in the performance of the study 
if the company elects to obtain such a license  it will assume all costs of obtaining and maintaining patent protection whether or not a patent is actually issued 
the parties will then negotiate in good faith as to the terms of such a license and if no license agreement is concluded within days of the date the company elects to obtain such a license  the company will no longer have any rights with respect to such inventions 
the parties have agreed that the royalty payable by the company under any such license shall be one half of one percent of the net sales of products based on a university patent which is an improvement to the company s patent and between and on the net sales of products based on other university inventions 
in the case of joint inventions  the royalty rate is to reflect the relative contribution of the parties to the development of such inventions 
the agreement expires on february  the agreement may be terminated by either party if dr 
anderson becomes unwilling or unable to continue the study and a mutually acceptable substitute is not available or at any time by the company upon days prior written notice to the university 
it is anticipated that  if the results of the university study are favorable  the company will design and develop specifications for an initial photo assisted cvd device 
the initial device is expected to have one chamber  containing a number of light pipes and a pedestal called a susceptor to hold wafers and would be sold to academic and industry research facilities 
if  as expected by the company  use by such facilities results in acceptance of the technology by the industry  the company will attempt to develop a fully automatic multi chamber  multi wafer product for mass production of semiconductors 
the automation or robotic components of the product are expected to be procured from other manufacturers 
the company s current plans for the proposed new photo cvd product are conceptual only 
detailed planning is expected to be done if  as and when the university study demonstrates the product s commercial feasibility 
the development of first a research laboratory product and then an industrial product is expected to take a period of approximately two to three years 
the total cost of the photo assisted cvd product development effort is expected to be approximately  expended in stages over a two to three year period 
all of the company s plans and estimates are subject to significant uncertainties 
wafer reclaiming venture in november  the company entered into a joint venture agreement pursuant to which it acquired a ownership interest and a voting interest in seil semicon  inc seil semicon  inc  which is in the preliminary start up phase intends to develop and operate a silicon test wafer reclaiming business 
the company agreed to invest  in the venture   of which was paid in november and the remainder of which will be due at the time seil semicon obtains million in third party financing 
seil semicon has acquired real property for construction of the reclamation facility 
the ultimate success of the venture depends on a number of factors  including securing adequate financing  of which there can be no assurance 
order backlog as of november   the company s order backlog for semiconductor equipment was approximately  compared to approximately  at the same date in the previous year 
the company includes in its backlog all credit approved customer purchase orders 
the company anticipates that  and  of its current backlog will be shipped in fiscal and  respectively 
orders in the backlog may be canceled by the customer upon payment of mutually acceptable cancellation charges 
while the current backlog includes the orders of one customer to be shipped over two fiscal years  orders generally are shipped within one to six months of receipt 
accordingly  the backlog may not be a valid measure of revenue for a future period 
in addition  a backlog does not provide any assurance that the company will realize a profit from the order 
manufacturing the company purchases quartz and metal components of its products from competitive market sources and inspects and assembles them at its plant in tempe  arizona 
certain parts of the system are machined at the company s own machine shop 
with the exception of quartz components  no procurement problems are currently being encountered nor are any such problems considered likely 
the company is experiencing long lead times of four to six months for quartz components  requiring it to quote longer lead times for certain of its products 
the company expects to conduct similar assembly operations for its proposed furnace line at a leased facility in hoogeveen  netherlands 
if the proposed photo assisted cvd product is developed  the company plans to continue to rely on suppliers for most parts and to do a small amount of machining work internally 
engineering research and development the atmoscan r  was acquired in through a licensing arrangement with its inventor  who was not employed by the company 
the other products were developed by company personnel 
the patented photo assisted cvd technology was invented and patent rights assigned to the company by an employee 
the company presently employs at its tempe  arizona plant  three engineers including one with sales support responsibilities and four technicians 
product development in the past has been accomplished in an important part through cooperative efforts with a key customer and such cooperation is expected to continue to be a significant element in the company s future development efforts 
the company s relationship with that customer are substantially dependent on the personal relations established by the company s president  mr 
jong s 
whang 
it is anticipated that approximately five additional engineers and technicians will be required for the proposed new photo assisted cvd product development effort 
the company presently employs one engineer and six technicians for its netherlands operation 
these employees design and support the horizontal diffusion furnace product line manufactured in the netherlands 
the company may from time to time seek to develop or acquire new products other than those described above to the extent that funds may be available 
patents generally  the effect of a patent is that the courts will grant to the patent holder the right to prevent others from making  using and selling the combination of elements or combination of steps covered by the patent 
the company has several united states patents on the atmoscan r system  each reflecting an improvement to or modification of the previous patent 
the two japanese patents pending on the atmoscan r cover the first two us patents listed in the table  below 
other than certain patents on the ibal automation  neither the ibal  cantilever  load stations nor the diffusion furnace products are protected by patents 
the following table shows the patents granted and the expiration date thereof and the patents pending for the company s products in each of the countries listed below expiration date or product country pending approval atmoscan r united states july  atmoscan r united states september  atmoscan r united states july  atmoscan r united states august  atmoscan r korea may  atmoscan r japan june  atmoscan r japan july  atmoscan r european patent community france july  germany july  united kingdom july  italy july  netherlands july  ibal cantilever trolley united states pending approval expiration date or product country pending approval photo cvd united states june  photo cvd united states november  photo cvd japan pending approval the company s ability to compete may be enhanced by its ability to protect its proprietary information  including the issuance of patents and trademarks 
while no intellectual property right of the company has been invalidated or declared unenforceable  there can be no assurance that such rights will be upheld in the future 
there can be no assurance that in the future products  processes or technologies owned by others  necessary to the conduct of the company s business can be licensed on commercially reasonable terms 
marketing there are two components of the market for the company s existing products  which consists of semiconductor manufacturers in the united states  western europe  taiwan  korea  japan and recently the people s republic of china and india 
one component consists of customers who are installing new semiconductor manufacturing facilities 
the other component consists of customers who wish to install new equipment systems in existing facilities 
the company s products have been sold in both components 
the market for the company s existing products is as described above 
the company intends to increase its share of that market by adding the horizontal diffusion furnace manufactured by the company in its netherlands facility to its product line and increasing its sales  marketing and manufacturing capabilities in europe 
this plan has and is expected to increase revenue not only through sales of a new product  but to increase sales of other products by permitting the company to offer a wider product line  enabling customers to fill more of their needs through purchases of the company s products and by permitting the company to offer more complete load stations described above 
for example  the company expects to generate increased sales of diffusion furnaces because it will offer them together with atmoscan r and ibal products 
the company also expects to obtain orders for its new horizontal diffusion furnace from former tempress customers as well as customers in the united states  a large market that had not been effectively penetrated by tempress in recent years 
the company s installed base of customers facilities at which the company s products are installed and operating includes ibm corporation  motorola  digital equipment  texas instruments  intel corporation  national semiconductor  rockwell international  phillips  northern telecom  sgs thomson  mitsubishi  oki  samsung  hyundai  umc and wuxi china 
of these corporations  ibm corporation  motorola  digital equipment  intel corporation  sgs thomson and samsung have been customers of the company for approximately years 
the company markets its products by participation in trade shows  by direct customer contact by the company s sales personnel currently the president and two salesmen in the united states and two sales and marketing personnel located in the netherlands and through independent sales representatives and distributors 
the company is dependent on its president  js whang  for continuing relationships with key customers 
during fiscal  three customers accounted for  and  respectively  of equipment sales 
no other customers accounted for or more of this segment s sales 
for a more complete analysis of significant equipment customers  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein the financial statements 
there are presently eight independent sales representatives  each covering a specified geographical area on an exclusive basis 
the areas now covered by representatives are the state of florida  the new england area  northern europe  central europe including germany  france  india  italy  korea  taiwan  and the people s republic of china 
representatives are paid a commission as specified from time to time in the company s commission schedule  which at present is higher for complete units and lower for spare parts and accessories 
furthermore  a discount is allowed to a customer who is a manufacturer of diffusion furnaces 
upon the development of the proposed photo assisted cvd product  the company will seek initially to make sales to customers who have assisted and will continue to assist in further development 
such customers will probably be allowed a discount from published prices 
although marketing the new product  if it is successfully developed  will probably result in an increase in the number of marketing employees and in advertising and other marketing expense  the amount cannot now be predicted with any degree of accuracy 
semiconductor equipment sales generally fluctuate with the level of capital spending in the semiconductor industry 
the semiconductor business is cyclical 
competition the company is not aware of any significant product which directly competes with the atmoscan r  however  there are several processing systems and various configurations of existing manufacturing products which provide advantages similar to those that the company believes the atmoscan r provides to semiconductor manufacturers 
notwithstanding the industry trend to the use of vertical diffusion furnaces with which atmoscan r is not useable  the company believes that a number of customers are and will continue to be willing to buy atmoscan r units for use with horizontal diffusion furnaces because the atmoscan r provides better results in terms of more uniform wafer temperature and dispersion of heated gases in the semiconductor manufacturing process  less exposure of semiconductor wafers to contaminants  and other technical advantages which afford to its users a higher yield and  therefore  a lower per item cost in the manufacture of semiconductors 
the company believes that there are several products in the market which perform the same functions as the ibal automation products  ibal atmoscan r  ibal butler and ibal queue  but they are more complex and more expensive 
the ibal products are intended for customers who do not require the more complex systems 
load stations are sold to customers that are upgrading their existing facilities with other products of the company 
these load stations provide a cleaner environment to those they replace and can reduce the down time for the upgrade as these load stations were specifically designed to accept the company s products without further modification 
products competitive with the company s load station are sold by several well established firms  larger than the company 
the company believes  however  that there is a niche market for its load stations because atmoscan r and ibal are included as components 
the cantilever system is designed for easy assembly and disassembly to minimize down time during maintenance 
the company expects to sell its horizontal diffusion furnaces to customers who purchase them in small quantities and that it will maintain a competitive position through its policy of providing competitive prices and product support services designed for the customer s specific requirements 
competition to be expected for the proposed photo assisted cvd product cannot now be determined 
it should be assumed  however  that others in the industry are in the process of developing new products and improving existing ones 
employees the company presently employs people including the corporate officers and three contract employees in its semiconductor equipment business  in manufacturing  in engineering  six in administration  and six in sales positions 
of these  are employed at the company s offices and plant in tempe  arizona  and at its facility in hoogeveen  netherlands 
technical contract personnel business discontinued operations sale of echelon general the company entered the technical contract personnel business through the acquisition in  from mr 
james d 
renner  of rts  inc rts  which business was principally conducted in the greater phoenix  arizona  area  with operations in texas and new mexico 
in  a similar business  echelon service company echelon  in baltimore  maryland  was acquired from mr 
eugene r 
hartman 
mr 
hartman is currently a director of the company 
in  the company continued its personnel business expansion through the acquisition of several businesses in los angeles  california known as martec from mr 
martin l 
simons 
in  rts  inc and martec  together with various wholly owned subsidiaries  were sold to another company 
under an agreement with the buyer  the company agreed not to engage in the temporary personnel business in those areas until october  the company s technical contract personnel business is conducted through a wholly owned subsidiary  echelon  located in baltimore  maryland 
echelon furnishes technical employees to customers located in baltimore and nearby areas including baltimore county and the eastern half of maryland  washington  dc  northern virginia and pennsylvania 
customers usually employ contract personnel when the estimated period of their need for the personnel is uncertain or believed to be short term  generally for periods of approximately six months 
this practice reduces the customers exposure to increased unemployment tax rates and other adverse consequences of frequent employee lay offs  reduces their recruiting expenses with respect to short term employees  and relieves them of the necessity of including technical contract personnel in various employee benefit plans 
arrangements with customers typically specify the company s charges usually a contractually fixed mark up over the compensation paid to the technical employee  the amount and type of insurance to be maintained by the company such as workmen s compensation and  the administrative functions to be performed by the company such as checking immigration status and processing applications for security clearances in connection with defense related employment 
the agreements set forth the terms to be applied if and when personnel are furnished to the customer  they do not require that the customer employ or that the company furnish any personnel 
the contract employee is in all legal respects an employee of the company for the time  and under the conditions  specified by the customer 
the company is responsible for paying the employee  and making appropriate payroll deductions and payment of proper amounts for income taxes  social security and the like 
customers are billed on a periodic basis 
all direct payroll costs employer s social security contributions  unemployment and workmen s compensation insurance premiums  etc 
are borne by the company 
in addition  the company provides certain limited fringe benefits to certain technical employees who meet criteria in terms of length and  steadiness of employment with customers 
contract personnel are employed and paid by the company only when they are engaged by a customer 
employee compensation is for the most part determined by negotiated agreements between the company and the customer and between the company and the employee  but in some areas are set by agreement between the company s customer and the particular employee 
the gross profit or margin of the company from personnel operations is the difference between the fee which is paid to the company by the customer and the compensation of the technical employee plus direct and indirect payroll costs paid by the company 
the company s fee is usually an agreed upon percentage of the employee s compensation 
variable factors affecting the earnings of this business are the cost of technical employee fringe benefits  payroll taxes  certain insurance premium costs to the extent that they can be influenced by the company and the company s related overhead expense 
there is currently a trend to increased unemployment insurance and workers compensation costs 
the company seeks to fill customer requests for specific types of technical employees with personnel selected on the basis of information maintained in its files  or with personnel who respond to help wanted advertising  active solicitation and referrals 
in most cases  the final hiring decision is made by the customer after conducting individual interviews with persons  selected by the company as well as those referred by competitors 
customers rarely if ever enter into exclusive agreements with any technical contract personnel supplier 
they maintain agreements with several selected technical contract personnel companies and specific requirements are usually communicated to all of them 
source and availability of contract personnel the company conducts a continuing recruiting effort to increase the number of prospective employees who desire to obtain temporary employment through the company 
this effort is conducted through general advertising in trade journals  advertising to fill specific positions  active solicitation and referrals 
the company has not experienced any material difficulties in recruiting employees qualified to meet customer requirements 
marketing and customers most of the company s customers and prospective customers usually solicit bids or proposals from personnel suppliers by submitting requirements for specific types of personnel on an employee by employee basis  with compensation being negotiated on an individual basis as well 
at such times the company  if it wishes to seek the business  prepares and submits a proposal to the customer or prospective customer which covers the fee or mark up and an undertaking to comply with customer requirements with respect to insurance and administrative matters 
company management personnel also seek to answer customer questions and convey assurances as to the company s experience and capabilities in furnishing technical contract personnel and otherwise performing customer services 
successful marketing often depends on the ability of individual management and marketing personnel to create and maintain good relationships with the customer s personnel management 
during fiscal and  martin marietta accounted for approximately and of echelon s revenues  respectively 
echelon markets itself as being a reliable source of highly skilled contract engineering talent 
as such  many of the customers tend to be engineering and technology driven companies which require additional personnel for specific projects 
the company emphasizes maintaining as large a customer base as possible  in order to minimize the pressure on prices and the volatility in revenues that sometimes results from being dependent upon one customer 
seasonality there is a certain seasonal aspect to the technical contract personnel business which is caused by the effect of payroll taxes 
the company is responsible for paying unemployment taxes and the employer s share of social security taxes 
when the maximum amount of such tax is reached for an employee  the company no longer makes payments in respect of the employee and its earnings are thereby increased 
accordingly  the earnings of the technical contract personnel business are higher during approximately the last three months of the calendar year corresponding to the company s first fiscal quarter than during other periods of the year 
payroll taxes tend to be the highest and earnings the lowest in the first three months of the calendar year corresponding to the company s second fiscal quarter as this is the period during which the company pays unemployment and social security taxes on all employees 
competition competitive factors in the technical contract personnel business are price the amount of fee or mark up over the salary or wage paid to the technical employee  ability to furnish the type of personnel required by the customer promptly and the quality of service given to customers 
the supplier with the largest number of qualified prospective technical employees and the information systems necessary to promptly match their skills and experience to the job requirements has a competitive advantage 
a number of the company s competitors are much larger and better financed than the company and as a result may be able to offer lower mark ups to customers because of economies of scale 
overhead personnel echelon has a total of five overhead employees  including one each in management  personnel recruiting  sales  administration and clerical 
plans to dispose of contract personnel business in october  the board of directors of the company determined to dispose of the contract personnel business in order to allow the company to focus on its core semiconductor equipment business 
in december  the company executed an agreement with eugene r 
hartman  a vice president of the company and the president of echelon  to sell all of the stock of echelon to mr 
hartman in exchange for  shares of amtech common stock held by mr 
hartman and additional cash consideration 
the total consideration for the echelon stock is valued at approximately million 
of that consideration  approximately  will be in the form of amtech stock and approximately  will be in the form of a cash distribution by echelon to amtech prior to the sale 
to the extent echelon does not have enough cash to make the full distribution  the balance will be paid by assigning receivables to amtech 
prior to entering the agreement with mr 
hartman  the company sought and negotiated offers from third parties 
however  in the opinion of the board  the best offer was tendered by mr

item properties the company s semiconductor equipment business and corporate offices are located in  square feet of office and manufacturing space at its principal address 
the facility is leased at a current rate of  per month for a term to expire on august  the company also leases approximately  square feet of general space on a month to month basis in hoogeveen  netherlands  at a current rate of  per month 
this facility will not provide adequate space for the company s assembly operations for its furnace line in the second half of fiscal  and accordingly the company will be required to lease additional space  which is believed to be available at prevailing lease rates 
if the results of the university study described above are favorable and the company commences a photo assisted cvd product development effort  an additional  square feet will be required for a laboratory 
that laboratory  together with the company s existing plant facility will  the company believes  be adequate through the first year of the development effort 
if and when commercial production begins  an additional  square feet of space may be required 
no difficulty is expected in obtaining any additional space at then prevailing rents

the  of net cash provided by operating activities resulted in the fiscal increase in cash and cash equivalents of  or 
short term investments  a capital resource  as well as another source of liquidity  also increased by  to  as of september  this increase resulted primarily from the  net proceeds from the public offering 
see note stockholders investment and stock options 
investments in property plant and equipment  primarily to increase the production capacity and operating efficiency of the semiconductor equipment segment and to improve a furnace used for sales demonstration and marketing purposes  resulted in the expenditure of  of such proceeds 
see the consolidated statements of cash flows included herein 
working capital increased by  to  from  an increase of  as a result of the net proceeds from the public offering 
the proceeds are substantially invested in us treasury bills and notes and other short term investments 
for the same reasons  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities increased to from during march  the company entered into a research and development contract with and paid  to the university of california at santa cruz the university 
the university was to develop designs and specifications for a prototype model of a product embodying the company s patented photo assisted cvd chemical vapor deposition process and to prove the feasibility and demonstrate the practical application of such product 
in november   amtech entered into an amendment of its research and development contract with the university  which expands the company s financial commitment by  and extends the contract through february  the purpose of the amendment is to confirm the deposition rate of the company s patented method before commencing the development of a commercial model of the photo assisted cvd reactor at amtech s facility 
as this study progresses  management will assess the degree of success achieved and determine how the company will proceed 
if the photo cvd feasibility study succeeds in demonstrating the practical commercial application of the company s patent  approximately  of liquidity and capital resources are expected to be expended to develop a commercial model of the photo assisted cvd reactor at amtech s facility and to manufacture and market the proposed photo assisted cvd product 
this expenditure is expected to be made in two stages approximately  for the development of an initial product suitable for use in research facilities and approximately  for the development of a product for use in industrial production facilities 
the funds from the cash and short term investments on hand should be sufficient for these two stages of development 
however  these estimates do not include any amount for the expansion of facilities for the manufacture of a new photo assisted cvd product designed for industrial production facilities 
funds for that expansion  if any  are expected to be obtained from cash flow from operations and other possible sources of financing  such as the possible exercise of the outstanding redeemable common stock warrants 
there is no assurance of the availability or sufficiency of that or any other source of financing 
subsequent to the end of fiscal  the company entered into a joint venture agreement pursuant to which it would have a ownership interest and a voting interest in seil semicon  inc in return for a commitment to invest  in cash 
on november   the company made an initial  investment in seil semicon  inc upon the receipt by the joint venture of million in third party financing  the company is obligated to make an additional  capital contribution 
the joint venture intends to develop and operate a silicon test wafer reclaiming business through seil semicon  inc  which is in the preliminary start up phase 
it has acquired real property for construction of the reclamation facility 
the ultimate success of seil semicon  inc depends on a number of factors  including securing adequate financing  of which there can be no assurance 
in addition  the company plans to either acquire the proprietary rights to a diffusion furnace controller to be developed by a third party or to develop its own 
the company currently purchases its controllers from other furnace manufacturers 
subject to securing a partial grant from the netherlands government and final approval of the projects specifications  the company plans to make a net investment of  for the acquisition or development of its own diffusion furnace controller 
if successful  of which there can be no assurance  the company expects to improve its competitive position and reduce its cost of sales over the long term 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal semiconductor equipment business the revenues of the semiconductor equipment business increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the improvement in revenues is due primarily to the  in sales of tempress horizontal diffusion furnaces and related after market parts resulting from the start up of manufacturing in the netherlands 
net revenues of the domestic operations were higher in fiscal than in fiscal  due to continued expansion in the demand by semiconductor manufacturers for production equipment and upgrades 
because tempress will be in full operation for all of fiscal and due to the increase in the backlog  the company believes that products sales may increase in fiscal the gross profit of this segment was  for fiscal versus  for fiscal  representing a increase 
the  increase in gross margin primarily results from the start up of the netherlands operation  volume increases in existing product lines  and a reduction in the material content as a percentage of sales due to a favorable product mix and increased use of lower cost parts manufactured in house rather than purchased from others 
these increases in gross margin were partially offset by increases in overhead expenses and a decline in the revenue and earnings derived from the sale of products manufactured by third parties 
gross margin as a percentage of revenue was in fiscal versus in the fiscal  with the decline primarily being attributed to the higher fixed costs in relation to sales associated with the start up operation in the netherlands 
further increases in fixed costs are planned for fiscal in order to provide greater manufacturing capacity 
however  because of the expected growth in revenue  gross margins may increase 
the selling  general and administrative costs associated with this segment were  higher in fiscal as compared to fiscal the higher costs are almost entirely associated with the new operations in the netherlands 
however  selling  general and administrative costs remained at approximately of revenues during both fiscal and prior to fiscal the company had made relatively small investments in product development for a technology business 
the company increased research and product development expenditures in fiscal by  primarily through the expenditure of  for the university study to demonstrate the practical application of the company s patented photo assisted chemical vapor deposition cvd process 
during fiscal  research and development costs consisted entirely of developing the new tempress line of furnaces  an automated robot to load cantilever paddle systems  and product improvements 
since the feasibility study continued through the end of fiscal without any further financial commitment required  total research and development costs in fiscal were  lower than in fiscal if the company is unable to acquire the proprietary rights to a furnace controller developed by a third party  as planned and as discussed above  research and development costs could increase in fiscal by the  cost  net of government grants  to develop its own diffusion furnace controller 
future earnings may decline significantly as the result of increased photo assisted cvd development expenses 
depending on the actual timing and results of the second stage of the feasibility study being conducted by the university  the company intends to expend  on research and development over approximately a three year period in order to develop a commercial product based upon the company s patented photo assisted cvd technology 
operating profits for the semiconductor equipment segment were  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal  an improvement of  during and the company committed significant capital to the future growth of this segment   in the start up losses of the netherlands operation in fiscal and  for the photo assisted cvd feasibility study in fiscal the improvement of this segment s operating profit for the two years reflects the expansion of the domestic operations  including increases in revenue   gross margin   and operating profit after excluding the photo assisted cvd study  
income from continuing operations income loss from continuing operations before income taxes includes the operating income of the semiconductor equipment segment  discussed above  general corporate expenses and net interest income  which increased in fiscal by   and  respectively  as compared to fiscal the increase in general corporate expense is principally due to incentive compensation tied to the completion of the public offering 
the growth in net interest income is due to the investment of  of the  received from the public offering 
as a result of these items  the income from continuing operations before income taxes improved by  to  in fiscal  from a loss of  in fiscal the income from continuing operations is  for fiscal  an improvement of  from the loss of  in fiscal  after taking into consideration the income tax provision of  in fiscal and the income tax benefit of  in fiscal the income tax provision for fiscal approximates the statutory rate 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details including an analysis of the differences between the statutory rate and the actual effective rate for fiscal the company s semiconductor equipment segment has been and may in the future be affected by the following trends 
furnaces used in semiconductor manufacturing are for the most part horizontal 
the use of vertical furnaces is increasing throughout the industry on a worldwide basis and is expected to increase in usage and in market share to an estimated over approximately the next five years as the technology improves 
however  the company continues to believe that a significant demand for its present product line will exist during that period  although there can be no assurance in that regard 
the reason for continued expected demand for atmoscan r and horizontal diffusion furnaces is that  notwithstanding other advantages of vertical systems eg reduced contamination and the capability to produce more sophisticated semiconductors more efficiently  for all but very large production runs there is a higher through put in horizontal furnaces as compared to vertical furnaces 
also  the company s products are often used in upgrading or retro fitting existing horizontal furnaces in order to extend their useful life and to avoid the necessity for the customer to acquire the much more expensive vertical furnaces 
another important factor is the growth of semiconductor manufacturing using the less capital intensive horizontal diffusion furnaces in the peoples republic of china  where the company made its first sale in fiscal  and other less developed areas  which could further prolong the commercial life of the company s existing products 
however  during the current cyclical upturn  demand for the atmoscan r has not reached the level of the previous high which was in  nor is it expected to reach that level again in future years because the atmoscan r is compatible with only horizontal furnaces 
thus future sales volume is dependent upon the continued introduction of new products  such as ibal automation products  or improved versions of products that exist in the market  such as clean room load stations and horizontal diffusion furnaces 
the company continues to pursue both types of product introductions 
the company s long range plans include developing  if feasible  a new product based on its patented photo assisted cvd technology 
discontinued technical contract personnel business net revenues of the technical contract personnel segment were  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal gross margins generated by these operations in fiscal and were  and  respectively  or and  respectively  when stated as a percentage of revenues 
these operations also produced operating profits of  and  for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decline in the revenues and the decrease in operating profit of this segment in fiscal as compared to fiscal are the result of the reduction in requirements of this segment s largest customer  to a level more representative to the years preceding fiscal the margin percentage produced by these operations improved due to the permanent placement business and another because of higher ratio of full service business in relation to the lower margin  payroll servicing business 
general and administrative costs increased  as a result of the inclusion of the permanent placement business for a full year and by  primarily from the settlement of a sexual harassment lawsuit 
in order to concentrate of the company s management and financial resources on its core semiconductor segment  echelon  the only remaining business in the technical contract personnel business  was sold effective december  as a result  this segment is designated as discontinued in the consolidated financial statements 
although the income tax provision associated with this segment approximates the statutory rate in fiscal  it is substantially lower in fiscal due to the resolution of uncertainties 
due to the sale of echelon  revenue and operating profit of discontinued operations for fiscal will include that business for only one quarter and thus will be significantly less than in fiscal total company consolidated revenues and total operating profit are summarized for the past three years in item  selected financial data 
fiscal s consolidated revenues were only higher  or  compared to  in fiscal  despite the increase in the sales of semiconductor equipment 
as discussed above  this is due to the decline in the revenues of the discontinued technical contract personnel business 
the improvement in the operating profit  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  is primarily a result of growth in revenues and profitability of the domestic portion the semiconductor equipment segment operations  which is offset by the start up losses of the netherlands operation and the reduction in the profits of the discontinued technical contract personnel business 
the  growth in net interest income results from the investment of  of the  received from the public offering 
as a result of all the above factors  the combined income from continuing and discontinued operations before income taxes for fiscal was  or  higher  compared with  in fiscal the total income tax provision for the year ended september  approximates the federal statutory rate 
the fiscal tax provision is significantly less than the federal statutory rate applied to pre tax income principally due to the  benefit from research and development credits 
as of september   the valuation allowance for deferred taxes is  and results from the company s limiting its recognition of state deferred tax assets  principally state net operating losses which can be carried forward only five years 
those state deferred tax assets will be recognized to the extent of arizona state taxable income in fiscal years and as a result of all of the above factors  net income for fiscal was  or 
per share  including 
per share from continuing operations  as compared to  or 
per share  net of a loss of 
per share from continuing operations  in fiscal as of november   the company s order backlog for semiconductor equipment was approximately  compared to  as of the same date of the previous year 
after deducting the approximately  of the current backlog that will not ship until fiscal  there is a increase in the backlog that can be shipped within one year 
most of the increase in the order backlog and the anticipated growth in semiconductor equipment revenue is for the new horizontal diffusion furnaces 
also  while there are exceptions  orders generally are shipped within six months of receipt 
therefore  growth in equipment sales and income from continuing operations will depend on how quickly productive capacity for diffusion furnaces can be expanded and the timing of the receipt of new orders 
another factor that could significantly affect profitability is the amount of research and development expenses  if any  incurred for the development of a controller for diffusion furnaces if not purchased and of a model of the photo assisted cvd product designed for use in research facilities 
fiscal compared to fiscal semiconductor equipment business the revenues of the semiconductor equipment business increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the improvement in revenues was due to the first sales of horizontal diffusion furnaces substantially assembled by suppliers  and sales to india 
the gross profit of this segment was  for fiscal versus  for fiscal  representing a decrease 
the recognition of the deferred epic revenue net of the provision for warranty expense accounted for approximately  of the fiscal gross profit 
after subtracting the effects of recognizing the deferred epic revenues as described above and in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  gross margins increased  or 
gross margin as a percentage of revenue was in fiscal versus in the fiscal after subtracting the effects of the recognition of the deferred epic revenue in fiscal most of the improvement in gross margins results from the higher sales volume discussed above 
the primary factors resulting in the decrease in the adjusted gross margin percentages are design and pricing errors resulting from the significant growth in sales from  in fiscal to  in fiscal without sufficiently increasing the work force 
the selling  general and administrative costs associated with this segment increased  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the primary reasons for this increase are  of additional travel costs primarily associated with efforts to expand foreign markets and the  growth in commission expense primarily related to sales made in india 
furthermore  bad debt expense increased by  due to the bankruptcy of an entity for whose products the company acted as sales agent 
until fiscal the company had not made expenditures for product development at a normal level for a technology business 
the company increased research and product development expenditures in fiscal by  primarily through the expenditure of  for the university study to demonstrate the practical application of the company s patented photo assisted chemical vapor deposition cvd process 
operating profits for the semiconductor equipment segment amounted to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal  a decrease of  the inclusion of  of gross profit from the recognition of deferred epic revenue net of related warranty costs and a  recovery from patent infringement litigation in the operating income of fiscal with no comparable items in fiscal and the  increase in research and development costs in fiscal account for  of the decline in operating profit 
the increase in selling  general and administrative costs also contributed to the decline 
income from continuing operations in addition to the operating income of the semiconductor equipment segment  discussed above  income loss from continuing operations before income taxes includes general corporate expenses and net interest income  which were  and  higher  respectively  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the growth in net interest income was due to having the funds resulting from the fiscal collection of the martec and rts receivables for a full year 
because of the cost of the photo assisted cvd project  the operating profit of the semiconductor equipment segment combined with net interest income was less than the general corporate expenses for fiscal  resulting in a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of  compared to  of income from continuing operations in fiscal the loss from continuing operations is  for fiscal  a  reduction in earnings from the income of  in fiscal  after taking into consideration the income tax benefit of  in fiscal and the income tax provision of  in fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements for an analysis of the differences between the statutory rate and the actual effective rate for fiscal the income tax provision for fiscal approximates the statutory rate of 
discontinued technical contract personnel business net revenues of the technical contract personnel segment were  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal gross margins generated by these operations in fiscal and were  and  respectively  or in each year when stated as a percentage of revenues 
these operations also produced operating profits of  and  for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in the revenues and the increase in operating profit of this segment in fiscal as compared to fiscal are the result of a continued improvement in the economy in the company s markets and more importantly the increased requirements of this segment s largest customer 
the margin percentage produced by these operations remained stable despite the continued competition in the maryland  washington d 
c  and pennsylvania markets 
general and administrative costs remained under control 
total company consolidated revenues and total operating profit are summarized for the past three years in item  selected financial data 
the factors contributing to fiscal s increase in consolidated revenues to  are discussed above by segment  particularly under the technical contract personnel segment 
the reduction in the operating profit from  in fiscal to  in fiscal are described above by segment  particularly under the semiconductor equipment segment 
general corporate expenses increased by  or  due to increased activities related to attempts to expand the company s business opportunities 
in fiscal the company had net interest expense of  as approximately of the rts and martec receivables were financed by a bank line of credit 
with the collection of those receivables and repayment of the line of credit during fiscal  the company earned net interest income of  in fiscal and  in fiscal the higher interest income in fiscal was due to having the funds resulting from the collection of those receivables for a full year 
as a result  the income from operations before income taxes for fiscal amounted to  compared with  in fiscal the fiscal tax provision is significantly less than the federal statutory rate applied to pre tax income principally due to the  benefit of research and development credits and the effects of the settlement of the tax  penalties and interest assessed in a prior year by the irs 
these items are partially offset by the  provision for state income and other less significant items 
as of september   the valuation allowance for deferred taxes is  and results from the company s limiting its recognition of state deferred tax assets  principally state net operating losses which can be carried forward only five years 
those state deferred tax assets will be recognized in future carryforward periods to the extent of state taxable income 
as a result of all of the above factors  net income for fiscal was  or 
per share  as compared to  or
