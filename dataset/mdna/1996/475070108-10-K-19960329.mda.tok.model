jefferson pilot communications company jp communications owns and operates three network television and fourteen radio broadcast stations and produces syndicated sports and entertainment programming 
jp communications revenues originate principally from the sale of advertising and other related services through its television and radio stations 
on october   jp acquired alexander hamilton life insurance company of america and certain of its affiliates from a subsidiary of household international  inc hi 
the acquisition was completed through a merger into a wholly owned michigan domiciled stock life insurance subsidiary of jp  which thereupon was renamed alexander hamilton life insurance company of america ah life

certain product classes  including credit life and accident and health insurance  corporate owned life insurance and periodic payment annuities  were not acquired but were reinsured back to affiliates of hi through coinsurance agreements 
hi provided payment  performance  and capital maintenance guarantees to secure these reinsurance agreements and established trusts backing a majority of the assets  subject to annual requirements for solvency and capital adequacy 
the purchase price was approximately million paid as follows million plus accrued interest in cash and million in newly issued floating rate preferred stock of ah life 
in addition  an outstanding surplus note of ah life which is classified as a liability in accordance with gaap was acquired from hi for million plus accrued interest 
the acquisition was financed through internal resources  borrowings of million under a day credit agreement dated october  and million from the sale of automatic common exchange securities due january   which are subject to exchange into shares of nationsbank corporation common stock beginning days prior to maturity

policy reserves of approximately million will be recorded if of such policyholders elect participation 
to the extent that such options are not exercised  the company will refund policy amounts received plus interest thereon 
additionally  subsidies to policyholders by participating guaranty associations which are intended to mitigate against the unfavorable financial impact to policyholders of surrenders do not apply prior to february  after that time  the level of policyholder withdrawals may increase 
the company does not expect that either of these uncertainties will have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
jp s revenues are derived approximately from life insurance  from communications  and from parent company and other investments 
the weightings have shifted more toward the life insurance segment during due to acquisitions 
consolidated revenues for include the results of the kcl assumption for the last seven months and for the ah life acquisition for the last three months of the year

net income earnings per common share increased in and in earnings per common share excluding the effects of adopting sfas and net realized investment gains increased in and in the increase for both years was partly due to improved earnings and partly due to the impact of share repurchases 
earnings per common share from continuing operations improved in and in jp s plan of operations focuses on growing revenues through internal expansion and acquisitions 
revenues increased to  million in and to  million in excluding realized investment gains  revenues increased in and in s increase was largely attributable to acquisitions 
premiums and considerations excluding discontinued operations increased in to million and in to million 
life and annuity premiums and considerations increased in to million and in to million 
in  a increase was accomplished through the company s acquisition strategy and an growth through internal development 
the internal growth in jp life is attributable to the successful implementation of its individual life and annuity and investment products business plans over the last two years 
the individual life business plan focuses on improvement in the productivity of career life agents and on developing new relationships with independent producers 
the annuity and investment products business plan emphasizes growth through multiple distribution systems including financial institutions  independent agents  investment professionals  and broker dealers 
this focus on multiple distribution sources has resulted in growth in premium receipts from traditional products as well as universal life and annuity products not including acquisitions exceeding in and in receipts on universal life and most annuity products do not flow through income in the year of receipt but are included in the liability for policyholder contract deposits 
accident and health premiums increased in to million and in to million 
accident and health premium growth for such years was modest due to a moderation in the rate of medical inflation in the most recent two years and intense market competition 
ii net investment income grew in to million and in to million 
in  net investment income grew without acquisitions 
this growth occurred in spite of lower investment yields experienced during the three year period 
such decline is represented by the following table that presents yield at cost on bonds and mortgages march june september december growth in investment income was achieved primarily by growth in invested assets arising from policyholder contract deposits related to universal life and annuity products 
during  policyholder contract deposits excluding acquisitions increased to  million with annuities increasing to  million 
during  these deposits increased to  million  of which annuity funds comprised  million  an increase of 
total policyholder deposits including acquisitions at year end were  million  of which  million were annuity funds 
revenues from the communications segment declined in due to the sale of assets of jefferson pilot data services and increased in to million 
without inclusion of this entity in operating results  revenues increased in growth in both years was achieved as a result of acquisitions  market share increases  and a favorable economic environment 
all of these events favorably influenced advertising receipts  the primary component of communications revenues 
total benefits  claims  and expenses increased in to  million and in to million 
without acquisitions  they increased to  million in life benefits and credits to policyholder accounts increased in and in  reflecting the growth in life business in force 
accident and health benefits increased in due to higher loss ratios  but only in as growth in medical inflation and utilization were moderate in that year 
net life insurance expenses after deferral of policy acquisition costs increased in due to increased life productions  and declined in as the company improved the economies of its individual distribution systems 
cost of communications operations declined in due to the sale of jefferson pilot data services and increased in as a result of acquisitions of television and radio properties as well as costs associated with higher overall revenues 
operating income available to common shareholders including discontinued operations but excluding net realized investment gains increased in to million and in to million 
in  acquisitions contributed growth and internal development 
s results were impacted adversely by lower earnings on group operations 
income taxes from continuing operations increased million  or  and million  or  in effective tax rates were   and in   and s effective tax rate decreased because of recoveries and reductions of prior years taxes 
s effective tax rate increased as a result of a reduction in the percentage of tax favored investments 
ii operating earnings by business segment jp s continuing business segments include life insurance and communications 
within the life insurance segment  major product classes include individual life insurance  annuity and investment products and group insurance 
annuity and investment products are now shown as a separate product class because of growth in these products from acquisitions 
certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to break out results of annuity and investment products 
operating income of the business segments includes investment income but excludes net realized investment gains 
operating income and losses of the parent company  consolidation entries  and net realized investment gains are included in the other category 
currently  all corporate capital is allocated to the business segments

as a percentage of total revenues  operating income for the individual life insurance unit was in without acquisitions  in  and in s results were favorably influenced especially during the fourth quarter by acquisitions  improved mortality  and earnings on increased policyholder contract deposits 
s results improved on the strength of expense savings 
expenses represented of total revenues in  in  and in without acquisitions  s expense ratio is 
effective tax rates are for  for  and for these effective rates have increased over because of the company s emphasis on holding a greater percentage of its investments in fully taxable securities 
premiums and other considerations increased in and in s increase is reflective of the company s strategy to achieve growth through new distribution sources as well as acquisitions 
without acquisitions  premiums and considerations increased in policy benefits increased in without acquisitions and in exclusive of acquisitions  death benefits in were higher than the prior year with a increase in face amount of insurance in force 
in  death benefits increased while insurance in force increased 
expenses increased in without acquisitions but declined in s increase is primarily related to acquisitions and growth of existing business 
the decline in occurred through improved economies in the career and home service distribution channels and as a result of the increase in the proportion of expenses related to new business sales  and thus deferred

annuity and investment products recognizing the significant market for retirement products  annuity and investment products are shown as a separate product line this year with comparable amounts for the previous four years 
with the acquisition of ah life  these products are significant and a separate discussion enhances the reader s comprehension of jp s results 
annuity and investment products are offered through financial institutions  independent agents  career agents  investment professionals  and broker dealers

health results improved in but declined in due to higher loss ratios among conventionally insured coverages and adverse experience in long term disability claims in certain industries  as indicated by the following chart in millions operating income group life group health ii premiums and equivalents  which include the equivalent premiums on cases administered on an uninsured basis  increased in and in s growth was affected by premium concessions to encourage clients to adopt managed care arrangements 
s growth was favorable as the company sold more new managed care cases 
policy benefits on fully insured coverages increased in and in death benefits in were higher at million and were higher in at million 
the group department experienced unusually high mortality in  particularly in its large case business  with improvement noted in expenses increased in and in the majority of the increases were attributable to managed care costs  network access fees  and other expenses that were passed through to customers 
such expenses increased as a result of more widespread use of managed care provider networks 
communications jp communications operates television and radio broadcast properties and produces syndicated sports and entertainment programming 
operating results were in thousands communications revenues      operating costs      depreciation and amortization      general expenses      total expenses      operating income before income taxes      provision for income taxes      operating income      operating income from the communications segment increased in and in in early  substantially all of the assets and the media services operations of jefferson pilot data services  inc jpds were sold for aggregate consideration approximating million 
operating income of jpds of million in  million in  and million in is included in the communications segment 
earnings on sale proceeds of jpds are included in the other segment for excluding jpds  operating income increased in s increase in core broadcasting earnings is attributable to both television and radio properties  as well as refunds of federal income taxes and related interest 
s increase is attributable to market share increases  particularly among radio properties  a favorable sales environment in the broadcast media business  acquisitions in new and existing markets  and increases in sports production business 
ii revenues declined in and improved in during  television revenues improved  radio  and sports and entertainment 
despite the decline in political revenues from  television benefitted from strong market growth and improved revenue shares in several key markets as well as the addition of sports programming 
radio experienced strong growth in all markets  but this gain was partially offset by a decline in market share in two major markets due to increased competition 
during  television revenues improved  radio  and sports and entertainment 
television improved as a result of acquisition activity  political advertising  and improved economic conditions 
radio benefitted from very favorable advertising conditions  acquisitions  and improved market shares 
the majority of the sports and entertainment increase was related to special sports programming events occurring during total expenses  as a percentage of revenues  improved to in versus in and in this favorable trend resulted from higher sales associated with improved market shares and a strong business environment  as well as special sports programming events 
effective tax rates including both federal and state income taxes of in  in and in were influenced favorably by refunds of federal income taxes 
discontinued operations and other discontinued operations include the operations of jefferson pilot fire casualty jpf c and jefferson pilot title insurance company jp title 
these subsidiaries formerly comprised the other insurance segment 
on december   jp agreed to sell the stock of jpf c for cash of million and recorded a gain on sale of million in prior to sale  jp received a dividend in partial liquidation of million 
jp title was sold during the fourth quarter of for a small gain 
earnings on proceeds from sale of these subsidiaries are included in the other segment for the operations of both subsidiaries are segregated as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements 
operating income attributable to discontinued operations declined to million  as they were only included for a portion of the year  but increased in to million 
gain on disposal of these companies included million from sale of investments prior to closing 
other operating results categorized as other include earnings on investments held in the parent company and passive investment subsidiaries  as reduced by expenses of the corporation and financing costs 
these results improved in due to earnings on cash sales proceeds of discontinued operations  offset by acquisition financing costs of million for three months  and in due to a reduction of expenses associated with shareholder litigation and income from options written on equity securities totaling million 
consolidated financial position  capital resources and liquidity jp s resources are primarily represented by investments related to its life insurance segment  properties  and other assets used in its life insurance and communications segments and investments backing corporate capital 
the investments section reviews the company s investment portfolio and key strategies 
ii total assets were  million and  million at december  and an increase of  million  or 
primary sources for asset growth were acquisitions  million  increases in policyholder contract deposits million  net borrowings million  and cash provided by operating activities 
these sources were offset by cash dividends paid to shareholders million and net acquisitions of jp shares million 
asset values also increased due to changes in market values of assets held in the available for sale category 
these increases were the result of decreases in market interest rate yields and transfers of certain held to maturity securities to the available for sale designation 
the life insurance segment defers the costs of acquiring new business including commissions  certain costs of underwriting and issuing policies  and certain agency office expenses 
such amounts deferred were million and million at december  and  an increase of million 
additionally  jp recorded value of insurance in force at fair value of million in conjunction with the assumption from kcl and acquisition of ah life 
this asset represents the actuarialy determined present value of future gross profits for the businesses acquired  discounted at a risk adjusted rate of return 
value of insurance in force is amortized at a constant rate based on the present value of the estimated gross profit amounts expected to be realized over the life of the business 
during  the balance was reduced by million for net amortization  million for the effect of realized investment gains  and million for the effect of unrealized investment gains 
goodwill representing the cost of acquired businesses in excess of fair value of net assets of million and million at december  and relates to acquisitions of ah life and communication properties and is being amortized over periods ranging from to years  with a dollar weighted average amortization period of approximately years 
goodwill as a percentage of shareholders equity was and at december  and carrying amounts of goodwill  value of insurance in force  and deferred policy acquisition costs are regularly reviewed for indications of value impairment with consideration given to the financial performance of acquired properties  future gross profits of insurance in force  and other relevant factors 
at december   jp had recorded reinsurance receivables of  million and policy loans of million which are related to the businesses of ah life not acquired by jp 
these businesses are coinsured to hi  which has provided payment  performance  and capital maintenance guarantees with respect to the balances receivable 
capital resources jp s financial strength is among the highest of its peer companies 
consolidated shareholders equity was  and  million at december  and shareholders equity includes net unrealized gains on securities available for sale of million and million at december  and the company adopted sfas as of january   as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
this resulted in a net increase in shareholders equity on that date of million 
ii jp considers existing capital resources to be more than adequate to support the current level of its business activities 
the company s business plan places priority on redirecting certain capital resources now invested in bonds and stocks into its core businesses  which businesses would be expected to produce higher returns over time 
as part of its plan to use its capital resources effectively  the company may continue to purchase its own common stock from time to time 
management believes that acquisitions and other strategic opportunities can be funded using a prudent balance of capital and debt financing 
long term debt outstanding was million at december  in the fourth quarter  the company filed a shelf registration statement for million of debt securities 
in december  the company completed a public offering of  unsecured automatic common exchange securities due january  aces 
annual interest of is payable quarterly in arrears 
net proceeds of million were used to repay short term borrowings incurred in connection with the acquisition of ah life 
at maturity  or within the prior thirty days  the company will exchange the aces into shares of nationsbank corporation common stock or equivalent cash  as more particularly described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
while it has made no commitments for obtaining additional financing  the company may issue additional long term debt securities to finance acquisitions or for other corporate purposes 
the company is also obligated under a variable rate note with an outstanding balance of million collateralized by an investment property and equipment 
short term debt outstanding was million and million at december  and during and  the company utilized uncommitted bank lines of credit to manage parent company cash flows 
in october  the company replaced uncommitted bank lines with a day unsecured revolving credit agreement  which was placed with a commercial bank syndicate  in the amount of million 
proceeds are to be used for funding a portion of the acquisition of ah life and for general corporate purposes 
interest rates of borrowings under the revolving credit agreement either are selected by the company by competitive bids from the syndicate banks or  at the company s option  are established at a level using the london interbank borrowing rate as a base 
the maximum amounts outstanding at any time under the revolving agreement and uncommitted bank lines were million in and million during during and  the company sold us treasury obligations under repurchase agreements involving various counterparties 
proceeds were used to purchase securities with longer durations as an asset liability management strategy 
the repurchase agreements were accounted for as financing arrange ments 
the maximum amount outstanding during and was million and million 
underlying securities collateralizing open repurchase agreements at year end were million at fair value and million at amortized cost for  and million at fair value and million at amortized cost for jp s capital adequacy is illustrated by the following table in millions total assets      total shareholders equity      ratio of shareholders equity to assets ii the company s ratio of capital to assets declined during as a result of acquisitions and internal growth  and in due to growth in policyholder contract deposits as well as securities sold under repurchase agreements which are accounted for as financing arrangements 
jp considers the capital requirements of its business segments in determining the level of capital available for strategic development 
the life insurance segment  which employs the larger level of required capital  is subject to regulatory constraints 
capital employed in the life insurance companies is measured in accordance with statutory accounting practices sap which differ from generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the bases for valuation of gaap assets and liabilities are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the life companies have not previously ceded business under surplus relief reinsurance arrangements nor has statutory capital and surplus been enhanced by any transaction or item that is either not included in gaap shareholders equity or eliminated in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the national association of insurance commissioners naic has adopted risk based capital rbc levels for life insurers 
rbc requires the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital and surplus based on formulas related to investment credit risk  insurance risk  interest rate risk  and general business risk 
for purposes of determining compliance with this new requirement  jp life and ah life compare minimum capital requirements authorized control level with adjusted statutory capital includes statutory capital and surplus  asset valuation reserves  and other adjustments 
regulatory authorities require that life insurers maintain adjusted capital and surplus positions up to twice the authorized control level 
each of these subsidiaries currently hold surplus levels substantially in excess of amounts needed to comply with regulatory requirements 
jp life and ah life have been assigned the following ratings by the following agencies jp life ah life am best a a standard poor s claims paying aaa aaa duff and phelps aaa aaa moody s aa aa jp management believes that the ratings assignments are a result of its overall capital position  stability of life insurance earnings  high quality investment portfolio  and competitive position within the market 
in managing its capital position  jp measures required capital for each of its major product lines in a manner similar to methods utilized by regulatory authorities for risk based capital requirements 
capital is allocated to product lines in amounts which management believes are prudent and necessary to cover all risks inherent in the book of business 
management also focuses on investment quality and other indications of capital adequacy  such as operating leverage  capital and surplus ratios  and the ratio of higher risk assets as a percentage of statutory capital and surplus 
management believes that these ratios are more conservative than those prevailing in the life insurance industry 
ii liquidity jp s liquidity requirements are met primarily by cash flows from the operations of jp life  ah life and other consolidated subsidiaries 
the company has historically posted positive cash flows from operating activities of its life insurance and communications segments 
management believes that its overall sources of liquidity will continue to be sufficient to satisfy its operating requirements 
net cash provided by operations on a consolidated basis was million  million  and million for   and cash flows provided from increases in policyholder contract deposits were million  million  and million in   and net proceeds from short term borrowing and securities sold under repurchase agreements were million  million  and million in   and these sources of funds were used to purchase net investments of million  million  and million  pay dividends to shareholders of million  million  and million  and to make net acquisitions of shares outstanding of million  million  and million in   and primary sources of cash from its life insurance segment are premiums  other insurance considerations  receipts for policyholder accounts  investment sales and maturities  and investment income 
primary uses of cash include payment of insurance benefits  operating expenses  withdrawals from policyholder accounts  costs related to acquiring new business  income taxes  and investment purchases 
primary sources of cash from the communications segment are revenues from advertising and sports and entertainment production 
primary uses of cash include payment of agency commissions  cost of sales  operating expenses  and income taxes 
cash dividends paid to the parent company from its subsidiaries were million in  million in  and million in jp life has been the primary source of dividends 
jp life is subject to north carolina laws and ah life is subject to michigan laws 
both states limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without first obtaining the approval of the state s insurance commissioner 
on a statutory basis  total dividends from jp life to the parent company of million include an extraordinary dividend representing shares in a former jp life subsidiary  whose holdings at year end included approximately four million shares of nationsbank common stock 
because of this dividend and extraordinary dividends paid by ah life prior to its acquisition  any dividends by either company prior to the fourth quarter of will require regulatory approval 
the first quarter dividend of million from jp life was approved and paid 
no common stock dividends from ah life are planned for dividend payments on the million floating rate preferred stock issued to hi also require advance approval prior to october   and all interest payments on the million surplus note held by a jp subsidiary also require advance approval 
the first quarter payments were approved 
cash and short term investments were million and million at december  and additionally  debt and equity securities held by the parent company and nonregulated subsidiaries with carrying amounts of ii million and million at december  and are considered to be sources of liquidity to support the company s strategies 
total trading securities and debt and equity securities available for sale at december  were  million 
investments jp s strategy for managing its investment portfolio is to dependably meet its pricing assumptions while achieving the highest possible after tax returns over the long term 
operating structures are in place to require that credit and interest rate risks are prudently managed and that sufficient liquidity is maintained 
management focuses on option adjusted yields as a measure of anticipated performance and on option adjusted durations of assets and liabilities as a measure of interest rate risk 
cash flows from operations are invested primarily in fixed income securities  including publicly issued bonds  privately placed notes and bonds  and commercial mortgage loans 
the nature and quality of the various types of investments held by insurance subsidiaries must comply with the statutes and regulations imposed by the states in which they are licensed 
jp held the following carrying amounts of investments at each of the dates reported dec 
 dec 
 dollars in millions publicly issued bonds   privately placed bonds  commercial mortgage loans  common stock policy loans  preferred stock real estate cash  other invested assets total   privately placed bonds and commercial mortgage loans have decreased as a percentage of invested assets due to acquisitions 
near term strategies include identification of fixed income market sectors and niches that provide investment opportunities to meet the portfolios growth  quality  and yield requirements 
as a result  the company anticipates that private placement and commercial mortgage loan production will increase these categories as a percent of total assets as they did in before the acquisitions 
common stocks  as a percent of total assets  have declined due to acquisitions and transfers to separate accounts for company sponsored pension plans 
the company will continue to hold common stock as an investment of corporate capital and surplus to enhance the long term value of the company and to provide opportunities for tax efficient portfolio management strategies  however  the percentage of common stocks will likely decline as new cash flows from policyholder account balances are invested in fixed interest securities 
jp s investment policy statement requires an average quality fixed income portfolio excluding mortgage loans of a or higher 
currently  the average quality is aa  excluding mortgage loans 
the policy statement also imposes limits on the amount of lower quality investments and requires diversification ii by issuer and asset type 
the company monitors investments which are considered to be higher risk for compliance with the investment policy statement and for proper valuation 
securities that experience other than temporary declines in value are adjusted to net realizable values through a charge to earnings 
commercial mortgage loans in default are carried at the net present value of expected future cash flows 
additionally  the company carries a reserve for nonspecific losses attributable to the mortgage portfolio 
other investments are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value  as appropriate 
carrying amounts of investments categorized as higher risk assets were  at year end dollars in millions bonds near or in default bonds below investment grade mortgage loans days delinquent or in foreclosure mortgage loans restructured foreclosed properties subtotal  higher risk assets all other investments   total cash and investments   the company s investment guidelines allow investments in below investment grade bonds up to a level which is specifically authorized by the finance committee 
in making acquisitions of this nature  the company attempts to identify well structured private placements offering enhanced yields 
also  the highest tier of public noninvestment grade bonds which have the potential to be upgraded crossover credits are considered for acquisition 
due to the acquisition of ah life  below investment grade bonds exceed the prior year as a percentage of total assets 
it is expected that this percentage will decline as new purchases are concentrated in investment grade securities 
the company will continue to manage its credit risks in a prudent fashion with due regard to regulatory constraints and efficient utilization of surplus 
while the company s investment policy permits the use of derivative financial instruments such as futures contracts and interest rate swaps in conjunction with specific direct investments  jp has not historically employed such instruments to alter investment or liability positions 
ah life has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and has not previously used them for trading purposes  but generally to manage well defined interest rate risks 
interest rate swaps with a notional value of million are open as of december   termination of which at current interest rates would result in an insignificant settlement payment 
the net amount paid or received under these arrangements is reflected as an adjustment to investment income 
during and  jp sold call options on selected common stock holdings classified as available for sale to reduce the market risk of these equities and as an additional source of investment returns 
premiums received from these options are applied to reduce the basis of the shares called or are recorded as investment income upon expiry 
the company s investment policy ii statement authorizes an investment up to million in trading securities shares for the primary purpose of writing covered call options to enhance returns from option premiums  market appreciation  and dividends received 
option premiums received under this program are recorded as investment income together with realized and unrealized gains on the portfolio 
considerations received for both programs were million in and million in as discussed in the liquidity section  the company sold securities under repurchase agreements as an asset liability management strategy 
jp held the following collateralized mortgage obligations cmo s at year end in millions available for sale  at fair value federal agency issued cmo s  corporate private labeled cmo s held to maturity  at amortized cost federal agency issued cmo s total  the company s investment strategy with respect to cmo s focuses on actively traded  less volatile issues that produce relatively stable cash flows 
cmo holdings consist predominantly of the least volatile planned amortization classes and sequential tranches of federal agency issuers 
during  the company liquidated its holdings of mortgage pass through securities and reinvested the proceeds into less volatile cmo s with longer durations 
due to the high quality and liquid nature of these investments  the company believes that the impairment risks associated with these securities are no greater than those applicable to direct agency or corporate issues 
in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb announced that reporting entities would be allowed an opportunity to reassess the appropriateness of the classification of all securities held 
subsequent guidance indicated that reclassifications from the held to maturity category that result from this one time reassessment will not call into question the intent of an entity to hold other debt securities to maturity in the future 
in response  the company transferred certain securities between the held to maturity htm category and the available for sale afs category as shown below transfers from htm to afs at fair value million transfers from afs to htm at fair value million prior to the reclassifications  jp generally classified approximately of its bond portfolio as afs  after the above reclassifications  the company expects that approximately of its bond portfolio will be classified as afs 
asset liability management the asset liability management process focuses primarily on the management of interest rate risk 
one measure of this risk is a comparison of asset and liability durations 
duration measures the sensitivity of asset and ii liability values to changes in interest rates 
jp monitors the duration of insurance liabilities for comparison to the duration of assets backing the insurance lines 
responsibility for monitoring interest rate risk lies with the company s asset liability management committee  which is made up of finance  investment  and actuarial senior management 
this group is charged with continually monitoring and refining the company s position in an attempt to prudently balance profitability and risk for each insurance line and for the company in the aggregate 
separate asset portfolios have been established for each insurance line 
various modeling and analytical systems are employed in analyzing the assets and liabilities which make up each of these lines 
option adjusted liability durations have been developed using stochastic actuarial projections of liability cash flows 
in addition  the investment department s models measure the assets effective duration and produce other analytical measures necessary for portfolio management 
jp considers the duration match for the respective portfolios as well as total assets and liabilities 
the company also considers the timing of the cash flows arising from the assets and liabilities under different interest rate scenarios 
management intends that option adjusted durations for interest sensitive portfolios such as universal life and annuities remain prudently matched 
a wider tolerance is permissible for the noninterest sensitive traditional portfolios 
at december  and  and of life insurance invested assets at amortized cost were held for interest sensitive portfolios and and were held for traditional portfolios and corporate capital and surplus 
external trends  economic factors and accounting pronouncements jp operates largely in the u 
s 
financial services market  which is subject to general economic conditions in the us over the past several years  these conditions have exhibited signs of gradual improvement and slow growth 
recent trends which have affected the company include rising bond and stock prices caused by secular declines in interest rates  increased levels of mergers  consolidations and reorganizations  and moderate increases in health care utilization and inflation as a result of increased emphasis on managed care arrangements 
growth of life and health insurance sales continues to be slow for most insurance companies due to changing demographics and inefficient distribution systems 
a slowing economy and increased competition from banks  mutual funds  and other financial institutions for investable consumer dollars also suppressed premium growth over the last two years 
the company believes that it has experienced growth at a rate greater than the overall industry because of acquisitions  its strong financial position  and efforts to increase distribution sources 
inflation and interest rate risks interest rates have varied in response to concerns for inflationary pressures in the us economy 
during  ten year us treasury rates declined approximately basis points 
in  the federal reserve raised interest rates significantly out of a concern for inflationary pressures 
since jp s assets and liabilities are largely monetary in nature  the company s financial position is impacted by changes in the general interest rate environment 
interest rate declines during and increases during ii contributed to the increase in unrealized gains on securities available for sale  net of deferred taxes of million and the decrease in of million 
interest rate changes can affect the company s net worth either positively or negatively since fixed income securities available for sale are recorded at fair values but corresponding liabilities are not adjusted to fair values 
the company s recent growth in assets and liabilities is largely attributable to increases in interest sensitive products 
because jp earns profits on the basis of investment spreads  changes in interest rates may also affect results of operations 
in a rising interest rate environment  competitive pressures may make it difficult for the company to sustain the spreads on its interest sensitive portfolio of insurance products 
durations of the company s assets and liabilities may also be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates 
to protect against the negative impact of interest rate risk  jp focuses on measuring option adjusted durations of its assets and manages the risk of mismatch between assets and liabilities 
the company also adjusts interest crediting rates  at least on an annual basis  to reflect the yield of its investment portfolio and assumptions for pricing and profitability 
medical inflation and utilization of medical services affects the profitability of health products offered through the individual and group distribution systems 
in the event that premium rates are not adjusted in anticipation of medical trends  profitability of health insurance products may be adversely affected 
environmental liabilities jp is exposed to environmental regulation and litigation as a result of ownership of investment real estate  property and casualty and communications subsidiaries 
the company s actual loss experience has been minimal and exposure to environmental losses is considered by the company to be insignificant 
mergers  acquisitions and consolidations the us insurance industry has experienced an increasing number of mergers  acquisitions  consolidations  and sales of certain business lines 
these consolidations have been driven by a need to reduce costs of distribution and maintenance of business in force 
additionally  increased competition  health care reform  regulatory capital requirements  and technology costs have also contributed to the level of consolidation in the industry 
these forces are expected to continue as is the level of industry consolidation 
regulatory and legal environment currently  prescribed or permitted statutory accounting principles sap may vary between states and between companies 
the national association of insurance commissioners naic is in the process of codifying sap to promote standardization of methods utilized throughout the industry 
completion of this project might result in changes in statutory accounting practices for the company  however  it is not expected that such changes would critically impact the company s statutory capital requirements 
ii the number of insurance companies that are under regulatory supervision has resulted  and is expected to continue to result  in assessments by state guaranty associations to cover losses to policyholders of insolvent or rehabilitated companies 
mandatory assessments may be partially recovered through a reduction in future premium taxes in most states 
the company has accrued for expected assessments net of estimated future premium tax deduductions 
in recent years  the life insurance industry has experienced increased litigation in which large jury awards including punitive damages have occurred 
jp is involved in various legal and administrative proceedings and claims of various types  some of which include claims for punitive damages 
because of the considerable uncertainties that exist  the company cannot predict the outcome of pending or future litigation with certainty 
it is possible that results of operations in a particular period could be materially affected by certain legal proceedings 
based on consultation with the company s legal advisers  management does not believe that resolution of pending legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or liquidity 
accounting pronouncements sfas accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan was effective for the company s consolidated financial statements 
sfas  as amended by sfas  requires that certain impaired loans be reported at the net present value of expected future cash flows  the loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the underlying collateral 
the company adopted sfas during the first quarter of  and the effect of adoption did not have a material impact on results of operations 
jp adopted the provisions of sfas accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities as of january  this statement applies to equity securities having readily determinable fair values as well as debt securities and requires classification of securities as securities held to maturity stated at amortized cost  trading securities at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in income currently  or securities available for sale stated at fair value with unrealized gains and losses  net of deferred income tax effect  included in a separate component of stockholders equity 
in connection with the adoption of sfas  the company classified debt securities that it has both the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity as held to maturity 
other debt securities and all holdings of equity securities were classified as available for sale 
at adoption  approximately at amortized cost of the company s debt securities were classified as available for sale and as held to maturity 
the adjustment to available for sale debt securities and parent company equity securities increased shareholders equity by million as of january  in march  the fasb issued sfas accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  which establishes accounting standards for the impairment of long lived assets  certain identifiable intangibles  and goodwill related to those assets to be held and used for long lived assets  and certain identifiable intangibles to be disposed of 
the statement will be effective for the company s ii consolidated financial statements 
the statement requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the statement requires that such assets be carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value  less cost to sell  and that impairment losses resulting from its application be reported in the period in which the recognition criteria are first met 
the company has not yet completed its analysis of the effects  if any  that initial application of sfas might have on its consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued sfas accounting for stock based compensation  which will also be effective in sfas establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for stock based employee compensation plans and allows entities to continue to measure compensation cost for those plans using the intrinsic value based method prescribed by accounting principles board apb opinion accounting for stock issued to employees  or to adopt a fair value based measurement method 
entities that do not elect to adopt a fair value based method are required to make proforma disclosures of net income and income per share as if the fair value based method had been applied 
such proforma amounts are likely to be less than the corresponding amounts presented in future statements of net income if the apb method is continued 
the company has not yet decided whether to adopt the fair value based measurement method described in sfas ii
