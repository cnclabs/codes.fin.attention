pompano park is comprised of approximately acres of owned land used for harness racing operations and acres of leased land used for training operations 
the company has a four year option to purchase the leased land at a cost of million  plus cost of living adjustments 
the company believes that  because of its size and location  pompano park would be an attractive location for casino gaming if casino gaming is ever legalized in florida and the site is available for gaming under applicable law 
pompano park competes against numerous other pari mutuel facilities  including thoroughbred and dog race tracks and jai alai frontons  located throughout south florida 
for the months ended april   total revenue at pompano park was approximately million  derived primarily from pari mutuel wagering of approximately million wagered on track and approximately million wagered at other pari mutuel facilities receiving pompano park s simulcast transmission

the additional consideration would be an amount equal to million plus of the gaming net win as defined  payable monthly 
the million portion of such amount would be payable million at such time as the company receives all licenses  permits or approvals necessary to conduct such casino gaming operations and million at such time as the company opens such a casino gaming facility to the public 
the company s obligation to pay any such additional consideration will terminate if casino gaming has not been legally permitted in florida within six years after the closing of the acquisition of pompano park

in connection with recent changes to florida law  the company expects to operate limited stakes with a maximum pot poker rooms at pompano park  beginning january   subject to county approval 
such activities will not constitute casino gaming or create any obligation for additional consideration in connection with the acquisition of pompano park 
although the company believes that broward county  the county in which pompano park is located  will approve the operation of such poker rooms  no assurance can be given in that regard 
the company plans to open and operate a minimum of tables from pm to am on each evening that live racing is held at pompano park 
pompano park has received approval to conduct live evening racing performances during the racing season and intends to seek approval to increase such number

per pot 
the company must distribute at least of the net proceeds reflecting its direct costs of operating poker rooms to supplement its purses for harness races and breeders awards 
see regulatory matters florida 
effective july   pompano park offers full card simulcasting of harness races from any harness track outside of florida for wagering at pompano park  even on days in which no races are held at pompano park 
florida recently reduced both its tax rate on retransmission of its simulcast signal from to of handle ie  the aggregate contributions to pari mutuel pools and the surcharge applied to simulcast races from per race to a fixed fee of per day  regardless of the number of races 
because pompano park typically broadcasts more than five races per day  the reduction in the surcharge as well as the reduction in the out of state signal tax is expected to favorably impact operating results at pompano park

competition general competition in the gaming industry is intense in the markets where the company operates gaming facilities 
as new gaming opportunities arise in existing gaming jurisdictions  in new gaming jurisdictions and on indiana owned lands  new or expanded operations by others can be expected to increase competition for the company s existing and future operations and could limit new opportunities for the company or result in the saturation of certain gaming markets 
casino gaming does not have a long operating history in the jurisdictions where the company operates gaming facilities and  therefore  the effects of competition in these jurisdictions cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty 
many of the company s competitors have more gaming industry experience  are larger and have greater financial resources than the company 
as a result  increased competition could have a material adverse effect on the company 
bossier city operations the isle bossier city is one of three comparably sized gaming facilities currently licensed and operating in the shreveport bossier city market  all of which opened between april and july and each of which has comparable amenities 
the isle bossier city will face increased competition from existing competitors to the extent that they add to or enhance existing amenities 
in that regard  binion s horseshoe casino recently broke ground on a room all suites hotel at its dockside riverboat casino location in bossier city 
in addition to existing competition  the granting of additional gaming licenses in the shreveport bossier city market or the relocation of existing licenses to that market from elsewhere in the state of louisiana would increase competition for the isle bossier city 
in that regard  casino magic corp 
was recently granted a license to operate a gaming facility in the shreveport bossier city market  which facility is to be located less than mile from the site of the isle bossier city 
in addition  the company believes that binion s horseshoe casino will seek approval to obtain a license to operate an additional dockside riverboat casino at its existing site  making it likely in management s opinion that at least a fifth dockside riverboat casino operated by binion s horseshoe casino or another operator eventually will be operating in the shreveport bossier city market  where only three currently operate 
moreover  the legalization of casino gaming in texas would have a material adverse effect on the isle bossier city 
lake charles operations the isle lake charles is one of two riverboat gaming facilities operating in the lake charles  louisiana market 
the isle lake charles riverboat competitor  players international  operates two riverboats and a room hotel facility from a single location in the city of lake charles approximately two miles form the site of the isle lake charles 
in addition  a land based  indian owned casino with approximately  square feet of gaming space is operating in kinder  louisiana  approximately miles to the northeast of the isle lake charles 
riverboats in the lake charles market are subject to cruising requirements  which makes a land based casino more desirable to many gaming customers 
players international and the company each hold two gaming licenses and operate two riverboats from a single facility 
louisiana  unlike certain other jurisdictions  does not permit license holders to operate a second boat out of the same location without a gaming license for each boat 
however  because of a limited operating history at the isle lake charles with a temporary land based pavilion and because  prior to july   only one riverboat operated at the site of the isle lake charles  the company s expectations regarding such operation are not based on historical operating results 
in addition to existing competition  the granting of additional gaming licenses in the lake charles market or the relocation of existing licenses from elsewhere in the state of louisiana to that market would increase competition for the isle lake charles 
moreover  the legalization of casino gaming in texas would have a material adverse effect on the isle lake charles

because mississippi law does not limit the number of gaming licenses that may be granted  there may be increases in the number of gaming facilities along the mississippi gulf coast and the surrounding areas  which could have a material adverse effect on the isle biloxi 
in addition  the company believes that many of its competitors will add to or enhance their existing amenities and new competitors will enter the mississippi gulf coast market 
mirage resorts  inc has announced plans and received a gaming license to open a golden nugget casino and resort complete in biloxi  at a site approximately two miles from the isle biloxi  in late in addition  an imperial palace casino is currently being built and will be located on the back bay in biloxi  approximately three miles from the isle biloxi 
both such developments are expected to include substantial hotel facilities 
certain existing and future competitors have more extensive financial resources than does the company 
intense competition on the mississippi gulf coast has contributed to the closure of two gaming facilities and the temporary closure of a third in that area and two others are operating under bankruptcy protection 
in addition  the legalization of casino gaming in alabama would increase competition for  and would have a material adverse effect on  the isle biloxi 
vicksburg operations the isle vicksburg is one of four gaming facilities currently operating an aggregate of approximately  square feet of casino floor space in the vicksburg area 
the isle vicksburg is the second largest casino in the vicksburg area 
two competitors have hotels on their site and the competitor closest to the isle vicksburg has a hotel within mile of its casino 
the isle vicksburg does not contain a hotel  but operates a space recreational vehicle park located mile from its facilities 
other local casino competition includes one gaming facility in natchez  mississippi approximately miles south of vicksburg and miles southwest of jackson  two gaming facilities in greenville  mississippi  with another under construction approximately miles north of vicksburg and miles northwest of jackson  and a land based  indian owned casino near philadelphia  mississippi approximately miles northeast of vicksburg and miles northeast of jackson 
because mississippi does not limit the number of gaming licenses that may be granted  there may be increases in the number of gaming facilities in vicksburg and elsewhere in counties bordering the mississippi river  which could have a material adverse effect on the isle vicksburg 
while the mississippi statutes specify that gaming may only be held on the mississippi river and on navigable waters within counties bordering the mississippi river  several controversies have arisen concerning the exact permissible locations of casinos within this statutory language 
specifically  there have been several attempts to expand gaming as far east of the mississippi river as possible 
it is likely that these controversies and efforts to expand gaming east of the mississippi river will continue 
in the event sites are approved in the eastern part of warren county  in which the isle vicksburg is located  the isle vicksburg could be adversely affected

the legislation granted authority to supervise riverboat gaming activities to the louisiana riverboat gaming commission and the riverboat gaming enforcement division of the louisiana state police the louisiana enforcement division 
the louisiana riverboat gaming commission was authorized to hear and determine all appeals relative to the granting  suspension  revocation  condition or renewal of all licenses  permits and applications

a security issued by a corporation that holds a license must generally disclose these restrictions 
prior gaming board approval is required for the transfer of any ownership interest of or more in any non corporate licensee or for the transfer of any economic interest of or more in any licensee or affiliated gaming person 
an economic interest is defined for purposes of a transfer as any interest whereby a person receives or is entitled to receive  by agreement or otherwise  a profit  gain  thing of value  loan  credit  security interest  ownership interest or other benefit 
accordingly  approval is being sought with respect to the lrgp acquisition 
a licensee must notify the gaming board of any withdrawals of capital  loans  advances or distributions in excess of of retained earnings for a corporate licensee  or of capital accounts for a partnership or limited liability company licensee  upon completion of any such transaction 
no prior approval of any such withdrawal  loan  advance or distribution is required  but any such transaction is ineffective if disapproved by the gaming board within days after the required notification 
in addition  the gaming board may issue an emergency order for not more than days prohibiting payment of profits  income or accruals by  or investments in a licensee 
riverboat gaming licensees and their affiliated gaming persons are required to notify the gaming board within days after the receipt by any such persons of any loans or extensions of credit 
the gaming board is required to investigate the reported loan or extension of credit  and to either approve or disapprove the transaction 
if disapproved  the loan or extension of credit must be rescinded by the licensee or affiliated gaming person 
the company is an affiliated gaming person of lrgp and scgc is therefore required to notify the gaming board of the sale and issuance of the notes offered hereby 
fees for conducting gaming activities on a riverboat include i  per riverboat for the first year of operation and  per year per riverboat thereafter  plus ii of net gaming proceeds 
proposals to amend or supplement louisiana s riverboat gaming statute are frequently introduced in the louisiana state legislature

florida on june   the florida department of business and professional regulation  acting through its division of pari mutuel wagering the division  issued its final order the order approving ppi  inc ppi  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  as a pari mutuel wagering permit holder with respect to harness and quarter horse racing at pompano park 
pursuant to the order and the relevant provisions of chapter of the florida statutes and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder the florida statute  ppi also was granted a license to conduct harness racing at pompano park for the racing season commencing july  and ending june  on a total of evening racing dates 
the division has approved ppi s license to conduct a total of live evening racing performances for the season beginning july  to june  ppi intends to seek approval to increase the number of live evening races 
although ppi does not presently intend to conduct quarter horse racing operations at pompano park  it may do so in the future  subject to division approval 
the transfer of or more of stock of a pari mutuel racing permit holder such as ppi would require the prior approval of the division 
the florida statute establishes minimum purse requirements for breeders and owners  license fees and the tax structure on pari mutuel permit holders 
the division may revoke or suspend any permit or license upon the willful violation by the permit holder or licensee of any provision of the florida statute 
in lieu of suspending or revoking a permit or license  the division may impose various civil penalties against the permit holder or licensee 
penalties so imposed may not exceed  for each count or separate offense 
pursuant to division order and recent enactments to the florida statute  ppi is also authorized to conduct full card pari mutuel wagering at pompano park on simulcast harness races from outside florida throughout the racing season and on night thoroughbred races within florida if the thoroughbred permitholder has decided to simulcast night races 
pompano park has been granted the exclusive right in florida to conduct full card simulcasting on days in which no live racing is held at pompano park  although  on such days  pompano park must offer to rebroadcast its simulcast signals to other pari mutuel facilities other than thoroughbred parks 
in addition  pompano park may transmit its live races into any dog racing or jai alai facility throughout florida  including dade and broward counties  for intertrack wagering 
the florida statute establishes the percentage split between pompano park and the other facilities receiving such signals 
recent legislation in florida provided certain reductions in applicable tax and license fees related to intertrack wagering on broadcasts of simulcast harness racing and thoroughbred racing 
the company believes that simulcast rights at pompano park and the recent changes in the florida statute are important to the results of operations of ppi 
effective january   the florida statute permits pari mutuel facilities to be licensed by the division to operate card rooms in those counties in which a majority vote of the county commission has been obtained and a local ordinance has been adopted 
card rooms can only be operated at pari mutuel facilities on days that the facility is running live races 
the hours of operation extend from two hours before the post time of the first live race and continue until two hours after the conclusion of the last live race at the racing facility 
thoroughbred racing facilities must choose between operating card rooms or simulcasting night races from outside the state  but cannot do both and if electing to simulcast night races  they will be required to retransmit the night simulcast signal to certain other pari mutuel facilities  including pompano park 
the card room operator will be the house and will deal the cards 
the house can charge a fee per player or establish a rake for each game 
the only card games that have been authorized are nonbanking games ie  those in which the house is not allowed to play against the players

the division is currently promulgating rules to give effect to the foregoing provisions of the florida statute 
texas and alabama legalization potential casino gaming is currently prohibited in several jurisdictions adjacent to louisiana and mississippi 
as a result  residents of these jurisdictions  principally texas and alabama  comprise a significant portion of the customers of the isle bossier city and the isle biloxi  respectively 
it is anticipated that residents of texas will comprise a significant portion of the customers of the isle lake charles 
although casino gaming is not currently permitted in texas and the texas attorney general has issued an opinion that gaming in texas would require an amendment to the texas constitution  the texas legislature has considered various proposals to authorize casino gaming 
no gaming legislation was enacted in the most recent legislative session ended may  if the texas legislature which meets every two years in odd numbered years does not enact legislation to amend the texas constitution in a special session  the next opportunity for the enactment of such legislation would be in although special sessions may be called by the texas governor for matters that were pending in the preceding regular legislative session  texas governor george bush has publicly opposed the legalization of gaming in texas 
a constitutional amendment would require a two thirds vote of those present and voting in each house of the texas legislature and approval by the electorate in a referendum 
the legalization of casino gaming in texas at or near the primary market areas of the isle bossier city or the isle lake charles  including the dallas ft 
worth and houston areas  would have a material adverse effect on the company 
casino gaming is currently illegal in alabama due to a constitutional prohibition against lotteries 
several attempts have been made to pass a resolution of the alabama legislature providing for a statewide referendum on the repeal of the pertinent section of the alabama constitution prohibiting lotteries 
this action would require a three fifths vote of each house of the legislature  followed by a statewide referendum 
both the governor and the attorney general of alabama have stated their opposition to legalized casino gaming  even though pari mutuel wagering and limited charitable bingo exist within the state 
the legalization of casino gaming in alabama would have a material adverse effect on the isle biloxi  both because the mobile metropolitan area is a major market for the isle biloxi and because a substantial portion of the isle biloxi s customers are residents of areas east of mobile  including florida and georgia  and pass though the mobile area when traveling to biloxi
