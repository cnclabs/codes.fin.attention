item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations paper products markets tend to follow general economic conditions 
the sales and earnings of the building materials business are closely related to new housing starts  remodeling activity and to the availability and terms of financing for construction 
the cost of wood fiber  the basic raw material for both industry segments  is sensitive to various supply and demand factors  including environmental issues affecting log supply 
results of operations vs 
net sales increased in compared with paper products sales increased as selling prices increased by or more in all paper products lines 
except for grocery bags and corrugated containers shipments  unit sales volumes increased by or more in all other paper products lines 
grocery bag and corrugated container shipments were down and respectively from mainly due to exceptionally strong demand for these products during during the fourth quarter of  selling prices for all paper products lines declined from the record levels achieved in the third quarter of and this trend appears to be continuing as we enter the first quarter of building materials sales decreased in compared with mostly due to lower unit shipments of at least in all building materials product lines 
unit shipments declined primarily due to weaker building materials markets  downtime taken associated with the completion of capital expansion projects and the closure of the sweet home  oregon plywood plant in the fourth quarter of except for lumber  selling prices in all other building materials product lines were higher in than  however  prices in the fourth quarter of were lower in all product lines than for the first three quarters of the gross profit margin was for compared with for paper products gross margins increased to in compared with for reflecting improved selling prices for all paper products lines and improved unit sales volumes in all fine paper products lines 
paper products gross margins also improved because costs were not impacted by the start up costs incurred in for the installation of a new pulping facility and paper machine at the company s johnsonburg  pennsylvania mill 
another significant improvement to gross margins in was the start up of the second linerboard machine at campti  louisiana which allowed the company to replace linerboard previously purchased outside with internally produced product at a much lower cost 
partially offsetting the increase in gross margins was the escalation of old corrugated container occ prices 
prices for occ  a raw material used in the manufacture of paper  increased compared with building materials gross profit margins decreased to compared with in the drop in building materials margins is mainly due to decreases in unit shipments coupled with higher log costs and increased glue and resin costs 
log costs in increased over costs from the cost of glue and resin  raw materials used in the manufacture of plywood and composite board products  increased in over selling and administrative expenses declined to of net sales in compared with for the drop was due to higher net sales as selling and administrative expenses increased between and mainly due to expansion of the company s operations 
other income expense was

interest expense was million in compared with million in because the company s average outstanding debt decreased million between and  gross interest was million in versus million in capitalized interest declined to million in versus million in the weighted average interest rate of all debt was at december  compared with at december  results of operations vs 
net sales increased in compared to paper products sales increased as unit volume sales increased in all paper products lines 
unbleached paper products selling prices improved significantly throughout as demand for these products was strong while available supplies grew at a far slower pace 
in addition  demand for linerboard grew in export markets further tightening supply 
in fine paper products  hardwood market pulp prices trended upward throughout average sales price realizations for other fine paper products trended down through the second quarter of in the second half of  a favorable upward trend in fine paper products sales prices boosted the average realization for fine paper prices in the fourth quarter of to above levels from the same period in building materials sales were up compared with as average sales price realizations increased for all building materials product lines 
both particleboard and mdf average sales prices increased in excess of in as compared with sales volumes increased for both particleboard and mdf  however plywood experienced slight volume declines due to the continuing reduction in the availability of federal timber in the pacific northwest 
as the federal government owns nearly of the commercial timberland in oregon  preservationists pressures that have stopped federal timber sales have caused a significant reduction in available timber supply 
state and private timber supply is inadequate to fill the shortfall 
this resulted in many mill closures at a time when product demand was increasing  creating supply related pressures on lumber and plywood prices 
in october  the company closed its sweet home  oregon plywood plant due to the reduced availability of federal timber 
no additional plant closures are anticipated in the immediate future 
gross profit margins increased to in from in paper products gross margins increased to from in reflecting improved selling prices in the last half of this improvement was tempered by start up costs associated with a new pulping facility and paper machine at the johnsonburg  pennsylvania mill 
in addition  margins were also pressured as the prices for old corrugated containers increased from building materials gross profit margins increased to compared with in the improvement in building materials margins was due mainly to increases in average sales price realizations for all product lines 
however  the company continued to experience increasing raw material costs due to environmental and supply and demand factors 
the cost of resin and glue increased significantly from selling and administrative expenses declined to of net sales compared with in the decline was due primarily to additional net sales as selling and administrative expenses increased between the two periods 
other income expense was million in compared with million in the increased expense was due primarily to a charge of million

liquidity and capital resources willamette generates funds internally via net earnings adjusted for non cash charges against earnings such as depreciation  cost of fee timber harvested and deferred income taxes 
funds generated externally have usually been through debt financing 
in  cash flows from operating activities were million and represented an increase of over comparable cash flows in this increase was primarily due to additional net earnings 
in addition to completely funding capital expenditures for  increased operating cash flows allowed the company to reduce its debt outstanding by million 
significant debt transactions since december  include the retirement of a million note with a interest rate due in april of and the repayment of million of the million bank term loan 
as a result of strong cash flows in  the total debt to capital ratio was at december  compared with at december  net working capital increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase is primarily due to increases in inventories and receivables coupled with a reduction in short term notes payable of million 
inventories increased million mostly due to quantities being unusually low at december   the acquisition of the kingsport  tennessee paper mill and higher prices for the company s non manufactured inventories 
receivables increased million from december  due to higher sales and a slight increase in the number of days sales outstanding 
the company is continually making capital expenditures at its manufacturing facilities to improve fiber utilization  labor efficiency and to expand production 
in  the company made such capital expenditures of million 
during the following major capital projects were completed construction of a second linerboard machine at the paper mill in campti  louisiana which began production in february  construction of a gas turbine cogeneration facility at the albany  oregon paper mill 
upgrade and rebuild to three specialty paper machines at the johnsonburg  pennsylvania fine paper mill 
upgrade and expansion to the paper machine at oxnard  california 
expansion of the cut sheet facility at owensboro  kentucky with a pocket sheeter 
acquisition of the kingsport  tennessee fine paper mill in may  major capital projects underway at december  include the following conversion of the eugene  oregon particleboard plant to manufacture medium density fiberboard 
construction of an oriented strand board facility in arcadia  louisiana 
expansion of pulping capacity at the marlboro county  south carolina fine paper mill 
new fine paper machine and related pulping capacity at hawesville  kentucky 
upgrades to the chemical and fiber recovery areas at the kingsport  tennessee fine paper mill 
expansion of secondary fiber capacity at the paper mill in campti  louisiana 
construction of a new laminated veneer lumber and custom products plant in albany  oregon 
the cost of all major capital projects in progress at december  is estimated to be approximately million of which million has already been spent 
these projects will be funded with internally generated cash flows and with external borrowings if needed 
the company believes it has the resources available to meet its liquidity requirements through internally generated cash flows  short term borrowings and revolving credit agreements which could be arranged with a number of banks 
in addition  in april  the company registered  under the securities act of  senior debt securities totaling million 
as of december   none of these debt securities had been issued 
in august  the board of directors of the company authorized the repurchase of up to million of the company s common stock 
during  the company purchased  share of its common stock for million 
other matters the company believes it is in substantial compliance with federal  state and local laws regarding environmental quality 
the environmental protection agency epa has issued proposed rules regarding air and water quality referred to as the cluster rules 
these rules are currently undergoing public review and if not modified would be extremely onerous to the paper industry with a potential financial impact estimated in excess of billion in capital spending to comply with the proposed rules 
this level of regulation is not justified on either an environmental impact or cost benefit basis and it is hoped compromise can be reached lessening the severity of the rules 
in addition to the impact of the cluster rules on pulp and paper mills  the company s other operations are faced with increasingly stringent environmental regulations 
based upon regulations either enacted or proposed  the company estimates that over the next five years additional capital expenditures which are not yet in process to comply with environmental regulations will not exceed million 
although future environmental capital expenditures cannot be predicted with any certainty because of continuing changes in laws  we believe that compliance with such environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect upon the company s competitive position 
much attention has been given to the controversy concerning preservationists efforts to stop the harvest of timber from federal timberlands in the northwest 
concurrent with these efforts have come increased regulations  limitations and restrictions on the harvest of timber from privately owned timberlands 
current rules and regulations do not significantly impact the company s ability to manage its oregon timberland on a sustained yield basis 
over the years  inflation has resulted in replacement costs higher than those originally needed to purchase existing plants and equipment 
advancing technology and environmental concerns also contribute to higher costs 
productivity gains  because of technological improvements  may partially offset these increased costs 
our use of lifo to value inventories allows us to include these inflationary costs in the cost of sales
