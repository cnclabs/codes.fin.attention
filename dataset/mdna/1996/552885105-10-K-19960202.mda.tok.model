principal sources of funds in the future are expected to be from property operations  mortgaging or refinancing of existing mortgages on properties and mgi s portfolio of investment securities 
other potential sources of funds include the proceeds of public or private offerings of additional equity or debt securities or the sale of real estate investments 
the cost of new borrowings or issuances of equity securities will be measured against the anticipated returns of investments to be acquired with such funds 
in lieu of proceeds from real estate sales or the sale of equity securities  it is presently anticipated that the purchase of additional properties in will be primarily financed by debt and  to a lesser extent  by cash flow from operations and short term investments 
mgi believes the combination of available cash and investment securities  the value of mgi s unencumbered properties and other resources are sufficient to meet its short and long term liquidity requirements 
results of operations compared to net income for of million  or per share  included a net gain of million  or 
per share  which resulted from the sale of real estate investments 
net income for was million  or per share  which included a net gain of million  or 
per share  resulting from similar sales 
income before net gains increased by million to million for  compared to million in funds from operations in totaled million  or per share  compared to million  or per share  in mgi defines funds from operations as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring  sales of property and similar non cash items  depreciation and amortization charges and equity method partnership losses 
mgi believes funds from operations is an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance 
the change in funds from operations is attributable to the same factors that affected income before net gains  with the exception of depreciation and amortization expense 
when comparing to  the increase in income before net gains resulted principally from an increase in property operating income  which is defined as rental and other income less property operating expenses and real estate taxes 
the change in property operating income reflects improvement in properties owned throughout both and  as well as the effects resulting from the sales and acquisitions of properties 
property operating income compared to net change properties held during and  and acquisitions  and sales  the change in operating income from the property segments generally derives from the trust s pattern of acquisitions and sales 
property operating income change by segment net change industrial  office  apartment  retail  the income growth in the industrial segment is primarily due to the twelve acquisitions completed during the prior two years 
these properties added million square feet to this segment which now totals million square feet 
the properties were near or at occupancy throughout  and the trust executed  and  square feet of leases related to and expirations  respectively 
scheduled lease expirations for are  square feet 
the increase in the office segment reflects million from the acquisitions and a million improvement from the properties owned throughout both and the three acquisitions totaled  square feet and bring the office portfolio to  square feet 
as two of the acquisitions occurred in the latter part of the fourth quarter  their earnings impact will not be appreciable until the increase in operating income from comparable properties is due to an improvement in occupancy and to a lesser extent rental rates 
average occupancy during was  compared to in the trust executed  and  square feet of leases related to and expirations  respectively 
scheduled lease expirations for are  square feet 
the change in the apartment segment reflects improvement from comparable properties offset by the effect of property sales in and the comparable properties experienced a increase in revenue  principally from an increase in rental rates  while operating expenses were relatively unchanged from this resulted in an increase in operating income of million which was offset by the loss of income of million from properties sold  when is compared to the trust s interest in a metairie  louisiana apartment complex  which was sold in september for million  had generated million of operating income for the ten months it was owned during the trust s partnership interests contributed an additional million of income compared to operating income in the retail segment decreased slightly from due to charges associated with tenant terminations 
during the latter part of the third quarter  the trust acquired a peabody  massachusetts department store 
the building is being leased by bradlees  inc  which filed for bankruptcy under chapter of the federal bankruptcy code in june in october  bradlees affirmed its lease with the trust and subsequently began paying rent 
the commencement and affirmation of the lease should help expand revenue for this segment 
the trust executed  square feet of leases during scheduled lease expirations for are  square feet 
also contributing to the change in income before net gains and funds from operations when is compared to is an increase in interest income which is due generally to higher interest rates on short term investments during depreciation expense increased due to the increase in the number of properties owned 
compared to net income for of million  or per share  exceeded net income of million  or 
per share  in included in net income in was a net gain of million  or 
per share  which resulted from the sale of real estate investments for an aggregate sales price of million 
income before net gains increased to million for  compared to million in funds from operations in totaled million  or per share  compared to million  or per share  in a primary component of the change in income before net gains is property operating income 
property operating income increased by million to million in from million in this increase is largely due to the and acquisitions which contributed million and million to the increase  respectively 
these properties consist of seventeen industrial and two office buildings totaling over million square feet 
properties sold during reduced property operating income by less than million 
property operating income for the balance of the portfolio  which the trust owned as of the beginning of fiscal  increased by million to million excluding million of income received during in connection with the amendment and assignment of a lease at yorkshire plaza located in aurora  illinois 
with respect to the group of properties owned throughout all of and  apartment property operating income improved by largely due to increases in rental rates  with average occupancy at for both and industrial property operating income improved due to an increase in occupancy 
overall  average occupancy for all industrial properties owned improved by to during the increases in property operating income from comparable apartment and industrial buildings were offset  however  by a million decline from comparable office buildings 
average occupancy in office buildings declined from in to in  primarily due to increased average vacancy at the suburban chicago  illinois and somerset  new jersey buildings during retail property operating income was largely unchanged  excluding the million lease amendment income received in  and average occupancy increased modestly from in to in the million increase in rental and other income in compared to was principally the result of million from the properties acquired in  million due to the partial year ownership of properties acquired in  offset by a decrease of million due to the sale of properties in and a decrease of million from the balance of the portfolio 
included in rental and other income  however  was million of income received in connection with the lease amendment previously mentioned 
exclusive of this income  revenue in the group of properties which the trust owned throughout all of and increased by million 
rental income from the comparable portfolio of apartments and industrial buildings increased while revenue in the office segment declined due to factors similar to those affecting property operating income 
the million increase in property operating expenses and the million increase in real estate taxes in as compared to  reflect primarily i million and million  respectively  attributable to the properties acquired in  ii million and million  respectively  due to the buildings acquired in and iii million and million  respectively  from the balance of the portfolio  which are offset by the decreases of million and million  respectively  due to buildings sold in the million increase in depreciation and amortization expense for when compared to was mostly due to partial year ownership of the properties acquired in and three additional factors also contributed to the change in income before net gains and funds from operations when is compared to interest income in reflects a decrease in the average outstanding balance of short term investments 
general and administrative expenses increased in primarily reflecting an increase in personnel and shareholder related items 
interest expense increased reflecting a higher average level of debt outstanding 
during the past three fiscal years  the impact of inflation on mgi s operations and investment activity has not been significant 
real estate investments and operations are subject to a number of factors  including changes in general economic climate  local conditions such as an oversupply of space  a decline in effective rents or a reduction in the demand for real estate  competition from other available space  the ability of the owner to provide adequate maintenance  to fund capital and tenant improvements required to maintain market position and control of operating costs 
in certain markets in which the trust owns real estate  overbuilding and local or national economic conditions have combined to produce lower effective rents and or longer absorption periods for vacant space 
as the trust re leases space  certain effective rents may be less than those earned previously 
management believes its diversification by region and property type reduces the risks associated with these factors and enhances opportunities for cash flow growth and capital gains potential  although there can be no assurance thereof
