in salaries and payroll taxes the decrease reflects slightly fewer full time equivalent positions and lower overtime expense 
net occupancy expense of million in was thousand below the amount  which included additional depreciation expense resulting from a change in estimate for the useful life of certain leasehold improvements 
lower utilities and maintenance expense also contributed to the total reduction in occupancy expense 
it is anticipated that stephenville bank trust co 
will occupy its newly constructed banking facility in the late first or early second quarter of the additional occupancy expense will not be material to the consolidated total 
fdic expense in totaled thousand and was thousand below the prior year 
the lower fdic expense was the major factor in the reduction in total noninterest expense and resulted from lower assessment rates which  were implemented by the fdic in mid year the thousand increase in postage and courier reflects the postal rate increase and higher expense of transporting items to item processing centers 
the cost of promoting a new deposit product contributed to the higher advertising expense 
legal and accounting fees declined thousand from the total  which included legal and accounting expenses related to acquisition of concho bancshares and legal fees to cover the settlement of claims brought against subsidiary banks 
total noninterest expense of million for was million over the effect of having a full year of operating expenses at stephenville bank trust co 
versus months in accounted for approximately thousand of the increase 
page income taxes income tax expense for totaled million as compared to million for and million for the company s effective tax rates on pretax income were   and  respectively  for the years  and at december  and  the company had deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively 
the approximate effects of each type of difference that gave rise to the company s deferred tax assets and liabilities at december  and  are provided in note to consolidated financial statements 
the most significant assumption relied upon by management in concluding that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset  net of the recorded valuation allowance  will be realized in the future is the recent history of taxable income generated by the company and the subsidiary bank to which the net operating loss carryforward relate 
on a consolidated basis  taxable income amounted to approximately million  million  and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the use of the net operating loss carryforward is conditioned upon taxable income generated by the subsidiary bank 
the net operating loss carryforward was acquired in the purchase of the stock of the subsidiary bank and  under applicable internal revenue service regulations regarding change of control  their usage is limited to a predetermined amount in each future period 
the net operating loss carryforward approximates million at december   with a usage limitation of  per year 
the net operating loss carryforward expires in the years through taxable income generated by the subsidiary bank before the net operating loss carryforward amounted to approximately million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the valuation allowance was established because full utilization of the net operating loss carryforward is dependent on future taxable income in years where the company is unable to determine that it is more likely than not that taxable income of the subsidiary bank will be available prior to expiration 
balance sheet review total assets at december   amounted to billion  up from billion at the end of during  total assets averaged billion compared to an average of billion in the following sections provide information for the major balance sheet categories 
investment securities at december   the investment securities portfolio totaled million as compared to million the prior year end 
at december   securities with an amortized cost of million were classified as securities held to maturity and securities with a market value of million were classified as securities available for sale 
the portfolio is comprised primarily of u 
s 
government and government corporations and agencies securities with relative short maturities 
the company did not hold any cmos that entail higher risks than standard mortgage backed securities 
total investment securities at year end included structured notes with an amortized cost of million and an approximate market value of million 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides detail disclosures relating to the maturities and fair values of the investment portfolio at december  and loans total loans at december   amounted to million and were million  or  above the prior year end totals 
commercial  financial  and agricultural loans were up million and consumer loans were up million 
real estate related loans were virtually unchanged from the december  totals 
real estate mortgage loans represent loans secured by family residences in the company s primary markets and loans to local business and farm operations in those markets 
the loans generally provide for repricing intervals that protect the company from the rate risk inherent in long term fixed rate mortgage loans 
table below provides the composition of loans at december  and page table composition of loans s omitted december  december  amount of total amount of total commercial  financial  and agricultural   consumer   real estate mortgage   real estate construction   allowance for loan losses an evaluation of the overall quality of the portfolio is performed to determine the necessary level of the allowance for loan losses 
the evaluation takes into consideration the classification of loans and the application of loss estimates to those classifications 
the company has an independent loan review function  which periodically reviews the loan quality at each of the subsidiary banks 
the subsidiary banks are also subject to periodic examinations by state and federal banking system examiners 
table below provides activity in the allowance for loan loss account for the past five years  and table presents the year end balance and composition of nonperforming assets that serves as a key indicator of loan quality 
management was not aware of any material classified credit not properly disclosed as nonperforming at december   and considers the allowance for loan losses to be adequate 
as shown in table  nonperforming assets have trended down over the past five years 
the unfavorable weather conditions and declining market prices that farm and cattle operations experienced in may cause classified credits and nonperforming assets to trend upward 
management believes that the level of classified credits and nonperforming assets will remain manageable and will not materially affect future operating results

during  total shareholders equity averaged million  or of average assets  compared to the average of million  or of average assets 
banking system regulators measure capital adequacy by means of the risk based capital ratio and leverage ratio 
the risk based capital rules provide for the weighting of assets and off balance sheet commitments and contingencies according to prescribed risk categories ranging from to 
regulatory capital is then divided by risk weighted assets to determine the risk adjusted capital ratios 
the leverage ratio is computed by dividing shareholders equity less intangibles by quarter to date average assets less intangibles 
regulatory minimums for the risk based and leverage ratios are and  respectively 
at december   the company s risk based ratio and leverage ratio were and  respectively 
page asset and liability management interest rate risk the company manages its assets and liabilities to control the exposure of its net interest income and capital to risks associated with interest rate changes to achieve growth in net interest income 
each subsidiary bank has an asset liability committee  which monitors interest rate risk and compliance with investment policies 
interest sensitivity gap and simulation analysis are among the ways that the subsidiary banks track interest rate risk 
from time to time  it may be necessary for a subsidiary bank to reallocate investable funds or make pricing adjustments to better position itself for interest rate movements 
as presented in table  the company s interest sensitivity gap analysis as of december   reflects a negative cumulative repricing gap in the one year horizon 
consequently  a sudden and large increase in rates or a dramatic narrowing in the spread between asset yields and liability costs would result in an adverse impact on the net interest margin  however  the adverse impact is more moderate if interest rates follow historical trends and increase gradually 
the company uses no off balance sheet financial instruments to manage interest rate risk

the subsidiary banks continue to maintain relatively low loan deposit ratios and liquid investment portfolios with short maturities 
these factors provide substantial liquidity for loan demand  deposit shifts and other funding requirements 
parent company funding sources and dividends at december  and  the parent company had cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively 
the company s ability to fund various operating expenses  dividends  and cash acquisitions is generally dependent on parent company only earnings  cash reserves  and funds derived from its subsidiaries 
these funds historically have been produced by intercompany dividends and management fees that are limited to reimbursement of actual expenses 
it is anticipated that the company s recurring cash sources will continue to include dividends and management fees from subsidiaries 
at december   approximately million was available for the payment of intercompany dividends by the subsidiary banks without the prior approval of regulatory agencies 
also at december   the company had million available under a line of credit with an unaffiliated financial institution
