item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general demand for corrugated containers  containerboard and unbleached kraft paper is cyclical and has historically corresponded to changes in the rate of growth in the us economy and exchange rates for the us dollar 
growth in the us economy generally stimulates demand for packaging products 
in addition  weakness of the us dollar versus the currencies of the united states major trading partners stimulates domestic demand for corrugated products and makes export sales of containerboard more price competitive 
the cyclicality of demand is accentuated by the inelasticity of supply due to the capital intensive nature of the industry 
because productive capacity cannot be added quickly  during periods of rising demand containerboard and unbleached kraft paper inventory levels tend to fall  exerting upward pressure on prices 
in periods when capacity exceeds demand  efforts to control inventory levels are limited because containerboard and unbleached kraft paper mills operate most economically near capacity operating levels 
demand for unbleached kraft paper has declined in recent years due to displacement by plastics 
the company can vary its production of unbleached kraft paper  depending on market conditions  because all four of the company s paper machines that produce unbleached kraft paper also have the capability to produce containerboard 
from the fall of through the fall of  published linerboard and grocery sack paper transaction prices declined approximately percent and percent  respectively 
published prices for linerboard and grocery sack paper recovered significantly throughout fiscal and fiscal  increasing approximately percent and percent  respectively  and reaching record highs

at the end of fiscal  the company determined it would be unlikely that its antioch  california virgin fiber mill the east mill  which was closed in fiscal  could be sold as a mill site or that the east mill  or some portion thereof  could be operated economically by the company 
the company believed  and continues to believe  that the most likely outcome will be the sale of individual assets and the subsequent demolition of the remaining structures on the mill site

during fiscal  published industry prices for linerboard and unbleached kraft paper decreased by approximately percent and percent  respectively  with corresponding decreases in converted product prices 
strengthening industry fundamentals  including year over year growth in demand for corrugated products and record export shipments of linerboard allowed price increases of approximately per ton for both linerboard and unbleached kraft paper to be realized in the fall of the company s delivered cost of occ dropped from a peak of per ton in may of  to approximately per ton in october during fiscal occ prices were relatively stable  averaging approximately per ton 
the secondary fiber market  however  is difficult to predict  and there can be no assurance of the direction future occ prices will take 
based upon october product prices and fiber costs  the company believes that cash provided by operations and borrowings available under its credit agreements will provide adequate liquidity to meet debt service obligations and other liquidity requirements over the next to months 
pending accounting standard the company will adopt the financial disclosure provisions of financial accounting standard no 
accounting for stock based compensation fas no 
in fiscal adoption of the financial disclosure provisions of fas no 
will not affect the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows
