overview results of operations for fiscal were materially adversely affected by several factors that occurred during the third and fourth quarters 
first  revenues from the sale of graphics and audio products declined in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal from the levels in the second quarter of fiscal this decline was caused by slower than expected growth in the home pc market  by dramatically reduced demand from customers for certain graphics  audio  and picopower pentium vl bus core logic products and for certain other products  and by softer than expected business conditions in taiwan 
second  the slower than expected sales resulted in substantial amounts of excess inventory of graphics and audio products 
this in turn caused the company to record inventory write offs and write downs during both the third and fourth quarters of fiscal also  the company provided additional amounts for underutilization of capacity at its micrus joint venture 
third  because new graphics  audio and fax modem products were being introduced  the value of the older products declined substantially 
the company liquidated some of the older inventory during the fourth quarter of fiscal and may continue to do so to a lesser extent in the first quarter of fiscal fourth  the company incurred a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of streamlining its operations 
net sales net sales for fiscal were  million  an increase of over the million for fiscal and over the million for fiscal the net sales increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was the result of growth in sales during the first three quarters of fiscal offset somewhat by a decline during the fourth quarter of fiscal sales of mass storage and wireless communication products increased in each of the first three quarters of fiscal but declined in the fourth quarter of fiscal against the third quarter of fiscal net sales of graphics and audio products for the first three quarters of fiscal increased over the comparable period of fiscal  but declined in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal against the second quarter of fiscal net sales of graphics and wireless communication products declined in the fourth quarter of fiscal over the fourth quarter of fiscal the net sales increase in fiscal compared to was largely due to an increase in sales of graphics  audio  mass storage and wireless communications products 
graphics and mass storage product revenue grew as a result of an increase in unit sales to the desktop personal computer market segment 
audio product sales grew as a result of an increase in sales of bit audio codec products 
wireless communications product sales grew primarily because of cellular digital packet data cdpd base station installations  beginning in the second quarter of fiscal export sales  principally in asia  including sales to overseas operations of domestic corporations  were approximately million in fiscal compared to approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal the company s sales are currently denominated in us dollars and japanese yen 
the company may purchase hedging instruments to reduce short term foreign currency exposure related to certain cash and trade receivables denominated in japanese yen 
in fiscal and  no single customer accounted for or more of net sales 
sales to international business machines corporation ibm were approximately of net sales in fiscal gross margin the gross margin percentage was in fiscal  compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal  the gross margin percentage declined from in the first quarter to a low of in the fourth fiscal quarter 
the gross margin percentage decreased as a result of charges for inventory written down for lower than anticipated shipments of and demand for graphics  audio  core logic and other products and charges for underutilization of capacity at the micrus joint venture 
the decline in the gross margin percentage was also the result of higher wafer costs caused by an increase in wafer prices for merchant wafers  an insufficient supply of micron wafers which made necessary the use of less cost effective micron wafers to meet expanded unit shipments  expediting expenses related to premiums paid to suppliers to increase production of the company s products  lower yields on new products ramping into production  and lower selling prices on certain graphics  audio and fax modem products 
during fiscal  the gross margin percentage declined from a high of in the first fiscal quarter to a low of in the fourth fiscal quarter 
during fiscal  the gross margin percentage increased from a low of in the first fiscal quarter to in the fourth fiscal quarter 
the decline in the gross margin percentage for fiscal compared to fiscal was mostly the result of expediting expenses related to premiums paid to suppliers to increase production of the company s products  higher wafer costs caused by the increased use of more expensive suppliers  low yield on several new products ramping into production  and lower selling prices on certain graphics and audio parts 
exacerbating the gross margin decline was the insufficient supply of micron wafers which made necessary the use of less cost effective micron wafers to meet expanded unit shipments 
the decrease in the gross margin percentage for fiscal compared to fiscal was tempered by a million charge to cost of sales in the first quarter of fiscal as a result of decreased demand for certain of the company s low end mass storage products 
one time royalty revenue of approximately million was included in net sales in the first quarter of fiscal but  offsetting this royalty revenue was an increased inventory reserve as a result of decreased forecasted demand for certain of the company s bit audio codecs 
research and development expenses research and development expenses expressed as a percentage of net sales were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
such expenses increased in absolute dollars in all of the fiscal years  as the company continues to invest in new product development 
during fiscal  research and development expenses increased at a greater rate than net sales 
therefore  the amount as a percentage of net sales declined in fiscal the company intends to continue making substantial investments in research and development and expects these expenditures will continue to increase in absolute amounts 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses represented approximately  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  such expenses increased at a rate greater than sales 
therefore  the amount as a percentage of net sales declined in fiscal the absolute spending increase in fiscal and reflects increased direct expenses for the expanding sales force  increased marketing expenses for promotions and advertising  and increased administrative and legal expenses 
the company expects these expenses to increase in absolute terms during fiscal restructuring costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as a result of decreased demand for the company s products for use in personal computers  which accounts for more than of the company s revenue  management reviewed the various operating areas of the business and took certain steps to bring operating expenses and capacity in line with demand 
these actions resulted in a pre tax restructuring charge of approximately million 
the principal actions in the restructuring involved the consolidation of support infrastructure and the withdrawal from an unprofitable product line and reduction of planned production capacity 
this resulted in the elimination of approximately positions from the manufacturing  research and development  sales and marketing and administrative departments 
the company estimates the annual savings from reduced salaries  benefits  and other expenses will be approximately million 
the major components of the restructuring charges were million of employee separation costs and million of costs primarily associated with the scaling back of certain capacity commitments 
the implementation of this plan commenced during the fourth quarter of fiscal and the cash outlays will occur mainly in the first half of fiscal non recurring and merger costs in the third quarter of fiscal  non recurring costs were approximately million associated with the planned formation of the new joint venture cirent semiconductor with lucent technologies formerly at t microelectronics 
in the second quarter of fiscal  non recurring and merger costs were approximately million 
non recurring costs of million were primarily associated with the acquisition of technology and marketing rights and the remaining minority interest in a subsidiary  and the formation of the micrus joint venture with ibm 
merger costs of approximately million for the august combination of cirrus logic and picopower included one time costs for charges related to the combination of the two companies  financial advisory services  and legal and accounting fees 
interest income interest income and other  net in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal over fiscal was primarily the result of a decrease in the amount of short term investments 
the increase in fiscal over fiscal was primarily the result of increased cash and cash equivalents and short term investments principally resulting from the stock offering in february foreign currency transaction gains during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded foreign currency transaction gains of approximately million 
these gains occurred because of a decline in the us dollar against the japanese yen and the impact of this decline on certain yen denominated assets 
transaction gains and losses were not material in fiscal and gain on sale of investment during fiscal and  the company invested approximately million in media vision technology  inc media vision stock 
the investment was accounted for by the cost method and represented an approximate six percent interest in media vision 
in april  the company sold approximately of its original investment in media vision in an underwritten public offering 
in october  the company sold approximately of its original investment in media vision in the open market 
in connection with the sales  the company recorded gains of million and million in the first and third quarters of fiscal  respectively 
income taxes the benefit for income taxes was in fiscal compared to a provision for income taxes of and in fiscal and  respectively 
the fiscal benefit rate of is different from the fiscal rate and from the us statutory rate primarily because of foreign operating results which are taxed at rates other than the us statutory rate 
the fiscal rate declined from the fiscal rate primarily because of a decrease in state income taxes due to benefits from investment tax credits 
the fiscal effective tax rate is less than the us statutory rate primarily because of the research and development tax credit and certain foreign earnings taxed at lower rates 
the fiscal effective tax rate is comprised of a annual effective tax rate and a  non recurring benefit in the quarter ended october  this benefit is caused by increased deferred tax assets and a larger prior year research and development tax credit as a result of federal tax legislation in august cumulative effect of change in accounting for income taxes effective april   the company changed its method of accounting for income taxes to the liability method required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as permitted by sfas no 
 prior period s financial statements have not been restated 
the change had no material effect on income before provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended april  however  the cumulative effect as of march  of adopting sfas no 
increased net income by approximately million 
the company has considered available evidence supporting the realizability of net deferred tax assets including carrybacks  future reversal of temporary differences  and future taxable income exclusive of temporary differences in the carryforward period of loss and credit carryforwards 
based on these factors and the company s prior earnings history  the company has determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the realizability of the deferred tax asset will be evaluated on a quarterly basis 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  the company generated million of cash and cash equivalents from its operating activities as compared to million during fiscal and million in fiscal the fiscal decrease from fiscal was primarily caused by the loss from operations and the net change in operating assets and liabilities offset somewhat by the non cash effect of depreciation and amortization 
the fiscal increase over fiscal was primarily the result of an increase in income from operations and the non cash effect of depreciation and amortization  offset somewhat by the net change in operating assets and liabilities 
as of march   the company had a commitment for a bank line of credit up to a maximum of  expiring on april   at the bank s prime rate at march  
the company had  outstanding under the line at march  terms of the arrangement require compliance with certain covenants including the maintenance of certain financial ratios  minimum tangible net worth and profitable operations on a quarterly basis as well as a prohibition against the payment of cash dividends without prior bank approval 
the company was not in compliance with certain financial ratios and the profitability covenant as of march  in april  the company completed a new commitment for a bank line see below and paid all amounts outstanding under this line 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased million from million at april   to million at march  during the same period accounts receivable decreased million  inventories increased million  and accounts payable  accrued salaries and benefits  income taxes payable and other accrued liabilities increased million 
the company believes accounts receivable and inventories will increase in fiscal year cash expenditures for property and equipment totaled million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the expenditures in all years consisted primarily of equipment used in product design and testing 
the company intends to continue to invest in capital equipment to support continued growth 
during september  the company and ibm completed a series of agreements pertaining to joint manufacturing 
in january  under the terms of the agreements  the micrus joint venture began manufacturing semiconductor wafers for each parent company 
in fiscal and  cirrus logic paid million and million  respectively  for the joint venture investment and the manufacturing agreement 
manufacturing agreement payments of million are being charged to the cost of production over the life of the venture based upon the ratio of current units of production to current and anticipated future units of production 
in fiscal  the company amortized approximately million of the manufacturing agreement payments 
the joint venture is accounted for on the equity method and million of the million commitment has already been paid 
in january  micrus leased approximately million of wafer fabrication and infrastructure equipment pursuant to a lease guaranteed jointly and severally by the company and ibm 
in addition  the company and ibm each agreed to provide micrus with approximately million of additional capital  primarily through lease financing 
in march  ibm and the company agreed to a million expansion of micrus  of which cirrus logic committed to provide million in financing 
the company expects to use equipment leases or lease guarantees to fulfill its financing commitment 
this expansion is expected to be available for full production in fiscal in addition  in october  the company committed to provide a further million to fund a second expansion of micrus and to support the migration to sub micron process technology 
of this amount the company expects to spend million in cash for facilities and to provide equipment lease guarantees for the balance 
as of march   the company has purchased approximately million of manufacturing equipment for micrus that the company expects to sell to a leasing company that will in turn lease the equipment to micrus 
as of march   the company is contingently liable for micrus equipment leases which have remaining payments of approximately million  payable through fiscal in october  the company also concluded agreements with lucent technologies to form the joint venture cirent semiconductor to build additional wafer production capacity in an existing facility in orlando  florida owned by lucent technologies 
the formation of the joint venture  which will be owned by lucent technologies and by cirrus logic  is pending completion of equipment lease financing to be provided by the company and formation of the joint venture partnership 
the agreements with lucent technologies obligate the company to provide million in financing 
the company expects to finance million of this amount through lease or lease guarantees 
of the million balance  the company will contribute million in equity in installments over a three year period and pay million for a manufacturing agreement in installments over a four year period 
the cost of the manufacturing agreement  of which million was paid in fiscal  will be charged to the company s cost of sales over the life of the venture based upon the ratio of current units of production to current and anticipated future units of production 
the company has entered into a volume purchase agreement with tsmc under which the company has agreed to make advance payments to tsmc of approximately million  one half in fiscal and one half in fiscal the company also has concluded an agreement with umc which provides for an approximate million equity investment  of which million was paid by the company during fiscal the remainder is scheduled to be paid in fiscal the company has recently initiated discussions with umc about rescheduling the project and postponing the company s investment 
the company believes that it is unlikely to make further equity investments in this project in fiscal the company estimates that its total financial obligations for the ibm  lucent technologies  umc and tsmc transactions excluding future wafer purchases may total million in fiscal and million in the following three fiscal years 
the company intends to obtain most of the necessary capital through equipment lease financing and the balance through a combination of debt and or equity financing  lease guarantees and cash generated from operations 
in addition to its investments in the various external manufacturing arrangements  the company estimates that capital expenditures for its own facilities  testing and other equipment may total million to million through fiscal the company expects to finance seventy to eighty percent of these capital expenditures through equipment lease or loan financing 
the company s future capital requirements also include financing the growth of working capital items such as accounts receivable and inventory 
in addition  the company has acquired technology companies in the past and may do so in the future 
such potential transactions may require substantial capital resources  which may require the company to seek additional debt or equity financing 
there can be no assurance that financing will be available or  if available  will be on satisfactory terms 
failure to obtain adequate financing would restrict the company s ability to expand its manufacturing infrastructure  to make other investments in capital equipment  and to pursue other initiatives 
in april  the company completed a new commitment for a bank line of credit for borrowings up to a maximum of  expiring on july  at the banks prime rate plus one half percent 
the borrowings are secured by cash  accounts receivable  inventory  certain purchased equipment  intellectual property  and stock in the company s subsidiaries 
use of the line is limited to the borrowing base as defined by a combination of accounts receivable and certain purchased equipment 
as of march   the company s borrowing base  as defined  under this line would have been limited to approximately million  net of certain outstanding letters of credit 
terms of the agreement include satisfaction of certain financial ratios  minimum tangible net worth  cash flow  and leverage requirements as well as a prohibition against the payment of a cash dividend without prior bank approval 
management continues to evaluate other possibilities for additional financing 
there is no assurance that financing will be available or  if available  will be on satisfactory terms 
future operating results quarterly fluctuations operations in the first quarter of fiscal are expected to produce a loss 
the company s quarterly revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary substantially from quarter to quarter in the future 
the company s operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors  many of which are outside of the company s control  including but not limited to  economic conditions and overall market demand in the united states and worldwide  the company s ability to introduce new products and technologies on a timely basis  changes in product mix  fluctuations in manufacturing costs which affect the company s gross margins  declines in market demand for the company s and its customers products  sales timing  the level of orders which are received and can be shipped in a quarter  the cyclical nature of both the semiconductor industry and the markets addressed by the company s products  product obsolescence  price erosion  and competitive factors 
the company s operating results in fiscal are likely to be affected by these factors as well as others 
the company must order wafers and build inventory well in advance of product shipments 
because the company s markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes  there is a risk that the company will forecast incorrectly and produce excess or insufficient inventories of particular products 
this inventory risk is heightened because many of the company s customers place orders with short lead times and because sales to these customers have increased as a percentage of total sales  particularly for certain graphics and audio products 
in the third quarter  these factors caused the company to produce excess inventories of particular products  and the company s revenues and earnings were adversely affected 
in the first quarter of fiscal  to a greater extent than commonly experienced in the past  a significant portion of the company s revenues from graphics and audio products is dependent on sales to customers who place orders with short lead times for delivery in the quarter 
these factors increase not only the inventory risk but also the difficulty of forecasting quarterly operating results 
moreover  as is common in the semiconductor industry  the company frequently ships more product in the third month of each quarter than in either of the first two months of the quarter  and shipments in the third month are higher at the end of that month 
the concentration of sales in the last month of the quarter contributes to the difficulty in predicting the company s quarterly revenues and results of operations 
the company s products are in various stages of their product life cycles 
the company s success is highly dependent upon its ability to develop complex new products  to introduce them to the marketplace ahead of the competition  and to have them selected for design into products of leading system manufacturers 
these factors have become increasingly important to the company s results of operations because the rate of change in the markets served by the company continues to accelerate 
since product life cycles are continually becoming shorter  revenues may be affected quickly if new product introductions are delayed or if the company s products are not designed into successive generations of products of the company s customers 
the company s gross margins also will depend on the company s success at introducing and ramping production of new products quickly and effectively because the gross margins of semiconductor products decline as competitive products are introduced 
anticipated gross margins for certain audio products have already declined and gross margins for certain older fax data modem products have declined in response to the announcement and introduction of newer products 
also  the company must deliver product to customers according to customer schedules 
delays in new product introductions could affect revenues and gross margins for current and follow on products if customers shift to competitors to meet their requirements 
issues relating to manufacturing and manufacturing investment during the first two quarters of fiscal  the company s sales were constrained by its inability to obtain sufficient sources of wafer supply to meet customer demand 
this situation changed beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  partly due to the reduced rate of growth  and partly due to increases in output from micrus 
in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal  manufacturing supply exceeded demand for certain of the company s products 
although the company believes that its efforts to increase its source of wafer supply through joint ventures and other arrangements have significant potential benefits to the company  there are also risks  some of which materialized in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal these arrangements reduce the company s flexibility to reduce the amount of wafers it is committed to purchase and increase the company s fixed manufacturing costs as a percentage of overall costs of sales 
as a result  the operating results of the company are becoming more sensitive to fluctuations in revenues 
in the case of the company s joint ventures  overcapacity results in underabsorbed fixed cost  which adversely affects gross margins and earnings  just as underabsorbed micrus fixed cost has affected the company s earnings in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal in the case of the company s take or pay contracts with foundries  the company must pay contractual penalties if it fails to purchase its minimum commitments 
moreover  the company will benefit from the micrus and lucent technologies joint ventures only if they are able to produce wafers at or below prices generally prevalent in the market 
if  however  either of these ventures is not able to produce wafers at competitive prices  the company s results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
the process of beginning production and increasing volume with the joint ventures inevitably involves risks  and there can be no assurance that the manufacturing costs of such ventures will be competitive 
additional risks include the timely development of products  unexpected disruptions to the manufacturing process  the difficulty of maintaining quality and consistency  particularly at the smaller submicron levels  dependence on equipment suppliers and technological obsolescence 
as a participant in manufacturing joint ventures and as an investor in the company being formed by umc  the company also will share in the risks encountered by wafer manufacturers generally  including being subject to a variety of foreign  federal  state and local governmental regulations related to the discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous materials used in the manufacturing process 
any failure by the joint venture to control the use of  or to restrict adequately the discharge of  hazardous materials by the joint ventures under present or future regulations could subject it to substantial liability or could cause the manufacturing operations to be suspended 
in addition  the company could be held financially responsible for remedial measures if any of the joint venture manufacturing facilities were found to be contaminated whether or not the company or the joint venture was responsible for such contamination 
the company will not be in direct control of the joint ventures or of the wafer manufacturing companies in which it invests 
the company is dependent on the joint venture management and or its joint venture partners for the operation of the new manufacturing facilities  including the hiring of qualified personnel 
in addition  the manufacturing processes and policies undertaken by each manufacturing joint venture may not be optimized to meet the company s specific needs and products 
if the joint ventures are unable to manage the operations effectively  their ability to implement state of the art manufacturing processes  to produce wafers at competitive costs  and to produce sufficient output could be adversely affected 
also  the company s joint venture partners may enter into contractual or licensing agreements with third parties  or may be subject to injunctions arising from alleged violations of third party intellectual property rights  which could restrict the joint venture from using particular manufacturing processes or producing certain products 
the increase in the company s wafer supply arrangements could strain the company s management and engineering resources 
this strain on resources could be exacerbated by the geographic distances between the company s headquarters and the various wafer production facilities 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to hire additional management  engineering and other personnel as needed  to manage its expansion programs effectively and to implement new production capacity in a timely manner and within budget 
the company believes other manufacturers are also expanding or planning to expand their fabrication capacity over the next several years 
there can be no assurance that the industry s expansion of wafer production will not lead to overcapacity 
if this were to occur  the market price for wafers sold by third party foundries could decline  and the wafers produced by the company s joint ventures could become more costly relative to prevailing market prices 
additionally  certain provisions of the micrus and lucent technologies agreements may cause the termination of the joint venture in the event of a change in control of the company 
such provisions could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control of the company 
in connection with the financing of its operations  the company will borrow money 
such indebtedness could cause the company s principal and interest obligations to increase substantially 
moreover  as a consequence of existing wafer supply related transactions  the company s obligations under guarantees  investment commitments and take or pay arrangements also will increase substantially 
the degree to which the company will be leveraged could adversely affect the company s ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  acquisitions or other purposes and could make it more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures 
the company s ability to meet its debt service and other obligations will be dependent upon the company s future performance  which will be subject to financial  business and other factors affecting the operations of the company  many of which are beyond its control 
an inability to obtain financing to meet these obligations could cause the company to default on such obligations 
most of the company s wafers are currently manufactured to the company s specifications by outside merchant wafer suppliers 
although the company has increased its future wafer supplies from the micrus and lucent technologies joint ventures  the company expects to continue to purchase a majority of its wafers from  and to be reliant upon  outside merchant wafer suppliers for at least the next two years although the number of suppliers it uses may diminish 
a decrease in the volume of wafers ordered or the number of suppliers used by the company could adversely affect the company s ability to obtain wafers from third party suppliers in the event the company faces unanticipated shortfalls in supply 
the company also uses other outside vendors to package the wafer die into integrated circuits 
the company s reliance on these outside suppliers involves several risks  including the absence of adequate availability of certain packaging technologies  or control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields  quality  and costs 
although wafer and packaging supplies in general are expected to be sufficient to meet expected demand during fiscal  the company s results of operations could be adversely affected if particular suppliers are unable to provide a sufficient and timely supply of product  whether because of raw material shortages  capacity constraints  unexpected disruptions at the plants  delays in qualifying new suppliers or other reasons  or if the company is forced to purchase wafers or packaging from higher cost suppliers or to pay expediting charges to obtain additional supply  or if the company s test facilities are disrupted for an extended period of time 
the company s supply also could be adversely affected if the company s suppliers are subject to injunctions arising from alleged violations of third party intellectual property rights 
the enforcement of such an injunction could impede a supplier s ability to provide wafers  components  or packaging services to the company 
because of the concentration of sales at the end of each quarter  a disruption in the company s production or shipping near the end of a quarter could materially reduce the company s revenues for that quarter 
moreover  the company s flexibility to move production from another wafer manufacturing facility can be limited because such a move can require significant re engineering  which may take several quarters 
these efforts also dilute the engineering resources assigned to new product development and adversely effect new product development schedules 
accordingly  production may be constrained even though capacity is available at one or more wafer manufacturing facilities 
in addition  the company could encounter supply shortages in fiscal if sales grew substantially 
any supply shortage could adversely affect sales and operating profits 
net sales and gross margin also could be adversely affected if the company receives orders for large volumes of products to be shipped within short periods and if the company s product testing capacity is not adequate to process such volumes 
the greater integration of functions and complexity of operations of the company s products also increase the risk that latent defects or subtle faults could be discovered by customers or end users after volumes of product have been shipped 
if such defects were significant  the company could incur material recall and replacement costs for product warranty 
dependence on pc market sales of most of the company s products depend largely on sales of personal computers pcs 
the growth in the pc market and the growth in the market share enjoyed by the company s pc oem customers was exceptionally strong during fiscal and the first two quarters of fiscal however  certain of the company s pc oem customers and their subcontractors experienced lower sales and slower growth for products incorporating the company s products in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal  apparently due to less than anticipated consumer demand for such products 
this led to an inventory correction by the pc and peripheral device manufacturers  which resulted in a decline in demand for products to be shipped in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal and in the company s revenues 
some of the pc and peripheral device manufacturers continued to experience excess inventories of certain products and or product components which include the company s graphics  audio  and fax modem products through the fourth quarter of fiscal  which is expected to reduce demand for the company s products in the first quarter of fiscal the reduced growth in the pc market  and any further reduction  also could affect the financial health of a number of the company s customers  which could affect the company s ability to collect outstanding accounts receivable from these customers 
product life cycles in the pc market are continually growing shorter 
as new products are introduced  there may be increases in demand for new components 
shortages of key components could constrain overall sales of pcs and thus indirectly constrain sales of the company s products 
in the last half of fiscal  sales of certain of the company s products were dependent to a great degree on key customers who supply motherboards to pc manufacturers and on pc manufacturers associated with the consumer marketplace 
a number of pc oems buy products directly from the company and also buy motherboards  add in boards or modules from suppliers who in turn buy products from the company 
accordingly  a significant portion of the company s sales may depend directly or indirectly on the sales to a particular pc oem 
this turned out to be the case in the third quarter of fiscal since the company cannot track sales by motherboard  add in board or module manufacturers  however  the company may not be fully informed as to the extent or even the fact of its indirect dependence on any particular pc oem  and  therefore  may be unable to assess the risk of such indirect dependence 
increasing dominance of the pc motherboard or pc market by any one customer increases the risks that the company could experience intensified pressure on product pricing and unexpected changes in customer orders as a result of changes in customer s market share 
moreover  the company s production schedules are based not only on customer orders  but also on forecasted demand 
these issues may contribute to increasing volatility in the company s pc related products  and thus may increase the risk of rapid changes in revenues  margins  and earnings 
furthermore  the intense price competition in the pc industry is expected to continue to put pressure on the price of all pc components 
other ic makers  including intel corporation  have expressed their interest in integrating through hardware functions  adding through special software functions  or kitting components to provide some multimedia or communications features into or with their microprocessor or microprocessor products 
successful integration of these functions could substantially reduce the company s opportunities for ic sales in these areas 
as a component supplier to pc oems and to peripheral device manufacturers  the company is likely to experience a greater magnitude of fluctuations in demand than the company s customers themselves experience 
in addition  many of the company s products are used in pcs for the consumer market  and the consumer pc market is more volatile than other segments of the pc market 
issues relating to graphics products historically  the company has had a large share of the market for desktop graphics controllers and graphics accelerators 
however  the company s market share as a percentage of the total market declined in the last half of fiscal the company continues to experience intense competition in the sale of graphics products 
several competitors introduced products and adopted pricing strategies that have increased competition in the desktop graphics market 
these competitive factors affected the company s market share  gross margins  and earnings 
these factors may further adversely affect revenues and gross margins for graphics accelerator products in the future 
the company has preliminary design wins for certain graphics products expected to begin shipping in the first quarter of fiscal although the company has conducted extensive testing of the products and has released the products for volume production  the company s customers have not completed their own testing and evaluation of the products 
if as yet unseen bugs are discovered or if the units were to perform poorly in customer evaluations  key customers could decide not to use these products in their own designs rather than risking the delay of their own product introductions 
in such event  revenues from the sale of graphics products could be adversely affected 
the pc graphics market today consists primarily of two dimensional d graphics accelerators  and d graphics accelerators with video features 
d graphics acceleration is expected to become an important capability in late fiscal and fiscal  primarily in pc products for the consumer marketplace 
several competitors have already introduced d accelerators 
the company is striving to bring products with d acceleration to market  but there is no assurance that it will succeed in doing so in a timely manner 
if these products are not brought to market in a timely manner or do not address the market needs or cost or performance requirements  then graphics market share and sales would be adversely affected 
issues relating to audio products most of the company s revenues in the multimedia audio market derive from the sales of bit audio codecs and integrated bit codec plus controller solutions for the consumer pc market 
in the last half of fiscal revenues from audio products declined against the first half of fiscal due to the heavy concentration of multimedia pcs in the consumer market  to be successful  an audio product must be compatible with the new and existing software games that dominate consumer multimedia pc usage 
these games typically require bit audio  a soundblaster compatible audio controller and fm synthesis emulation 
due to the price sensitive nature of the consumer pc market  the market is moving from multi chip solutions to solutions that provide the codec  controller and synthesis integrated into a single ic 
if the company is unable to provide or is late to market with these highly integrated solutions  or if its solutions are not compatible with new and existing software  the company could lose market share 
revenues from the sale of audio products in fiscal are likely to be significantly affected by the success of a recently announced fully integrated  single chip audio ic 
the product has not yet passed customer qualification and acceptance 
if there are as yet unseen bugs or if the product is not qualified and accepted by customers in time for volume shipments in the first quarter of fiscal  revenues and gross margins from the sale of audio products could be significantly impaired 
the rate of transition from design into production is proceeding slower than the company had expected  and customers have been slow to ramp production of their new products 
moreover  the recent introduction of a fully integrated single chip audio ic and aggressive pricing by competitors is resulting in pricing pressures which are likely to adversely affect the company s revenues and gross margins from the sale of audio products 
issues relating to mass storage market the disk drive market has historically been characterized by a relatively small number of disk drive manufacturers and by periods of rapid growth followed by periods of oversupply and contraction 
additionally  growth in the mass storage market is directly affected by growth in the pc market 
to the extent the pc market growth slows  disk drive demand would decline  directly impacting demand for the company s mass storage products 
as a result  suppliers to the disk drive industry experience large and sudden fluctuations in product demand 
furthermore  the price competitive nature of the disk drive industry continues to put pressure on the price of all disk drive components 
the company s mass storage revenues are derived primarily from sales of disk drive controllers and more recently  from read channel chips and cd rom drive controllers 
future mass storage revenues will be heavily dependent on the acceptance and qualification of new generations of controllers and read channel chips by the company s customers 
recently the disk drive industry has become more consolidated 
such consolidation  which is continuing  reduces the number of customers for the company s mass storage products and may increase the desire of customers to source their components internally 
revenues from the sale of mass storage products could be affected in various ways as a result of the merger between seagate and conner peripherals 
in the short term  the combined seagate conner entity could elect to eliminate overlapping disk drive product offerings 
such a development could sharply reduce or increase its demand for the company s ics depending on whether the discontinued disk drive products do or do not use the company s ics 
such a development also would increase the risk that the company builds excess inventory of ics for the disk drives that are suddenly discontinued or builds insufficient inventory and is unable to meet demand for ics for the disk drives that are retained 
in the long term  the greater size of the combined entity may increase its ability to rely on internal sourcing of components  which could reduce demand for the company s products 
revenues from the sale of mass storage products also could be affected by the adoption rate of windows and windows nt 
there remains some uncertainty in the market place regarding the timing of demand for disk drive storage capacity by end users as they decide whether or not to purchase these new operating systems 
if disk drive manufacturers incorrectly forecast demand  they may make sudden and dramatic changes in disk drive product mix  which increases the risk that the company will produce excess or insufficient inventories of various products 
issues relating to wireless and other communication products sales of the company s cellular digital packet data cdpd products commenced during the quarter ended october  since that time the company s subsidiary  pcsi  has sold over  base stations to customers building cdpd communications infrastructure in anticipation of a developing market for cdpd wireless data services 
future cdpd revenues will depend primarily on the sale of subscriber units  modules and components 
if the cdpd market does not develop  or the company s cdpd products are not competitive with those being introduced by other suppliers  then future revenues and earnings would be adversely affected 
sales of digital cordless phone products  which were developed by pcsi for the japanese personal handyphone system phs market  will depend upon the establishment of infrastructure and services which are beyond pcsi s control 
if pcsi is unsuccessful or delayed in developing next generation chip sets for the phs market  future chip set sales could decline rapidly 
all sales are being conducted through the company s japanese marketing partner which limits the company s gross margins for its phs products 
sales of the current generation chip sets decreased during the fourth quarter of fiscal and will continue to decrease in the first quarter of fiscal as pcsi s customer adjusts inventory supply to meet manufacturing requirements 
the same customer is currently in discussions with pcsi regarding the next generation phs chip set 
while pcsi is actively seeking this customer and other customers for its next generation product  if pcsi is not successful in developing and marketing the product then net sales  gross margin and earnings would be adversely affected 
the company expects a further decline in demand for and revenue from the sale of fax data modem ic products as customers use existing inventories of v 
bis product and as the market transitions to v 
products 
the company does not expect to begin shipping v 
fax data modem products until late in the first quarter of fiscal the company s pcsi subsidiary was awarded a multi million dollar contract from at t wireless services  inc to develop and supply base station equipment for the newly announced pact personal air communications technology network 
pcsi was co developer of this narrowband pcs technology for next generation wireless two way messaging 
pcsi also announced that it expects to develop pact two way messaging subscriber units as well as pact chip sets for original equipment manufacturers 
future pact revenues and earnings depend on pcsi s ability to develop and market competitive products 
if the pact messaging market does not develop  or pcsi s pact products are not competitive with those being introduced by other suppliers  then future revenues and earnings would be adversely affected 
the company s development of new technology in the communications business faces major challenges and risks which could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
continued investment in research and development in technology for which a market does not emerge could adversely affect the company s net sales  gross margin and earnings 
moreover  investment in technology which proves incompatible with market standards could impede the company s ability to participate in such markets 
in addition  the timing and direction of the future market development in this area could depend heavily on the decisions of government regulators  which are subject to significant delays and are outside of the company s control 
the company s competitors in communications include some of the world s largest  most successful and most technologically advanced companies and there is no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully 
intellectual property matters the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
the company and certain of its customers from time to time have been notified that they may be infringing certain patents and other intellectual property rights of others 
in addition  customers have been named in suits alleging infringement of patents by customer products 
certain components of these products have been purchased from the company and may be subject to indemnification provisions made by the company to its customers 
the company has not been named in any such suits 
although licenses are generally offered in situations where the company or its customers are named in suits alleging infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights  there can be no assurance that litigation will not be commenced in the future regarding patents  mask works  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets  or indemnification liability  or that any licenses or other rights can be obtained on acceptable terms 
because successive generations of the company s products tend to offer an increasing number of functions  there is a likelihood that more of these claims will occur as the products become more highly integrated 
the company cannot accurately predict the eventual outcome of any suit or other alleged infringement of intellectual property 
an unfavorable outcome occurring in any such suit could have an adverse effect on the company s future operations and or liquidity 
furthermore  efforts of defending the company against future lawsuits  if any  could divert a significant portion of the company s financial and management resources 
foreign operations and markets because many of the company s subcontractors and several of the company s key customers  which customers collectively account for a significant percentage of the company s revenues  are located in japan and other asian countries  the company s business is subject to risks associated with many factors beyond its control 
international operations and sales may be subject to political and economic risks  including political instability  currency controls  exchange rate fluctuations  and changes in import export regulations  tariff and freight rates 
although the company buys hedging instruments to reduce its exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations  the company s competitive position can be affected by the exchange rate of the us dollar against other currencies  particularly the japanese yen 
in addition  various forms of protectionist trade legislation have been proposed in the united states and certain other countries 
any resulting change in current tariff structures or other trade and monetary policies could adversely affect the company s international operations 
there can be no assurance that the political and economic risks to which the company is subject will not result in customers of the company defaulting on payments due to the company or in the reduction of potential purchases of the company s products 
competition the company s business is intensely competitive and is characterized by new product cycles  price erosion  and rapid technological change 
competition typically occurs at the design stage  where the customer evaluates alternative design approaches that require integrated circuits 
because of shortened product life cycles and even shorter design in cycles  the company s competitors have increasingly frequent opportunities to achieve design wins in next generation systems 
in the event that competitors succeed in supplanting the company s products  the company s market share may not be sustainable and net sales  gross margin  and earnings would be adversely affected 
competitors include major domestic and international companies  many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources than the company with which to pursue engineering  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of their products 
emerging companies are also increasing their participation in the market  as well as customers who develop their own integrated circuit products 
competitors include manufacturers of standard semiconductors  application specific integrated circuits and fully customized integrated circuits  including both chip and board level products 
the ability of the company to compete successfully in the rapidly evolving area of high performance integrated circuit technology depends significantly on factors both within and outside of its control  including but not limited to  success in designing  manufacturing and marketing new products  wafer supply  protection of company products by effective utilization of intellectual property laws  product quality  reliability  ease of use  price  diversity of product line  efficiency of production  the pace at which customers incorporate the company s integrated circuits into their products  success of the customers products and general economic conditions 
also the company s future success depends  in part  upon the continued service of its key engineering  marketing  sales  manufacturing  support and executive personnel  and on its ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
the competition for such employees is intense  and the loss of the services of one or more of these key personnel could adversely affect the company 
because of this and other factors  past results may not be a useful predictor of future results
