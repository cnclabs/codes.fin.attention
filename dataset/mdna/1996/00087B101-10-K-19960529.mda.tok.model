item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal operating income declined  from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal  because of lower gross margins on sales  start up costs associated with the opening of new branch operations  and increased inventory shrinkage 
additionally  higher interest costs associated with borrowings required to support the sales growth of the company resulted in a reduction of net income to  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal  a decline of 
sales increased  from million to million  in fiscal compared to fiscal  with each subsidiary reporting a significant increase in sales 
sales at acrs increased in fiscal same store sales at acrs increased in fiscal  compared to in fiscal  a new branch in south texas accounted for the remainder of the sales increase 
sales at tsi increased in fiscal  aggregate sales at the two branches that existed at the beginning of fiscal increased in fiscal despite the opening during the year of two additional  larger branches within the same metropolitan atlanta trade area 
tsi also acquired two branch operations in central and south georgia by purchasing the stock of sweet georgia air supply  inc in october although the two former sweet georgia branches were marginally profitable in fiscal  the acquisition expanded the territory in which tsi has the distribution rights to sell the gmc brand of hvacr equipment to almost the entire state of georgia 
sales of the gmc line of hvacr equipment represented of tsi s sales in both of fiscal and sales at hcs rose in fiscal  as the company maintained its strong presence in the commercial hvacr market while significantly expanding its sales of the janitrol brand of hvacr equipment in the residential market sector 
janitrol equipment sales represented of hcs s sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal  the first year that hcs distributed janitrol equipment 
sales at vsi increased in fiscal from fiscal  when vsi first opened 
vsi gradually enlarged its sales of products other than gmc equipment in fiscal sales of gmc equipment comprised of vsi s sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal the company acquired eti  in january  and eti s results of operations are included in the consolidated financial statements beginning with the effective date of the acquisition 
eti s sales represent only of the increase in the company s sales from to the company s gross margin percentage declined to in fiscal from in fiscal this is a result of the continually increasing percentage of the company s sales that are generated by tsi and vsi  which sell substantially more hvacr equipment than other products 
in addition  the increase in janitrol equipment sales at hcs  as described above  reduced hcs s gross margin percentage by almost in fiscal compared to in the hvacr industry  the profit margin on sales of equipment  such as condensing units  furnaces and heat pumps  is generally less than on sales of parts and supplies 
furthermore  the primary equipment supplier to tsi  hcs and vsi provides incentives to its distributors to induce a greater volume of sales at lower gross margins 
the gross margin percentage at acrs also declined in  as the company gained market share in part by negotiating bulk sales to customers at low margins of products that could be shipped directly to the customer from the manufacturer 
gross margin in fiscal was also adversely affected by excessive inventory shrinkage at two of the company s subsidiaries that were detected in connection with physical inventories 
in response  the company has instituted a rigorous system of inventory cycle counts designed to promptly identify and reconcile inventory shortages 
selling  general and administrative costs sg a as a percentage of sales declined to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal with payroll costs representing of sg a expenses in fiscal  the company continues to focus on increasing the sales volume of each of its branch operations as a means to generate higher gross profit without a proportional increase in sg a expenses

in april  the company also opened a second branch of vsi in the memphis area 
the company expects that fiscal sales will increase at least over fiscal management is aggressively seeking to reduce its cost of inventory purchases by negotiating arrangements with national suppliers covering all of the company s operating entities and believes that this effort may alleviate a further decline in the company s gross margin percentage 
in addition  eti  which specializes in the sale of commercial controls systems  generates a significantly higher gross margin than the company s other subsidiaries 
management is also resolved to further reduce operating expenses as a percentage of sales by controlling personnel costs as branch sales increase

selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales declined to in fiscal from in fiscal  as the company continued to limit increases in both administrative and branch operating costs in relation to increases in sales 
management believes that operating expenses should continue to grow at a lesser rate than sales 
net operating income from energy services increased from fiscal to fiscal the increase consisted of revenues from a contract sold in to a third party pursuant to which the company was to receive a percentage of future net income from an energy savings project 
in fiscal  an accounting of the project s income revealed that the third party had not fulfilled its payment obligations to the company  and agreement was reached for payment of the arrearage and resumption of contractually required payments 
although none of the company s remaining energy contracts expired in fiscal  they all are due to expire during fiscal the remaining contracts will be profitable up to their expiration  at which time management will attempt to negotiate with the users a form of payment for the residual value of the installed equipment 
interest expense increased in fiscal compared to as a result of the company s increased borrowings and increases in interest rates 
liquidity and capital resources working capital increased from  at february  to  at february  as a result of the company s increased operations  which resulted in increases in accounts receivable and inventory that were financed largely through long term borrowings 
current assets increased from to  principally in accounts receivable and inventory 
gross receivables represented days of sales at the end of fiscal  compared to days of sales in receivables at the end of fiscal of the million increase in inventory   was attributable to an increase in pre season shipments of air conditioning equipment received by acrs from its primary supplier 
the remainder of the increase in inventory was attributable to the inventory at eti and to the inventory requirements of the five branch operations that were opened in fiscal in february  the company s credit lines with a commercial bank bank were amended to increase the revolving line of credit from million to million and to increase the availability of financing for capital equipment from  to  the maturity date of the revolving line of credit was extended to february  at february   the company s outstanding borrowings were million and  under the respective credit lines 
borrowings are secured by accounts receivable and inventory  and the permitted amount of outstanding borrowings at any time is limited to percentages of certain accounts receivable and inventory 
borrowings under the credit line bear interest at the bank s prime rate plus  payable monthly  and may be reduced to above prime upon attainment of specified levels of net income 
restrictive covenants of the loan agreement prohibit the company from paying dividends  prepaying its debt to the catalyst fund  ltd 
or incurring other debt without the bank s consent  and also require the company to maintain certain financial ratios 
borrowings under the revolving line of credit were used for working capital 
the bank also financed the company s purchase of land and construction of a building for its pasadena  texas branch location 
the outstanding balance of the related real estate loan at the end of fiscal was  the loan is repaid in monthly installments of  plus interest at prime plus  until april   when the unpaid balance of the note is due 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company has obtained amendments or waivers of certain covenants in the company s loan agreements with the bank and catalyst 
these amendments and waivers cure any non compliance with such covenants as of february   and the company expects to be in compliance with all covenants during fiscal in connection with the purchase of eti  the company issued notes to the sellers which aggregated  and are payable in equal quarterly installments  including interest at  to december these notes are unsecured and are subordinated to the company s indebtedness to the bank 
in addition  certain debt of eti aggregating  that was assumed by the company in connection with the acquisition was refinanced such that the lenders have subordinated the debt to the company s borrowings from the bank 
management believes that funds available under the revolving line of credit will be adequate to support planned internal growth and start up activities in fiscal the company expects to expend up to million for the initial inventory and capital equipment requirements of the four branch operations opened in florida in april in april  the company acquired land in temple  texas to construct a building that will replace the existing branch location  and in may  entered into a contract to purchase land in las vegas on which the company intends to ultimately build a facility to replace the existing branch operation and administrative offices of hcs 
the company has not arranged financing for the construction of either the temple or las vegas facility and may seek a buyer for one or both properties which would construct the buildings according to the company s specifications and lease the premises to the company under long term arrangements 
the company has approximately million in tax loss carryforwards and million in tax credit carryforwards 
such operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will substantially limit the company s federal income tax liabilities in the near future 
certain provisions of the internal revenue code code regulate the amount of additional stock that the company could issue without resulting in a change in ownership control  as defined in the code 
should such a change in control be deemed to occur  the company s ability to utilize its operating loss and tax credit carryforwards would be severely restricted 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
seasonality the company s sales volume varies significantly during its fiscal year 
the highest levels of sales occur during the times of the year when climatic conditions require the greatest use of air conditioning  since the company s operations are concentrated in the warmer regions of the united states 
accordingly  sales will be highest in the company s second fiscal quarter ending august  and will be lowest in its fourth fiscal quarter 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its results of operations in recent years 
generally  manufacturer price increases attributable to inflation uniformly affect both the company and its competitors  and such increases are passed through to customers as an increase in sales prices
