in connection with the early adoption of fas during the second quarter of  management reviewed the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets  primarily fixed assets  goodwill and deferred costs 
the company initiated its review of potential loss impairment due to the continuing changes in the health care environment which have put downward pressure on customers and equipment and reduced forecasted operating results for certain assets to a level below previous expectation 
following its review  management concluded that there was an impairment in the recorded value of fixed assets  goodwill and deferred costs under fas based on management s estimate of future undiscounted cash flows over the estimated remaining useful life of certain assets 
accordingly  an impairment loss of  was recorded in the second quarter of based on the differences between the fair value of such assets as determined by third parties and the recorded values

revenues and operating profits from curacare continued to decline significantly over the past few years despite strategic plans implemented by management 
during the fourth quarter of  company s management determined it was unlikely that the company s non mri businesses would have significant growth potential in the foreseeable future 
company management  therefore  reduced the operational management and sales force for its non mri businesses 
the changing health care environment and reduced barriers of entry due to decreased equipment costs for non mri businesses contributed to losses in the company has determined  based on its methodology of evaluating the recoverability of intangible assets  that the forecasted cashflow for non mri businesses did not support the future amortization of the intangible asset balance of  at december   for these modalities 
the company projected forward its results from operations and undiscounted cash flows for five years to analyze the recoverability of its intangible assets 
the company  in formulating the financial forecasts  considered historical trends  current market conditions and potential new trends and their impact on revenues 
based on these forecasts it was determined that the cumulative results of operations and cash flows for non mri businesses were inadequate to recover any portion of the intangible asset balance associated with curacare 
accordingly  the company wrote down the intangible asset balance by  in the fourth quarter of the company s remaining intangible asset balance of  at december  relates primarily to its mri business

the notes repurchase  together with the december lease restructuring as defined below and the availability of up to  of new debt financing  concluded a broad restructuring of the company s obligations 
in  the company determined that it would not generate sufficient revenues or achieve sufficient expense reductions to meet in full its scheduled debt and lease obligations 
accordingly  the company suspended interest payments under the subordinated notes beginning with the october  semi annual interest payment and suspended lease payments on a significant portion of its equipment leases from december  as a result  the company was in default under substantially all of its debt and lease obligations and the holders had the right to accelerate such obligations

on december  and march   the company further restructured certain of its medical equipment leases and the ge notes to extend the terms of the leases for periods of up to an additional months  to defer certain monthly lease payments and to defer certain installment payments on the ge notes in the beginning of this further restructuring results in payment reductions of approximately  for the company in in connection with the issuance of the ge notes  the company issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of  common shares for per share to general electric company  the ge warrants 
effective march    of the ge warrants were exercised to purchase  common shares 
subordinated notes 
on may   in lieu of a previously negotiated restructuring that would have resulted in the exchange of approximately of the subordinated notes for new common shares that would have represented approximately of the company s common equity  the company agreed to repurchase such subordinated notes including accrued and unpaid interest for a combination of cash and equity securities equal to approximately of the company s fully diluted shares 
on may   the company completed the notes repurchase 
after giving effect to certain subsequent adjustments  these holders received  in cash  plus a total of  common shares equal to approximately of ashs s then fully diluted common shares  and warrants for an additional  common shares equal to approximately of the then fully diluted common shares 
the warrants are immediately exercisable at per share

the notes repurchase was completed with the proceeds of a new term loan  the new revolver and the gamma knife loan as defined below 
the term loan is a month level amortizing loan of  at an annual interest rate of 
the term loan is secured by various unencumbered equipment and inventory and certain accounts receivable of as c and curacare and is guaranteed by dr 
bates and ashs 
the proceeds of the term loan and new revolver were used to repurchase the subordinated notes  refinance certain equipment and provide working capital 
as of january   the lender under the new revolver was replaced by an affiliate under substantially identical terms 
the new revolver is a two year   interest only revolving credit facility at the bank of america prime lending rate plus 
the new revolver is secured by as c s and curacare s accounts receivable  certain equipment  inventory and general intangibles  is guaranteed by dr 
bates and ashs  and had a balance of  as of february  the company had additional borrowing capacity under the new revolver  based on its eligible accounts receivable valuation  of  at february  the gamma knife loan is an month level amortizing loan of  at an annual interest rate of 
the proceeds were utilized to refinance the company s gamma knife and provide additional working capital 
the payments on this loan were restructured in september from  per month to  per month  effective september   and to extend the loan term until september  at the company s annual shareholder meeting held on october   the company s shareholders approved the issuance of an option for additional common shares to dr 
bates as further consideration for his continued service to the company and his personal guarantee of  of the company s new credit facilities 
as a result of this issuance  dr 
bates held approximately of the company s then fully diluted outstanding shares and the selling securityholders received additional common shares and warrants to maintain their respective fully diluted ownership of the common shares 
the various restructuring transactions described above cured all of the company s outstanding defaults relating to its debt and lease obligations 
the company nevertheless remains highly leveraged and has significant cash payment requirements under its equipment leases and credit facilities 
scheduled cash equipment capital lease payments and operating lease payments during the months ending december  are  and  respectively  with related maintenance commitments of approximately  scheduled interest and principal payments under the company s other debt obligations during such period are approximately  in order to generate sufficient cash to satisfy these obligations as they become due  the company s management will do the following i continue to implement its program of expense reductions  ii identify and sell non essential assets  iii negotiate favorable concessions from major creditors  iv enhance revenues by increasing customer contracts and equipment utilization  and v offer to exchange equity in the company for interest bearing debt 
there can be no assurance that these measures will generate sufficient cash to enable the company to meet its scheduled obligations 
any inability of the company to meet its obligations when due would result in a default which could permit the relevant obligor to accelerate the obligation and seek other remedies including seizure of the company s medical imaging equipment 
in such event  the company would be forced to seek a liquidation under chapter or a reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
impact of inflation and changing prices the company does not believe inflation has had a significant impact on operations  because most of its customer contracts include a cost of living price adjustment provision  which the company believes will be sufficient to offset the impact of any future inflation on the company s costs of operation
