in addition to the investment management subsidiaries  pimco advisors sponsors two mutual fund families pimco funds funds for institutional and k defined contribution investors and pimco advisors funds retail funds and the cash accumulation trust 
under generally accepted accounting principles  the consolidation has been accounted for as an acquisition of tag by pfamco group  even though the legal form was the reverse 
therefore  the historical financial statements include the operations of pfamco group  in its corporate form  prior to the consolidation and the combined results of pimco advisors  in its partnership form  for the period since the consolidation 
due to the different bases of presentation and resulting difficulties in analyzing comparative historical financial information as a result of the required accounting presentation  management has included below certain pro forma financial information as if the consolidation occurred at the beginning of pro forma results eliminate the significant comparative differences in the historical results of operations arising primarily from different taxation of corporations and partnerships  from the inclusion of tag s results of operations in the pro forma results from the beginning of rather than only from the date of consolidation reflected in the historical financial statements  and from certain transactions and restructuring effected by the consolidation  principally related to the creation and amortization of intangibles and revised profit sharing arrangements

the pro forma information for and  given above is not intended to reflect the results that actually would have been obtained if the operations were consolidated during the periods presented 
page results of operations general commentary pimco advisors derives substantially all its revenues and net income from advisory fees for investment management services provided to its institutional and individual clients  and advisory  distribution and servicing fees for services provided to its proprietary families of mutual funds proprietary funds 
generally  such fees are determined based upon a percentage of client assets under management and are billed quarterly to institutional clients  either in advance or arrears  depending on the agreement with the client  and monthly in arrears to proprietary funds 
revenues  therefore  are determined in large part based upon the level of assets under management  which is dependent upon market conditions  client decisions to add or withdraw assets from pimco advisors management  and pimco advisors ability to attract new clients  among other factors 
in addition  pimco advisors has certain accounts which are subject to performance based fee schedules wherein performance relative to the s p index or other benchmarks over a particular time period can result in additional fees 
these fees accrue on a quarterly or annual basis  depending upon the specific investment advisory contract 
quarterly fees generally are calculated based upon a rolling twelve month performance result 
annual fees are predominantly weighted towards fourth quarter billings 
as a result  there is a seasonality to the recognition of such fees 
such performance based fees can have a significant effect on revenues  but also provide an opportunity to earn higher fees than could be obtained under fee arrangements based solely on a percentage of assets under management 
intangible assets of approximately million created by the consolidation represent the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets of tag deemed acquired by pfamco group 
approximately million of the intangible assets represents the value assigned to pimco advisors master limited partnership mlp structure 
under current tax law  an mlp is exempt from federal and most state and local income taxes through december  the value attributed to the mlp structure is being amortized through the period ended december  the remainder is being amortized over its estimated life of years 
net income per unit is computed under the two class method which allocates net income to class a lp units and class b lp units in proportion to the operating profit available for distribution for each class 
operating profit available for distribution is defined by pimco advisors partnership agreement and is computed as the sum of net income plus non cash charges from the amortization of intangible assets  non cash compensation expenses arising from option and restricted unit plans  and losses of any subsidiary which is not a flow through entity for tax purposes 
class a lp units and gp units are entitled to a priority distribution of per unit per year until december  because of this  the amount of operating profit available for distribution allocated to such units is currently greater than the amount allocated to class b lp units 
as a result  the net income allocated per class a lp unit and gp unit is currently greater than the net income allocated per class b lp unit 
due to the priority distribution  any dilution to net income per unit from the assumed exercise of unit options is currently applied entirely to class b lp units 
actual unit distributions in were for the gp units and class a lp units and were cents for the class b lp units 
these amounts reflect operating profit available for distribution for the day period from the date of consolidation through december   and operating profit available for distribution for the first three quarters of  as such distributions are made in arrears

these include up front commissions paid at the time of sale of the mutual funds  trail commissions for the maintenance of assets in the mutual funds and service fee commissions paid for services provided to mutual fund shareholders 
the level of commission expense will vary according to the level of assets in the mutual funds on which trail and service fee commissions are determined and on the level of sales of mutual funds on which up front commissions are determined 
trail and service fee commissions are generally paid quarterly beginning one year after sale of the mutual funds 
therefore  at any given time  trail and service fee commissions will be paid on only the mutual fund assets that qualify for such payments 
in  trail and service fee commissions increased to million  an increase of million or  compared to this increase is related to an increase in the underlying qualifying assets 
up front commissions decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of million or

advisory revenues were million in compared to million in  up million 
padco s revenues were million in compared to million in  up million 
revenue increases resulted from the commitment of new assets by institutional clients and to a lesser extent from favorable investment performance and increases in mutual fund assets under management 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in performance based fees  which were of revenues in compared to of revenues in the decline in performance based fees occurred primarily from under performance in a product line that seeks to outperform the s p index

this was further impacted by a million expense reimbursement related to the page operations of pimco advisors institutional services division  which is the maximum amount that can be received under a reimbursement agreement and is reflected in as a pro forma item 
in actuality  this reimbursement agreement became effective on the date of consolidation and reimbursement was realized subsequent to the that date 
results of operations historical financial information general commentary the historical financial statements reflect the results of pfamco group during the results for include pfamco group  in its corporate form for the period january  to november  and pimco advisors post consolidation combined results in its partnership form from november  to december   and for this accounting treatment  known as reverse acquisition accounting  is required under generally accepted accounting principles 
therefore  many of the comparative differences in the results of operations between  and are due to the reorganization of pfamco group into partnership form  the inclusion of tag s operations in pfamco group s operations from november   to december   and in  and from transactions and restructuring that occurred in the consolidation 
the and results also include certain non cash expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets created by the consolidation and from expenses related to option and restricted unit plans 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  pimco advisors revenues  including padco  were million  compared to million in  up million 
the increase in revenue results primarily from the inclusion of tag in the results of pimco advisors operations since the consolidation  and to a lesser extent  from increased assets under management at the investment management firms 
compensation and benefits  which includes salaries  employee benefits and incentive compensation  is the largest expense category 
the increase in of million  to million  reflects increased staff levels  higher profit sharing and the inclusion of tag in the full year of  compared with only days in in addition to the effect of including tag s operations for a full year in  as compared to only days in  other expense categories reflect the following fluctuations a restricted units and option plans  which came into existence at the consolidation  include approximately million of amortization related to the accelerated vesting of outstanding options and restricted units for certain employees terminating during b trail and service fee commissions increased approximately million as a result of an increase in the underlying qualifying assets 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  pimco advisors revenues  including padco  were million compared to million in  up million 
the increase in revenues results primarily from the inclusion of tag in the results of pimco advisors operations since the consolidation 
compensation and benefits  which primarily include salaries  employee benefits and incentive compensation  is pimco advisors largest expense category 
incentive compensation consists of profit sharing and other incentive awards which are primarily formula driven and based upon profitability of the investment management firms 
incentive compensation also includes discretionary bonus amounts 
prior to the consolidation  profit sharing awards ranged from to of the profits  as defined  of the operating subsidiaries of pfamco group 
awards range from to of such profits after the consolidation 
commission expenses include the up front  trail and service fee commissions from padco s operations 
restricted unit and option plan expenses result from grants to key employees of restricted units and options to purchase units at substantially reduced prices 
such plans have year vesting provisions and other restrictions  and the associated expense is amortized over the year period 
there were no similar commission or restricted unit and option plan expenses in the results of operations 
general and administrative expenses are primarily comprised of telephone and printing expenses  the cost of supplies  books and periodicals  and electronic research fees 
page marketing and promotional expenses include marketing fees and sales promotion  sales literature  travel  entertainment and public relations costs 
the increase in such expenses in over results from the inclusion of million of tag s costs  primarily related to padco  since the consolidation and from promotional spending for the marketing of the pimco funds 
occupancy and equipment expenses increased over due to facility expansion primarily at pacific investment management  and includes million of tag s costs 
professional fees include the costs of outside legal  accounting  audit and consultant services 
the expense for includes approximately million from tag s operations 
the increase in total professional fees over is largely due to professional services rendered in connection with the consolidation 
equity in income of partnerships represents earnings from pacific investment management s investment in a limited partnership  stocksplus  lp  a pooled investment vehicle whose investment objective is to create returns for clients above the s p index 
the amount earned by pacific investment management will vary from year to year and will depend on the relative investment performance of stocksplus  lp income tax expense represents the current and deferred provision for federal and state income taxes 
following the consolidation  pimco advisors was organized as a partnership whose income is generally not subject to tax at the partnership entity level 
pimco advisors does  however  have two corporate subsidiaries that may be subject to federal and state income taxes 
capital resources and liquidity pimco advisors and its predecessor entities combined business have not historically been capital intensive 
prior to the consolidation  working capital requirements have been satisfied out of operating cash flow or short term borrowings 
pimco advisors will make quarterly profit sharing payments to key employees and distributions to its unitholders 
pimco advisors may need to finance profit sharing payments using short term borrowings 
pimco advisors had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments at december  compared to approximately million at december  the decrease was due primarily to the funding of b share commissions to brokers 
b shares involve the payment of commissions to the selling broker by the distributor at the time of sale of mutual fund shares 
through deferred sales charges to the investor  or b plans with the mutual fund  these front end commissions are recouped by the distributor over a period of years 
pimco advisors excess liquidity  after distributions to its unitholders  will be used for general corporate purposes including profit sharing payments and brokers commissions on sales of mutual fund shares distributed without a front end sales load 
pimco advisors believes that the level of such commissions may increase in the future due to the introduction of new products and mutual fund pricing structures which may require an alternate financing source 
however  pimco advisors has made no formal decision as to the source or necessity of such financing 
pimco advisors currently has no long term debt 
pimco advisors is currently engaged in discussions with banks with respect to a million four year revolving line of credit for working capital purposes 
pimco advisors currently believes that cash on hand and internally generated cash provides it adequate liquidity both in the near and long term 
economic factors the general economy including interest rates  inflation and client responses to economic factors will affect  to some degree  the operations of pimco advisors 
as a significant portion of assets under management are fixed income funds  fluctuations in interest rates could have a material impact on the operations of pimco advisors 
pimco advisors advisory business is generally not capital intensive and therefore any effect of inflation  other than on interest rates  is not expected to have a significant impact on its operations or financial condition 
client responses to the economy  including decisions as to the amount of assets deposited may also impact the operations of pimco advisors 
these fluctuations may or may not be recoverable in the pricing of services offered by pimco advisors
