liquidity and capital resources 
current assets increased from  at december  to  at december  despite this increase  working capital at december  was a deficit of  compared to a positive working capital of  at december  the decrease in working capital reflects both the short term debt incurred to acquire home pharmacy and the need to finance the increased operations  through trade accounts payable and other short term sources  through the normal cycle of creating and collecting accounts receivable

see note to the consolidated financial statements 
commencing at the end of the fourth quarter of  the company determined to increase the efficiency of its operations by attempting to sell five of the medi phar retail outlets and by consolidating the south carolina distribution facility with the new chicago operation 
although the retail outlets have been contributing approximately  of annual net sales  certain of the outlets have been operating at a loss and are being sold 
the consolidation of the south carolina facility is not expected to affect net sales  but should result in lower costs 
subsequent to the end of the fiscal year  the company and its insurance carrier reached a preliminary settlement on the shareholder class action suit described at legal proceedings 
if approved by the court and accepted by the plaintiff class  the settlement will remove a financial uncertainty and will allow management to avoid the distractions of fighting litigation 
in the fourth quarter of  the company reserved its anticipated share of the settlement amount and related defense costs 
results of operations 
the following table sets forth certain financial data as a percentage of net sales for the periods presented percent of sales for the years ended december  net sales cost of sales selling  general and administrative expenses excluding amortization  merger expenses and restructure provisions earnings loss before income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda operating loss other income expense  net net loss on april   medi claim assumed the obligation for payments to members of med claim s pharmacy network 
prior to april   medi claim was only obligated to the extent payment was received from the sponsoring organization 
this step was taken to standardize medi claim s procedures with trends in the industry 
as a result of this change  subsequent to april  the company presents the sales and cost of sales as well as the related accounts receivable and accounts payable in its consolidated financial statements for prescriptions filled at participating network pharmacies by insureds covered under pharmacy plans offered by medi claim s clients  the sponsoring organizations 
the effect of this change was to increase reported revenue by approximately  compared to previous reporting 
if the change had occurred at the beginning of  an additional approximately  of revenue would have been reported in compared with on september   the company acquired the assets of home pharmacy from arcventures  inc the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
consistent with its treatment of prior acquisitions  the company has included the operations of the acquired business for the entire year to date in its operating statements with a single line item to subtract the profit of the acquired business for periods prior to acquisition 
primarily as a result of the home pharmacy acquisition  consolidated net sales for the year ended december  increased over the prior year  in compared to  in 
the increase in sales includes  from pre acquisition operations of home pharmacy in approximately  of the increase results from the medi claim contract changes discussed above 
the remainder of the increase represents operation of the home pharmacy business by the company 
although the company has determined to reduce its retail pharmacy operations  the impact on future revenues for the company as a whole is not expected to be significant 
not all of home pharmacy s major customers have continued with the company following the acquisition 
as with turn over of any of the company s customers  the company expects to obtain new customers to replace revenue previously received from departing customers  subject to the normal sales and implementation cycles of the industry 
costs of sales for were approximately of sales compared to in as the industry has continued its consolidation to fewer  but larger  participants  competitive pressures to obtain customers has increased 
this has led to pricing pressures and lowered gross margins for the industry generally 
the slight increase in margin for compared to is not considered by management to be significant  and will likely be offset in the future by pricing pressures 
gross margins for the retail pharmacy sector have historically been higher than for the mail service and pbm business 
increased pressure from large retail chains are eroding margins for in clinic retail pharmacies 
management therefore does not anticipate that future reductions in retail revenue will significantly affect the company s overall gross margin 
the contract with the third party payor or affinity group for the provision of mail service pharmacy services typically establishes a formula for determining the price of prescriptions filled under the contract 
although each contract is separately negotiated  typically the pricing is based on the published average wholesale price awp or other standard cost reference of the drug dispensed  plus or minus a specified percentage  plus a fixed dispensing fee per prescription 
the company believes such pricing structure is typical in the industry 
the pricing formula allows the company to pass onto its customers increases in the awp of prescribed drugs 
the company typically could not renegotiate the contract to increase its dispensing fee or the percentage of awp charged except in connection with the annual renewal of the contract 
expenses for salaries and benefits were of sales  in compared to of sales  in the efficiencies expected from the company s operation of the home pharmacy business which were implemented in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of will begin to be reflected in marketing and advertising expenses decreased slightly in dollar amount  in from  in and therefore decreased as a percentage of sales to from 
the decrease in marketing expenses reflects the company s operating efficiencies and the economies of scale resulting in part from the home pharmacy acquisition 
other administrative expenses including provisions for doubtful accounts were  or of sales in compared to  or of sales in the decrease in these expenses as a percentage of revenue reflects efficiencies and cost cutting actions implemented by management as well as economies of scale 
other administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of were unusually high due to transition costs of consolidating the home pharmacy operations into the company  the reserve for the class action litigation settlement and an increased bad debt reserve 
depreciation and amortization for was  or of sales compared to  or of sales in the increase in amortization for in reflects approximately  of amortization of the home pharmacy assets and intangibles 
the home pharmacy acquisition allowed the company to consolidate the owings mills and mt 
pleasant operations in the new chicago facility 
this consolidation and the planned reduction in retail operations resulted in the accelerated amortization in of approximately  of intangibles related to the fpa  mailrx and medi phar acquisitions 
earnings loss before income taxes  depreciation and amortization and restructuring and merger related expenses ebitda were a loss of  in compared to a loss of  in during the first nine months of  the company had earned an ebitda profit of  the company attributes the ebitda loss for the year principally to the class action litigation  as well as increases in fourth quarter expenses including a substantial increase in the bad debt reserve for the approximately  of the accounts receivable generated since the acquisition by home pharmacy customers with whom the company had no prior credit history 
in addition  in the fourth quarter the company incurred non recurring expenses related to integrating the new chicago operations into the company and consolidating the mt 
pleasant operations into chicago 
the company recorded merger related expenses of  in  primarily consisting of increased shipping costs incurred to maintain home pharmacy delivery schedules during the transition to the new chicago facility 
the company also recorded  of restructure charges relating to the decision to phase out the retail stores  and consolidate the mt 
pleasant facility into chicago 
with these items  operating loss for was  compared to an operating loss of  in interest on debt incurred in connection with the home pharmacy acquisition contributed to the interest expenses of  compared to interest expense of  for it should be noted that interest expense does not include dividends paid on preferred stock issued in connection with the home pharmacy acquisition 
as compared with consolidated net sales for the year ended december  increased over the prior year  in compared to  in with a consolidated loss of  compared to a loss of  in the prior year 
the increase in sales was attributable to acquisitions  including the june acquisition of fpa  the acquisition of msa in november in addition   of claims processing revenue and costs of sale in was attributable to contractual amendments entered into by medi claim described above 
costs of sales increased as a percentage of net sales from in to in the increase in cost of sales was primarily due to the changing mix in the company s sales and the inclusion of medi claim sales  which had a lower gross margin in due to the contractual amendments 
expenses for salaries and benefits increased to  in from  in  but declined as a percentage of sales to from 
this reflects the addition of the fpa and mednet operations and addition of other personnel consistent with increased volume 
the salaries and benefits include  of common shares and cash paid to the president to obtain the release of certain potential future severance benefits 
similarly  other selling  general and administrative expenses rose in dollar amount  but declined as a percentage of sales 
the  depreciation and amortization expense in compared to  in related to primarily intangible assets acquired in connection with acquisitions 
during may  the company entered into an agreement with former owners of the retail pharmacies purchased during to induce them to convert the outstanding balance of the convertible note payable into common shares of the company 
the agreement provided for the issuance of  common shares having a market value at the time of  in satisfaction of the  balance of the note payable 
in addition  the company agreed that until such time as the shares issued on conversion were registered  the company would continue to make principal and interest payments to the note holders in accordance with the original terms of the notes 
the conversion terms of the notes had provided that the note holders  at their option  could convert the outstanding balance of the notes into common shares of the company at a price of per share 
generally accepted accounting principles as prescribed in statement of financial accounting standards no 
induced conversions of convertible debt sfas requires recognition of an expense equal to the fair value of the additional securities or other consideration issued to induce conversion 
sfas is applicable to such transactions regardless of whether  as was the fact here  the total value of the securities issued on conversion was less than the balance of the debt 
as a result of the transaction and the application of sfas  the company recorded debt conversion expense of  in with an increase to paid in capital of an equal amount and  in the expense in represented interest and principal paid on the note in prior to registration of the shares issued on conversion
