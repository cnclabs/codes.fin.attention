continuing savings from the consolidation of d m chu s operations into dorne margolin principally accounted for this reduction 
the integration of d m chu into dorne margolin has been substantially completed and further reductions in sg a costs are not anticipated from this consolidation 
engineered products the registrant s engineered products segment includes metex corporation and afp transformers  inc the operating results of the engineered products segment for the years ended december  and are as follows in thousands net sales   cost of sales   selling  general and administrative expenses   income from operations   net sales of the engineered products segment were  an increase of  or versus such sales in this growth is a result of stronger demand and increased marketing efforts which produced an increase in the sale of knitted wire products and a increase in the sale of transformer products 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased approximately between and this decline is primarily a result of the mix of product sales 
sg a expenses of the engineered products segment increased  or during  as compared to such costs in this increase primarily results from additional selling related expenses associated with the rise in sales noted above and from additional administrative personnel in the current year 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses not associated with the manufacturing operations increased approximately  during as compared to such expenses incurred in the preceding year

reductions in military and commercial sales continued to seriously effect this segment of the registrant s business 
further emphasis has been placed on expanding commercial product applications and existing market niches 
several management changes took place  including naming a new president to the antenna systems segment with a primary focus on reversing the trend in sales and profits 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales of the antenna systems segment increased approximately from that of this increase is the result of the following factors changes in the mix of product sold between years  additional overhead incurred as the company moved to consolidate production of its two manufacturing facilities  the recording of certain realization allowances for inventory as a result of the continuing decline in military sales and the uncertainty that such sales will increase in the future  and from incurring additional manufacturing costs as a result of the transition of certain d m chu products which are now being manufactured at dorne margolin sg a of the antenna systems segment decreased by approximately  during as compared to such costs incurred in the previous year 
administrative savings from the consolidation of the dorne margolin and d m chu operations and from previously implemented cost containment measures are the primary cause of this decline 
engineered products the registrant s engineered products segment includes metex corporation and afp transformers  inc the operating results of the engineered products segment for the years ended december  and are as follows in thousands net sales   cost of sales   selling  general and administrative expenses   income from operations   net sales of the engineered products segment increased approximately  or during versus such results for the preceding year 
this is the result of substantially higher sales at metex technical products division and is offset by slightly lower sales generated by afp transformers 
virtually all of metex markets showed sales growth 
however  overall results of this segment continue to be negatively impacted by the results of the segment s transformer operations  which posted a loss of approximately million during cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was virtually unchanged between and this percentage remained at despite fluctuations in the mix of products sold 
sg a expenses of the engineered products segment increased approximately  or during  as compared to such costs in the preceding year 
this increase primarily results from additional selling related expenses associated with the rise in sales noted above 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses not associated with the manufacturing operations decreased approximately  during as compared to such expenses incurred in the preceding year 
this represents a decrease of less than of consolidated revenues and is primarily the result of lower professional costs incurred in other income and expense  net other income and expense  net for of approximately million is comprised of million in gains from the sales of real estate assets  million from realized gains on the sale of marketable securities   in income from equity investments which represents nonrecurring cash distributions  and  in miscellaneous other income

this settlement is included in other income in  net of approximately  of costs incurred in the defense of this action incurred during all such defense costs incurred prior to were included in general and administrative expenses 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the registrant s current liabilities exceeded current assets by approximately million 
this shortfall in working capital results from financing the purchase of long term assets utilizing short term borrowings and from the classification of current mortgage obligations without the benefit of a corresponding current asset for such properties 
management is confident that through cash flow generated from operations  the sale of select assets and the refinancing of certain current liabilities on a long term basis  all obligations will be satisfied as they become due 
the registrant has an unsecured line of credit with a bank which provides for borrowings up to million at the bank s prime lending rate or libor london inter bank offered rate plus  at the registrant s option 
at december  there was approximately million outstanding under this facility 
the maximum amount outstanding under this facility during was approximately million 
this demand facility is reviewed by the bank annually on may on march   the registrant  through a new wholly owned subsidiary known as kentile  inc kentile  purchased substantially all of the operating assets of kentile floors for approximately million  of which approximately million consisted of new bank financing 
in august  the operations of the registrant s kentile subsidiary ceased when its raw material stocks were exhausted resulting from an unwillingness of major trade suppliers of kentile to extend further credit 
see note to consolidated financial statements  acquisition and disposal of operating companies 
the registrant has undertaken the completion of environmental studies and remedial action at metex two new jersey facilities and has filed an action against certain insurance carriers seeking recovery of costs incurred and to be incurred in these matters 
based upon the advice of counsel  management believes such recovery is probable and therefore should not have a material effect on the liquidity or capital resources of the registrant 
however  the ultimate outcome of litigation cannot be predicted 
to date settlements have been reached with several carriers in this matter 
at december  a total of million in anticipated insurance recoveries is recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  including approximately million in prepaid expenses and other current assets since such amounts were anticipated to be settled and received within months 
such amounts were in fact received during the remaining balance of million at december  is in dispute with the registrant s insurance carriers as more fully discussed in item legal proceedings and note to consolidated financial statements  contingencies 
management believes that recoveries in excess of the amounts reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are available under the insurance policies but have not been recorded 
there can be no assurances  however  that the registrant will prevail in its efforts to obtain amounts at or in excess of the estimated recoveries 
the cash needs of the registrant have been satisfied from funds generated by current operations and additional borrowings 
it is expected that future operational cash needs will also be satisfied from ongoing operations and additional borrowings 
the primary source of capital to fund additional real estate acquisitions will come from the sale  financing and refinancing of the registrant s properties and from third party mortgages and purchase money notes obtained in connection with specific acquisitions 
in addition to the acquisition of properties for consideration consisting of cash and mortgage financing proceeds  the registrant may acquire real properties in exchange for the issuance of the registrant s equity securities 
the registrant may also finance acquisitions of other companies in the future with borrowings from institutional lenders and or the public or private offerings of debt or equity securities 
funds of the registrant in excess of that needed for working capital  purchasing real estate and arranging financing for real estate acquisitions are invested by the registrant in corporate equity securities  other financial instruments  certificates of deposit and government securities 
business trends total revenues of the registrant increased million or from levels to million 
income from continuing operations declined by  or during while operating income increased million or in the current year versus such results of the results of the registrant s real estate operations reflect a increase in sales for the year  primarily as a result of additional hotel revenues 
operating income from this segment was million  up slightly from the prior year 
continuing lease renewals and mortgage amortization will continue to have a positive effect upon the revenues and operating profit of this segment 
the registrant s engineered products segment continues to reflect sales growth in virtually all markets 
this has resulted in a increase in revenues during versus comparable results 
with continued increases in automobile demand and as more vehicles are outfitted with air bags  demand for these products should continue 
operating income from this segment increased to million primarily as a result of a dramatic turnaround in the transformer component of this segment which had lost approximately million in each of the last two years and has attained a break even position in the current year 
management is hopeful this trend will continue 
the results of the registrant s antenna systems segment reflect a increase in sales during versus the prior year 
although military sales remain weak this segment is beginning to experience a higher mix of commercial product sales 
operating results reflect a loss of approximately million in the current year compared to a loss of million in management is concentrated on reversing this situation by expanding the registrant s commercial product base and reducing operating costs 
although there can be no assurance as to how the events discussed above  or other changes in the economy  will impact the future financial condition or results of operations of the registrant  management continues to monitor such developments and has implemented measures to minimize any possible negative effects they may have upon these businesses
