item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition for years ended april    and results of operations consolidated revenue in was million  an increase of million  or percent  from million in the prior year 
the increase in reflected higher product sales while service revenue was substantially unchanged 
revenue in included the effect of a change in fiscal year end for certain of the company s foreign subsidiaries which added million to the total 
excluding this amount from the comparison  year to year revenue increased percent from to each of the company s product classes experienced sales growth in  with the largest increase occurring in microprocessor and pc controlled signmaking systems 
within this class  sales of the gerber edge  a four color process digital imaging system  were particularly strong as were sales of related aftermarket supplies 
also contributing to the higher sales in this product class was a new line of friction fed plotters  which are used to cut sign images from signmaking vinyl 
increased sales of the company s computer to plate digital imaging systems for the commercial printing and graphic arts industries also contributed to the sales increase 
the company invested heavily in the development of this business in  particularly in product development and marketing  and expects to continue to do so in management believes the computer to plate systems business represents a significant growth opportunity for the company 
product sales gains were also realized in in optical lens manufacturing equipment for optical superstores and laboratories and in the company s line of marker making and fabric spreading systems for the apparel and allied industries 
in the third quarter of  the company experienced a substantial drop in order entry from the us apparel industry which affected primarily the company s line of computer controlled gerbercutter fabric cutting systems 
management believes this reflected weakness in the domestic retail industry which caused apparel manufacturers to reduce their orders for new production equipment 
order entry in this product class rebounded in the fourth quarter of and appeared to mirror an improved retail environment 
sales gains were realized in in each of the company s major geographic markets 
in total  export sales from the united states in rose million  or percent  from the previous year and represented percent of total revenue compared with percent in and percent in consolidated revenue in was million  an increase of million  or percent  from the increase reflected three factors a year over year improvement in sales from the company s baseline operations  the acquisition of two new businesses  microdynamics  inc microdynamics and niebuhr maskinfabrik a s niebuhr  and a change in the fiscal year end for certain foreign subsidiaries 
the sales gain in occurred in all major geographic markets but was particularly strong in europe 
export sales to european customers improved significantly  up million from the previous year 
in total  export sales from the united states in rose million or percent from the previous year 
the niebuhr and microdynamics acquisitions added a total of million to revenue 
niebuhr was a danish based company that manufactures computerized fabric spreading equipment for the apparel and related industries 
in  niebuhr s operations added million to the company s consolidated revenue 
microdynamics was a texas based company and a leading supplier of computer aided design  graphic design  and product management systems 
its operations added million to the company s consolidated revenue 
in  the year end of certain of the company s foreign subsidiaries was changed from february to april to coincide with the parent company s year end 
accordingly  an additional two months of operating results from these subsidiaries was included in the fiscal financial statements 
the effect of this change in year ends was to increase sales and service revenue for the fourth quarter and year ended april  by million 
this change in year ends had an insignificant effect on net earnings and earnings per share for these periods 
service revenue rose million in compared with approximately one half of this increase reflected the addition of the microdynamics service business 
the additional two months of service revenue from the change in year ends for certain foreign subsidiaries accounted for most of the remaining increase 
in terms of the company s products  the largest sales increase in occurred in gerbercutter fabric cutting systems for the apparel and allied industries  reflecting the introduction of a new series of gerbercutters 
product sales gains were also realized in the company s line of marker making systems for these same industries 
other significant sources of the sales increase in were shipments of a new lens blocking system for the ophthalmic industry and higher sales of aftermarket supplies to the signmaking industry 
for the fiscal year ended april   consolidated revenue increased million  or percent  from the prior year 
the increase reflected percent growth in product sales  partially offset by an percent decline in the smaller service component of revenue 
in geographic terms  the sales increase in occurred primarily in north america and reflected an improved domestic economic environment and strength in capital spending 
the relative weakness of foreign economies in was evident in the company s lower export sales  particularly export sales to european markets which were down million from the prior year 
within the company s major product classes  the largest sales increase in occurred in microprocessor and pc controlled systems for the signmaking industry and was related primarily to the introduction of the gerber edge 
product sales also increased in optical lens manufacturing systems  primarily for a low cost surface generating system which uses computer controlled machining to generate prescriptions in plastic eyeglass lenses 
these increases were partially offset by lower sales of computer controlled fabric cutting systems 
the year to year decrease in cutting system sales occurred in european markets and reflected the weak state of those economies  particularly in the first half of the fiscal year 
the consolidated gross profit margin in was percent compared with percent in and percent in gross profit margins on product sales improved to percent in from percent in  while margins on service revenue declined slightly 
the improvement in product margins reflected the favorable impact of higher sales volume in  although product margins continued to be pressured by price discounting on sales of cutting and marker making systems to the apparel industry 
service gross margins were lower in due to less than anticipated revenue growth in servicing cutting and marker making systems 
the gross profit margins on product sales in were lower than in  while margins on service revenue improved 
contributing to the product margin decline in were the sales of niebuhr fabric spreaders  whose margins were significantly below the company s average product margin 
higher costs of manufacturing in denmark coupled with the relative strength of the danish currency versus the us dollar pressured the margins on this product 
lower product margins in also reflected start up costs on the early production runs of the new gerbercutter series and the lens blocking system 
the improved service margin in reflected the addition of the microdynamics service business 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million or percent of revenue in this compared with million and million in and  which represented percent and percent of revenue in the respective years 
the higher selling  general and administrative expenses in and related to the higher volume of business  marketing expenses associated with the introduction of new products  the additional expenses of niebuhr and microdynamics  and in the inclusion of two additional months of expenses for the foreign subsidiaries whose year end was changed 
in  the company incurred significant marketing and other expenses in furthering sales of its new computer to plate systems for the commercial printing and graphic arts industries 
the company expects to continue to incur a high level of such expenses which will put pressure on earnings in the near future 
the company has historically committed significant resources to research and the development of new products and strives to maintain a leading position in automation technology in the various markets it serves 
research and development r d expenses represented percent of revenue in compared with percent and percent of revenue in and  respectively 
although r d expenses in were slightly lower than in  the pace of spending accelerated in the second half of the fiscal year and management expects this higher expenditure rate will continue for the near term 
among its ongoing r d projects  the company expects to continue to incur significant expenses in developing newer computer to plate systems for the commercial printing and graphic arts industries 
in each of the years   and  the company s principal debt obligations were industrial revenue bonds with variable tax exempt interest rates 
since debt levels changed only slightly over this three year period  the changes in the company s interest expense reflected primarily the movements in short term interest rates 
the lower short term interest rates that prevailed in resulted in comparatively lower interest expense in that year and with the rise in short term interest rates that occurred in  interest expense rose 
other income in and consisted principally of royalty income and tax exempt interest income from investments in municipal bonds 
the lower interest income in compared with reflected a smaller investment portfolio  which is discussed below under financial condition

offsetting the statutory us federal income tax rate in each year were tax exempt interest income from the company s municipal bond investments and the tax savings derived from the company s foreign sales corporation fsc 
the increase in the effective tax rate from to was due in part to the expiration and non extension of the us research and development tax credit
