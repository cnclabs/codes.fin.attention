item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general discussion hondo oil gas company is an independent oil and gas company focusing on international oil and gas exploration and development 
the company s domestic exploration and production assets were sold in and substantially all of its refining and marketing assets were disposed of in today  the company s principal asset is its interest in the opon association contract the opon contract  an exploration concession for an area in the middle magdalena valley of colombia  south america 
significant reserves of natural gas and condensate were shown to exist in the opon contract area by two discovery wells drilled during and in accordance with the terms of the opon contract  empresa colombiana de petroleos ecopetrol declared a portion of the area as commercial in may a pipeline and related facilities to deliver natural gas and condensate to a market is under construction 
a new well  opon no 
 is being drilled to confirm additional gas resources north of the commercial area 
as further described below  the company will require additional financing to continue development of the opon project 
cautionary statements the company believes that this report contains certain forward looking statements  as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of  including  without limitation  statements containing the words believes  anticipates  estimates  expects  may and words of similar import  or statements of management s opinion 
such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of the company to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such factors include  among others  the following substantial reliance on single investment 
the company s success currently is dependent on its investment in the opon project in colombia  south america 
the company has no operating assets which are presently generating cash to fund its operating and capital requirements 
at september  the company had a deficiency in net assets of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item role of ecopetrol 
ecopetrol is a quasi governmental corporate organization wholly owned by the colombian government 
see international operations in item at present  the price of natural gas is set by law enacted by the legislature of colombia in the regulated price of natural gas could be changed in the future by governmental action 
the participation of ecopetrol  a government owned company  in the opon project as a producer and as a purchaser  and the power of the government of colombia to set the price of natural gas creates the potential for a conflict of interest in ecopetrol and or the government 
if such a conflict of interest materializes  the economic value of the company s interest in the opon project could be diminished 
marketing of natural gas 
the company must secure additional markets and sales contracts for natural gas in colombia in order to increase production and cash flow from the opon project 
this will depend on the continued development of markets for  and an infrastructure for the delivery of natural gas in colombia 
also  competition from other producers of natural gas may adversely affect the amount of the market for natural gas the company may secure 
see international operations and competitive factors in item foreign operations 
operations in colombia are subject to the risks inherent in foreign operations 
see international operations in item risks of oil and gas exploration 
inherent to the oil and gas industry is the risk that future wells will not find hydrocarbons where existing wells and engineering and geological data indicate hydrocarbons should be found 
further  existing wells can deplete at rates faster than those anticipated  potentially causing revisions to reserve estimates and increasing costs due to replacement wells 
operations in the opon project are also subject to operating risks associated with the exploration for  and production of oil and gas 
see international operations in item laws and regulations 
the company may be adversely affected by new laws or regulations in the united states or colombia affecting its operations and or environmental compliance  or by existing laws and regulations 
see other factors affecting the company s business in item limited capital 
the company has no source of current income from its operations 
the company s principal asset  its investment in the opon project  does not currently provide any income and will require additional capital for exploitation 
see liquidity and capital resources  below  and note to the consolidated financial statements in item losses from operations 
the company experienced losses of   and  for the years ended september   and  respectively 
as discussed above under limited capital  because the company s principal asset does not currently provide any income and requires additional capital for exploitation  the company anticipates continued losses through fiscal see results of operations  below 
continuation of american stock exchange listing 
because of losses in prior years and negative shareholders equity  the company does not fully meet all of the guidelines of the american stock exchange for continued listing of its shares 
see market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters in item given these uncertainties  prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward looking statements

opon exploration hondo magdalena oil gas limited hondo magdalena  a wholly owned subsidiary  became involved in the opon contract through a farmout agreement with opon development company odc in during  and  hondo magdalena and odc drilled four shallow oil wells to the mugrosa formation  one of which was a dry hole  and one deep gas well to the la paz formation 
these efforts met with limited success 
in august  hondo magdalena and odc entered into a farmout agreement under which amoco colombia petroleum company amoco colombia earned a participating interest in the opon contract 
to earn the interest  amoco colombia paid million in cash in and paid all of the costs related to drilling the opon no 
well in in addition  amoco colombia paid hondo magdalena million in october and paid all but million of hondo magdalena s costs for drilling the opon no 
well in the opon no 
well  completed in september  was drilled to a depth of  feet at a total cost of approximately million 
the well tested at a daily rate of million cubic feet of natural gas and  barrels of condensate 
downhole restrictions prevented the well from testing at higher rates 
the opon no 
well  completed in september  was drilled to a depth of  feet at a total cost of approximately million 
the well tested at a daily rate of million cubic feet of natural gas and  barrels of condensate 
these two wells have confirmed the existence of a significant natural gas field 
the company has for the first time attributed proved reserves to the discovery described above 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item and supplementary information about oil and gas producing activities and reserves unaudited following the consolidated financial statements in item the rules concerning reporting of proved reserves require that the hydrocarbons be recoverable under existing economic and operating conditions 
the quantum of proved reserves reported is limited to the volumes that the company has reasonable certainty will be sold under existing and pending sales arrangements 
presently  amoco colombia  hondo magdalena and odc have interests in the opon contract outside the commercial area described below of approximately  and  respectively 
as provided in the opon contract  upon the designation of an area or field as commercial  ecopetrol acquires a interest in such area or field and will reimburse the associate parties for of the direct exploration costs for each commercial discovery from its share of production 
an application for commerciality was submitted by amoco colombia in february on may   ecopetrol approved a commercial field of approximately  acres around the opon no 
and no 
wells 
the interests in the commercial field are approximately ecopetrol   amoco colombia   hondo magdalena   and odc  
the commercial field is substantially smaller than that requested by amoco colombia 
the commercial field may be enlarged by future drilling and or additional technical information 
ecopetrol will not pay for its share of expenditures to enlarge the commercial field until the new areas are proven and declared commercial 
ecopetrol will participate in further development costs of the existing commercial field 
as described below  ecopetrol has agreed to reimburse in cash certain costs related to the construction of pipeline and wellhead facilities incurred before commerciality was declared 
the opon contract provides that at the end of the exploration period  if a field capable of producing hydrocarbons in commercial quantities has been discovered  the opon contract area will be reduced by 
two years thereafter  the opon contract area will be further reduced to of the original area 
two years thereafter  the opon contract area will be reduced to the area of the commercial field that is in production or development  plus a reserve zone of five kilometers in width around the productive limit of such field 
the commercial field plus the zone surrounding such field will become the area of exploitation 
the associate parties designate the acreage to be released 
additional wells will be required to enlarge the commercial area and to increase the size of the area of exploitation 
the first acreage relinquishment of was completed during the opon contract area now covers  hectares  acres 
the company believes that the first relinquishment did not cause the loss of significant exploration opportunities 
drilling of additional wells and further assessment of geological and geophysical information will be necessary to evaluate the effects of further acreage reductions 
the next well on the opon contract area  the opon no 
well  commenced drilling on october  this well is slightly more than kilometer north of the opon no 
well and is outside the presently designated commercial area 
hondo magdalena will pay of the costs of this well estimated at million 
this well is intended to confirm the existence of the la paz reservoir in this area 
contingent upon the results of the opon no 
well  the next well will be either i the opon no 
well  located south of the commercial area  to confirm the existence of the la paz reservoir in that area or ii the opon no 
well  located within the commercial area to support sales commitments 
hondo magdalena  odc  amoco colombia and ecopetrol executed a memorandum of understanding mou in july for the construction of a pipeline and wellhead facilities which were not contemplated in the opon contract and the sale of natural gas from the opon contract area 
the mou provides that the parties will construct a inch pipeline approximately kilometers in length from the opon contract area north to ecopetrol s gas processing plant at el centro  and from there to ecopetrol s refinery at barrancabermeja 
the pipeline will have a capacity of million cubic feet per day and is estimated to cost million 
under the mou  hondo magdalena  odc and amoco colombia each pay their respective share of the costs incurred prior to july   up to a maximum of of the total pipeline costs 
ecopetrol will pay cash for its share of pipeline costs incurred after july   the remainder of ecopetrol s share of costs those incurred prior to july  will be recovered out of production 
the investment in pipeline costs will be recovered through a pipeline tariff 
in the mou  ecopetrol agreed to construct improvements at its el centro gas processing plant to handle incremental production from the opon contract area 
ecopetrol will recover its investment through a gas processing fee 
the parties agreed in the mou to negotiate contracts necessary to carry out the agreements made in the mou 
ecopetrol agreed to fund of its share of wellhead facilities total estimated cost of million in cash with to be recovered subsequently from production 
after new regulations were adopted in late by the comision de regulacion de energia y gas commission for the regulation of energy and gas  creg  an agency of the ministry of mines and energy of the colombian government  the parties began to renegotiate certain terms of the mou 
the regulations set a ceiling price for natural gas and a maximum rate of return of after colombian taxes  except for a remittance tax on foreign exchange returned to the united states for pipeline tariffs 
the ceiling price has been interpreted to include costs or fees for the processing of natural gas  thus processing costs cannot be passed on to the buyer as contemplated in the mou 
ecopetrol was unwilling to provide the terms outlined in the mou related to the buyer s payment of gas processing fees and the rate of return after colombian taxes included in the pipeline tariff because of these new regulations 
three contracts  covering the sale of natural gas  the sale of condensate and natural gas liquids  and the processing of the gas stream are complete and have been signed by all parties 
management believes that the new contracts achieve an arrangement that is an economic equivalent to the terms of the mou and comply with the new creg regulations 
the three contracts provide for i the sale of million cubic feet of natural gas per day for the life of the opon contract at the regulated price determined semi annually by a formula based upon the average price received by ecopetrol for exported fuel oil during the prior two six month periods currently us per million british thermal units  ii the sale of condensate and natural gas liquids at market related and market indexed prices  and iii the processing of the gas stream at ecopetrol s el centro gas processing plant for a fee of per thousand cubic feet of gas 
amoco colombia has received a letter from ecopetrol dated december   stating that the three contracts previously signed are effective and enforceable without the need for the completion and signing of a fourth contract 
ecopetrol s letter confirmed that because the pipeline being built to transport gas is owned by the parties who own the gas  a transportation agreement will not be necessary 
the company had previously reported that a fourth contract  covering the transportation of the gas and liquids was required for all of the contracts to become effective 
negotiations are continuing for another contract for the sale of up to million cubic feet of natural gas per day 
the gas will be used as fuel to generate electricity in a power generation plant to be built near the opon field 
preliminary work for the pipeline began in late and construction began in july completion of the pipeline is estimated to occur in march construction of wellsite facilities began in august  completion is estimated to occur in march ecopetrol has begun the improvements to the el centro gas plant  completion is estimated to occur in the summer of production will commence when all of these construction projects are completed  estimated to occur in the summer of the estimates of the completion dates of the three projects are subject to delays due to weather  labor interruptions  guerrilla activity  unanticipated shortages of materials or equipment and other causes beyond the control of the associate parties 
amoco colombia submitted a budget to hondo magdalena and odc for calendar in april hondo magdalena approved capital expenditures for wells and the pipeline projects  and certain other expenditures  but did not approve the proposed overhead 
similarly  amoco colombia submitted a budget for calendar on november   and hondo magdalena approved capital expenditures for wells and the pipeline projects  and certain other expenditures  but did not approve the proposed overhead 
as of this date  no final budget has been approved for calendar years and the parties continue to try to resolve the dispute about overhead 
hondo magdalena has paid invoices from amoco colombia  including disputed overhead and has charged the full overhead amount to expense 
it is management s opinion that the company is not obligated to pay for overhead unless charged pursuant to an approved budget  however the company has paid amoco colombia s invoices  under protest and subject to audit  in the hope of resolving the dispute about overhead 
if the dispute cannot be resolved  the joint operating agreement among amoco colombia  hondo magdalena and odc provides for arbitration of disputes 
corporate activities in fiscal  the company continued to maintain general and administrative expenses at the lowest levels prudent to maintain its business 
the company moved its principal offices to houston  texas in march to facilitate its relationships with amoco colombia  the international oil and gas community in general  and travel to colombia 
on december   lonrho plc and robert o 
anderson and his family entered into a revised settlement agreement under which the parties reallocated their ownership in the hondo company  the company s controlling shareholder 
lonrho plc now owns or controls of the hondo company  has an option to acquire the remaining of the hondo company in three years for million shares of the company s common stock owned by the hondo company  and controls the company 
robert o 
anderson and his family have informed lonrho plc that they will exercise their call for  of the shares in january in exchange for approximately of the hondo company 
discontinued operations the company began an effort to sell its refining and marketing assets in april on october  the company completed a transaction for the sale of its fletcher refinery and asphalt terminal in hilo  hawaii 
the company received net proceeds of million in further proceeds from the sale of certain components of the refinery equipment have not been realized and the company wrote off the related receivable in the company completed disposal of the remaining minor portions of the refining and marketing assets during in the agreement for the sale of the fletcher refinery  the company indemnified the buyer as to liabilities in excess of million for certain federal and state excise taxes arising from periods prior to the sale 
fletcher notified the company in july that an audit for california motor vehicle fuels tax was underway and a preliminary review by then fletcher employees indicated that a significant liability might exist 
the company retained a consultant to evaluate the contingent liability 
in september  the company accrued million as a result of the consultant s evaluation 
an additional million was accrued in september  primarily because of increases in the estimated amounts of penalties and interest which will be due 
the state of california issued a preliminary report in june which concludes taxes and penalties of million are due as a result of the audit 
however  no final audit report or assessment has been issued and the company does not believe the preliminary report is accurate 
the buyer has notified the company that it claims indemnity in this matter 
the company has provided its consultant to fletcher to assist in disputing the preliminary report 
the company believes the liability accrued is sufficient to provide for the amount that will ultimately be paid based on the information available 
the state of california s audit is still in process and could result in a liability different from that accrued when concluded 
the company owns in fee simple approximately acres of undeveloped land located in eastern los angeles county 
an option to a developer on the via verde tract expired on august  and will be extended until december at an option price of million 
the renegotiated option agreement will allow the company the right to be released from the current agreement should there be a potential sale of the parcel to a ready and willing buyer 
in  the company suspended a development plan for the valley gateway property  a former refinery site  due to the company s limited cash resources and poor market conditions in california 
the company listed the valley gateway property with a broker for million and recorded additional loss provisions of million and million for its discontinued real estate operations during and  respectively 
in september  the company revised its estimate of the realizable value of the valley gateway property to zero  resulting in an additional loss provision of million and making the carrying value a liability of million due to accruals for future carrying costs 
management believes it can dispose of the property and any associated liabilities for an insignificant price and little or no additional cost 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item other because of continuing losses and decreases in shareholders equity  the company does not fully meet all of the guidelines of the american stock exchange for continued listing of its shares 
see item  market for registrant s equity and related shareholder matters 
management has kept the exchange fully informed regarding the company s present status and future plans 
although the company does not or may not meet all of the guidelines  to date  the american stock exchange has chosen to allow the company s shares to remain listed 
however  no assurances can be given that the company s shares will remain listed on the exchange in the future 
the company is subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
as is the case with other companies engaged in oil and gas exploration  production and refining  the company faces exposure from actual or potential claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters 
these matters may involve alleged soil and water contamination and air pollution 
future environmental related expenditures cannot be reasonably quantified in many circumstances due to the conjectural nature of remediation and clean up cost estimates and methods  the imprecise and conflicting data regarding the characteristics of various types of waste  the number of other potentially responsible parties involved and changing environmental laws and interpretations 
management believes the reduced scope of the company s operations following the sale of the company s domestic oil and gas properties and the fletcher refinery have significantly reduced the company s potential exposure to environmental liability 
the company will continue to closely monitor and administer its compliance with environmental matters 
see other factors affecting the company s business in item results of operations results of operations for the year ended september  amounted to a loss of million  or cents per share  of which million arose from continuing operations and million resulted from discontinued operations 
the company reported a net loss of million  or cents per share  for the year ended september  the loss included discontinued loss provisions of million and a loss of million from continuing operations 
in  the company reported a net loss of million  or cents per share  which included losses from discontinued operations of million and a loss of million from continuing operations 
as described previously  the company is in transition from a domestic oil and gas operation to a foreign oil and gas operation 
the historical results of continuing operations contain many non recurring transactions 
as a result  they are not comparable and are a poor indicator of the company s future operating results 
management expects losses from continuing operations to continue through fiscal vs the company s share of expenses from the opon operation was borne solely by amoco colombia during and while the opon nos 
and wells were being drilled 
the increases in operating expenses  overhead colombian operations and exploration costs of million  million and million  respectively  for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september   all arise from the company assuming its share of these costs in management has the following expectations for results of operations revenue and related operating costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization will increase significantly in conjunction with the commencement of production in the summer of  overhead colombian operations should not vary significantly from  exploration expenses should decline to a negligible amount as the seismic data acquisition program is complete and no further activity is presently planned 
the increase in interest expense of million between the years arises primarily from colombian costs financed with the funding agreement described in liquidity and capital resources below 
management expects interest expense to continue to increase in as additional costs are financed with the funding agreement 
vs the decreases in operating revenues  other income  operating costs and loss on sale of assets all arise primarily from non recurring transactions recorded in the decrease in general and administrative expense of million between the years arises primarily from reductions in the number of employees and insurance costs 
exploration costs had no significant activity in but reflect the beginning of a seismic data acquisition program in discontinued operations the company implemented disposal accounting for its refining and marketing and real estate segments during in  the company recorded loss provisions of million and million for its refining and marketing and real estate segments  respectively  as described previously 
loss provisions of million for the refining and marketing segment and million for the real estate segment were recorded in loss provisions for amounted to million and million for refining and marketing and real estate  respectively 
operating losses from discontinued operations of million  million  and million for   and  respectively  were charged against loss provisions established in earlier periods 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  cash inflows of million  and million arose from borrowings from lonrho plc under existing loan agreements  and issuance of common stock as a result of the exercise of stock options  respectively 
the company utilized cash of million and million to finance continuing and discontinued operations  respectively  million for capital expenditures  and made scheduled debt repayments of million 
at september   the company had cash balances of million 
in december  the company restructured the terms of its debts to lonrho plc 
the revised terms included reduction of interest rates to a fixed rate of and provisions allowing the company to offer payment of future interest in shares of its common stock  and allowing lonrho plc to either accept such payment in kind or add the amount of the interest due to principal 
the ability to pay interest in kind or capitalize interest allows the company to service its debt while cash resources are scarce 
the company obtained an additional facility loan of million in a revolving credit agreement dated as of june   between the company and thamesedge  ltd  a subsidiary of lonrho plc 
the facility is to be used for hondo magdalena s requirements for the opon project and for general corporate expenses 
the interest rate is  due semiannually  as provided in other debts to thamesedge and described above  the company may make payment of interest in shares of its common stock 
the first draw on this facility of million occurred in october in december  the company obtained extensions of the maturity of its debts to lonrho plc 
the maturity of all loans from lonrho plc was extended from not earlier than october  to not earlier than january  as consideration for the extensions and certain other financial undertakings  the company has granted to lonrho a security interest in all of the shares of hondo magdalena and agreed to give lonrho an option to convert million of existing loans with an interest rate of see note to the consolidated financial statements in item into the company s common stock 
the debt will be convertible at lonrho s option at any time prior to maturity january  at a rate of per share 
the portion of the debt that may be converted into common stock will not be secured by the pledge of the hondo magdalena shares 
the option to convert the debt into common stock will be subject to the approval of the company s shareholders at the annual meeting 
if the conversion option is not approved by the shareholders  the interest rate on the million will revert to  the rate of interest on such debt prior to the december restructuring 
on may   hondo magdalena  odc and amoco colombia entered into a funding agreement for tier i development project costs the funding agreement for the interim financing of costs associated with the construction of a pipeline from the opon contract area see note to the consolidated financial statements in item and general discussion  opon exploration  above and certain other costs related to the opon contract 
the funding agreement became effective on july  with the execution of the mou 
hondo magdalena may finance its share of the costs including overhead for the pipeline and an approved geological and geophysical work program for up to days after the date that production from the opon contract area begins 
the funding agreement provides that hondo magdalena may repay the amounts financed from prior to the date of first production until days thereafter  along with an equity premium computed on a annualized interest rate 
the equity premium will be computed monthly on hondo magdalena s share of expenditures including any amounts to be later recouped from ecopetrol after commerciality 
alternatively  from the date of first production until days thereafter  hondo magdalena may elect to repay of its share excluding any amounts to be later recouped from ecopetrol after commerciality of the total costs accumulated up to the date of repayment 
if the financed amounts are not repaid within days after the date of first production  an additional penalty of of the amount then due would be recovered out of hondo magdalena s revenues 
hondo magdalena s revenues from production of the first million cubic feet of natural gas and corresponding condensate and natural gas liquids are pledged to secure its obligations under the funding agreement 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item based upon the company s budget and current information  management believes existing cash  available facilities and commitments  and the interim funding agreement will be sufficient to finance the company s known obligations the pipeline and related facilities  drilling of the opon no 
well  overhead obligations unrelated to capital projects and other business activities during fiscal however  management believes the company will need additional cash to participate in the drilling of additional wells in colombia  or to participate in other capital projects which may be proposed in colombia 
in addition  funds are required to retire the funding agreement since a significant portion of the anticipated cash flow is dedicated to servicing the funding agreement 
there is a financial incentive to prepay the funding agreement within days after production begins 
if the company becomes obligated for the drilling of an additional well  or other capital projects  the company has the option to not participate in some or all of the capital projects 
in management s view  use of this election would be a last resort to preserve the company s existing interest in the opon contract area because substantial penalties would be incurred by not participating 
cash from operations are not expected to be a source of funds until the opon project begins commercial production  estimated in summer management is reviewing several options for raising funds including sale of the company s interest in the pipeline 
management continues to pursue discussions with a number of financial institutions regarding debt or equity financing of the company s future obligations for the opon project but has received no commitments 
while the company will continue to seek permanent financing in the near term  there can be no assurance that the opon project will be successfully developed or that additional debt or equity funds will become available
