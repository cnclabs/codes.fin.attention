item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis is designed to provide a better understanding of various factors related to the company s results of operations and financial condition 
such discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the business and financial statements and related notes sections included elsewhere in this report 
the purpose of this discussion is to focus on significant changes in the financial condition and results of the operations of the company during the three years ended september   and this discussion and analysis is intended to supplement and highlight information contained in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the selected financial data presented elsewhere herein 
financial condition investment securities investment securities held to maturity were  and  at september  and  respectively 
this decline of  in was due primarily to the reclassification  on december   of approximately  of the collateralized mortgage obligations cmo s to its available for sale portfolio as a result of the adoption of the financial accounting standards board s statement no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities fas 
the investment securities available for sale portfolio was  at september  the composition of the company s total investment securities portfolio reflects the company s former investment strategy to provide acceptable levels of interest income from portfolio yields while maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity to assist with controlling the company s interest rate position 
in previous years  the company invested primarily in investment grade cmos and mbs because of their liquidity  credit quality and yield characteristics 
the yields  values  and duration of such securities generally vary with the interest rates  prepayment levels  and general economic conditions  and  as a result  the values of such instruments may be more volatile than other instruments with similar maturities 
such securities also may have longer stated maturities than other securities  which may result in further price volatility 
the company made purchases of cmos amounting to  in  along with purchases of mbs amounting to  in no purchases of cmos or mbs were made in and with the company s purchase of the construction loan portfolio of another alabama thrift institution in april of  the company revised its investment strategy  deciding to curtail its purchases of cmos and mbs and utilize the principal repayments on these securities to fund construction loans 
principal repayments on both cmos and mbs during and were  and  respectively

securities are tested as to their average life  average life sensitivity  and price volatility 
because all cmos passed their most recent stress test  the company had none that were considered high risk at september  or additionally  no mbs in the investment portfolio are inverse floaters  or interest only i os or principal only p os securities  and  therefore  are not considered high risk by the ffiec 
at september   the bank owned ten cmos for a total dollar amount of  these issues were all backed by federal agency guaranteed mortgages except for three issues  in the amount of  which are privately issued mortgage pass through certificates 
four issues totaling  are fixed rate  the remainder are variable 
two issues  for  were purchased at par 
three issues  in the amount of  were purchased at a discount 
the remaining five issues  totaling  were purchased at a premium 
as interest rates increase  refinancing generally slows and  therefore  prepayments slow 
in such an event  mortgage related products purchased at a discount will experience lower yields  while those purchased at a premium will experience higher yields 
prior to purchase  the company applies the ffiec stress test and looks at both increasing and decreasing prepayment speeds 
cmos are purchased based on the company s evaluation of the cmos at these extremes 
the mbs portfolio  consisting of issues totaling  is a mixture of fixed rate mortgages and arms 
at the time of purchase  the company looks at various prepayment speeds and makes the purchase based on the ability to accept the yield and average life based on both increasing and decreasing prepayment speeds

one to four family real estate mortgage loans increased  from september  to september  the increase from september  to september  was  
the company aggressively pursues real estate mortgage loans within its own market area 
in addition to originating mortgage loans for its own portfolio  the company also actively originates residential mortgage loans which are sold in the secondary market  with servicing released 
the company sells a significant portion of all residential mortgage loans with terms greater than years 
for the most part  such sales are composed of residential mortgage loans with terms of years 
proceeds from loan sales were   and  in   and  respectively 
see financial statements and supplementary data consolidated statements of cash flows 
had the company not sold residential mortgage loans over the past two fiscal years  the one to four family real estate mortgage loan portfolio would have increased by a larger margin than the indicated above

if there is reasonable doubt as to the repayment of a loan in accordance with the agreed terms  the loan may be placed on a nonaccrual basis pending the sale of any collateral or a determination as to whether sources of repayment exist 
generally  delinquency of days or more creates reasonable doubt as to repayment 
this action may be taken even though the financial condition of the borrower or the collateral may be sufficient ultimately to reduce or satisfy the obligation 
generally  when a loan is placed on a nonaccrual basis  all payments are applied to reduce principal to the extent necessary to eliminate doubt as to the repayment of the loan 
any interest income on a nonaccrual loan is recognized only on a cash basis 
see nonperforming assets 
lending officers are responsible for the ongoing review and administration of each particular loan 
as such  they make the initial identification of loans which present some difficulty in collection or where circumstances indicate that the probability of loss exists 
the responsibilities of the lending officers include the collection effort on a delinquent loan 
senior management and the company s board of directors are informed of the status of delinquent loans on a monthly basis 
senior management reviews the allowance for loan losses and makes recommendations to the board of directors as to loan charge offs on a monthly basis 
at september  and  loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis were approximately  and  respectively  or and of the total loans outstanding  net of unearned income 
the balances of accruing loans past due days or more as to principal and interest payments were  and  at september  and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s assessment of the risk associated with extending credit and its evaluation of the quality of the loan portfolio 
management analyzes the loan portfolio to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the appropriate provision required to maintain a level considered adequate to absorb anticipated loan losses 
in assessing the adequacy of the allowance  management reviews the size  quality and risk of loans in the portfolio 
management also considers such factors as the bank s historical loan loss experience  the level  severity  and trend of criticized assets  the distribution of loans by risk class  and various qualitative factors such as current and anticipated economic conditions 
as discussed in the business construction lending section of this report  the bank began construction lending activities in march of as of september   the bank has not experienced significant loss on the construction loan portfolio 
since these lending activities are fairly new to the bank  the bank does not have the same historical data available for construction loans as for other loans 
due to the concentration of these loans  a default by certain construction loan borrowers or other financial difficulty could result in a significant addition to the allowance for loan losses 
while it is the company s policy to charge off loans in the period in which a loss is considered probable  there are additional risks of future losses which cannot be quantified precisely or attributed to particular loans or classes of loans 
because these risks include the state of the economy  management s judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance is necessarily approximate and imprecise 
in assessing the adequacy of the allowance  management relies predominately on its ongoing review of the loan portfolio  which is undertaken both to ascertain whether there are probable losses which must be charged off and to assess the risk characteristics of the portfolio in the aggregate 
this review takes into consideration the judgments of the responsible lending officers  senior management and those of bank regulatory agencies that review the loan portfolio as part of the company s examination process 
specific percentages are allocated to each loan type 
management recognizes that there is more risk traditionally associated with commercial and consumer lending as compared to real estate mortgage lending  as such  a greater allocation is made for commercial and consumer loans than real estate mortgage loans 
while all information available is used by management to recognize losses in the loan portfolio  there can be no assurances that future additions to the allowance will not be necessary 
the company s board of directors reviews the assessments of management in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
generally  the only loans  including construction loans  which are classified are loans which are greater than days delinquent 
however  the board of directors may also classify loans less than days delinquent should such classification be considered necessary 
the company s allowance for loan losses is also subject to regulatory examinations and determinations as to adequacy  which may take into account such factors as the methodology used to calculate the allowance for loan loss reserves and the size of the loan loss reserve in comparison to a group of peer banks identified by the regulators 
during its routine examinations of banks  the ots has  from time to time  required additions to banks provisions for loan losses and allowances for loan losses as the regulators credit evaluations and allowance for loan loss methodology have differed from those of the management of such banks 
such regulatory examinations have focused on loan quality  particularly that of real estate loans 
the company attempts to reduce the risks of real estate lending through maximum loan to value requirements as well as systematic cash flow and initial customer credit history analyses 
see business supervision and regulation 
management believes that the  in allowance for loan losses at september  of total outstanding loans  net of unearned income at such date  is adequate to absorb known risks in the portfolio 
no assurance can be given  however  that adverse economic circumstances will not result in increased losses in the bank s loan portfolio 
at september    of the allowance for loan losses was reserved for possible losses on construction loans   was reserved for possible losses on real estate mortgage loans  and the remaining  was reserved for all other loan classifications 
the following table summarizes the levels of the allowance for loan losses at the end of the last five years year ended september  in thousands balance at beginning of period charge offs real estate installment total charge offs recoveries real estate mortgage installment total recoveries net loans recovered charged off provisions for loan losses balance at end of period ratio of net charge offs to total loans outstanding net of unearned income ratio of allowance for loan losses to loans outstanding  net of unearned income as indicated in the above table  loan loss provisions recorded by the bank have been at modest levels since fiscal  as credit quality of the company s loans has substantially improved 
the following table sets forth the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by loan category at the dates indicated 
management believes that the allowance can be allocated by category only on an approximate basis 
the allocation of the allowance to each category is not necessarily an indication of future losses and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any category 
at september  percent of loans percent of loans in each category in each category amount to total loans amount to total loans in thousands construction loans real estate mortgage loans all other loans total allowance for loan losses on october   the company adopted the financial accounting standards board s statement no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan fas  as amended by fas fas addresses the accounting by creditors for impairment of certain loans and requires that impaired loans be measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or at the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
under fas  creditors are permitted to use existing methods for recognizing interest income on impaired loans 
fas requires that an entity disclose its policy for recognizing interest income on impaired loans  including how cash receipts are recorded 
the effect of the adoption of fas was immaterial 
at september  and  there were no impaired loans and no specific reserve for impaired loans 
nonperforming assets the bank has policies  procedures and underwriting guidelines intended to assist in maintaining the overall quality of its loan portfolio 
the bank monitors its delinquency levels for any adverse trends 
nonperforming assets consist of loans on nonaccrual status  accruing loans which are past due days or more  and foreclosed real estate 
the company s policy generally is to place a loan on nonaccrual status when there is reasonable doubt as to the repayment of the loan in accordance with the agreed terms 
generally  delinquency of days or more creates reasonable doubt as to repayment 
at the time a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed and charged against current earnings 
income is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash payments are received until  in management s judgment  the borrower is able to make periodic interest and principal payments and the loan is no longer delinquent and is returned to accrual status 
nonperforming assets were   and  at september   and  respectively 
these levels represent an increase of  between september  and  compared to a decline of  between september  and the increase in nonperforming assets in coincides with the increase in loan balances 
as a percentage of total loans  nonperforming assets continue to be at levels which management considers to be acceptable and commensurate with its conservative lending policies 
an analysis of the components of nonperforming assets at the end of the last three years is presented in the following table nonperforming assets at september  in thousands loans accounted for on a non accrual basis real estate mortgage loans all other loans total accruing loans which are past due days or more real estate mortgage loans all other loans total total of non accrual and days past due loans foreclosed real estate net of related loss provisions total non performing assets nonaccrual and days past due loans as a of total loans nonperforming assets as a of total loans total loans outstanding    if nonaccrual loans had performed in accordance with their original contractual terms  interest income would have increased approximately   and  for the years ended september   and  respectively 
the amount of interest income earned and collected on nonaccrual loans which is included in income was   and  for   and  respectively 
management regularly reviews and monitors the loan portfolio in a effort to identify borrowers experiencing financial difficulties  but such measures are subject to uncertainties that cannot be predicted

during  however  cash dividends of  or per share  were declared on the common stock 
the cash dividends declared during included a special dividend of per share  paid in connection with the company s equity management programs 
the company s special dividend in should be considered a non recurring event and  although the company plans to continue a dividend payout policy that allows it to maintain adequate capital to support future growth and capital adequacy  the current common dividend payout ratio  which is based in part on excess capital  cannot be viewed as a guarantee of future dividend payments 
management believes that a strong capital position is vital to the continued profitability of the company and provides a foundation for future growth as well as promoting depositor and investor confidence in the institution

certain financial ratios for the company at the end of the last three years are presented in the following table equity and assets ratio september  return on average assets return on average stockholder s equity common dividend payout ratio average stockholders equity to average assets the firrea and the implementing regulations of the ots  which became effective on december   changed the capital requirements applicable to thrifts  including the company  and the consequences for failing to comply with such standards 
the capital standards include i a core capital requirement  ii a tangible capital requirement  and iii a risk based capital requirement 
firrea specifies such capital requirements and states that such standards shall be no less stringent than the capital standards applicable to national banks 
the ots has issued guidelines identifying minimum regulatory tangible capital equal to of adjusted total assets  a minimum core capital ratio  and a minimum risk based capital of of risk weighted assets 
the company s compliance with these regulatory capital requirements at september   is illustrated in the following table at september  tangible core risk based capital capital capital retained earnings    general valuation allowance  regulatory capital    regulatory asset base    capital ratio minimum required ratio capital ratio required for well capitalized designation liquidity liquidity is the bank s ability to convert assets into cash equivalents in order to meet daily cash flow requirements  primarily for deposit withdrawals  loan demand  and maturing liabilities 
without proper management  the bank could experience higher costs of obtaining funds due to insufficient liquidity 
on the other hand  excessive liquidity could lead to a decline in earnings due to the cost of foregoing alternative higher yielding investment opportunities 
asset liquidity is provided primarily through cash  the repayment and maturity of investment securities  and the sale and repayment of loans 
sources of liability liquidity include customer deposits and participation in the federal home loan bank s fhlb advance program 
although deposit growth historically has been a primary source of liquidity  such balances may be influenced by changes in the banking industry  interest rates available on other investments  general economic conditions  competition and other factors 
fhlb advances include both fixed and variable terms and are taken out with varying maturities 
the bank can borrow up to of its mortgage loans which are backed by one to four family residential properties  for a maximum of approximately  at september   the bank had credit available  net of advances drawn down  of approximately  the bank drew down such advances in order to fund new one to four family construction loans 
on a consolidated basis  net cash provided by operating activities decreased  to  from  at september  and  respectively 
the  in net cash used in investing activities during consisted primarily of a  increase in net loans originated   in purchases of investment securities available for sale and net proceeds from repayments maturities and purchases of investments securities held to maturity and available for sale of  the  in net cash provided by financing activities resulted from an increase of  in deposits  coupled with a net increase of  in borrowed funds  payment of  in common stock dividends  and net issuance of and contributions to the employee stock ownership plan of the bank s liquidity ratio at september  was compared to on september  and on september  liquidity levels may be increased or decreased depending upon the yields on investment alternatives  management s expectations to the level of yield that will be available in the future  and management s projections as to the short term demand for funds to be used in loan origination 
the bank is subject to certain regulatory limitations with respect to the payment of dividends to the company 
the bank paid no dividends to the company during or see business regulations and supervision 
the company also requires cash for various purposes including servicing debt  paying dividends to shareholders and paying general corporate expenses 
the primary source of funds for the company is dividends from the bank 
the bank s capital levels meet the requirements for a well capitalized institution and enable the bank to pay dividends to the company 
in addition to dividends  the company has access to various capital markets and other sources of borrowings 
the company retained  of the net proceeds from the initial public offering of common stock in substantially all of those funds have been used to pay dividends  including the special per share dividend in  acquire treasury stock  invest in affiliates and pay general corporate expenses 
accordingly  the company will likely rely on dividends from the bank to repay borrowings under the line of credit and to continue paying dividends to shareholders 
interest rate sensitivity management an integral part of the funds management of the company and the bank is to maintain a reasonably balanced position between interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the bank s asset liability committee alco is charged with the responsibility of managing  to the degree prudently possible  its exposure to interest rate risk  while attempting to provide a stable and steadily increasing flow of depositors and borrowers and to seek earnings enhancement opportunities 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific period if it will mature or reprice within that period 
the interest rate sensitive gap gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest sensitive liabilities  and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would result in an increase in net interest income 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would result in an increase in net interest income and a positive gap would adversely affect net interest income 
a gap ratio is calculated by dividing rate sensitive assets by rate sensitive liabilities 
due to the nature of the company s balance sheet structure and the market approach to pricing of liabilities  management and the board of directors recognize that achieving a perfectly matched gap position in any given time frame would be extremely rare 
at september   the company had a negative one year gap of and a cumulative five year positive gap of  as a result of which its net interest income could be adversely affected by rising interest rates and positively affected by falling interest rates 
at september   the company had a positive one year gap of and a cumulative five year positive gap of 
at september   the company had a negative one year gap of and a cumulative positive five year gap of 
consistent with a positive gap during the increasing interest rate environment experienced in late and  when interest rates increased further and more rapidly on interest bearing liabilities than on interest earning assets  the company experienced a decrease in its interest rate spread 
conversely  consistent with a negative gap  during the declining interest rate environment experienced from through late  when interest rates declined further and more rapidly on interest bearing liabilities than on interest earning assets  the company experienced an increase in its interest rate spread 
there are other factors that may affect the interest rate sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities 
these factors generally are difficult to quantify but can have a significant impact on the sensitivity of the company to changes in market interest rates 
such factors include features in adjustable rate loans that limit the changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the loan 
the company s portfolio of one to four family residential mortgage loans includes million of the bank s total loan portfolio of adjustable rate loans with restrictions limiting interest rate changes to or per year and over the life of the loan 
in a rapidly declining or rising interest rate environment  these restrictions could have a material effect on interest income by slowing the overall response of the portfolio to market movements 
alco utilizes the asset and liability management report prepared by morgan keegan company  inc in order to assist the company in determining the company s gap and interest rate position 
through use of this report  alco analyzed the effect of an increase or decrease of up to basis points on the market value of the company s portfolio equity mvpe at september  at a basis point increase  the company s mvpe increased approximately  and  at a basis point decrease  the company s mvpe decreased approximately  management determined that these changes in mvpe were acceptable at september  the following tables set forth information regarding the projected maturities and repricing of the major asset and liability categories of the company as of september  and maturity and repricing dates have been projected by applying the assumptions set forth below as to contractual maturity and repricing dates

certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the table above 
although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in the market interest rates 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
certain assets  such as arms  generally have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayments and early withdrawal levels would cause significant deviations in the table 
additionally  an increased credit risk may result if the ability of many borrowers to service their debt decreases in the event of an interest rate increase 
a majority of the adjustable rate loans in the bank s portfolio contain conditions which restrict the periodic change in interest rates

on october   the financial accounting standards board issued financial accounting statement no 
 disclosure about derivative financial instruments and fair value financial investments fas 
fas amends fas and fas and provides specific disclosure requirements for derivative financial instruments 
fas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years ending after december   except for entities with less than million in total assets in the current statement of financial position for which the effective date is for fiscal years ending after december  the company has not entered into derivative products 
therefore  fas does not have a material effect on the financial statements 
interest rate risk strategy the company has employed various strategies intended to minimize the adverse effect of interest rate risk on future operations by providing a better match between the interest rate sensitivity between its assets and liabilities 
the company s strategies are intended to stabilize net interest income for the long term by protecting its interest rate spread against decreases and increases in interest rates 
to offset the interest rate risk associated with holding a substantial amount of fixed rate loans and having a predominantly short term certificate of deposit base  the company maintains a portfolio of residential adjustable rate mortgage loans that reprice in less than one year equal to  at september  the company also sells a significant portion of its fixed rate loan originations with maturities more than fifteen years in the secondary markets  and directs excess cash flow into short term and adjustable rate investment securities 
recent diversification into more interest sensitive consumer loans and in construction loans in the birmingham area has also served to reduce the company s interest rate risk exposure 
the company has also reduced the interest rate risk through the use of an increasing level of fixed rate fhlb advances  which have effectively lengthened the term to maturity of liabilities 
effects of inflation and changing prices inflation generally increases the costs of funds and operating overhead  and to the extent loans and other assets bear variable rates  the yields on such assets 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on the performance of a financial institution than the effects of general levels of inflation 
although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services  increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates 
in addition  inflation affects financial institutions increased cost of goods and services purchased  the cost of salaries and benefits  occupancy expense  and similar items 
inflation and related increases in interest rates generally decrease the market value of investments and loans held and may adversely affect liquidity  earnings  and stockholders equity 
mortgage originations and refinancings tend to slow as interest rates increase  and likely would reduce the company s earnings from such activities and the income from the sale of residential mortgage loans in the secondary market 
results of operations net income for the year ended september   net income decreased  for a net loss of  when compared with s net income of  earnings per common share of common stock outstanding was a loss of 
cents per share for versus income per share of in weighted average shares outstanding in reflects shares outstanding for the entire year 
however  weighted average shares for only reflects shares outstanding for the days since the initial public offering on february  the primary reasons for the decline in net income are an increase in compensation and benefits of  and the one time saif assessment of  offset by  income received in the settlement of the usf g litigation 
net income increased  during and decreased  to  during increases in net interest income and other income are primarily responsible for the increase while the write off of the bond claim receivable primarily caused the decline in the items discussed in the preceding paragraphs are discussed more fully below 
net interest income net interest income is the difference between the interest the company earns on its loans  investment securities and other earning assets and the interest cost of its deposits and borrowed funds 
this is the primary component of the company s earnings 
net interest income was  for the twelve months ended september  this decrease of  over resulted primarily from the increase in interest on deposits and interest on borrowed funds 
the net yield decreased basis points as rates on interest earning assets increased basis points to  while cost of funds increased basis points to when compared to the basis point decrease in the interest rate spread is a result of a small decrease in the yield on loans during and an increase on the yield on interest bearing liabilities offset by a slight increase in the yield on investments 
these changes in yields resulted from the stabilization of interest rates in the market 
net interest income for was   higher than net interest income of  net interest income for increased  from the level of  the moderation of the interest rate environment during and was the primary reason for the increases in the company s net interest income for these periods 
the company s alco conducts a gap analysis in order to assist in analyzing the yields on earning assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
however  there can be no assurance that such analysis will positively affect earnings 
see interest rate sensitivity management  and consolidated average balances  interest income expense and yields rates tables appearing elsewhere herein and the rate volume variance analysis table immediately following this page 
rate volume variance analysis the following table sets forth information regarding the extent to which changes interest rates and changes in volume of interest assets and changes in volume of interest related assets and liabilities have affected the company s interest income and expense during the periods indicated 
for each category of interest earning asset and interest bearing liability  information is provided for changes attributable to i changes in volume change in volume multiplied by old rate  ii changes in rates change in rate multiplied by old volume and iii changes in rate volume change in rate multiplied by change in volume

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is based on management s assessment of the risk in the loan portfolio  as reflected in the amount of recent loan losses 
the provision for loan losses was   and  during   and  respectively 
these provisions for loan losses reflect management s assessment of the quality of the loan portfolio 
as previously discussed  the loan portfolio is comprised primarily of one to four family residential mortgage loans and residential construction loans 
the one to four family residential mortgage loans are originated in the bank s primary market area of talladega county  alabama 
management believes that the credit risks associated with this type of loan are significantly lower than other loan types 
this belief is substantiated by the low level of net charge offs which have averaged less than  each year over the past four years 
although residential construction loans have characteristics of relatively higher credit risks  such as concentrations of amounts due from a smaller number of borrowers and dependence on the expertise of the builder  management believes that its residential construction lending policies and procedures substantially reduce the credit risks associated with this type of loan 
see business of the bank general construction lending 
the bank entered the residential construction lending area in by purchasing the portfolio of another alabama thrift and hiring the loan officer who originated and managed the portfolio 
all of the bank s residential construction loans are in hoover  alabama  a suburb of birmingham and one of the most affluent areas of the state 
since acquiring the portfolio  the bank has not suffered a significant loss on a residential construction loan 
for the reasons discussed above  charge offs for the total loan portfolio  net of recoveries  have averaged less than  each year over the past four years 
based on this historical level of loan losses  the low level of nonperforming loans and general economic conditions  management believes the allowances for loan losses at september   and were adequate 
the provisions for loan losses in  and reflect amounts management considered necessary to maintain an acceptable level of loan loss allowance relative to the total loan portfolio and relative to nonperforming loans 
future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions 
in addition  various regulatory agencies periodically review the bank s allowance for loan losses and may require the bank to recognize additions to the allowance based on judgments about information available to them at the time of their review 
see further discussion at management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation allowance for loan losses and risk elements 
other income other income increased  to  in from  in  compared to a decrease of  over the level of  other income for represented an increase of  from the increase in resulted from the  settlement of the company s lawsuit against usf g 
see legal proceedings 
the decrease in resulted primarily from a decline in insurance commissions of  and a decrease in gain on sale of loans of  the increase in was primarily due to a  increase in service charges and other fees  reflecting higher charges for deposit account privileges 
service charges and other fees were   and  for   and  respectively  which represent increases of  in   in  and  in these fluctuations were due almost entirely to increases in income on nonsufficient funds and overdraft charges 
gain on sale of loans decreased  in and  in and increased  in the increase in is due to the increase volume of loans sold in compared to prior years 
the decrease in resulted from the increase in market interest rates in late  coupled with the continuing trend in the early part of proceeds from sales of loans increased by  in end decreased by  during and decreased by  in the increase in was due to favorable interest rates and increased marketing efforts 
the decrease in and increases in were due to lower levels of loan origination volumes 
the company is dedicated to providing quality products and services at competitive prices to the customers within its market area 
recognizing the value of other income  management periodically reviews the bank s pricing schedule for goods and services offered and makes any adjustments it deems appropriate 
in reviewing new products and services  management considers both the pricing aspect and the value of the product or service in meeting the financial needs of the company s customers 
other expense total other expense was  for   for and  for the increase for was   compared to a decrease of  in and an increase of  in compensation and benefits was   and  for   and  respectively 
these levels reflect increases of  in   in  and  in the increase in was primarily due to additional compensation awarded to selected employees under the management recognition plan mrp including non recurring cash bonuses to the company s officers of  and the cost of a large number of shares released to participants in the company s esop 
the increase in the number of shares released is attributable to the special dividend paid to qualifying stockholders  including the esop  on january  additionally  increases in   and can be attributed to merit and cost of living raises and the cost of benefits associated with such increases  and the addition of key personnel 
other expenses in also reflected a special one time saif assessment in the amount of  this expenditure  in connection with the federal insurance of accounts  was assessed on an industry wide basis and was not assessed in prior years 
see business supervision and regulation 
other noninterest expense was  for   and  for and respectively 
these levels represent an increase of  in  compared to a decrease of  in and an increase of  in the increase in was due primarily to increased costs associated with legal and accounting expenses 
the decrease in was due primarily to a  write off during for a possible loss on a fidelity bond related to a complaint filed by the bank against united states fidelity guaranty company as compared to no allowance during the effect of the absence of the write off in was mitigated somewhat by an increase in professional expenses of  incurred in relation to the cost of additional regulatory filings and other costs associated with being a public entity 
income tax expense income tax expense was   and  in   and  respectively 
these levels represent an effective tax rate on pre tax earnings of for  for  and for the increase in the effective tax rate in is due to the nondeductibility of portions of compensation expense related to esop and the management recognition plan mrp 
for and  the effective rates approximate the statutory rate of 
in and  the bank s effective tax rate was higher than the statutory rate due to state income taxes and differences between taxable income for financial reporting and income tax purposes
