item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion includes certain forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those reflected by the forward looking statements in the discussion and a number of factors may adversely affect future results  liquidity and capital resources 
these factors include softness in the general retail environment  the timing and acceptance of products being introduced to the market  international trade developments affecting chinese and other foreign sourcing of products  as discussed in greater detail below  the outcome of various litigation and environmental contingencies  including those discussed in item  legal proceedings and in note to the consolidated financial statements  the solvency of the retail customers of the company  the level of margins achievable in the marketplace and the ability to minimize operating expenses 
they also include possible continued weakening of the western boot market  which has experienced a somewhat prolonged down cycle 
many western boot retailers are thinly capitalized 
continued weakness in demand for western boots could result in the failure of those retailers and  consequently  the erosion of the company s customer base 
although the company believes it has the business strategy and resources needed for improved operations  future revenue and margin trends cannot be reliably predicted and the company may alter its business strategies during fiscal significant developments fiscal restructuring in response to worsening trends in the company s men s apparel business and in response to a strategic review of its footwear operations  the company s board of directors  on november   approved a plan the restructuring designed to focus the company on its core footwear businesses by selling or liquidating four businesses  two of which constituted its entire men s apparel segment 
the ongoing businesses  after implementation of the restructuring  include the manufacture or sourcing  marketing and distribution of footwear under the johnston murphy  laredo  code west  larry mahan  dockers and nautica brands  the tanning and distribution of leather by the volunteer leather division and the operation of jarman  journeys  johnston murphy  boot factory and factory to you retail footwear stores 
the restructuring provided for the following restructuring charge liquidation of the university brands children s shoe business  sale of the mitre sports soccer business  and facility consolidation costs and permanent work force reductions 
restructuring provision liquidation of the greif companies men s tailored clothing business  and sale of the gco apparel corporation tailored clothing manufacturing business 
in connection with the restructuring  the company recorded a combined charge of million in the third quarter of fiscal  of which million the restructuring charge related to university brands and mitre and facility consolidation costs and permanent work force reductions and million the restructuring provision related to greif and gco apparel  which constituted the entire men s apparel segment of the company s business  and is therefore treated for financial reporting purposes as a provision for discontinued operations 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal the restructuring provision was positively adjusted by million  reducing the million provision for future losses of discontinued operations to million 
the adjustment reflected the favorable consequences of a transfer  not anticipated at the time the provision was recorded  of a licensing agreement for men s apparel to another manufacturer 
the transfer resulted in realization of inventory and accounts receivable balances on more favorable terms than anticipated  assumption of piece goods commitments by other manufacturers and cancellation of minimum royalty requirements under the transferred license 
in the first quarter of fiscal the company recorded an additional restructuring charge of million relating to the restructuring 
the additional restructuring charge reflected the lowering of anticipated proceeds from the sale of the mitre sports soccer business 
in addition  the restructuring provision was adjusted by an additional reversal of million 
the reversal reflected primarily an agreement during the quarter providing for the resolution of a long term lease liability on terms more favorable than were anticipated when the restructuring provision was established  better than anticipated realization of inventories and accounts receivable as the remaining greif inventory was liquidated in the first quarter of fiscal and lower than anticipated union pension liability  which the union pension fund determined and announced to the company during the quarter 
throughout the remainder of fiscal  the company recognized additional reductions to the restructuring charge and provision of million as actual events differed from the original estimates 
the transactions provided for in the restructuring were substantially complete as of january  and the company does not expect any material future adjustments arising from the completion of the restructuring 
the restructuring charge  as adjusted  provided for the elimination of jobs in footwear operations to be divested or consolidated and in staff positions to be eliminated  of which jobs had been eliminated as of january  the divestiture of the university brands business was completed in february the operations of the greif companies have ceased  its inventories and equipment have been liquidated and its last major remaining long term lease liability was resolved in june the company s gco apparel corporation was sold in june the company s mitre sports soccer business was sold in august with cash proceeds to the company of approximately million  including repayment of intercompany balances

international trade developments manufacturers in china have become major suppliers to genesco and other footwear companies in the united states 
in fiscal the company expects to import approximately of purchases from china 
in addition to the products the company imports  many of the company s suppliers import a significant amount of their products from china 
the united states has threatened trade sanctions of up to billion if china does not do more to stop piracy and other intellectual property violations 
in addition  annual renewal of china s most favored nation trading status is also under review by the united states 
failure of the united states government to continue to grant most favored nation s treatment to china would raise duties and significantly increase the cost of footwear and other products imported from china into the united states 
it could also materially affect the company s ability to source those products from other countries  because the company would have to compete with other footwear companies  some of whom buy substantially greater quantities and have substantially greater resources  for productive capacity in other low labor cost countries 
while the company s divisions are developing contingency plans in case of negative developments in chinese sourcing  there can be no assurance that such developments would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business
