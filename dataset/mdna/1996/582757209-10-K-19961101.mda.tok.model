the major contributor to the company s record consolidated revenue level was the footwear unit which increased revenue by as a result of increased us government requirements  sales of combat boots to foreign governments and the acquisition of american west 
gross profit margins fell on a consolidated basis for fiscal compared to fiscal and were flat from fiscal to the bar code and office products units continued to experience downward trends in gross margins  and the footwear unit posted a increase to over fiscal and nearly matched the level recorded in fiscal the bar code unit continued to yield margin to competitive pricing pressure in as several major product lines experienced reductions in selling price levels 
the office products margins have continued to decrease as a result of increased service costs and higher costs associated with sales type leases and cost per copy rental programs 
gross margins for the footwear unit increased as a result of fixed overhead being spread over a larger production of military combat boots which was slightly offset by lower margins on the western and work boot product line

total revenues for fiscal were lower than those reported in fiscal which were higher than revenues 
several product lines were affected by significant competitive pressures on pricing during the year which resulted in lower revenues and gross margins for the business unit 
in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses increased over fiscal from higher health insurance costs  research and development expenditures and professional fees 
all of these factors were responsible for the decline in operating profits from fiscal office products mcrae graphics sells and services certain office equipment of two major lines of photocopier  facsimile  and digital printing equipment through nine offices in north carolina 
total revenues for fiscal were higher than in fiscal which was higher than the fiscal revenues 
revenues have continued to grow for five consecutive years 
mcrae graphics sells various equipment and supplies and services the equipment it sells 
gross margins decreased approximately two percentage points during fiscal this was primarily attributed to a decline in service margins 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to of revenues for fiscal because of higher administrative salaries  health care costs and depreciation expense on rental machines 
the higher cost of sales and selling and general and administrative expenses out paced the increase in revenues and resulted in a net operating loss for fiscal footwear mcrae footwear manufactures military combat  western and work boots 
military combat boots are manufactured primarily for the united states government government 
in an effort to offset losses of production caused by the defense department s overall reduction of combat boot orders in recent years  the company began producing boots for other markets in fiscal this segment is currently operating under the third and final year of a three year contract with the government 
a new contract covering a five year period is currently being negotiated 
the company believes that it is well positioned to successfully negotiate a new contract with the government  however  there can be no assurances that the terms of any such contract will be favorable to the company or that any such contract will be awarded 
in addition to producing combat boots for other markets  the company purchased american west trading company american west  a high quality  low cost producer of men s  women s and children s western and work boots  in april total revenues for the footwear segment increased to million  up over fiscal which had declined from fiscal combat boots accounted for of the revenues for the footwear segment while the western and work boot product line contributed in fiscal higher production levels of military combat boots  slightly offset by lower gross margins in the western and work boot product line  resulted in a positive increase in gross margin as a percentage of sales as fixed overhead was spread over an increased production level of military combat boots 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased over fiscal which was flat compared to fiscal the increase was largely attributable to the acquisition of the western and work boot operation 
other operations and inflation the printing unit s performance in fiscal was adversely affected by rising paper prices and scrap costs 
the primary cause of the large change in operating profit in the other category during fiscal was the recovery of a bad debt of approximately  in our financing and leasing unit 
inflation  in the opinion of management  has not been a significant factor in the company s operations for the last three fiscal years 
financial condition the company continues to have a strong balance sheet with a current ratio of over total assets grew approximately during fiscal  while stockholders equity grew over during the same period 
the expansion in operations for the footwear unit as a result of increased sales activity and the acquisition of american west contributed to the substantial increase in accounts receivable and inventory levels as compared to fiscal the increase in receivables is directly related to higher military combat boot sales coupled with a delay in collection of government receivables and timing of purchases by customers of the western and work boot product line 
the increase in inventory over last year is largely attributed to the buildup of western and work boot inventory to fill greater seasonal demands occurring during the fall and winter months of the year 
higher sales activity also prompted a slight upward adjustment in the allowance for bad debts

short term investments were liquidated resulting in a source of cash amounting to almost million

fixed assets increased by capital expenditures of approximately million as the company continued to add to and update its manufacturing machinery and equipment as well as its computer and support programs 
net cash provided by financing activities amounted to  new bank loans approximating million were negotiated to replace the debt assumed by the company in the purchase of american west 
the company paid dividends during the fiscal year which totaled  at august   the company had lines of credit with several banks totalling million  of which million was available to the company 
the company will continue to have cash requirements to support working and capital needs as well as debt payment and servicing 
to meet these cash requirements  the company intends to use internally generated funds and to borrow under its lines of credit  if necessary 
management believes that the cash generated from these sources will be adequate to meet the company s cash requirements during the next fiscal year
