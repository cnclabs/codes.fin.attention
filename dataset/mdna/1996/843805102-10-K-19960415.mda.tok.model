item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
overview 
this analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of southern security life should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and financial statements and notes to the financial statements included in this report 
in recent years the company has primarily issued one type of insurance product  universal life 
universal life provides insurance coverage with flexible premiums  within limits  which allow policyholders to accumulate cash values 
these accumulated cash values are credited with tax deferred interest  as adjusted by the company on a periodic basis 
deducted from these cash accumulations are administrative charges and mortality costs 
should a policy surrender in its early years  the company assesses a surrender fee against these same cash accumulations  based on issue age of the insured  smoker verses non smoker status  sex of the insured and the duration of the policy at the time of surrender 
pursuant to the accounting methods prescribed by financial accounting standards no 
fas  premiums received from policyholders on universal life products are credited to policy holder account balances  a liability  rather than income 
revenues  described herein as premium  on such products result from the mortality and administrative fees charged to policyholder balances in addition to surrender charges assessed at the time of surrender as explained above 
such costs of insurance  expense charges  and surrender fees are recognized as revenue as earned 
in addition  the company has adopted policy designs with the characteristic of having higher expense charges during the first policy year than in renewal years 
under fas  the excess of these charges are reported as unearned revenue 
the unearned revenue is then amortized into income over the life of the policy using the same assumptions and factors used to amortize capitalized acquisition costs 
interest credited to policyholder balances is shown as a part of benefit expenses 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  certain costs directly associated with the issuance of new policies are deferred and amortized over the lives of the policies 
these costs are defined as deferred policy acquisition costs and are shown in the asset section of the balance sheet of the company 
capitalized acquisition costs are amortized over the life of the business at a constant rate  based on the present value of the estimated gross profits expected to be realized over the life of the business 
fas requires that estimates of expected gross profits used as a basis for amortization be evaluated on a regular basis  and the total amortization to date be adjusted as a charge or credit to earnings if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates be revised 
thus  variations in the amortization of the deferred policy acquisition costs  from one period to the next  are a normal aspect of universal life insurance business and are generally attributed to the recognition of current and emerging experience in accordance with the principles of fas annuity products  of which the company currently has a minor amount  are recorded in similar fashion to universal life products 
considerations received by the company are credited to the annuity account balances which are shown as a liability in the balance sheet 
interest is credited to these accounts as well and shown as an expense of the company 
income is derived primarily from surrender charges on this type product 
an additional source of income to the company is investment revenue 
the company invests those funds deposited by policy holders of universal life and annuity products in debt and equity securities in order to earn interest and dividend income  a portion of which is credited back to the policyholders 
interest rates and maturities of the company s investment portfolio play a part in determining the interest rates credited to policyholders 
product profitability is affected by several different factors  such as mortality experience actual versus expected  interest rate spreads excess interest earned over interest credited to policyholders and controlling policy acquisition costs and other costs of operation 
the results of any one reporting period may be significantly affected by the level of death claims or other policyholder benefits incurred due to the company s relatively small size

net income results of operations 
new business written was  and million dollars in face value for  and  respectively 
new business written declined again in  as it did in  as the company continued its efforts to license new products and develop marketing distribution channels 
delays in obtaining admission of new products into various states has cost the company anticipated sales as well as agency forces over the past two years 
yet  by year end  some key marketing strategies were accomplished which have already begun to show a positive impact on production figures 
one such marketing strategy included the hiring of a new marketing director 
the new director  a seasoned insurance executive  brings to the company a product expertise and market expansion knowledge that will enable the company to accomplish its long term goals 
another key development was the creation of a lead generation program designed to provide new business leads in order to increase production 
premium income for was recorded at million  for at million and for at million 
this decline of in premium income can be attributed somewhat to the decline in the company s insurance in force and therefore an associated reduction in administrative and mortality fees 
surrender fees  another component of premium income  decreased by approximately from due to the fact that the book of business is aging and as it does so  surrender fees decrease 
in comparison with is much the same scenario as versus  however surrender fees were greater 
the new business decline of the past several years is having an impact on premium income 
the balance of the decline in premium income for and is attributable to the amortization and unlocking for current and future experience of unearned premium into income 
unearned premium essentially represents the excess first year charges in the policy 
with the advice and assistance of our consulting actuaries  each year the company reviews its current experience rates for mortality  credited interest rates  lapse rates  surrender fees and the like  and adjusts its amortization of deferred acquisition costs and unearned premium to the appropriate levels for both the current experience and anticipated future experience 
this is an on going refinement process 
increased investment in debt securities coupled with reduced expenses for student loan processing accounted for the increase in investment income for the year the company s investment in student loans is declining each year in response to increased costs designated by the government 
this trend is expected to continue and show significant change in annuity  death and other benefits decreased only slightly in from the results of death claims continued their trend of less than anticipated by the actuarial assumptions but were up slightly from  however  well below the figures 
a significant increase or decrease in death claims in any given year can have a marked impact on the results of operations in a small company 
surrender benefits were responsible for the slight improvement in this expense area 
while death claims were up slightly  surrender benefits declined enough to compensate for the increase 
the amount of the amortization of deferred acquisition costs continued its trend  declining by approximately 
the amortization of deferred acquisition costs is a continuous refinement process which relates to current experience in connection with revenues  mortality gains and losses  credited interest rate spreads  expense charges and surrender charges 
the change in the rate of amortization of both deferred acquisition costs and unearned premium liabilities is due to unlocking for current and future experience based on the results of the changing experience encountered as required under fas operating expenses for the company were million 
million and million for  and  respectively 
in  the company settled litigation with a former employee and experienced the related costs of legal representation 
after due consideration of the litigation delays the company might encounter on the collection of these expenses from its insurers  the costs of settlement and associated legal expenses  estimated at between  and  were expensed in that same year 
while the company reasonably expects to receive reimbursement through its insurance carriers for a substantial portion of these expenses  estimated at  it has prudently established a receivable for only  due to litigation delays in receiving said funds 
these expenses account for the decrease in current year operating expenses in comparison with those of it can also be noted that the expenses have returned to their previous level of reinsurance premiums ceded for and were  and  respectively 
policy benefits were reduced due to reinsurance  and  for and respectively 
reinsurance commissions amounted to  for and  for in addition  under the terms of the company s treaty with mega life formerly united group insurance company expenses of  were transferred to the reinsurer for and  for the company has also amortized the remaining  of deferred gain  under the aforementioned treaty  against deferred acquisition costs for see note 
income  before income taxes  in was  compared to  in and  in the income declined from prior year as a result of reduced premium income and level amortization expenses 
income suffered from higher death benefit expenses than the following two years 
liquidity and capital resources 
effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
sfas required that investments in all debt securities and those equity securities with readily determinable market values be classified into one of three categories held to maturity  trading or available for sale 
classification of investments is based upon management s current intent 
debt securities which management has a positive intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as securities held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost 
unrealized holding gains and losses on securities held to maturity  are not reflected in the financial statements 
debt and equity securities that are purchased for short term resale are classified as trading securities 
trading securities are carried at market value  with unrealized holding gains and losses included in earnings 
all other debt and equity securities not included in the above two categories are classified as securities available for sale 
securities available for sale are carried at market value  with unrealized holding gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity  net of tax and a valuation allowance against deferred acquisition costs 
adoption of this statement had no effect on the income of the company 
the company s insurance operations have historically provided adequate positive cash flow enabling the company to continue to meet operational needs as well as increase its investment grade securities to provide ample protection for policyholders 
student loans are a service the company makes available to the public as well as an investment 
while the company anticipates the seasonal demand for student loan funds and the subsequent sale of such loans to the student loan marketing association slma  there are times when additional funds are required to meet demand for student loans until such time as the sale thereof to slma can be completed 
in the company renewed its  line of credit with slma in order to meet these seasonal borrowing requirements 
the company made several draws against this line of credit throughout the seasonal period 
the company anticipates continued borrowings to be made through this line of credit with slma to the extent that student loan borrowings are required for slma offers a more competitive rate of interest on such borrowings than the company has been able to obtain through banks 
the following table displays pertinent information regarding the short term borrowings of the company as they relate to these credit lines slma slma sun trust slma balance year end    weighted avg 
interest year end maximum balance     average balance     weighted rate the company continued its association with university support services throughout  for the purpose of making more student loan funds available without increased costs to the company 
this association aided in keeping borrowings to a minimum for the company is currently in negotiations with another firm that would accomplish this same benefit to a greater extent 
except as otherwise provided herein  management believes that cash flow levels in future periods will be such that the company will be able to continue its prior growth patterns in writing life insurance policies  fund federally insured student loans and meet normal operating expenses 
the national association of insurance commissioners  in order to enhance the regulation of insurer solvency  issued a model law to implement risk based capital rbc requirements for life insurance companies  which are designed to assess capital adequacy 
pursuant to the model law  insurers having less statutory surplus than required by the rbc calculation will be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action 
while florida  the company s state of domicile  had yet to adopt the provisions of the rbc model law  the company is monitoring their rbc results in anticipation of future adoption 
at december   the company had statutory surplus well in excess of any rbc action level requirements 
the company recently executed a lease with a new tenant for the remaining square foot of rentable space on the first floor of the office building 
the contract includes the build out of the space to serve as office space 
the company has agreed to cover expenditures of the build out and the lessee has agreed to rent the space for a five year period 
the build out is estimated to have a cost of  the company  at this time  has no other material commitments for capital expenditures through the balance of this year
