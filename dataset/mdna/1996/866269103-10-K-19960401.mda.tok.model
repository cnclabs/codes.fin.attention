item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital resources and liquidity the registrant has invested in eleven tax exempt fmbs issued by various state or local governments or their agencies or authorities 
the fmbs are secured by participating first mortgage loans on multi family residential apartment projects 
at the beginning of the year  the registrant had cash and temporary investments of approximately  after payment of distributions and receipt of the net cash flow from operations  registrant ended the year with approximately  in cash and temporary investments 
the fourth quarter distribution of approximately  
per buc was paid to buc holders in february from current and previously undistributed cash flow from operations 
the registrant anticipates funding future cash distributions from current and previously undistributed cash flow from operations 
interest payments from fmbs are anticipated to provide sufficient liquidity to meet the operating expenditures of the registrant in future years and to fund distributions 
the registrant s loan payable has a variable interest rate  therefore  future levels of interest expense will fluctuate in correlation to movements in the day commercial paper interest rate 
as discussed in more detail in note to the financial statements in item  the registrant received net proceeds of approximately  in april in connection with an affiliate s sale of its ownership interest in the mansion to an unrelated third party 
the registrant has recorded the proceeds as deferred income 
management is not aware of any trends or events  commitments or uncertainties that will impact liquidity in a material way except as discussed here and in the financial statements in item the registrant s investments in mortgage loans are secured by a registrant interest in properties which are diversified by location so that if one area of the country is experiencing downturns in the economy  the remaining properties may be experiencing upswings 
result of operations fmbs and promissory notes are carried at cost less a valuation allowance where appropriate 
the registrant periodically evaluates the collectibility of both interest and principal of these investments to determine whether they are impaired 
an fmb or promissory note is considered to be impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the registrant will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms 
when an fmb or promissory note is considered to be impaired  the amount of the valuation allowance is determined by discounting the expected cash flows at the fmb s or promissory note s original effective interest rate  or  for practical purposes  at the estimated fair value of the collateral 
the process of determining impairment and the appropriate level of the valuation allowance is based upon projections of future economic events such as property occupancy rates  rental rates  operating cost inflation and market capitalization rates 
the cash flows used in this process are based on good faith estimates and assumptions developed by the registrant s management 
changes in market conditions and circumstances may occur which would cause these estimates and assumptions to change  which  in turn  could cause additional impairments 
thus  the registrant may be required to provide for additional valuation allowances  which could be material  in subsequent years 
the registrant s accounting policy for its fmbs and promissory notes conforms to statement of financial accounting standards and  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan the statements  which the registrant adopted in adoption of the statements did not have a material impact on the registrant s financial position or results of operations 
prior to the adoption of the statements  the registrant classified fmbs as assets held for sale when the original owner of the property and obligor of the fmb was replaced by an affiliate of the related general partner  who had not made an equity investment in the property 
because the registrant has not declared default on these fmbs and has no present intention to do so  they have been reclassified as fmbs for all periods presented  in accordance with the statements 
such fmbs were written down to the estimated fair value of the underlying properties at the time the original owners were replaced
