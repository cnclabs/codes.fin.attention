item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company set record levels for sales and orders for fiscal  and earnings increased in fiscal as compared with the prior year 
in fiscal  the company doubled its investments in product development mainly for the gallium arsenide monolithic integrated circuits gaas mmics and ceramic products aimed at the wireless communication markets 
at the same time  the company increased unit output by due to improved manufacturing efficiencies and added capacity for both semiconductor and ceramic products 
these actions have positioned the company to support higher demands particularly for wireless communication products 
unfortunately  an overall softness in the north american cellular market and the delayed roll out of the personal communications system pcs is expected to result in lower demand throughout the summer of with lower volumes  higher fixed costs associated with the company maintaining its readiness to serve the wireless market and a decision to exit certain non strategic business areas  the company expects to report a net loss for the first quarter of fiscal as demand returns and increases  the company anticipates improved results for the remainder of fiscal results of operations sales for fiscal increased to million as compared to sales of million in fiscal and million for fiscal the increases in fiscal and sales were attributable to increased unit volume in the company s gaas mmic  ceramic and discrete semiconductor product lines primarily into the commercial wireless markets 
these unit volume increases were partially offset by a decline in average selling prices because of the company s shift to high volume business in the commercial sector 
as the company continues to gain strength in the commercial wireless markets  direct sales to the united states defense department continue to decline  with of fiscal sales related to military subcontracts for ultimate sale to the defense department or foreign governments  compared with in fiscal  and in fiscal the decrease in defense related business for fiscal and was attributable to the decline in traditional military products and reduced funding for certain weapons systems 
gross profit increased in fiscal to million  or of sales  as compared to million  or of sales in fiscal and million or of sales in fiscal the improvement in gross profit for fiscal and was the result of a increased sales volumes b higher capacity utilization at the company s woburn  massachusetts manufacturing facility and c greater efficiencies due to the consolidation of facilities that took place in fiscal when the company moved several product lines to its woburn  massachusetts plant 
the company recorded lower margins in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of flattening sales and rising costs due to added manufacturing capacity 
in anticipation of the demand for wireless communication products increasing over the second half of fiscal  the company has decided to maintain its current levels of manufacturing capacity for mmics  discrete semiconductors and ceramic products which will result in lower gross margins in the first quarter of fiscal  but with steady improvement expected as the volumes increase with higher demand 
research and development expenses increased in fiscal to million  or of sales  from million  or of sales in fiscal research and development expenses increased in fiscal from million or of sales in fiscal these increases in research and development reflect the continued investment by the company in the gaas mmic and ceramic product lines 
the company will continue to invest in product and process development in order to address the demands of its targeted wireless markets 
customer sponsored r d decreased million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal as customer sponsored r d continues to decrease  the company sponsored r d will continue to increase since the company is strongly committed to developing new wireless communications products 
however  whenever possible the company will try to fund its r d through collaborative developmental contracts 
selling and administrative expenses increased to million  or of sales  in fiscal whereas selling and administrative expenses decreased to million  or of sales  in fiscal from million  or of sales in fiscal the increase in selling and administrative expenses for fiscal is primarily a result of training and other costs related to the early phases of implementation of a new manufacturing and management information system  as well as increased commissions related to higher sales volume 
the decrease in selling and administrative expenses for fiscal was primarily attributable to a reduction in administrative personnel completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal  as a result of the consolidation of the company s operations in methuen  massachusetts into its operations in woburn  massachusetts 
interest expense remained relatively constant for fiscal and in fiscal interest expense decreased thousand from fiscal since certain financing costs associated with the methuen facility were charged to the repositioning cost in the fourth quarter of fiscal interest income increased thousand largely due to interest earned on funds received from a stock offering that was completed during the third quarter of fiscal the company successfully completed a secondary public offering which raised million  net of expenses  on the sale of  shares of common stock 
the proceeds are being used to fund further capital expansion  to retire certain bank debt  for working capital  potential acquisitions and general corporate purposes 
interest income remained constant for fiscal and other expense and income increased by thousand in fiscal compared with fiscal and decreased thousand in fiscal in relation to fiscal these fluctuations are due to currency gains and losses 
the company s effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to the current combined federal  state and foreign rate of approximately 
this rate differed from statutory rates primarily as a result of the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
at march   the company had available net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million which will expire commencing in net income for fiscal was million or per share versus million or per share for fiscal and a net loss of million or per share for fiscal the first quarter of fiscal included a repositioning credit of thousand or per share which resulted from the reversal of certain accruals for estimated carrying costs as a result of an earlier than expected disposition of the methuen  massachusetts facility 
per share data reflects the stock offering completed in the third quarter of fiscal the company expects a loss of approximately to per share for the first quarter of fiscal  as a result of i lower shipments in the quarter  ii the decision to maintain production capacity  iii the decision to continue product development work  and iv the exiting of certain non strategic areas 
the company has previously announced that it anticipates break even to positive results in the second quarter of fiscal  and if an anticipated resurgence of demand for the company s products sold into the wireless communications industry leads to increased orders beginning in the second quarter of fiscal  the company expects to report improved operating results and a return to profitability in the second half of fiscal financial position at march   working capital totaled million and included million in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  compared with million of working capital at the end of fiscal cash increased million during fiscal mainly as a result of proceeds received from the secondary public offering 
during fiscal  the company had million of capital expenditures primarily for the expansion of its ceramic manufacturing facilities  further automation of its semiconductor wafer fab operations  and various information technology equipment 
the company remains strongly committed to adding the required capacity needed to service the wireless markets as the demand begins to return 
in addition to the proceeds received from the offering  the company also has two lines of credit available for a total of million 
the company entered into a million working capital line of credit agreement which expires on august   and a million equipment line of credit which expires on july  at expiration both lines are expected to be renewed 
at march  there was million outstanding under the equipment line of credit 
in july  the company sold its methuen  massachusetts plant and received net proceeds of million 
in connection with the sale  using the net proceeds and million borrowed under its line of credit  the company retired million of related debt 
with the funds raised from the secondary offering and the lines of credit available  the company believes it has adequate funds to support its current operating needs 
the company will continue to evaluate other available financing such as low interest financing for the capital expansion of its ceramic manufacturing business and any other sources that may become available 
other matters during the third quarter  the company successfully completed a surveillance audit to renew its iso certification of its woburn  massachusetts facility 
inflation did not have a significant impact upon the results of operations of the company during the three year period ended march  in march  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of fas  which becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after december  this standard establishes accounting standards for the impairment of long lived assets  certain identifiable intangibles  and goodwill related to those assets to be held and used for long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be disposed of 
the company will adopt fas for fiscal and believes that adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on the financial condition or operating results of the company 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas  which becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under fas  companies can elect to adopt the new accounting method  which accounts for stock based compensation based on the fair value at the date of grant 
companies that choose not to adopt fas would continue to follow the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
in addition  those companies who choose not to adopt the new accounting method prescribed by fas would be required to provide proforma disclosures of net income and earnings per share  assuming fas had been adopted 
the company currently does not expect to adopt the new accounting method prescribed by fas forward looking statements except for the historical information contained herein  the discussion in this report contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of the company s plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
the cautionary statements made in this report should be read as being applicable to all forward looking statements wherever they appear in this report 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences are discussed below 
current market softness as the company has previously announced  overall softness in the north american cellular market and the delayed roll out of the personal communications system pcs  have significantly impacted the company s orders and shipments 
although the company believes that the market softness will abate  especially as orders for new pcs equipment increase  there can be no assurance as to when  if at all  these events will occur  how significant they will be to the industry and the company in particular  and whether or not the company will receive new orders in any such demand run up that will be consistent with its past market share 
substantial delay in the new demand  or failure of the company to receive the anticipated share of such new orders would have a material and adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
repositioning of company s business the company has in recent years worked to reposition its business  away from military sales and into commercial sales 
military sales have been declining  and the company anticipates that revenues from military sales will continue to decline 
there can be no assurance that the company s effort to reposition itself as a supplier of advanced products to wireless communications markets will be successful 
if revenues from commercial wireless customers do not grow  or grow less rapidly than expected  or if in the near term revenues from military sales decline more rapidly than expected  the company s operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
variability of operating results the company s quarterly and annual results have varied in the past and may vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors  including cancellation or delay of customer orders  market acceptance of the company s or its customers products  variations in manufacturing yields  timing of announcement and introduction of new products by the company and its competitors  changes in revenue and product mix  competition  changes in manufacturing capacity and variations in the utilization of this capacity  variations in average selling prices  variations in operating expenses  the long sales cycles associated with the company s customer specific products  the timing and level of product and process development costs  cyclicality of the semiconductor and ceramic industries  the timing and level of nonrecurring engineering revenues and expenses relating to customer specific products  and changes in inventory levels 
any unfavorable changes in these or other factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company s expense levels are based  in part  on its expectations as to future revenue  and certain of these expenses  particularly those relating to the company s capital equipment and manufacturing overhead  are relatively fixed in nature 
for example  the company is investing in gaas  silicon and ceramic process development technology in anticipation of increased revenues from related markets 
as a result of the relatively fixed nature of certain of the company s expenses  operating results would be disproportionately and adversely affected by a reduction in revenue 
the company expects that its operating results will continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of these and other factors 
customer concentration historically  a significant portion of the company s sales in each fiscal period has been concentrated among a limited number of customers 
this trend is accelerating  and in recent periods sales to the company s major customers as a percentage of total sales have increased 
the company does not generally enter into long term contracts with its customers  and when it does  the contract is generally terminable for the convenience of the customer 
if the company were to lose one of these major customers  or if orders by a major customer otherwise were to decrease  or if major orders were to be cancelled or deferred  the company s business  financial condition and operating results would be materially and adversely affected 
product and process development and technological change the wireless communications industry is characterized by frequent new product introductions  evolving industry standards and rapid changes in product and process technologies 
the company believes that its future success will depend upon its ability to continue to improve its product and process technologies and develop new technologies 
the success of the company s new products is dependent upon many factors  including factors that are outside the company s control 
these factors include the company s ability to anticipate market requirements in its product development efforts  market acceptance and continued commercial success of oem products for which the company s products have been designed  the ability to adapt to technological changes and to support established and emerging industry standards  successful and timely completion of product development and commercialization  achievement of acceptable wafer fabrication and ceramic process yields and manufacturing yields generally  and the ability to offer new products at competitive prices 
no assurance can be given that the company s product and process development efforts will be successful or that the company s new products or those of its customers will achieve or sustain market acceptance 
in addition  the wireless communications industry is characterized by end user demands for increased functionality at ever lower prices 
to remain competitive  the company must obtain yield and productivity improvements and cost reductions and must introduce new products which incorporate advanced features and which therefore can be sold at higher average selling prices 
to the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner or the company s or its customers products do not achieve market acceptance  the company s operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
manufacturing risks the manufacturing processes for the company s products  in particular its gaas mmics  are highly complex and precise  requiring advanced and costly equipment  and are being modified continually in an effort to improve yields and product performance 
the company expects that its customers will continue to establish demanding specifications for quality  performance and reliability that must be met by the company s products 
the company has limited experience in high volume manufacturing of certain gaas mmics and ceramic products for the high volume commercial applications on which its current product development  sales and marketing efforts are focused 
the company has encountered and may in the future encounter development and manufacturing delays  has from time to time failed and may in the future fail to meet its customers contractual specifications  and one or more of its products have contained and may in the future contain undetected defects or failures when first introduced or after commencement of commercial shipments 
if such delays  defects or failures occur  the company could experience lost revenue  resulting from delays in or cancellations or rescheduling of orders or shipments  product returns or discounts  or could experience increased costs  including product or process redesign  warranty expense or costs associated with customer support  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
there can be no assurance that the company will not in the future experience significant product quality  performance or reliability problems 
cyclicality of the company s markets while the semiconductor and ceramic markets have in the past experienced overall growth  they have historically been characterized by wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
from time to time  these industries have also experienced significant downturns  often in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles and declines in general economic conditions 
these downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand  production overcapacity and subsequent accelerated price erosion  and in some cases have lasted for extended periods of time 
the company s business is currently  and may in the future be  materially and adversely affected by industry wide fluctuations 
the company s continued success will depend in large part on the continued growth of the wireless communications industry 
no assurance can be given that the company will not be adversely affected in the future by cyclical conditions in the wireless communications industry 
competition wireless communications markets are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change  rapid product obsolescence and price erosion 
currently  the company competes primarily with manufacturers of high performance gaas mmics  discrete silicon semiconductors  ceramic filters and other ceramic products and microwave and millimeter wave components and subsystems 
the company expects increased competition both from existing competitors and others which may enter these markets  as well as potential future competition from companies which may offer new or emerging technologies  such as surface acoustic wave filters  silicon germanium and other silicon technologies 
in addition  many of the company s customers  particularly its largest customers  have or could acquire the capability to develop or manufacture products competitive with those that have been or maybe developed or manufactured by the company 
the company s future operating results may depend in part upon the extent to which these customers elect to purchase from outside sources rather than develop and manufacture their own systems 
a number of the company s competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  manufacturing and marketing resources than the company 
the ability of the company to compete successfully depends in part upon the ability of the company to develop price competitive  high quality solutions for oems and the extent to which customers select the company s products over competitors products for their systems 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future
