item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview since its organization in june  the company has been engaged principally in oil exploration in the great basin and range of nevada  an area that management believes is one of the most promising unexplored onshore domestic areas with potential for the discovery of major oil reserves 
in continuing to advance this exploration  the company s strategy is to generate exploration prospects with the most recent generally available scientific techniques  expand and improve the company s strategic land position  and establish arrangements with other oil exploration firms active in nevada to obtain additional scientific data  leases  and funding 
until  the company had only limited revenue  consisting of modest amounts of interest income earned on net proceeds from the sale of securities and revenue from producing properties  including properties held in texas from which the company received no material operating income after april in september the texas properties were sold to an unrelated third party operator 
in and  the company acquired twelve previously producing wells in eagle springs  including three acquired with barrett  and has since reworked and returned to production eleven of such wells  drilled a new water injection well in the eagle springs field  and has undertaken a multi well drilling program with barrett  as discussed below  in order to supplement the company s other limited production from its tomera ranch and north willow creek oil discoveries 
in august  the company entered into an agreement with barrett under which barrett provided  of  in well costs to earn a interest in the company s eagle springs producing properties and obtained the right to participate in one specified company exploration project on agreed terms 
pursuant to such agreement  the company and barrett acquired an additional eagle springs lease on approximately acres with three previously producing wells  which have since been reworked  and a shut in water injection well and have drilled a total of eight new wells in eagle springs  all of which are now in regular continuous production 
the company plans to continue additional drilling in this field to place into production undeveloped reserves and to drill in additional locations to test horizons that are productive in existing wells 
to date  the company has funded its exploration program principally from the sale of its equity securities 
the company also benefits from capital provided by oil industry participants for drilling and other exploration of certain oil prospects through joint arrangements typical in the oil industry 
plan of operation eagle springs drilling the company s strategy in acquiring the eagle springs property was to increase revenue by returning existing wells to production and to identify additional drilling locations to evaluate the horizons that are productive in existing wells 
management believes that drilling in the eagle springs field involves lower risk as compared to the company s other exploration drilling in prospect areas with less drilling history and less available exploration data 
the company has completed substantial work at eagle springs since its acquisition in july  reworking eleven wells  including the three wells acquired and reworked with barrett  to return them to production subject to interruptions from time to time until further well treatment and other surface facilities could be completed  drilling a water injection well  and drilling and placing into production eight additional eagle springs wells with barrett 
such activities include substantially renovating and upgrading surface facilities such as tank batteries  piping  separators  and other equipment so that field production facilities currently have excess capacity available to service new wells 
production from the eagle springs field is sold under the company s existing sales agreement and trucking arrangement to a refinery in salt lake city  utah 
of the new wells drilled on the eagle springs field  the company and barrett drilled three new producing wells in the eagle springs field in late and early in january  after the first three new eagle springs wells were placed into production  barrett elected to continue to participate in eagle springs  thereby earning a working interest in the company s eagle springs project  subject to the right to make individual elections respecting participating in future wells proposed by the company 
in mid  the company and barrett commenced a multi well drilling program on the proved nonproducing and proved undeveloped acreage in the field  to test at additional locations horizons that are productive in existing wells  and to increase proved reserves 
the company and barrett are proceeding to prioritize the proved undeveloped locations as identified in the reserve report and anticipate those eight locations as additional wells to be drilled during and barrett or foreland may elect  on a well by well basis  to participate in the wells planned for and but has no obligation to participate in any well 
based on its current drilling experience  the company estimates that the eagle springs drilling will cost approximately  per gross well for a dry hole or  for a completed gross well  including related geophysical and geological evaluations  for estimated costs attributable to the company s share of the eagle springs drilling of from approximately  to  per well for a dry hole and a producing well  respectively 
therefore  the company s share of the cost of the eight wells planned for and is estimated at approximately from  if all wells were dry holes  to  if all wells were completed for production 
general  administrative  and property maintenance the company requires cash for general and administrative expenses  for maintaining its properties  and for other items that are required in order for the company to continue  as distinguished from costs to advance its ongoing exploration program in nevada 
based on estimates of the production rates and operating conditions during the first quarter of  management believes that the company currently requires cash from external sources of approximately  to  per quarter for ongoing fixed and recurring operating costs which include general and administrative expenses  exploration consisting of an allocation of employee salaries and other overhead to the exploration function  and interest on outstanding debt  and approximately  to meet annual lease rental and other cost on its properties  which exceeds the company s net revenue from oil production 
based on current production  after giving effect to reworking several existing eagles springs wells  to be accomplished during the second quarter of  the company estimates its second quarter oil revenue to be approximately  based on current oil prices  with average daily production net to the company s interest of approximately barrels of oil  giving effect to the fact that at any time some wells many not be in production 
related production costs are estimated at approximately  yielding estimated net production revenue of approximately  for the second quarter of see item properties production and sale of oil 
therefore  the company estimates that it will be able to meet fixed and recurring operating costs for the second quarter of and thereafter 
however  there can be no assurance that the reworking of the eagle springs wells will result in increased production  that production levels will not decline  or that current prices for oil will not decline 
any improved operating margins resulting from increased production and reduced operating expenses as weather improves or price increases would benefit the company 
there can be no assurance that eagle springs development will result in material additional production or that the company will be able to obtain funds from other sources  in which case the company would be required to implement cost cutting measures and curtail drilling and most other exploration activity in order to continue 
exploration program the company requires substantial amounts of capital to advance its oil exploration program  relying on funding provided through joint exploration arrangements with other firms and utilizing its own capital provided principally through the sale of securities and existing and anticipated revenues from the development of eagle springs 
during  the company drilled the fourth and fifth exploratory tests under its agreement with enserch berry  both plugged and abandoned  incurring approximately  in drilling costs for the hot creek wash test in antelope valley and approximately  in drilling costs for the eldorado federal exploratory well drilled in little smoky valley 
the company anticipates that it will continue its exploration program with up to six additional exploration tests during  depending on the availability of required funds 
the test in the pinon prospect in pine valley  with estimated total dry hole costs of  is planned for  subject to available funding 
the company would be required to bear of such costs 
this would be the sixth well of the six well exploration program with enserch berry 
the company and barrett may also drill one test at north humboldt at an estimated dry hole cost of approximately  for a net cost to the company of  under their joint exploration agreement 
the company has reentered an existing hole drilled by another operator in the deadman creek area of toano draw on lands covered by an exploration agreement with p p 
the hole was originally drilled in the mid s and encountered favorable oil shows but was not completed for production 
the company is evaluating the hole to determine if it could be economically completed using modern completion techniques 
if joint exploration arrangements can be reached with other industry participants and the company s share of required funds is available  the company may also attempt to drill a dixie flats test in huntington valley at an estimated dry hole cost of  in addition  the company will be drilling the pine creek prospect in pine valley at a net estimated cost to the company of  and the ghost ranch prospect in railroad valley at a net estimated cost to the company of  the company also plans to continue its geophysical and geological data gathering and evaluation  property acquisition  and prospect evaluation  depending on the availability of funds  this includes continuing to process seismic data available to the company  completing d seismic studies of specific drilling prospects  and integrating seismic  gravity  and drilling data 
in addition the company may undertake joint geophysical data acquisition with others under arrangements in which each participant bears a share of the cost for specific surveys 
the company will continue its lease acquisition efforts in specific prospect areas and  as it generates drilling proposals  seek funding for drilling 
typically  new prospects that are generated are not drilled for several months or until the next drilling season or later 
the company initiated its exploration program with the net proceeds of  received from the private placement of units consisting of preferred stock and common stock purchase warrants completed in september and  received from the exercise of c warrants in october 
in order to pay other liabilities incurred in connection with drilling  during february and march  the company sold shares of preferred stock for net proceeds of  the company is currently seeking and is dependent on the receipt of funds from the sale of debt or equity financing to fund its portion of the cost of the eagle springs drilling program and further exploration drilling  but there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining such additional financing 
in seeking financing for proposed data gathering  land acquisition  or drilling or other exploration of specific prospect areas  the company typically investigates both oil industry funding sources and the availability of capital through the sale of securities 
in considering participation from industry sources  the company assesses whether the potential industry participant can provide scientific data and lease or other exploration rights in the prospect area as well as required funding as compared to the dilution that may result to the interest of the company by sharing in any reserves that may be discovered 
in analyzing the availability of capital from the sale of securities  the company considers conditions in the capital markets generally  the anticipated marketability of company securities  and the dilution that may result to existing shareholders 
in selecting between available financing alternatives  management seeks the source that management believes will result in lesser dilution and greater economic return to its shareholders 
liquidity and capital resources previous periods historically the company has obtained cash required for its other requirements from the sale of its equity securities 
the company s operations provided cash of  in when the company reported a net loss of  which included  in expenses due to abandonments and impairments  and  for depreciation  depletion  and amortization 
as of december   the company s accumulated deficit was  operations used  of cash in  which included  in expenses due to abandonments and impairments   for the loss on the sale of the company s texas oil and gas properties  and  for depreciation  depletion  and amortization 
during investing activities used net cash of  principally due to  in additions to oil and gas properties 
in investing activities used net cash of  principally due to additions to oil and gas properties resulting from the acquisition of additional lease rights from kanowa in the eagle springs field and additional eagle springs drilling  including the completion of a water injection well 
as noted above  cash required for both operating and investing activities was provided from financing activities during each of the past two fiscal years 
in  financing activities provided  provided by  from the issuance of equity securities 
in  financing activities provided  consisting primarily of a net of  from the issuance of equity securities and  in proceeds from new borrowing 
in addition to the above  the company s oil and gas exploration and production activities were also advanced by approximately  and  provided during and  respectively  by others under industry sharing arrangements related to specific drilling or other exploration 
current position future requirements the company is dependent on the receipt of additional funds to repay certain drilling expenditures incurred during the fourth quarter of and to date during as well as to meet ongoing general and administrative expenses and other operating costs 
the company requires cash for certain fixed and recurring operating costs in order for the company to continue  as distinguished from drilling and related costs to advance its ongoing exploration program in nevada that are either expensed as dry hole and abandonment costs in the case of an unsuccessful test or added to oil and gas properties if a producing well results 
for example  during the fourth fiscal quarter ended december   the company required cash for production operations  exploration  consisting of an allocation of employee salaries and other overhead to the exploration function  general and administrative  and interest on outstanding debt requiring cash payment  for an aggregate of approximately  most interest revenue and most interest expense relate to indebtedness to and from former and present officers and directors that do not require current cash expenditures 
during the fourth quarter  the company received revenue of  from oil sales at an average of approximately barrels per day  resulting in a cash shortfall for the quarter of  average daily net fourth quarter production increased to approximately barrels per day  which is lower than anticipated 
due to delays in the eagle springs drilling and completion program  only three new eagle springs wells were placed in production during the fourth quarter 
such wells were not placed into production until the latter part of the fourth quarter 
one additional well was placed in production in january management believes that the company s cash requirements  excluding drilling and related costs to advance the company s ongoing development and exploration program in nevada  will be met when certain eagle springs wells are recompleted in the second quarter of  but there can be no assurance that production will increase in sufficient quantities or that oil prices will not fluctuate significantly 
to the extent that net production to the company does not increase to a level sufficient to cover shortages of cash required for operations  the company will be dependent on the sale of additional debt or equity securities  the exercise of outstanding options or warrants  or financing from other sources 
there can be no assurance that eagle springs development will sustain sufficient additional production for the company to be able to meet its requirements for recurring operating expenses or that the company will be able to obtain funds from other sources  in which case the company would be required to implement cost cutting measures and curtail drilling and most other exploration activity in order to continue 
between march and september  the company sold  units consisting of preferred stock and common stock purchase warrants at for net proceeds of  during september  the company amended the exercise price of the c warrants from per share to per share  and extended the expiration date from september  to october  the company received  in october   in cash and notes receivable for the exercise of  c warrants 
in order to pay other liabilities incurred in connection with drilling  during february and march  the company sold shares of preferred stock for net proceeds of  and is investigating the possibility of selling additional equity securities 
the company is current seeking and is dependent on the receipt of funds from the sale of debt or equity financing to fund its portion of the cost of the eagle springs drilling program and further exploration drilling  but there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining such additional financing 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful with any of its current financing activities on april   the company borrowed  from an unrelated third party  collateralized by oil and gas production and other personal property of the company  to provide interim financing to advance the company s drilling program in its eagle springs field and to pay ongoing general and administrative expenses 
the loan bears interest at per annum  payable quarterly  and was originally due on april  in connection with this loan  the company granted the lender options to purchase  shares of common stock at per share at any time prior to the earlier of april   or days subsequent to the repayment of the loan 
in may  the company negotiated the extension of the due date of this loan to april  in connection with extending the loan payment date to april   the company reduced the exercise price of the options previously granted to and granted a new option to purchase  shares at through the earlier of april   or days subsequent to the repayment of the loan 
the company is currently investigating financing alternatives to repay the loan the auditors report on the financial statements of the company as of december   contains a modification regarding the ability of the company to continue as a going concern because of its limited working capital and revenue and continuing losses from operations 
as of december   the company had negative working capital of approximately  and had ongoing cash requirements for fixed and recurring operating expenses requiring cash expenditures  but excluding drilling and related expenditures  of approximately  greater than production revenue for the fourth quarter of the company will continue to seek cash proceeds from the exercise of outstanding options and warrants and from the sale of additional common stock  preferred stock  warrants  debt or other securities 
in addition  the company is exploring other sources of financing for ongoing costs as well as expanded activities and the possible purchase of additional production to increase the company s production to increase the company s financial security and stability as it continues its exploration 
the purchase of producing properties would require substantial amounts of additional debt and equity financing 
there can be no assurance that the company can negotiate the acquisition of any properties or obtain any financing that may be required for such purchase 
as in the past  the company will rely largely on the sale of additional securities to meet its capital requirements 
results of operations and for the year ended december   oil sales increased  to  when compared to the fiscal year ended december   with sales from the eagle springs field increasing  to  during such period 
the revenues from the company s other interests increased  operating overhead revenue and well service revenue aggregately increased a net of  when compared to  consisting of an increase of  in operating overhead revenue in due to the increased number of eagle springs wells drilled and placed into production during and a decrease of  in well service income during as compared to as a result of reduced fees earned for water disposal services 
the increase of other income of  in as compared to was primarily a result of increases in value of new and used well equipment inventories used in the company s drilling program 
interest income increased  in to   of such increase attributable to interest earned on stock subscriptions receivable  while interest earned from excess cash investments decreased  in when compared to the company s oil and gas production expenses for decreased  to  when compared to  attributable principally to reduction in operating expenses of the eagle springs field of  in when compared to such expenses in these reductions were a result of increased efficiency and excess field operations capacity 
during  oil and gas exploration costs decreased  components of oil and gas exploration costs in were eagle springs d seismic program expenses of  and gravity and other surveys costing  for dixie flats   for the north humboldt prospect  and  for toano draw 
the company did not incur any similar expenses during dry hole  abandonment  and impairment costs aggregately decreased  when compared to such expenses during individually  dry hole expense decreased  when compared to dry hole costs for were primarily from the eldorado federal of  the hot creek wash of  and costs for the trout creek well of  impairment and abandonment of leases decreased  when compared to major cost components during were abandonment of expired undeveloped leasehold costs of  impairment of undeveloped leases of  and impairment of well equipment inventory of  while the north willow creek nos 
and and the tomera ranch wells were impaired in at  general and administrative expenses decreased  in to  much of the reduction in general and administrative expenses were principally due to one time charges in that were not repeated in of  for relocation cost  and  as a reduction in securities offering costs that were required to be expensed because of delays in consummating the company s financing  although in the company did incur an increase of  in expenses related to financial public relations  information dissemination within the investment community which management expects to decline and a decrease in certain salaries and benefits of  when compared to depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses increased  when compared to such expenses attributable to the eagle springs field increased  primarily due to new wells being brought into production with high initial production rates  while such expenses attributable to the company s remaining properties increased  in when compared to interest expense increased  in to  primarily due to a full year of interest and amortization of loan fees associated with the company s  note payable  as opposed to nine months of interest and amortization of the same loan fees during and for the year ended december   oil sales increased  to  as compared to  with the eagle springs field contributing approximately  of revenues as production from the company s other fields declined 
well service revenue decreased  due primarily to reduced water disposal fees 
other income was approximately  higher in as compared to as a result of increased drilling and lease overhead fees charged to participants in company drilling programs and lease operations 
the company s oil and gas production expenses for increased  to  when compared to  attributable principally to  in operating costs at eagle springs  which was placed into production in early and included one time repair  maintenance and clean up costs of  during  oil and gas exploration costs increased  reflecting the company s continuing active exploration program 
major components of exploration costs were an eagle spring d seismic program expense of  and gravity and other seismic surveys of  for dixie flats   for north humboldt  and  for toano draw areas in nevada contributed to the increase in exploration costs for dry hole and abandonment cost increased by  due to the company s exploration activities as well as specific abandonment expenses relating to wells initially drilled in previous years 
dry hole  abandonment  and impairment costs included charges to expense of  for the indian springs no 
a test that was plugged and abandoned   for the cedar creek no 
dry hole   for the willow springs no 
dry hole  and  for the trout creek no 
dry hole 
impairment expense increased due to the charge to expense of  for the north willow creek no 
test drilled in august that management concluded could not be placed into production 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of when it was determined that no reserves could be attributed to the north willow creek no 
or the tomera ranch wells  their undepleted capitalized costs of  and  respectively  were charged to impairment expense 
general and administrative expenses for increased approximately  as compared to the major contributors to this increase were  associated with expenses written off for a canceled securities offering and the  cost on the guarantee of the selling price of n 
thomas steele s residence 
the company recognized a  loss during related to the disposal of its remaining interest in certain texas producing properties 
in  the company reported a noncash compensation expense of  related to the grant of below market options 
the eagle springs field added approximately  of depletion expense in  while depletion attributable to the north willow creek and the tomera ranch wells decreased  and  respectively  as compared to interest expense declined  primarily due to the conversion of promissory notes to stock in september as compared to interest expense on the long term debt incurred in accounting treatment of certain capitalized costs included in oil and gas properties on the company s balance sheets are costs of wells in progress 
such costs are capitalized until a decision is made to plug and abandon or  if the well is still being evaluated  until one year after reaching total depth  at which time such costs are charged to expense  even though the well may subsequently be placed into production 
the company also charges to expense the amount by which the total capitalized cost of proved oil and gas properties exceeds the total undiscounted net present value of related reserves 
as a result of the foregoing policies  the company expects that from time to time capitalized costs will be charged to expense based on management s evaluation of specific wells or properties or the disposition  through sales or conveyances of fractional interests in connection with industry sharing arrangements  of property interests for consideration in amounts that have the effect of reducing the company s total undiscounted net present value of oil and gas reserves below the total capitalized cost of proved oil and gas properties 
as part of the company s evaluation of its oil and gas reserves in connection with the preparation of the company s annual financial statements  the company completes an engineering evaluation of its properties based on current engineering information  oil and gas prices  and production costs  which may result in material changes in the total undiscounted net present value of the company s oil and gas reserves 
the company would be required to charge to expense the amount by which the total capitalized cost of proved oil and gas properties exceeds the amount of such undiscounted net present value of the company s oil and gas reserves

operating costs operating costs relating to nevada production from time to time include costs associated with various production testing measures on the tomera ranch and north willow creek wells and fixed costs allocable to a number of wells  including the eagle springs wells that were returned to production during and the new producing wells jointly drilled with barrett 
production costs relating to the eagle springs field have historically been higher than the normal industry standard per barrel of oil presently being produced due to start up costs associated with the upgrading and expanding the production facility to facilitate additional production  and repairs to equipment that had been shut down without maintenance for over a year 
during the first three months of  the company incurred additional costs of operating in winter due to energy costs for heating the oil  and operating the wells using propane as its main fuel to operate the pumping units 
in early  the company completed field upgrades including a boiler system to heat the oil  a trace water disposal system to return produced water to the field water injection well as opposed to trucking the water to the disposal well 
overall operating costs are a combination of costs associated with each well and costs associated with operation of the entire field 
as additional wells are added to the production system  the field operating costs will be spread among additional wells  lowering the impact of such costs on each well and per barrel produced 
because of the foregoing  the company expects that production costs per barrel will continue to be high unless and until the amount of production increases sufficiently to obtain economies of scale and dilute the impact of high fixed operating costs 
in addition  operating costs may continue to vary materially due to the costs of ongoing treatment or reworking of existing wells and other factors 
inflation the company s activities have not been  and in the near term are not expected to be  materially affected by inflation or changing prices in general 
the company s oil exploration and production activities are generally affected by prevailing sales prices for oil  however  and material price declines may make wells with low rates of production uneconomical to operate 
because of the size of potential discoveries in nevada  the company does not expect that short term declines in oil prices would materially affect its exploration activities 
accounting policy changes the company s accounting policy is to compute depreciation and depletion expense for its proved oil and gas properties on a well by well basis  and to assess impairment on a company wide basis by comparing aggregate net capitalized costs related to proved properties to the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows related to such properties 
at december   the company recorded impairment to leases of undeveloped drilling properties of  and to well equipment inventory of  no impairment was necessary for net aggregate capitalized costs of proved properties 
in march  the financial accounting standards board issued a new statement titled accounting for impairment of long lived assets 
this new standard is effective for years beginning after december   and would change the company s method of determining impairment of proved oil and gas properties 
although the company has not performed a detailed analysis of the impact of the new standard on the company s financial statements  management estimates the application of the new standard would have increased the provision for impairment of oil and gas properties by approximately  as of december  the company will adopt the new standard in the first quarter of fiscal in october  the financial accounting standards board issued a new statement titled accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
the new statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas encourages  but does not require  companies to recognize compensation expense for grants of stock  stock options  and other equity instruments to employees based on fair value 
companies that do not adopt the fair value accounting rules must disclose the impact of adopting the new method in the notes to the financial statements 
transactions in equity instruments with non employees for goods or services must be accounted for on the fair value method 
for transactions with employees  the company currently does not intend to adopt the fair value accounting under sfas  and will be subject only to the related disclosure requirements 
the company does not anticipate that any other currently adopted changes in accounting policies will have a material positive or negative effect on the company
