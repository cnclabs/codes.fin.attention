this is the fifth consecutive year that total cumulative enrollment at the devry institutes has increased from the previous year and the largest rise in any of those years 
at kgsm  cumulative total student enrollment for the five terms of fiscal grew by from the increase in enrollments was due to elevated enrollments at the pomona and long beach  california  centers  both of which opened last year  the opening of a center in tysons corner  virginia washington  dc area  and continued growth in enrollments at the previously existing centers 
tuition increases have historically been implemented by the devry institutes effective with the spring term and effective with the fall term at kgsm 
tuition rates rose approximately at devry  which is just slightly below the rate of last year s increase and below the average rate of tuition increases at other colleges and universities 
tuition rates rose similarly at kgsm 
other revenues are attributable primarily to sales of books and supplies to students attending the company s educational programs 
interest income on short term investments of cash balances in excess of those needed for daily operations declined slightly from last year  as the higher level of payments for taxes on income  payments and receivable increases associated with financial aid processing at the toronto area campuses and completion of the new devry institute campus in north brunswick  new jersey  reduced average investible balances during the year

tuition revenues in increased by  or from the rise is attributable to both higher student enrollment at devry and kgsm and to tuition increases implemented during the year 
cumulatively  total student enrollment at the devry institutes in the three semesters of fiscal increased by compared with fiscal this is the fourth consecutive year that total cumulative enrollment has grown from the previous year 
at kgsm  cumulative total student enrollment for the five terms of fiscal grew by from tuition increases have historically been implemented by the devry institutes in the spring term and at kgsm in the fall 
tuition rates grew by more than at devry  a slightly lower percentage increase than was implemented in tuition rates were increased similarly at kgsm 
historically  the company has been able to pass along inflationary cost increases through higher tuition 
other revenues are attributable primarily to sales of books and supplies to students attending the company s educational programs 
interest income on short term investments increased because of higher cash balances available for investment throughout most of the year and because of higher prevailing interest rates 
costs of educational services include the cost of faculty and related staff  which composed approximately of this expense category 
also included in this expense category are the costs of facilities  supplies  bookstore sales  other student education related support activities and tuition refunds 
the cost of educational services increased by from costs associated with rising student enrollment  such as additional faculty and higher wages and benefits  were largely responsible for the increase 
the company also continued its investment in growth with the opening of new devry institutes in long beach  california  and scarborough toronto  ontario  canada 
during the year  kgsm opened two new centers in california  operating in the devry institute campuses in these locations 
partially offsetting these cost increases was a reduction in depreciation expense on certain assets whose depreciable lives expired in the first quarter 
tuition refund and bad debt expenses also declined  reflecting educational program and student service quality initiatives that have favorably affected the pattern of student retention  reducing refund expense and uncollected account balances compared to prior periods 
student services and administrative expense includes the costs of new student recruiting  curriculum development and general administrative costs 
these expenses increased by from last year 
marketing costs grew at a somewhat faster rate than tuition revenue in support of the two new devry campuses and two kgsm centers that opened during for the year  new student enrollment at the devry institutes increased by from the company s earnings from operations  before interest expense and taxes on income  reached a record  for the year 
this represents an operating margin of  up from last year and the year before 
higher revenues  improved educational program success  producing greater student retention  and cost containment measures contributed to the improved margins even as expansion continued 
interest expense was reduced by  to  for the year 
the lower interest expense resulted from scheduled principal payments and voluntary prepayments of the company s funded debt 
in june  the company voluntarily prepaid all  of its senior subordinated notes  with a make whole premium payment of  included in interest expense in the consolidated statement of income 
in  total funded debt was reduced by  taxes on income were computed in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  which the company adopted in the effective tax rate of represents the combination of us federal and state and canadian income taxes on the company s operations 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary source of liquidity is the cash received from student payments for tuition  fees and books 
these payments include cash from student and family resources  student and family educational loans and other financial aid under various federal  state and provincial programs 
the pattern of cash receipts is somewhat seasonal throughout the year 
the level of accounts receivable from which cash payments are collected reaches a peak immediately after the billing of tuition  fees and books at the beginning of each devry institute semester in july  november and march 
collections of these receivables are heaviest at the start of each semester 
in the first two months of each semester  collections typically exceed payments for operating expenses applicable to that period 
accounts receivable reach their lowest level just prior to the start of the next semester  dropping to their lowest point in the year at the end of june 
the end of june corresponds to both the end of the spring semester and to the end of a financial aid year  at which time all financial aid for the previous months should have been disbursed to students accounts 
at june   net accounts receivable were  the increase in accounts receivable from last year results from the inclusion of a  receivable of refundable income tax and from higher revenues and number of students at the devry institutes and kgsm during the year 
the increase in receivables is also attributable  in part  to the tuition financing offered by devry canada to those students at the toronto area campuses who were affected by the temporary suspension of financial aid 
in conjunction with the conditional reinstatement of financial aid processing effective with the spring term  the company returned to the ontario ministry of education and training payments believed to have been inappropriately disbursed to students 
in addition  the company posted a letter of credit with the ministry as security against possible additional amounts that may have been inappropriately disbursed to students who incorrectly completed their financial aid applications 
the company estimates that historically nearly of the devry institutes tuition  bookstore and fee revenues are derived from some form of government provided financial aid to its students 
these financial aid and assistance programs  in which most of the company s students participate  are subject to political and budgetary considerations 
there is no assurance that such funding will be maintained at current levels 
extensive and complex regulations in the us and canada govern all of the government financial assistance programs in which the company s students participate 
the company s administration of these programs is periodically reviewed by various regulatory agencies 
any regulatory violation could be the basis for the initiation of a suspension  limitation or termination proceeding against the company 
under the terms of the company s participation in governmental financial aid programs  certain cash received from the us department of education is maintained in restricted bank accounts 
this cash becomes available for general use by the company only after student loans and grants have been credited to the accounts of students and the cash is transferred to an unrestricted operating cash account 
the introduction of electronic fund transfers for student loans and the direct loan program from the department of education have generally accelerated the receipt and processing of these payments by the devry institutes and kgsm  contributing to the company s liquidity 
cash payments for income taxes no longer benefit from the net operating loss carryovers  which were fully utilized by the end of the first quarter of fiscal while the increased payment of income taxes will affect the company s liquidity  the company believes that its present cash resources and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements 
in july  the company entered into an out of court settlement agreement with the internal revenue service irs relative to the statutory notice of deficiency issued by the irs against the company for tax years through the claimed deficiencies related to the amortization of intangible assets purchased during the acquisition of the devry institutes in all of these issues have been resolved as a result of the settlement 
the settlement amount  which is expected to be paid in the first quarter of fiscal  is immaterial to the company s financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
cash generated from operations in was  approximately the same as in each of the last two years 
the generation and use of cash during the year reflects the seasonal operating patterns discussed above 
during some periods just prior to the start of a semester  cash balances may be supplemented by temporary borrowings under the company s revolving line of credit 
cash generated from operations each year has been sufficient to meet all of the company s operating needs and capital investment needs while reducing debt on a regular basis 
capital expenditures were primarily for expansion and facility improvement  replacement and upgrading of school laboratories and for teaching and administrative equipment 
capital expenditures in were a record  this spending reflects the company s continued investment in improved quality of educational offerings  facilities and programs and in additional expenditures connected with the opening of new devry institutes in scarborough  ontario  canada  and long beach  california  last year  and the completion of construction of a devry institute campus in north brunswick  new jersey  to replace the present leased facility in woodbridge  new jersey 
for  total capital spending for existing operations is planned at somewhat lower levels than during the past two years 
cash generated from operations and existing cash resources have been sufficient to meet capital requirements in the past and are anticipated to be sufficient to cover expansion plans in the future 
in june  the company and its banks completed a renegotiation of its term loan agreement 
the  bank facility remains an unsecured revolving line of credit with a higher borrowing limit  longer term and lower interest rates effective upon the achievement of certain financial ratios 
the revolving loan facility allows the company to take maximum advantage of its seasonally heavy cash flows to reduce debt while also providing flexibility in providing funds for expansion as needed 
at june   approximately  of the revolving line had been utilized in the form of borrowings and letters of credit 
the terms of this loan agreement reflect the company s strong financial position 
in june  the company acquired certain tangible assets and tradenames of the becker cpa review for  in cash and acquired copyrights  other intellectual property and publicity rights of the becker cpa review for  funds for the acquisition were provided by borrowings under the company s newly renegotiated revolving line of credit 
the company s bank borrowings are at a floating interest rate subject to adjustment at varying intervals at the company s option 
at the present time  the company does not have an interest rate swap or other forms of protection against increases in the floating rate but has fixed the interval of interest rate adjustment on approximately one third of its year end borrowings for a one year period 
the company periodically evaluates its need for additional protection in light of projected interest expense and borrowing levels 
the company believes that current balances of unrestricted cash  cash generated from operations and  if needed  the revolving loan facility will be sufficient to fund its operations for the foreseeable future
