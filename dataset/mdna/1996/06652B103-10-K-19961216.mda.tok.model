results of operations are also dependent on the dollar volume and asset quality of the company s loans and investments 
the results of the company s operations  like those of other financial institution holding companies  are affected by the company s asset and liability management policies  as well as factors beyond the company s control  such as general economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government 
lending activities are affected by the demand for mortgage financing and other types of loans  which is in turn affected by the interest rates at which such financing may be offered and other factors affecting the supply of housing and the availability of funds 
deposit flows and costs of funds are influenced by yields available on competing investments and by general market rates of interest

in this regard the company acquired million as part of the suncoast acquisition subsequent to year end

there were no significant gains or losses from the sale of assets in non interest expenses

in fiscal  the company recorded an additional provision on tax certificates previously purchased  which have not been redeemed and on which the company elected not to seek tax deeds 
income tax provision 
the income tax provision was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the difference primarily results in the difference in income before income taxes 
the effective tax rate was in and in preferred stock dividends

of this amount the company had at september  million in arm s tied to the th district federal home loan bank cost of funds index cofi 
cofi is a lagging index in that it does not change as quickly as market rates 
credit quality 
at september  non performing assets totaled million as compared to million and million at september  and  respectively 
expressed as a percentage of total assets  non performing assets declined to as of september  as compared to as of september  the declines in fiscal and fiscal were due to asset growth 
prior to  the company did not experience significant loan losses 
however  beginning late in  the company began to charge off loans  particularly in southern california where real estate values declined 
real estate values in southern california had declined because of i a slowing in the economy due to plant closings and layoffs in certain industries  ii natural disasters in the area  and iii an over valuation of the real estate market  in general  prior to the decline 
while real estate values in southern california stabilized during  the company believes that real estate values there have declined sufficiently since for there to be a continuing risk that borrowers faced with home mortgage payments based on values would default on their home mortgages 
from late through september  the company recorded a total of million in charge offs for residential loans secured by property in southern california 
of these southern california charge offs  million or an unusually high charge off rate were for loans purchased from a single seller 
as a result  the company instituted legal action against the seller for breach of warranty to recover the company s losses 
in october  this legal action was settled  which resulted in a recovery of million 
taking into account this million recovery  the company recorded net charge offs of million for the period from late through september   of which million or were for residential loans secured by real properties in southern california 
beginning in fiscal  management began to reduce the percentage of new loans acquired in california and ceased acquiring all but de minimis amounts of such loans in april as of september  the company had million of residential loans in california which constituted of its assets 
this compares to million  or of its assets as of september   and million or as of september  effective in fiscal  after taking into account the improved economic conditions in southern california  management has discontinued this policy and may purchase additional recently originated residential loans secured by property located in california 
the allowance for loan losses was million  million  and million at september    and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans increased to at fiscal year end  as compared to at fiscal year end  and 
at fiscal year end the increase in non performing assets to million as of september  from million as of september  was due to increases in non performing loans of million and non accrual tax certificates of  partially offset by a decrease in reo of  the increase in non accrual tax certificates was due primarily to certificates purchased in which were not redeemed and on which the company determined not to apply for tax deeds 
reo declined from million as of september  to  as of september  the decrease in reo was due to sales of properties in fiscal with net book values totaling million  partially offset by new additions to reo of million during the year 
as a percentage of non performing loans  the allowance for loan losses increased from at september   to at september  and at september  at september   million  or  of the company s non performing loans were secured by southern california properties as compared to million or  as of september  this level of southern california non performing loans reflected the longer time period required for foreclosures to be completed on california properties  as compared to that for foreclosures in other states 
effective october   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan as amended by sfas no 
accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures sfas no 

there was no impact on the consolidated statement of operations upon implementation due to the composition of the company s loan portfolio primarily residential or collateral dependent loans and the company s policy for establishing the allowance for loan losses 
the only impact to the consolidated statement of financial condition and to non performing assets was to reclassify three loans totaling  previously classified as in substance foreclosures in real estate owned to non accrual loans 
these loans were reclassified because the company did not have possession of the collateral which  under sfas no 
is required for a loan to be classified as real estate owned 
sfas no 
does not apply to large groups of smaller balance homogenous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment 
loans collectively reviewed by the company for impairment include all residential and consumer loans that are past due not more than days 
all other loans are reviewed based on specific criteria such as delinquency or other factors that may come to the attention of management 
the company s impaired loans within the scope of sfas no 
include all non performing loans 
the company s process for evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loans losses has three basic elements first is the identification of impaired loans  second is the establishment of an appropriate loan loss allowance once individual specific impaired loans are identified  and third is a methodology for establishing loans losses based on the inherent risk in the remainder of the loan portfolio  past loan loss experience  specific loans which could have loss potential  geographic and industry concentration  delinquency trends  economic conditions  the views of its regulators  and other relevant factors 
the identification of impaired loans is achieved mainly through individual reviews of all loans or more days past due 
loss allowances are established for specifically identified impaired loans based on the fair value of the underlying collateral in accordance with sfas no 
impairment losses are included in the allowance for loan losses through a charge to the provision for loan losses 
adjustments to impairment losses resulting from changes in the fair value of an impaired loan s collateral are included in the provision for loan losses 
upon disposition of an impaired loan any related valuation allowance is removed from the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is adjusted by additions charged to operations as a provision for loan losses and by loan recoveries  with actual losses charged as reductions to the allowance 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate given the strength of the company s collateral position and the attention given to loan review and classifications 
there can be no assurance that additional provisions for loan losses will not be required in future periods

mortgage backed securities 
the company s held to maturity mortgage backed securities portfolio decreased million  or  to million at september  from million at september   primarily as a result of the company s reclassifying million of held to maturity mortgage backed securities to available for sale in accordance with a guide to implementation of statement on accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities issued by the financial accounting standards board which permitted a one time reclassification 
the reclassified securities had a market value of  in excess of their book value at the time of the transfer 
the company s available for sale mortgage backed securities portfolio increased million to million as of september  from million as of september  million of the increase was due to the reclassification from held to maturity discussed above  million of the increase was due to securities acquired with the bank of florida  and the remainder of the increase was due to purchases made during the fiscal year

liquidity and capital resources the company s most significant sources of funds are deposits  federal home loan bank fhlb advances  amortization and pre payment of mortgage loans and securities  maturities of investment securities and other short term investments  and earnings and funds provided from operations 
while fhlb advances  scheduled mortgage loan repayments and securities repayments are relatively predicable sources of funds  deposit flows and prepayments on loans and mortgage backed securities are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the company manages the pricing of its deposits to maintain a desired balance 
in addition  the company invests excess funds in federal funds and other short term interest earning assets which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements 
the bank is required under applicable federal regulations to maintain specified levels of liquid investments in cash  united states government securities and other qualifying investments 
regulations currently in effect require the bank to maintain liquid assets of not less than of its net withdrawable accounts plus short term borrowings  of which short term liquid assets must consist of not less than

the company s primary use of funds is to purchase or originate loans and to purchase mortgage backed and investment securities 
in fiscal   and  loans increased million  million  and million  respectively  and the company purchased million  million  and million  respectively  of mortgage backed and investment securities 
in addition  in  the company sold branches having million of deposits 
funding for the above came primarily from increases in deposits of million in  increases in fhlb advances of million in and increases in both deposits and fhlb advances of million and million  respectively in federal savings banks such as bankunited  fsb the bank are also required to maintain capital at levels specified by applicable minimum capital ratios 
for a detailed discussion of these requirements  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at september   the bank was in compliance with all capital requirements and met the definition of a well capitalized institution under applicable federal regulations 
the company is exploring several alternative public and or private financings that would provide the bank with a significant increase in liquidity and tier capital to permit additional growth 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurements of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
savings institutions have asset and liability structures that are essentially monetary in nature  and their general and administrative costs constitute relatively small percentages of total expenses 
thus  increases in the general price levels for goods and services have a relatively minor effect on the total expenses of the company 
interest rates have a more significant impact on the company s financial performance than the effect of general inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or change in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services  although periods of increased inflation may accompany a rising interest rate environment
