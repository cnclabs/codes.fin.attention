item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for the years ended december   and the company derives or has derived income from three principal areas of business net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income the company receives on interest bearing loans and investments and the interest expense it pays on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings  the origination and sale of sba loans  and servicing fee income which results from the ongoing servicing of loans sold by the company and other loans pursuant to purchased servicing rights 
net income for the year ended december  declined  from million during to million 
while the company was able to generate a increase in net interest income  net income was adversely affected by a increase in operating costs which included start up costs on four branches opened during  costs associated with the termination of the company s mortgage banking operations  the costs to shut down one of the company s two branches located in south lake tahoe  california and the costs associated with the company s director s retirement plan 
additionally  during  the company altered its strategy with respect to the sale of sba loans 
rather than continuing to sell the guaranteed portion of the sba portfolio  the company retained both the guaranteed and unguaranteed portions in its portfolio 
during the company plans to securitize and sell portions of its unguaranteed sba loans 
the first such securitization is expected to be completed during the second quarter of the following table summarizes the operating results for the years ended december    and amounts in thousands except percentage amounts december  over over amount percentage amount percentage total interest income      total interest expense      net interest income      provision for possible loan and lease losses   net interest income after provision for possible loan and lease losses      total other operating income

net interest income 
net interest income is influenced by a number of factors such as the volume and distribution of interest earning assets  the rate charged on loans for interest and fees  the rate earned on investments and federal funds sold and the rate paid for deposits and other liabilities 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  a summary of the changes in interest income and interest expense resulting from changes in volume and from changes in rates 
income from tax exempt securities has not been presented on a tax equivalent basis as it is not significant 
for purposes of this table  the change not solely attributable to volume or rate has been allocated to change due to volume and change due to rate in proportion to the relationship of absolute dollar amounts in thousands of the change in each 
over over volume rate total volume rate total increase decrease in interest income loans     mutual funds taxable securities tax exempt securities federal funds sold other deposits total      increase decrease in interest expense deposits savings deposits transaction accounts time deposits    total    other borrowings convertible debentures total      increase in net interest income     as disclosed in the foregoing table  the company s net interest income in and increased over preceding years 
in both and volume increases were related to an increase in the asset size of the company 
during and  total daily average assets increased by and  respectively 
during these same periods  the volume component of the increase in net interest income was and  respectively 
for the rate of increase in the volume component of the increase in net interest income was lower than the increase in average daily assets due both to the fact that the percentage of average non interest bearing deposits decreased to from during and additionally due to the increase in other interest bearing liabilities related to the issuance of the debentures 
during the rate of increase in the volume component of the increase in net interest income exceeded the increase in average daily assets  primarily as a result of an increase in the percentage of average interest earning assets to average total assets from in to during this increase in average interest earning assets was partially offset by a decrease in average non interest bearing deposits to 
because the company funded more of its growth between and by the use of interest bearing deposits versus non interest bearing demand deposits  the ratio of non interest bearing deposits to total deposits declined 
in and  largely because of the success of the company in attracting non interest bearing deposits  this declining trend was reversed 
during and escalating in  the company again found itself in the position of funding much of its growth through the use of interest bearing deposits 
the company charges interest rates and fees in accordance with general economic conditions  capital and liquidity constraints  and desired net interest margin levels 
approximately of the company s loan portfolio consists of variable rate loans tied to the prime rate for leading west coast us banks 
the prime interest rate is influenced by forces outside the company s control 
because the company has less variable rate deposits than variable rate loans  the company would expect to incur a reduction in its net interest margin when interest rates fall  and when interest rates rise  the reverse would be expected to apply 
during the first quarter of the company moved to mitigate the effect of the change in the prime rate on its net interest income by entering into a three year million notional amount interest rate swap agreement with a major bank the bank 
under this agreement the bank pays a fixed rate of and receives from the company the prime rate 
if prime increases by  the company would pay the bank thousand on an annual basis 
conversely  if prime decreases by  the bank would pay the company thousand on an annual basis 
at the current prime rate of  the company will pay the bank thousand annually 
any payments made or received by the company under the terms of the agreement are more than offset by the corresponding increase or decrease in interest on its variable rate loans 
this transaction has a similar effect to that of converting of the company s variable rate loans to a fixed rate 
the average prime rate for leading banks and as used by the company prime rate for was compared to in this increase equates to a price variance in of million compared to an actual price variance of million 
the difference includes a decrease in the contribution of loan fees 
loan fees totaled million  million and million for the years ending december   and  respectively 
as a percentage of average loans  loan fees represented in  in and in in  the average prime rate was compared to for this increase equated to a positive price variance in of million compared to an actual positive price variance of thousand 
the difference is primarily related to a decrease in the contribution of loan fees 
starting in the fourth quarter of  and continuing into the company increased its investment in us government securities with a maturity of one year or less  while decreasing its holding of federal funds sold and mutual funds 
investment in these securities allowed the company to maintain its short term liquidity needs while earning interest at a rate greater than that for mutual funds or federal funds sold 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of  at the request of the csbd  truckee river bank raised its liquidity levels 
see liquidity 
these two actions were the primary factors associated with the increased volume variance in taxable securities during during the company increased its holdings of guaranteed portions of sba loans 
these loans  which can be sold in relatively short periods of time  provide an available source of liquidity 
the negative volume variance during in investment securities included the effect of funding the increase in guaranteed portions of sba loans both with an increase in time deposits and a decrease in taxable investment securities 
additionally during the positive spread between short term us government securities and federal funds sold narrowed considerably from prior year levels and the company therefore increased its reliance on federal funds sold for short term investment purposes 
the positive rate variances for and in taxable investment securities are consistent with market conditions 
the and rate variances in federal funds sold are primarily attributed to the interest rate changes during these periods 
the positive volume variance in resulted from the company s increase in liquid assets as its overall asset size increased  partially offset by the use of short term us government securities for this purpose 
the negative volume variance in includes the effect of the company s lowering its average investment in these funds while increasing its holdings of the guaranteed portion of sba loans 
mutual funds consist of investments in mutual funds whose assets are invested primarily in us government securities 
interest earned on mutual funds during and includes interest on both money market mutual funds and non money market mutual funds 
these funds have no stated maturity and can be bought or sold daily 
money market mutual funds in most cases earn interest at a higher rate than federal funds and  like federal funds  provide a daily source of liquidity 
during the company stopped using money market mutual funds as a source of liquidity 
mutual funds held at december  and during related to a non money market mutual fund held principally for investment purposes 
the price variances for both and reflect the general changes in interest rates during these periods and additionally during includes the effect of the discontinuance of the use of money market mutual funds in the company s investment portfolio 
other deposits consist primarily of the cash surrender value of officers life insurance policies 
interest earned on these policies is reduced by insurance costs incurred including  at the start of the second and third years for each policy  a surrender charge 
the modest volume increases in both and is due to retention of accrued interest in the policies 
because the company is now funding new employee participation with traditional pay as you go life insurance versus single premium life insurance  the volume increases in this asset will for the future be limited to retained income for existing single premium policies 
the rate variances in and are associated with market rate conditions 
the average balance and average rate paid on interest bearing transaction accounts during and are as follows year ended december  money money now market now market average balance     rate paid the company prices its interest bearing deposits consistent with market conditions 
during and the increase in the rate paid on its interest bearing transaction accounts has lagged behind the increase in the rate paid on the company s time deposits 
during the period the company s average time deposits increased by while its average money market accounts decreased by 
the company attributes the decrease in money market accounts both to a movement into higher interest rate time deposits and a movement into non bank money market accounts 
the company has relied on time deposits to fund most of its growth during during the company funded much of its growth through out of area cds and the company s million optional convertible subordinate debenture issuance during february the debentures 
the positive volume variance in time deposits for was primarily related to out of area cds 
these cds pay on average a greater rate than cds gathered through the company s branch network and are the key factor in the positive rate variance in this category 
the average rate paid on time deposits for was and for was 
the average rate paid on time deposits for increased to 
the increase in average time deposits during included both an increase in out of area cd s as well as retail cd s generated though the company s branch network 
out of area cd s at december  totaled million or of total deposits at this same date 
this represents an increase of million over the december  balance 
total cd s increased by million between december  and december  while average cd s increased by million during this same time period of which million represents out of area time deposits 
the positive rate variance for primarily relates to market conditions 
other borrowings consist primarily of federal funds purchased from other banks and  beginning in august  a thousand capital lease related to truckee river bank s gateway branch 
the negative rate variance experienced during includes the effect of capitalizing interest expense on the company s new sierra bank of nevada headquarters building currently being constructed in reno  nevada 
the variances in convertible debentures in and relate to the issuance of the debentures 
provision for possible loan and lease losses 
at december   approximately of the company s loan portfolio was held in loans collateralized primarily by real estate 
particular attention is given by the company to factors affecting the real estate markets 
the primary risk elements considered by management with respect to commercial real estate loans are changes in real estate values in the company s market area and general economic conditions 
the primary risks associated with other commercial loans are the financial condition of the borrower  general economic conditions in the company s market area  the sufficiency of collateral  the timeliness of payment  and interest rate fluctuations 
the primary risk elements considered by management with respect to other loans are the lack of timely payment and the value of collateral 
the company has a reporting system that monitors past due loans and management has adopted policies to preserve the company s position as a creditor 
the company maintains its allowance for possible loan and lease losses to provide for potential losses in its loan and lease portfolio 
the allowance is established through charges to earnings in the form of provision for possible loan and lease losses 
loan losses are charged to  and recoveries are credited to  the allowance for possible loan and lease losses 
the provision for possible loan and lease losses is determined after considering various factors such as loan loss experience  current economic conditions  maturity of the loan portfolio  size of the loan portfolio  industry concentrations  borrower credit history  the existing allowance for possible loan and lease losses  independent loan reviews  current charges and recoveries and the overall quality of the portfolio  as determined by management  regulatory agencies and independent credit review consultants retained by the company 
the provision for loan and lease losses for the year ended december  was million and net loan losses were thousand 
the end of period allowance for possible loan and lease losses was million or of loans and leases at december  during  the provision for possible loan and lease losses was thousand and net loan losses were thousand 
the allowance for possible loan and lease losses at december  totaled million  which represented of loans and leases outstanding 
excluding loans and portions of loans guaranteed by the federal government the allowance for possible loan and lease losses to total loans and leases was at december  and at december  in evaluating the company s loan loss reserve  management considers the credit risk in the various loan categories in its portfolio 
historically  most of the company s loan losses have been in its commercial lending portfolio  which includes local commercial loans and sba loans 
from inception of its sba lending program in through  the company sustained a relatively low level of losses from these loans 
losses  net of recoveries from the unguaranteed portion of sba loans retained in the company s loan portfolio  increased from thousand in to thousand in and decreased to thousand in and thousand in during net losses in the sba loan portfolio again increased to thousand 
the increase in   and over includes the effect of the maturing of the sba loan portfolio  the impact of the recession in california on borrowers and collateral values  and an increase in the size of the sba loan portfolio 
most of the company s other commercial loan losses have been for loans to businesses within the tahoe basin area and during  and  at the company s sierra bank of nevada subsidiary 
the company believes that it has taken steps to minimize its commercial loan losses  including centralization of lending approval and processing functions 
it is important for the company to maintain good relations with local business concerns and  to this end  it supports small local businesses with commercial loans 
to offset the added risk these loans may represent  the company typically charges a higher interest rate 
it also attempts to mitigate this risk through the loan review and approval process 
the following table sets forth the ratio of the allowance for possible loan and lease losses to nonperforming loans  the ratio of the allowance for possible loan and lease losses to total loans and the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans and leases as of the dates indicated 
year ended december  allowance for possible loan and lease losses to nonperforming loans 
allowance for possible loan and lease losses to total loans and leases nonperforming loans to total loans and leases the balance of nonperforming loans at december  include thousand in loans which were classified as in substance foreclosures at december  and million in loans and portions of loans guaranteed by the federal government 
excluding the guaranteed loans the allowance for possible loan and lease losses to nonperforming loans at december  increases to and nonperforming loans to total loans and leases drops to at this same date 
management considers the allowance of million at december   to be adequate as a reserve against foreseeable losses at that time 
total other operating income 
total other operating income for the year ended december  decreased by from the level 
for other operating income decreased by as compared to the following table summarizes the principal elements of total other operating income and discloses the increases decreases and percent of increases decreases for and amounts in thousands except percentage amounts increase decrease year ended december  over over amount percentage amount percentage service charges    securities losses gains  net gain on sale of sba loans 
   net loan servicing income    other income  service charges on deposit accounts increased by in over levels and in over levels 
the increase in includes the effect of an increase in average non interest bearing demand accounts and an increase in overdraft charges at sierra bank of nevada 
the increase in is primarily related to an increase in service charge rates at sierra bank of nevada 
the securities loss of thousand incurred in included a loss of thousand generated on the sale of thousand in mutual funds 
the company currently maintains in its investment portfolio mutual funds with a market value of million at december  and an original cost of million at this same date 
the company s current investment strategy does not include the holding of any additional investment in mutual funds 
legislative changes to the sba s loan program have lowered the gain recorded on the sale of sba loans by the company since august  these legislative changes include the reduction of the guaranteed percentage on loans made through the sba s preferred lender program to  reduction of the guaranteed percentage on loans made through the sba s certified lender program for loans over thousand with terms over ten years to  charging a fee equal to of any cash premiums in excess of of the guaranteed portion of the sold loan  and charging a fee of on the declining balance of loans sold into the secondary market after august  in december  the sba announced a temporary ruling that  beginning january   reduced the maximum loan that may be made under the sba a program to thousand 
additionally  effective may  a temporary ruling eliminated guarantees for refinanced debt with limited exceptions 
effective october   these temporary restrictions were removed 
the sba established new guarantee percentages of for loans of  or less and for all other loans  subject to a maximum guaranteed amount of  at the same time  the fee structure was revised to include a fee of per annum on the guaranteed portion of the outstanding balance of all loans approved on or after october  and to increase the guarantee fees charged borrowers 
sales of sba loans in   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
in the company altered its strategy with respect to the sale of sba loans 
rather than continuing to sell the guaranteed portion of the portfolio the company began to retain the guaranteed portion and plans to securitize and sell portions of unguaranteed sba loans 
the company estimates that the decline in sales between and would have been reduced by up to million if it had continued to sell the guaranteed portion of loans available for sale in  resulting in an estimated decline in sales of approximately million 
this decline includes the effect of temporary restrictions in the sba program 
in addition to the effect of the changes in the sba program  the company has in the last several years experienced increased competition in the sba market place 
to support its sba program the company has  since  relied in part on third party sba loan packagers 
in  approximately of the company s sba loans were generated by sba packagers 
this compares to during the packagers refer proposed sba loans to the company and provide certain services to the borrowers 
the packagers receive fees of a fixed amount from the borrowers  not exceeding limits prescribed by the sba  for preparing the sba loan application for the borrower 
they also receive a fee from the company for referring the loans 
these referral fee payments are included in the basis of loans and hence are not disclosed separately in the company s financial statements 
referral fees for   and totaled thousand  thousand  and thousand  respectively 
the reduction in packager volume in includes the loss of loan packages to competition based on price and underwriting factors and the focus by the company on its loan production offices as its primary source for generating new loans 
the reduction in the profit margins recorded on sba loan sales during and as compared to  includes the effect of the legislative changes made in and and  additionally  the company has experienced a market rate decrease in the premium paid as a percentage of loans sold 
to mitigate the effect of the changes in the sba program  the company has begun expanding its ability to generate an increased volume of sba loans through the establishment of new loan production offices in las vegas in december  in buena park in southern california in february and in fresno in december  and the addition of supporting personnel at other offices 
in addition the company has increased its efforts to diversify its lending activities and during has experienced significant gains in its construction  real estate and non sba commercial loan portfolios 
net loan servicing income increased by in as compared to for the year ended december  net loan servicing income increased by over levels 
net loan servicing income primarily consists of net servicing income on sba loans 
for the years ended december   and  net servicing income on sba loans totaled million  million and million  respectively 
servicing income on sba loans is reported net of the amortization of the excess servicing recorded on the sale of the same loans and the amortization of purchased servicing 
amortization is based on the expected average life of the related loans 
to date  actual prepayment experience reflects an average life in excess of the estimated life 
the increase in net servicing income on sba loans in and is primarily attributable to a change made by the company during the third quarter of related to its estimates of the prepayment speeds of the sba loans it services 
the effect of this change was to decrease amortization expense by approximately thousand in and thousand in servicing income exclusive of amortization  has declined in both years as a result of prepayments on existing loans plus a lowered level of sba sales and the change during late to the sale of loans for cash premiums 
during and into the company experienced a reduction in demand and a decline in profit margins in its mortgage banking operations

the change in processors and the related reduction in merchant accounts processed did not have a significant impact on the company s operations 
gain on sales of servicing rights on mortgage loans totaled thousand in  thousand in  and thousand in as a result of a termination of its mortgage banking operations  the company does not expect to generate gains from the sale of mortgage rights in the future 
additional significant sources of other income during include thousand related to the company s mortgage banking operations  thousand in rental income and thousand related to the sale of mutual funds and annuities through a third party marketer 
other operating expense 
the ratio of the company s other operating expenses to total assets is higher than for california banks in general because truckee river bank experiences higher operating expenses in its area of operation and employs additional personnel and utilizes additional facilities to manage its sba loan program and other services related to income activities which provide non interest income 
because of the extreme climatic conditions in much of the company s area of operations temperatures range from degrees to degrees and average snow levels exceed inches per year  local building codes require more expensive construction and the company experiences added costs of heating and snow removal which increase occupancy costs 
additionally  the company s supplies are generally more expensive than in larger metropolitan regions because of the added cost of freight 
the following table computes the ratio of major other operating expense categories to total average assets in thousands except for percentage amounts salaries occupancy and and other year ended average related equipment operating december  assets benefits expenses expenses excludes bonuses and contribution to ksop plan

included in the company s earnings are items which are exempt from federal and  in some cases  state income taxes 
these items include interest on certain loans and securities of state and county municipalities and the increase in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies on certain officers and directors 
liquidity liquidity refers to the company s ability to maintain adequate cash flows to fund operations and meet obligations and other commitments on a timely basis 
the company s liquidity management policies are structured so as to maximize the probability of funds being available to meet present and future financial obligations and to take advantage of business opportunities 
financial obligations arise from withdrawals of deposits  repayment on maturity of purchased funds  extensions of loans or other forms of credit  purchase of loans  payment of interest on deposits and borrowings  payment of operating expenses  and capital expenditures 
the company has various sources of liquidity 
increases in liquidity result from the maturity or sale of assets 
other than cash itself  short term investments like federal funds sold are the most liquid assets 
also  investment securities available for sale can be sold prior to maturity as part of prudent asset liability management in response to changes in interest rates and or prepayment risk as well as to meet liquidity needs 
additionally  liquidity is provided by loan repayments and by selling loans in the normal course of business 
at december   the company had million in guaranteed portions of sba loans available for sale  all of which could be sold within a short period of time compared to thousand of sba loans available for sale at december  in management s view  these loans represent an available source of liquidity 
deposits such as demand deposits  savings deposits and retail time deposits also provide a source of liquidity 
they tend to be stable sources of funds except that they are subject to seasonal fluctuations 
the company maintains an adequate level of cash and quasi cash items to meet its day to day needs and in addition  at december   the company had unsecured lines of credit totaling million with its correspondent banks 
during the company changed its strategy from the selling of the guaranteed portion of sba loans to retaining these portions of loans in its portfolio 
additionally the company announced that it intends to securitize and sell the unguaranteed portion of sba loans 
the company expects to complete the first such securitization during the second quarter of and expects to include up to million of the unguaranteed portion of sba loans in this securitization 
cash and due from banks  and federal funds sold as a percentage of total deposits were at december  as compared to at december  cash and due from banks totaled million at december  as compared to million at december   and federal funds sold totaled million at december  as compared to million at december  federal funds sold represent deposits which are predominantly uninsured 
the uninsured portion of these deposits together with the uninsured portion of cash deposited with other institutions totaled million as of december  in the event of a failure of any of these institutions  the company could lose all or part of its deposits 
to mitigate this risk  the company periodically examines the financial statements of these institutions and limits the amount it deposits with any single institution 
during the company chose to increase its investment in short term investment securities as an additional source of liquidity primarily as a result of the rate differential between these securities and federal funds sold 
however during the second half of  this differential became less significant and the company increased its holdings of federal funds sold while decreasing its investment securities classified as available for sale from million at december  to million on december  total loans increased from million at december  to million at december  the increase included million in sba loans  million in other commercial loans  million in real estate mortgage  million in real estate construction and million in leases 
individual and other loans decreased by million 
the increase in sba loans relates primarily to the company s decision to retain the guaranteed portion of sba loans 
the increase in other loans includes the company s program to expand and diversify its non sba lending activities 
the million increase in the loan portfolio since december  was primarily funded with increased time deposits 
deposits increased by million from million at december  to million at december  a decrease of million in interest bearing transaction accounts was offset by increases of million in non interest bearing demand accounts  million in time deposits  and million in savings accounts 
the company attributes the decrease in interest bearing transaction accounts primarily to two factors  the transfer of funds into higher yielding time certificates of deposit and the movement of funds into nonbank investment vehicles such as money market mutual funds 
the increase in time deposits includes an increase in out of area certificates of deposit of million 
to mitigate the effect of seasonality of its deposit sources which is due to the local tourist based economy  truckee river bank utilizes a money desk to solicit out of area cds to supplement its other deposit sources  to provide additional liquidity and additionally  to help support its loan growth 
these deposits  which at december   and totaled million  million and million  respectively  represented  and of total deposits as of december   and  respectively 
the increase in resulted from the csbd s requirement beginning in the fourth quarter of that truckee river bank raise its liquidity levels 
until december  the csbd did not include loans available for sale in its calculation of liquidity and therefore required a higher level of liquidity than is required by the fdic 
in the opinion of the company  because of seasonal conditions  these actions by the csbd caused truckee river bank to maintain levels of liquidity above those it might otherwise have maintained at certain peak times of the year and required the use of additional capital to support these increased levels 
to attract out of area cds  truckee river bank subscribes to a listing service which lists nationally the rate truckee river bank is prepared to pay 
customers call truckee river bank directly and place deposits 
additionally  beginning in truckee river bank began accepting referrals by brokers which can result in a slightly lower cost of those deposits 
at december  million of out of area cd s have been acquired through broker referrals 
to attract deposits  truckee river bank pays a market rate which may at times be above the comparable rate offered by truckee river bank to its local depositors 
the overhead costs associated with these out of area deposits is  however  lower than that for local deposits since local deposits require the use of bank branch facilities and hence the company believes the cost of these funds does not normally exceed the cost truckee river bank incurs to generate comparable deposits through its branch system 
while out of area deposits are acquired at an acceptable cost  truckee river bank monitors the level of these deposits because it is concerned that out of area deposits are more rate sensitive and volatile and that there may be some exposure for increased costs in the future should the supply tighten 
if interest rates rise rapidly  the company s reliance on these deposits could have an adverse impact on net interest income if the costs to retain those deposits rise faster than rates charged on interest earning assets 
in order to reduce the company s reliance on out of area time deposits and to generate additional deposits needed to fund loan growth  the company opened four new branches during on april   truckee river bank opened two new branches  one in auburn and a second branch in grass valley  california 
on july truckee river bank opened a regional facility in sacramento  california 
sierra bank of nevada opened a branch in carson city  nevada on september  total deposits raised from these branches at december  were million 
during december  the company sold million of commercial loans 
this sale had a positive effect both on the company s liquidity position and its risk based capital ratios 
capital resources at december   the company had shareholders equity of million as compared to million at december  the company s growth strategy is to expand its banking business  internally and through possible acquisitions 
such expansion is contingent on the retention of internally generated earnings  and the possible issuance of new equity or additional debt  as well as the satisfaction of other factors including obtaining regulatory approvals 
the company s strategy is to expand its banking business  through internal growth and acquisitions  both within its present service areas  particularly in the reno metropolitan market and adjacent areas  and the sacramento  auburn and grass valley locations 
it also plans to increase the volume and geographic scope of its sba lending to leverage on its sba loan origination and servicing capabilities 
in connection with this objective  the company established a loan production office in las vegas during december  in february in buena park in southern california  and during december in fresno  california 
the company plans to finance its expansion program through the retention of internally generated earnings  through the use of the proceeds of its million debt offering completed in february  and through the possible future issue of equity and or further debt offerings 
factors which could impede the company s growth strategy include possible non approval by the banking regulators of applications for acquisitions or new branches  and the possible inability of bancorp to raise future capital through the issuance of equity or debt 
sierra bank of nevada is rapidly outgrowing its present facility and during july purchased land at a cost of thousand for the site of a new facility to be constructed in southwest reno 
construction on the new facility began during september with completion expected by june the total cost of this facility is not expected to exceed million 
sierra bank of nevada anticipates that it will initially occupy up to  square feet in the  square foot facility 
the remaining space is to be leased until needed by the bank for expansion 
the company anticipates incurring certain costs related to relocation expenses  as well as increased occupancy expenses due to additional space  none of which are expected by management to be material to the company
