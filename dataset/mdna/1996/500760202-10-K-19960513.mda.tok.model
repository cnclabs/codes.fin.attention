outlook 
in january krause s obtained a revolving line of credit with a financial institution providing for borrowing of up to  for a period of two years 
borrowings under the line of credit are based on the value of inventory and are secured by substantially all of krause s assets 
in addition  krause s is required to satisfy certain financial covenants for working capital and stockholder s equity 
as of january  the company did not comply with these covenants 
on may  the company s revolving credit agreement was amended to provide for a waiver by the lender of the technical noncompliance with financial covenants and to amend those covenants  to extend the credit agreement to january and to provide  subject to the company obtaining certain additional equity financing  for additional borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility note 
during fiscal the company incurred an operating loss of  and as of january  the company has a working capital deficiency of  and an accumulated deficit of  management has identified certain initiatives and taken steps to return to profitability 
principal planned strategic objectives and initiatives include a downsizing of showroom size to reduce occupancy expenses  upgrading and remodeling showrooms to provide a more appealing setting for customers  remerchandising  refocusing and reducing advertising expenditures  improving manufacturing processes  and a corporate expense reduction with tight budgeting controls 
some of these initiatives can be undertaken presently while others will require capital expenditures and  therefore  additional financing 
to provide necessary financing for current operations as well as to begin to obtain necessary funding for the capital expenditures contemplated by management s strategic initiatives  the company has increased its borrowing availability under the amended revolving credit agreement discussed above 
additionally  the company has received a commitment from an investor that will assure it of receiving at least million from a planned convertible debt offering during the year ending january  as a result  management believes the company has sufficient sources of financing to continue operations throughout fiscal the company has no significant long term capital expenditure requirements 
however  the company will need to obtain further financing to implement all of the strategic objectives and initiatives contemplated by the strategic plan 
the company s long term success is dependent upon its ability to obtain necessary financing  the successful execution of management s plan and  ultimately  the achievement of sustained profitable operations 
management has no knowledge of any trends or events that are likely to substantially increase or decrease liquidity needs in the near future other than as noted above and as explained in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  or for acquisitions and expansion of the business that the company may undertake from time to time
