item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
financial condition as of march   in accordance with aicpa statement of position no 
 financial reporting by entities in reorganization under the bankruptcy code the company adopted fresh start reporting which included adjustments for bankruptcy related cash transactions through the effective date  which for accounting purposes was march   to properly reflect the reorganization 
as a result of the plan of reorganization becoming effective  the company s financial statements for the year ended december  are not comparable to statements for the prior year 
see note for pro forma results 
in accordance with the plan of reorganization which became effective on april   the company issued senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of million  million shares of common stock and million warrants to purchase common stock 
the senior notes bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable semi annually  and mature on july  the warrants are exercisable through december  and each warrant provides for the purchase of one share of common stock at a price of per share 
both preferred stock issues and the predecessor company s common stock were canceled on the plan effective date 
in addition  as discussed in note  the asset proceeds notes issued by rosebud holdings  inc  the company s liquidating subsidiary  bear interest at a rate of per annum payable in cash and or in additional asset proceeds notes in semi annual installments 
the asset proceeds notes mature on july  these notes were guaranteed  in part  by the company pursuant to the company guarantee 
the company s guarantee  guarantee agreement  and the related pledge of rosebud s common stock owned by the company was terminated on july  as the combined partial redemption of the asset proceeds notes made to that date exceeded million 
as of december   total interest and principal payments of approximately million had been paid on the asset proceeds notes 
the remaining face value of the asset proceeds notes as of december  was million 
other than an initial million cash contribution by the company for working capital purposes  the company is not obligated to fund additional rosebud working capital requirements 
cash generated by rosebud in excess of the remaining face value of the asset proceeds notes  accrued interest and rosebud working capital requirements  if any  will be paid to lone star 
upon emergence from chapter the company entered into a three year  million revolving credit agreement  which is collateralized by inventory  receivables  collection proceeds and certain intangible assets 
the agreement was subsequently amended in april  november and december the amendments reduced the rates of interest under the agreement and increased the amounts allowed for capital expenditures and certain other payments 
although the company from time to time has used the letter of credit facility provided by the credit agreement  it has not drawn any funds under the credit agreement for working capital purposes 
accordingly  there was no outstanding balance at december  in november  the board of directors authorized the expenditure of up to million for the repurchase of the company s common stock 
the company executed a purchase of  shares through a privately negotiated transaction in mid november at a cost of million 
during  the company made scheduled payments of million and a prepayment of million  terminating the production payment liability 
the company s financing agreements contain restrictive covenants which  among other things  limit the payment of dividends  and prohibit or limit the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness  create liens  engage in mergers and acquisitions or make certain capital expenditures 
analysis of cash flows and working capital cash flows from operating activities of million for the year ended december   primarily reflect income from operations  changes in working capital and million of pension plan contributions 
the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards in will reduce cash taxes otherwise payable by approximately million 
at december  the company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million which are expected to reduce future cash taxes by an additional million over time 
during the year ended december   the company used million for investing activities  primarily representing capital expenditures  partly offset by proceeds of million from asset sales  including the nova scotia  canada aggregate operation  and the denver  colorado concrete railroad tie plant  which had been leased to a third party 
net cash outflows from financing activities of million for the year ended december  primarily reflect payments on the remaining production payment balance of million and the repurchase of  shares of the company s common stock for million 
working capital on december   was million as compared to million on december  current assets increased million primarily due to higher inventory and prepaid expenses  partly offset by lower marketable securities 
current liabilities decreased million primarily due to a million reduction on the production payment and lower accounts payable  partly offset by higher state taxes payable 
investments in joint ventures increased million due to income from kosmos cement company  less cash dividends paid 
net property  plant and equipment increased million reflecting capital expenditures partly offset by depreciation and the sales of the nova scotia quarry and the denver facility 
payments of million on the long term portion of the production payment terminated the liability 
the long term pension liability decreased million  primarily reflecting contributions made during in excess of current expenses 
the carrying value on the company s books of net assets of rosebud and the related asset proceeds notes decreased million primarily due to a million redemption of the outstanding notes in late february  a million redemption in july  a million redemption in october and a million redemption in december which primarily resulted from asset sales and recoveries 
this was partly offset by an increase in asset valuation reflecting the shorter time period used in determining the present value 
the decrease was also partly offset by a million net proceeds recovery from the crosstie litigation involving northeast cement company and its affiliates  lafarge corporation and lafarge canada  inc  and by the inclusion of litigation settlements totaling million reached with the remaining insurance companies related to indemnity in the crosstie cases and with two argentine companies related to the auction sale of the company s argentine subsidiary 
prior to reaching final agreements  these recoveries were not included in the valuation of the net assets of rosebud 
all payments related to the above litigation settlements have been received 
capital expenditures capital expenditures of million for were primarily for major repairs  replacements and improvements at existing facilities  including the expansion of the st 
louis  missouri cement terminal to be completed in capital expenditures also included million related to the purchase of a fleet of barges used by new york trap rock  which had previously been leased 
in an effort to increase production  improve operating efficiencies and reduce costs  the company expects to make capital investments of approximately million in in addition to spending million for a modern clinker storage facility at the cape girardeau cement plant expected to be completed in early  the company intends to make various other improvements at its cape girardeau complex at an expected cost of approximately million 
planned expenditures for also include improvements to the new orleans  louisiana cement terminal and slag grinding facility at a cost of approximately million and improvements  including the expansion of two cement terminals and the relocation of another cement terminal  at an expected cost of million 
the company expects to fund its capital expenditures from cash on hand in addition to cash to be generated from operations 
other information the company is subject to extensive  stringent and complex federal  state and local laws  regulations and ordinances pertaining to the quality and the protection of the environment and human health and safety  requiring the company to devote substantial time and resources in an effort to maintain continued compliance 
many of the laws and regulations apply to the company s former activities  properties and facilities as well as its current operations 
changes to such regulations or the enactment of new regulations in the future could require the company to undertake capital improvement projects or to cease or curtail certain current operations or could otherwise substantially increase the capital  operating and other costs associated with compliance 
moreover  there can be no assurances that judicial or administrative proceedings  seeking penalties or injunctive relief  will not be brought against the company for alleged non compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations relating to matters as to which the company is currently unaware 
in addition  if releases of hazardous substances are discovered to have occurred at facilities currently or previously owned or operated by the company  or at facilities to which the company has sent waste materials  the company may be subject to liability for the investigation and remediation of such sites 
the company believes that it has adequately provided for costs related to its ongoing obligations with respect to known environmental liabilities 
expenditures for environmental liabilities during did not have a material effect on the financial condition or cash flows of the company 
the december  accompanying consolidated balance sheet includes accruals of million which represent the company s current estimate of its liability related to environmental matters 
on january   the united states environmental protection agency epa issued a regulatory determination regarding the need for regulatory controls on the management  handling and disposal of cement kiln dust ckd  a by product of cement manufacturing 
generally  the regulatory determination provides that the epa intends to draft and promulgate regulations imposing controls on the management  handling and disposal of ckd that will be based largely on selected components of the existing resource conservation and recovery act rcra hazardous waste regulatory program  tailored to address the specific regulatory concerns posed by ckd 
the epa regulatory determination further provides that new ckd regulations will be designed both to be protective of the environment and to minimize the burden on cement manufacturers 
in early  epa officials reported that certain other alternatives such as oversight of ckd management by state officials also are being explored 
it is not possible to predict at this time what  if any  new regulatory controls on the management  handling and disposal of ckd or what increased costs or range of costs  if any  would be incurred by the company to comply with these regulatory requirements 
as an alternative to new epa regulations or state oversight  portland cement manufacturers including lone star  are engaged in negotiations with the epa in an attempt to enter into other arrangements relating to the management of ckd 
on july   the state of indiana made a determination that the company s ckd was a type i waste and requested that the company apply for a formal permit for an on site landfill for the ckd at the greencastle  indiana plant 
the company understands that similar notices were sent to all other cement manufacturers in the state of indiana 
the company is protesting this determination through legal channels and received a stay to allow it to demonstrate that current management practices pose no threat to the environment 
the company believes that the state s determination ultimately will be reversed or the company will receive the needed permit or other adequate relief such as an agreed order requiring certain additional waste management procedures that are less stringent than those required for type i wastes 
if the company is not successful in this regard  however  like other indiana cement producers  the greencastle plant could incur substantially increased operating costs 
a number of collective bargaining agreements covering the company s hourly employees at its ready mixed concrete operations were renegotiated in during collective bargaining agreements covering substantially all of the company s hourly employees at its cement and construction aggregates operations will be renegotiated 
the company does not currently anticipate any unusual circumstances or difficulties in obtaining replacement agreements 
dividends and stock market prices in april the company s board of directors declared a per share dividend paid on june  to shareholders of record as of june  and announced their intention to continue  so long as merited  this dividend on a quarterly basis 
the dividend represented the first cash dividend paid since the board of directors has since declared additional per share dividends paid on september  and december  on february  the board of directors declared a per share dividend payable on march  to stockholders of record as of march  the common stock  warrants and senior notes are listed on the new york stock exchange nyse and began trading may  prior to this the old common stock and preferred stock traded on the nyse 
the following table sets forth the high and low sales prices for the common stock and warrants in composite transactions as reported on the nyse 
common stock warrants high low high low first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter second quarter commencing may  third quarter fourth quarter on march   the reported sale price of the common stock and warrants was per share and per warrant  respectively 
as of march   the company had approximately  holders of record of common stock and  holders of record of warrants 
results of operations on april  the plan of reorganization became effective 
upon the plan of reorganization becoming effective  the company issued new common stock  warrants  senior notes and asset proceeds notes  transferred certain assets to rosebud and for accounting purposes adopted fresh start reporting as of march  as a result  the company s financial statements for the year ended december  are not comparable to statements for prior periods 
also affecting comparability are differences in the operating units of the successor company and the predecessor company 
the successor company s operations include the pryor  oklahoma and maryneal  texas cement plants which were previously classified as assets held for sale and were excluded from the predecessor company s results 
the successor company s operations exclude the nazareth  pennsylvania and santa cruz  california cement plants and the hawaiian cement and rmc lonestar partnerships 
these operations  along with certain other assets  were transferred to rosebud 
see note for a description of operations and basis of presentation 
to facilitate a meaningful comparison of the company s operating performance  as historical annual results for and are not comparable  the following discussion and analysis compares the results of the historical year ended december  with the pro forma results for the period see note 
the company believes that this comparison is useful in understanding its operating performance for the current year 
the company s operations are seasonal and  consequently  the interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year 
compared to pro forma net sales consolidated net sales of million during were million higher than the prior year pro forma results 
the increase in net sales primarily reflects cement price increases implemented in april and during cement price increases of to per ton have been announced effective april cement sales of million during were million greater than the prior year pro forma results  primarily due to higher average cement net realized selling prices in  the result of price increases which began in cement shipments for were below levels 
sales of construction aggregates of million during were million lower than the pro forma results 
this decrease is primarily attributable to lower shipments  particularly into the new york metropolitan area  resulting from soft market conditions 
the decrease in overall construction aggregates shipments was partly offset by a increase in average selling prices 
ready mixed concrete and other operations sales during were million  million below the prior year pro forma results 
this reflects a decrease in shipments resulting from unfavorable weather conditions experienced during the second and third quarters of in the midwest  combined with soft market conditions 
the decrease in shipments was partly offset by a increase in average net realized selling prices 
net sales of cement  construction aggregates and ready mixed concrete and other products contributed  and  respectively  to total sales for gross profits gross profits from the cement operations were million in as compared to pro forma gross profits of million for gross profits at each plant in were higher than the previous year 
these results primarily reflect higher average cement net realized selling prices in partly offsetting these favorable results were higher overall per unit costs  reflecting higher costs and production interruptions  particularly at the maryneal  texas cement plant 
the cape girardeau  missouri and greencastle cement plants use hazardous waste fuel as cost saving energy sources 
the company expects to continue to operate its waste fuel program which is subject to stringent regulation pursuant to federal  state and local requirements governing hazardous waste treatment  storage and disposal facilities 
there can be no assurance that the company s hazardous waste fuel operations will be able to maintain compliance with the requirements contained in the federal boiler and industrial furnace regulations under rcra bif rules and state requirements or that changes to such rules or requirements or their interpretation by the relevant agencies or courts will not make it more difficult or cost prohibitive to maintain regulatory compliance or to continue to burn hazardous waste fuel see note 
construction aggregates gross profits of million during increased million over the prior year pro forma results 
these results primarily reflect lower finance costs associated with the purchase of the fleet of barges which had previously been leased  along with a increase in overall average selling prices  partly offset by lower shipments in in the new york metropolitan area due to soft market conditions 
shipments from the new york trap rock operations were adversely affected by the temporary closure of a customer s asphalt plant for rebuilding purposes  a sluggish concrete stone market  and the decision not to compete on certain low price jobs 
lower per unit production costs associated with higher production volume efficiencies at the nova scotia  canada operation contributed to the improved results 
the assets of the nova scotia quarry were sold in october for net proceeds including working capital of about million  which approximated book value 
this operation contributed sales of million and an operating loss of million to the results 
gross profits from ready mixed concrete and other construction products were million for  a million decrease from the pro forma results  primarily reflecting a decrease in overall ready mixed concrete shipments  partly offset by a increase in overall average net realized selling prices 
lower ready mixed concrete and concrete block shipments resulted from unfavorable weather in the midwest and soft market conditions  particularly in the central illinois area 
higher per unit costs at all operations adversely affected gross profits 
included in the calculation of gross profits are sales less cost of sales including depreciation related to cost of sales which excludes depreciation related to facilities leased to third parties and depreciation on office equipment  furniture and fixtures which are not related to the cost of sales 
joint ventures pre tax income from joint ventures of million during reflects the results of the kosmos cement company  a partnership in which the company has a interest 
the results for were million higher than the prior year reflecting higher net realized selling prices  partly offset by lower shipments 
other income other income of million in decreased million from  reflecting lower rental income resulting from sales of assets which had been leased to third parties partly offset by proceeds from an insurance settlement relating to a prior year claim 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses of million during represent a decrease of million over the prior year pro forma expense 
the savings in selling  general and administrative expenses primarily reflect lower corporate headquarters expenses and lower other postretirement benefit expenses in the savings in corporate headquarters expenses reflect a corporate downsizing which occurred on june   which eliminated approximately of the salaried positions at the corporate office 
the lower other postretirement benefits were the result of favorable experience for retiree medical claims 
selling  general and administrative expenses for include million of other postretirement benefit costs related to the company s presently retired employees 
selling  general and administrative expenses for included million relating to the filing of a registration statement 
interest expense interest expense of million in approximated the prior year pro forma total 
capitalized interest was million in interest expense was comprised primarily of interest accrued on the million senior notes and the company s obligation related to the production payment 
income taxes the income tax expense of million during  an increase of million from the prior year pro forma expense  primarily reflects higher taxes resulting from higher pre tax earnings in the provision for income taxes for reflects a effective tax rate as compared to a tax rate for the reduction in the rate is due to a higher estimated percentage depletion allowance 
net income net income of million  or per share  during was million  or per share higher than the prior year pro forma results 
excluding the after tax effect of million related to a litigation recovery included in the pro forma results  net income in was million or per share higher than this improvement is primarily due to higher cement results  reflecting higher average net realized cement selling prices partly offset by lower results from the construction aggregates and ready mixed concrete operations 
also contributing to the favorable increase in net income for over the prior year pro forma results were higher earnings from kosmos cement company  lower overall cost of goods sold associated with the lower sales volumes in all major product lines and decreased selling  general and administrative expenses 
nine months ended december  net sales consolidated net sales for the nine months ended december  were million following the company s emergence from bankruptcy in april cement operations recorded sales of million for the nine month period ended december  cement sales for the nine month period from comparable operations were million higher than the prior year comparable period reflecting a increase in average net realized selling prices and a increase in cement shipments 
the increase in cement shipments  particularly from the cape girardeau  missouri and the greencastle  indiana cement plants  and higher average net realized selling prices at all locations  resulted from strong demand in all local markets 
sales of construction aggregates were million for the nine month period ending december  sales of construction aggregates increased million from the comparable prior year nine month period primarily due to a increase in shipments 
increased shipments of construction aggregates in the new york metropolitan area were partly offset by decreased shipments from the company s canadian operations 
ready mixed concrete and other operations recorded sales of million for the nine month period ended december  the increase in ready mixed concrete sales of million was attributed to a increase in shipments and an increase in prices as compared to the comparable prior year period 
shipments of ready mixed concrete were favorable at all locations during this period  particularly in the memphis  tennessee area where strong demand from increased commercial building resulted in both higher shipments and favorable prices 
net sales of cement  construction aggregates and ready mixed concrete and other products contributed  and  respectively  to total sales for the nine month period 
gross profits gross profits from the cement operations were million for the nine months ended december   primarily reflecting the increase in overall average net realized selling prices and higher cement shipments 
also contributing to the favorable cement gross profits were favorable per unit production costs at the cape girardeau  missouri cement plant reflecting operating efficiencies due to increased production volumes 
the positive results were partly offset by higher production costs at the other locations  particularly the greencastle  indiana facility  which was affected by higher coal costs and lower waste fuel revenues due to the decreased use of waste fuels in the production process 
in september  the greencastle plant temporarily suspended the use of hazardous waste fuels pending analysis of the administrative enforcement action commenced by the epa 
the company resumed burning hazardous waste fuel in  but on a substantially reduced basis throughout the year  resulting in decreased revenues and higher coal costs 
gross profits from the construction aggregates operations were million for the nine month period reflecting a increase in overall shipments and a increase in overall average net realized selling prices from the comparable prior year period 
shipments from the new york trap rock operation increased over the comparable period 
this increase reflects higher shipments in the second quarter of caused by the prolonged and adverse winter weather conditions experienced during the first quarter in the northeast  which delayed the opening of customer asphalt and ready mixed concrete plants until march 
in addition  the company s customers were adversely affected by strikes in the summer of which did not occur in also contributing to the favorable construction aggregates gross profits were favorable per unit production costs from the west nyack  new york operation due to increased production volumes 
the positive results were partly offset by decreased shipments from the canadian operation  due to the lack of available ships to transport product to its coastal us and caribbean markets and lower overall customer demand 
gross profits from ready mixed concrete and other construction products were million for the nine month period ended december  primarily due to the increase in overall shipments and average net realized selling prices  reflecting strong demand in the memphis  tennessee and central illinois areas 
included in the calculation of gross profit are sales less cost of sales including depreciation related to cost of sales which excludes depreciation related to facilities leased to third parties and depreciation on office equipment  furniture and fixtures which are not related to the cost of sales 
joint ventures pre tax income from joint ventures of million for the nine months ended december  reflects the results of the kosmos cement company

the rmc lonestar and hawaiian cement joint ventures were transferred to rosebud in connection with the plan of reorganization 
other income other income of million for the nine month period ended december  primarily reflects interest earned on investments  rental income and interest earned on accounts and notes receivable 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses of million for the nine months ended december  reflects savings achieved during and after the company s bankruptcy proceedings 
the savings in selling  general and administrative expenses primarily reflect lower other postretirement benefit expense and lower pension expense due to settlements reached through negotiations with retirees including the establishment of a voluntary employee beneficiary association veba for salaried retirees whereby the company makes quarterly contributions to a trust 
the company also reached a settlement with the pbgc whereby the company contributed additional cash to its pension plans 
lower insurance expenses also contributed to the savings in selling  general and administrative expenses reflecting settlements reached with insurance carriers and the company s joint ventures and certain former joint ventures which settled certain ultimate liabilities for periods prior to the petition date 
other savings in selling  general and administrative expenses reflect lower employee related expenses primarily achieved by reductions in personnel  prior to june  through attrition  combined with a corporate downsizing on june  which eliminated approximately of salaried positions at the corporate office

net income for the nine months reflects joint venture income of million  which represents the company s share of earnings from kosmos cement company 
the rmc lonestar and hawaiian cement partnerships were transferred to rosebud in connection with the plan of reorganization 
the positive net income for the current period was partly offset by higher interest expense primarily related to the senior notes 
for years subsequent to  first quarter results have reflected and are expected to continue to reflect losses which may be significant  due to the impact of the winter months on construction activity  particularly at the company s northern operations  production curtailments at plants to perform annual maintenance  and higher costs associated with the annual maintenance 
historically  for accounting purposes planned capacity variances during a fiscal year were deferred in the first quarter and recognized during the last nine months 
these deferred costs in totaling million were written off as part of the revaluation of assets in accordance with fresh start reporting 
beginning in  due to a change in the company s accounting policies  these costs will be expensed more quickly than in prior years and will primarily impact first quarter results of the year in which they occur 
three months ended march  net sales consolidated net sales of million for the three months ended march  were million higher than the comparable prior year period reflecting higher shipments of cement and ready mixed concrete  partially offset by lower sales of construction aggregates 
cement sales of million were million greater than the comparable prior year period reflecting increased domestic cement shipments particularly from the cape girardeau  missouri cement plant due to stronger demand and higher average net realized cement selling prices at all locations 
the favorable sales volume was partly offset by lower cement sales from the nazareth  pennsylvania cement plant subsequently transferred to rosebud as shipments were adversely affected by severe winter weather conditions in the northeast 
sales of construction aggregates of million for the three months ended march  were million below the comparable prior year period 
the reduction in shipments of construction aggregates reflects a slow start in construction activity caused by the prolonged and adverse winter weather conditions experienced in the northeast in these adverse conditions extended into march  which delayed the opening of customer asphalt and ready mix concrete plants 
also contributing to the lower aggregate shipments was the shortage of available commercial freighters to transport construction aggregates from the company s canadian operation to the caribbean market

results from the hawaiian cement partnership decreased million from the first quarter of reflecting lower shipments of cement  construction aggregates  and ready mixed concrete as a result of a slowdown in the construction industry in hawaii 
the company s share of pre tax income from kosmos cement company approximated the comparable prior year period s results 
recovery of litigation settlement included in income in the first quarter of is an insurance settlement of million from the company s primary carrier regarding indemnification pursuant to the railroad crosstie litigation  the right of recovery to such litigation was subsequently transferred to rosebud 
the settlement was offset against a bankruptcy claim of that carrier 
cost of sales cost of sales of million for the first quarter of was million higher than the comparable prior year period primarily due to higher cement and ready mixed concrete costs reflecting higher shipments 
this was partly offset by lower sales of construction aggregates and the delayed startup of production at the domestic construction aggregates plants 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses of million for the three months ended march  were million lower than the comparable prior year period 
reorganization items reorganization items  related to the bankruptcy  of million during the first quarter of were million higher than the comparable prior year period primarily reflecting adjustments to fair value of fixed assets in connection with the adoption of fresh start reporting  and higher professional fee expenses and higher administrative costs associated with the emergence from bankruptcy pursuant to the plan of reorganization

excluding the pre tax earnings from the brazilian joint venture and the insurance recovery  pre tax operating results for the first quarter of were million better than the same prior year period 
this increase reflects higher results from the cement and ready mixed operations and domestic joint ventures on higher shipments due to increased business activity and lower selling  general and administrative expenses
