actual results may differ materially from those projected 
such risks and uncertainties may be more fully described in other reports and information filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission 
certain of these risks and uncertainties are discussed under the caption factors that may affect future results of operations 
nature of operations the company develops  manufactures  markets and supports hardware and software systems for the verification of integrated circuit designs 
ikos mission is to help customers realize their high complexity products through innovative design verification solutions 
the company s products are designed to enable its customers to verify their designs more rapidly and accurately than existing software based simulation tools 
with the completion of its acquisition of vmw  the company broadened its spectrum of verification solutions to extend from the design concept stage to the prototype stage as the company is completing its development of an emulation system 
the company sells its products to a broad range of customers in the communications  multimedia graphics  semiconductor  computer  aerospace and consumer electronics industries 
the company markets its products and services primarily through its direct sales and service organization as the company has direct sales operations throughout the united states and in the united kingdom  france and germany 
the company also has a distribution network covering the remainder of europe and in parts of asia 
net revenues net revenues increased to  for the fiscal year ended september  as compared to  for fiscal the increase for the year was primarily the result of continued growth in unit sales of the voyager systems primarily nsim product and maintenance revenues 
voyager system sales contributed over of the net revenues for the fiscal year ended september  and represented an increase of over the previous year 
maintenance revenue for the year ended september   increased to  from  for fiscal and represented of net revenues for both and the increase in maintenance revenues was primarily a result of the growth in the installed customer base of the company s systems 
international revenues increased by and domestic revenues increased by over this same period 
net revenues for fiscal were  for the fiscal year ended september  as compared to  for fiscal this increase was the result of the broader acceptance of the voyager systems and increases in maintenance revenues 
international sales export sales and sales shipped by the company s european operation were   and  for the fiscal years  and  respectively 
these sales represents  and of net revenues 
the increases in international sales were a result of the increased customer acceptance of the new product offerings  increased economic demand  particularly in europe  increased focus on the international market and increased presence in the far east marketplace 
the company opened its subsidiary in japan during fiscal it is expected that international sales should increase in absolute dollars in fiscal the company first released its voyager series product  the vhdl software simulator vs in and has since released its mixed level simulator  its next generation hardware accelerator and its software gate level simulator 
the company entered the verilog market with its gemini product during and in early released its voyager fault simulator voyager fs 
the company expects to begin commercial shipments of its new emulator product in the first quarter of fiscal although the company believes its product offerings have been accepted very favorably  there can be no assurances that there will not be any new product offerings by competitors or changes in the marketplace that could adversely affect the company s sales and profits 
gross profit gross profit was   and  or  and of total net revenues for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal is primarily a result of both higher product margins of  or and higher maintenance margins of  or 
the increase in product margins is a result of the increases in unit shipments of higher margin products and to a lesser extent  the absorption of fixed manufacturing costs over a broader revenue base 
the increased maintenance margins are a result of the increased maintenance revenues from a larger customer base without significant increases in related maintenance costs 
the company expects margins to remain comparable with fiscal as the company believes it will continue to recognize manufacturing efficiencies and continued sales of products with higher margins 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were   and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
as a percent of net revenues  research and development expenses were  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues from fiscal to fiscal were primarily the result of the company s addition of the vmw operations  increased headcount and related expenses 
in addition  the increase in research and development is a result of the company s acquisition of certain technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and did not have alternative future uses 
research and development expenses in fiscal and were comparable in terms of absolute dollars but lower in fiscal as a percentage of revenue due to the completion of its major product development program that began in fiscal in fiscal  the company increased its hiring to address its on going research and development efforts for enhancing its current products and for new product and technology development 
research and development expenses are expected to increase in absolute dollars when compared to fiscal as the company continues its product enhancement  new product development and technology development programs 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses were   and  in fiscal  and or  and of net revenues  respectively 
the primary causes of the increase in absolute dollars have been increases in headcount  commissions and international operations 
the growth in headcount due to the higher level of presale support and benchmarking performed by field application engineers 
commissions have increased as a result of higher net revenue levels  as well as the growth of international operations 
spending on international operations have increased to support the increased activity in both europe and asia 
sales and marketing expenses are expected to increase in absolute dollars in fiscal general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were   and  for fiscal  and  or  and of net revenues  respectively 
the increase in expenses in was primarily due to increases in headcount with related expenses  increased investor relations expenses  and increases in professional services and profit sharing expenses 
the increase in fiscal was primarily due to additional headcount  as the company filled the president and chief operating officer positions which were vacant in fiscal general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in absolute dollars in fiscal other income expense net interest income in fiscal of  was the result of interest income of  being earned on increased cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances during the fiscal year  net of interest paid on long term debt borrowings of  the increasing cash balances were the result of the company completing two stock offerings netting proceeds of approximately  net interest income of  in fiscal consisted of approximately  of interest income offset by approximately  of interest expense on long term borrowings 
net interest expense in fiscal was the result of  of interest expense on the long term debt partially offset by approximately  of interest income earned 
other income in fiscal  and was   and  respectively  and primarily relates to rental income from property that the company began leasing in provision for income taxes the company recorded a tax benefit of  for fiscal which was primarily attributable to the recognition of deferred tax assets for which no benefit was previously recognized  net operating losses utilized during fiscal  and acquired research and development expenditures for which no tax benefit is available 
the company s tax provision for fiscal and consists primarily of federal alternative minimum tax  state taxes and foreign withholding taxes 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
the company has established a valuation allowance covering a portion of the gross deferred tax assets based on management s expectations of future taxable income and the actual taxable income during the three years ended september  approximately  of the valuation allowance at september  is related to tax benefits of stock option deductions which will be credited to paid in capital when realized 
the remaining valuation allowance is attributable to vmw pre acquisition deferred tax assets which will be credited to goodwill when recognized 
extraordinary credit forgiveness of debt in april  the company and racal re negotiated the terms of the july  agreement regarding the transfer  joint development and joint ownership in certain racal technology 
the new terms reduce overall payments to racal from the company by  and extend the scheduled payments into fiscal this resulted in an extraordinary credit of  after being offset by certain related expenses 
other the company has experienced virtually no gains or losses on foreign currency translation since substantially all of its international sales to date have been billed and collected in us dollars 
the company pays the expenses of its international operations in local currencies and does not engage in hedging transactions with respect to such obligations 
factors that may affect future results of operations potential fluctuations in quarterly results the company s quarterly operating results have in the past and may in the future vary significantly depending on factors including the timing of customer development projects and purchase orders  new product announcements and releases by the company and other companies  gain or loss of significant customers  price discounting of the company s products  the timing of expenditures  customer product delivery requirements  availability and cost of components or labor and economic conditions generally and in the electronics industry specifically 
any unfavorable change in these or other factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results for a particular quarter 
many of the company s customers order on an as needed basis and often delay issuance of firm purchase orders until their project commencement dates are determined 
quarterly revenue and operating results will therefore depend on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter  which are difficult to forecast accurately 
moreover  a significant portion of the company s revenue may result  from shipments during the last few weeks of the quarter from orders generally received in the last month of the quarter 
any concentration of sales at the end of the quarter may limit the company s ability to plan or adjust operating expenses and production and inventory levels 
therefore  if anticipated shipments in any quarter do not occur or are delayed  expenditure levels could be disproportionately high as a percentage of revenue  and the company s operating results for that quarter would be adversely affected 
in addition  sales of individual systems with high average sales prices can constitute a significant percentage of the company s quarterly revenue 
operating results in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period  and there can be no assurance that the company s net revenues will continue to increase  that its recent rate of quarterly revenue and earnings growth will be sustained  or that the company will remain profitable in any future period 
continued acceptance and development of the company s products substantially all of the company s product revenues since fiscal have been derived from the sale of its voyager and gemini simulation systems 
there can be no assurance that market acceptance of these products will continue 
the continued adoption of the company s hardware assisted simulation products for the verification of integrated circuit ic and system designs is expected to depend on the continued increasing complexity of ics designed for electronic systems  integration of the company s products with other tools for ic design and simulation  the ability of hardware assisted simulation systems to shorten the time of simulation of ic designs  continued industry acceptance of mixed level hardware assisted simulation  the development and market acceptance of alternative simulation technologies such as cycle based software simulation  formal proof and hybrid timing verifiers  and modular design techniques 
because the market for hardware assisted simulation products is evolving  it is difficult to predict with any assurance whether the market for hardware assisted simulation products will continue to expand 
there can be no assurances that such market will expand or  even if such market expands  that the company s products will achieve the market acceptance required to maintain revenue growth and continued profitability in the future 
prior to the acquisition of vmw  the company had limited in house experience with logic emulation  and the company s initial emulation technology is in the final stages of development 
there can be no assurance that with the final development of this technology  any products resulting from this development will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace  be of acceptable quality or achieve market acceptance 
in addition  because the company s proposed emulation products are based on a new technology concept  there can be no assurance that the products will function and perform as planned or that the company will not experience other delays or difficulties in finalizing the development of these products 
the success of the company in developing  introducing  selling and supporting emulation products will depend on a variety of factors in addition to the timely and successful completion of product design and development  including timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing processes  effective sales  marketing and customer service  and the absence of performance problems or other difficulties that may require design modifications and related expenses and may hinder or damage market acceptance of the products 
while the company s emulation systems are being designed to provide cost and ease of use advantages intended to broaden the market for logic emulation  there can be no assurance that its products  if successfully developed  will be able to achieve such goals 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the market for logic emulation will broaden beyond the current set of emulation systems users 
the adoption of any emulation products the company may develop will also depend on the continued increasing complexity of ics designed for electronic systems  integration of such products with other tools for ic design and verification  importance of the time to market benefits of emulation systems and industry acceptance of the need to close the gap between high level design and silicon production 
because the market for emulation products is new and evolving  it is difficult to predict with any assurance whether the market for emulation products will continue to expand 
competition the eda industry is highly competitive and rapidly changing 
the company s products are specifically targeted at the emerging portion of the industry relating to complex designs that the company believes benefit from simulation and emulation products 
to date  substantially all of the company s revenue has resulted from sales of hardware assisted simulation products 
the company currently experiences competition from hardware assisted simulation based systems sold by zycad corporation zycad and traditional software verification methodologies 
the company also competes in the market for emulation products where its main competition for emulation systems are those sold by quickturn design systems  inc quickturn and other eda companies 
the company expects competition in the market for verification tools to increase as other companies attempt to introduce new products  such as cycle based software simulation products and product enhancements 
moreover  the company competes  and expects that it will continue to compete  with established eda companies 
a number of these companies have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources  greater name recognition and larger installed customer bases than the company 
in addition  many of these competitors and potential competitors have established relationships with current and potential customers of the company and offer a broader and more comprehensive product line 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of market share  all of which could materially adversely affect the company 
in addition  current competitors or other entities may develop other products that have significant advantages over the company s products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by the company will not materially adversely affect its operating results 
new products and technological change the eda industry is characterized by extremely rapid technological change in both hardware and software development  frequent new product introductions  evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
the company s future success will depend upon its ability to enhance its current series of simulation systems and to design  develop and support its future simulation and emulation products on a timely basis 
those efforts require a high level of expenditures for research and development by the company to address the increasingly sophisticated needs of the customers 
for example  all of the company s current products operate in  and planned future products will operate in  the unix operating environment  an industry standard in the eda market 
in the event that another operating system  such as windows nt  becomes an industry standard  the company may be required to port its products to such new standard 
in addition  the company s simulation systems generally accept designs in the broadly accepted hardware description language  verilog xl  which cadence design systems  inc cadence has developed and made available to the company 
in the event cadence adopts a less cooperative stance toward the company in the future  the company s systems may not be able to accept designs based on verilog xl and the company may be required to develop software to accept designs of other hardware description languages 
the inability to accept designs in verilog xl may materially adversely affect the company s results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing product enhancements or new products that respond to technological change or evolving industry standards or changing customer requirements  that the company will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of these products  or that its new products and product enhancements will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace  will be of acceptable quality or will achieve market acceptance 
if the company is unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  the company s business  operating results and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 
moreover  from time to time  the company may announce new products or technologies that have the potential to replace the company s existing product offerings 
there can be no assurance that the announcement of new product offerings will not cause customers to defer purchases of existing company products  which could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
dependence on electronics industry the company is dependent upon the electronics industry and  in particular  new system and ic design projects 
the electronics industry is characterized by rapid technological change  short product life cycles  fluctuations in manufacturing capacity and pricing and margin pressures  all of which cause it to be volatile 
as a result  the electronics industry has historically experienced sudden and unexpected downturns  at which time the number of new system and ic design projects decrease 
because most of the company s sales occur upon the commencement of new projects for system and ic products  the company is dependent upon the rate of commencement of new system and ic design projects 
accordingly  negative factors affecting the electronics industry could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
dependence upon certain suppliers certain key components used in the company s products are presently available from sole or limited sources 
the inability to develop alternative sources for these sole or limited source components or to obtain sufficient quantities of these components could result in delays or reductions in product shipments which could adversely affect the company s operating results 
the company s systems use proprietary application specific integrated circuits asics that are currently manufactured solely by american microsystems  inc ami and subassemblies that are manufactured solely by micron technology inc micron 
the company generally purchases these components  including semiconductor memories used in the company s hardware simulators  pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time in the ordinary course of business and has no supply arrangements with any of these source suppliers that require the suppliers to provide components in guaranteed quantities or at set prices 
moreover  the manufacture of these components can be extremely complex  and the company s reliance on the suppliers of these components exposes the company to production difficulties and quality variations that may be experienced by these suppliers 
therefore  the company s reliance on its sole and limited source suppliers involves several risks  including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components  reduced control over pricing and timely delivery and quality of acceptable components 
while the timeliness and quality of deliveries to date from such suppliers have been acceptable  there can be no assurance that problems will not occur in the future 
any prolonged inability to obtain components or subassemblies in sufficient quantities or quality or on favorable pricing or delivery terms  or any other circumstances that would require the company to seek alternative sources of supply  could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results and could damage the company s relationships with its customers 
customer concentration a relatively limited number of customers have historically accounted for a substantial portion of the company s net revenues 
during fiscal and  sales to the company s top ten customers accounted for approximately and  respectively  of the company s net revenues 
the company expects that sales of its products to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a high percentage of net revenues for the foreseeable future 
the loss of a major customer or any reduction in orders by such customers  including reductions due to market or competitive conditions in the electronics or eda industries  would have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
moreover  the company s ability to increase its sales will depend in part upon its ability to obtain orders from new customers  as well as the financial condition and success of its existing customers and the general economy  there can be no assurance that such increases will occur 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  the company has financed its operations  including increases in accounts receivable and inventory and capital equipment acquisitions  primarily through private and public sales of equity securities and a loan secured by capital equipment 
at september  the company s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased to  from  at september  the increase was a result of  cash provided by operating activities and  provided by financing activities offset by  for investment activities 
operating activities the company s operating activities provided cash of  during fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from net income adjusted for the purchase of in process research and development related to the purchase of vmw plus depreciation and amortization partially offset by the adjustment for deferred tax assets 
in addition  the increase was a result of increases in accounts payable  accrued payroll and related expenses and deferred maintenance offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
for fiscal and  net cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization  which was partially offset by increases in accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable associated with increases in revenue activity 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities for fiscal  and were   and  respectively 
a significant use of cash for fiscal resulted from the acquisition of vmw which totaled  the purchases and maturities of short term investments resulted in a net use of cash in the amount  for investment purposes in fiscal such investment activities in fiscal and were insignificant 
in addition to the short term investments  the company s investment activities were comprised primarily of capital expenditures of   and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
capital expenditures were primarily for evaluation equipment and engineering workstations 
the company expects continued capital expenditures during fiscal as expected headcount additions will require additional computers and engineering workstations 
financing activities during fiscal  and  the company s financing activities provided cash of   and  respectively 
during fiscal  the company completed two public stock offerings  issuing approximately  shares of common stock while receiving net proceeds of approximately  in addition  during fiscal   and  the company also received cash upon the exercise of options to purchase common stock under the company s stock option and purchase plans 
during these same periods  the company s principal payments on long term borrowings were   and  respectively 
the company s primary unused sources of funds at september  consisted of  of cash and cash equivalents  in addition to  of short term investments 
the company expects to make capital expenditures throughout fiscal the company expects that capital expenditures will increase as compared to capital expenditures incurred in fiscal the company believes that net proceeds from the public offerings  together with cash and cash equivalents generated from operations  will be sufficient to finance its operations through at least the end of fiscal to the extent necessary  the company may also use bank borrowings and capital leases depending on the terms available 
the company s cash requirements in the future may also be financed through additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that such financing can be obtained on favorable terms  if at all
