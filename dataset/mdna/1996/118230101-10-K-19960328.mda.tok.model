results of operations through its operating partnerships  the partnership is principally engaged in the transportation of refined petroleum products including gasoline  jet fuel  diesel fuel  heating oil and kerosene 
the partnership s revenues are principally a function of the volumes of refined petroleum products transported by the partnership  which are in turn a function of the demand for refined petroleum products in the regions served by the partnership s pipelines and the tariffs or transportation fees charged for such transportation 
results of operations are affected by factors which include competitive conditions  demand for products transported  seasonality and regulation 
see business competition and other business considerations 
compared with revenue for the year ended december  was million  million or percent less than revenue of million for volume delivered during averaged  barrels per day   barrels per day or percent less than volume of  barrels per day delivered in the decline in revenue was related to decreases in gasoline and distillate deliveries  offset somewhat by increases in turbine fuel deliveries and the effect of tariff rate increases 
see tariff changes 
gasoline volumes declined as several competitive pipeline systems marginally expanded their capacity in resulting in some volume shifting to these systems 
in addition  a midwest refinery shutdown contributed to the decline 
these declines in gasoline volume were somewhat offset by increased market share in pennsylvania through the addition of a significant new customer during the distillate volume decline was primarily related to warmer weather throughout the northeast in the first quarter of marketers also opted to keep inventories at low levels  unlike the prior year when extensive summer inventory building occurred 
the midwest refinery closure also contributed to the decline in distillate volumes 
meanwhile  turbine fuel deliveries increased as both airline passenger and cargo traffic improved in the partnership s market areas during volume increases occurred at several major airport locations 
costs and expenses during were million  million or percent less than costs and expenses of million during declines in the use of outside services and power  along with declines in casualty loss expense  were partially offset by increases in payroll and employee benefit expenses 
other income expenses consist of interest income  interest and debt expense  and minority interests and other 
the partial repayment and refinancing of debt at lower interest rates in resulted in an interest expense decline of million in compared with revenue for the year ended december  was million  million or percent greater than revenue of million for volume delivered during averaged  barrels per day   barrels per day or percent greater than volume of  barrels per day delivered in greater revenue in was related to increased gasoline and distillate deliveries and to the effect of tariff rate increases 
see tariff changes 
gasoline volumes increased primarily due to higher end use demand in response to continued economic recovery and moderate growth in market share 
higher distillate shipments were the result of increased demand due to colder weather early in the year and the effect of carrying two distillate inventories  both high and low sulfur product  as required by clean air act regulations that became effective in october turbine fuel shipments increased slightly due to market demand growth at major airports 
costs and expenses during were million  million or percent greater than costs and expenses of million during categories of increased expenses included payroll and employee benefits  maintenance services  power  supplies and casualty loss 
a significant portion of these increased expenses were directly related to the transportation of additional volume 
in addition  costs incurred in connection with environmental remediation activities were million greater than the prior year 
see environmental matters 
other income expenses consist of interest income  interest and debt expense  and minority interests and other 
net reductions in debt  plus refinancing of debt at lower interest rates  resulted in a decline in interest expense of million from levels

certain operating partnerships or their predecessors have been named as a defendant in lawsuits or have been notified by federal or state authorities that they are a prp under federal laws or a respondent under state laws relating to the generation  disposal  or release of hazardous substances into the environment 
these proceedings generally relate to potential liability for clean up costs 
the total potential remediation costs to be borne by the operating partnerships relating to these clean up sites cannot be reasonably estimated and could be material 
with respect to each site  however  the operating partnership involved is one of several or as many as several hundred prps that would share in the total costs of clean up under the principle of joint and several liability 
the general partner believes that the generation  handling and disposal of hazardous substances by the operating partnerships and their predecessors have been in material compliance with applicable environmental and regulatory requirements 
at the whitmoyer laboratories site in myerstown  pennsylvania  buckeye is one of several prps for a clean up estimated to cost approximately million 
however  in  epa entered into an agreement with the estate of one of the prps to recover a portion of epa s past costs and a consent decree with the two prps that were former owners of whitmoyer laboratories to assume the cost of clean up at the site and to reimburse epa for future response costs and a portion of its past response costs 
these two prps have instituted suit against each other to determine their relative responsibility for the whitmoyer laboratories site clean up 
one of the prps served a third party complaint against buckeye for the stated purpose of tolling the statute of limitations to preserve its rights  if any  against buckeye 
buckeye subsequently settled the third party complaint that had been filed against it 
in consideration of mutual releases and the prp s agreement to cleanup buckeye s portion of the site  buckeye agreed to remove its booster pump station  to reroute its pipeline around the site and to reimburse the prp for the cost of removing the original pipeline  if such removal is required by epa 
buckeye has not entered into any agreements with the epa or the other prp involved at the site  and buckeye has not waived any rights to recover for any claim arising out of the prp s activities at the site or any claims brought by any governmental agency or third party based upon environmental conditions at the site 
although the exact costs of the settlement are not known  buckeye estimates at this time that the costs of complying with the terms of the settlement agreement will be between million and million 
in march  a landslide near freeport  pennsylvania caused a rupture to one of buckeye s pipelines which resulted in the release of approximately  gallons of petroleum products 
during  buckeye paid claims and other charges related to this incident in the amount of million 
total claims paid as a result of this incident have amounted to million 
of this amount  million has been reimbursed by buckeye s insurance carriers 
buckeye is unable to estimate the total amount of future environmental clean up and other costs and liabilities that may be incurred in connection with this incident 
however  based on information currently available to it  buckeye believes that its net expense after insurance recoveries will not be material to its financial condition or results of operations 
see legal proceedings freeport landslide 
various claims for the cost of cleaning up releases of hazardous substances and for damage to the environment resulting from the activities of the operating partnerships or their predecessors have been asserted and may be asserted in the future under various federal and state laws 
although the partnership has made a provision for certain legal expenses relating to these matters  the general partner is unable to determine the timing or outcome of any pending proceedings or of any future claims and proceedings
