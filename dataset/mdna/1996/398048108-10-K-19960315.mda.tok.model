item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital resources and liquidity public offering 
the company filed a registration statement on form s relating to the sale of up to  shares of common stock which was declared effective on september   and on october   the sale of the stock was completed 
four million shares were sold by the company and  shares were sold by motor coach industries limited  a selling stockholder 
the company did not receive any portion of the proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock by the selling stockholder 
net proceeds to the company from the sale of the  shares of common stock offered by the company were million 
the company used million of the net proceeds it received to repurchase the senior note repurchase million aggregate principal amount of its senior notes due the senior notes pursuant to a put call agreement with one of the company s principal stockholders 
the purchase price for the senior notes was based on arm s length negotiations 
the company used the remaining net proceeds from the sale of the common stock for general corporate purposes 
pending use  the net proceeds to the company from the offering were invested in short term  interest bearing securities or were used to reduce the borrowings under the new credit facility defined herein 
capital structure and leverage 
the company had million in long term debt outstanding excluding million of issued and undrawn standby letters of credit at december   which primarily consisted of the company s senior notes 
although the company generally requires significant cash flows to meet its debt and other continuing obligations  the senior note repurchase will reduce these requirements for the near term 
after giving effect to the senior note repurchase  the company s semi annual interest payments on the senior notes will be reduced from million to million each january and july 
the senior notes sinking fund requirements for  in the amount of million  will be met through the senior notes repurchased in and the million of senior notes which the company owned prior to the senior note repurchase 
the balance of the senior note repurchase will be applied to the july sinking fund payment 
as a result of the application of the remaining senior note repurchase  the july sinking fund payment will be reduced from million to approximately million 
the sinking fund payment due july is million and increases annually thereafter 
the company will also require million in the aggregate for other debt service  million of which is interest including interest on the senior notes and million for bus  real estate and other operating lease obligations during during february  in connection with the financial restructuring see financial restructuring  the company pre paid million in bus financing to motor coach industries acceptance corporation mciac 
the pre payment resulted in the release of liens on buses  which the company then pledged as collateral under the new credit facility defined herein 
aggregate amounts outstanding to mciac were million as of december  in july  the company issued  shares of common stock to participants in the company sponsored k cash or deferred retirement plans that cover substantially all of its ongoing salaried  hourly and represented employees 
liquidity 
operating cash flows  together with cash from financing activities  seasonal revolving credit borrowings and sales of assets  historically have been sufficient to fund the company s operations and investing activities which consist primarily of capital expenditures for new bus acquisitions  systems development costs and  where appropriate  facilities replacements or upgrades 
for the year ended december   operating activities provided net cash of million 
however  during each year  the seasonal fluctuations in the company s cash flows can be significant 
typically  cash flow for the first quarter of the year is negative  and is not offset until the third and fourth quarters  which typically produce substantial positive cash flows 
the net cash required for financing activities  as well as cash required for investing activities  were funded by cash provided by operating activities  proceeds from the issuance of common stock  proceeds received from the rights offerings see financial restructuring  and the sale of surplus assets 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million and million in available borrowing capacity under the new credit facility defined herein for general purposes 
additionally  the company had sufficient unpledged collateral which could be pledged under the terms of the new credit facility to increase total available borrowing capacity to million 
the company is party to two floating rate interest rate swap agreements 
in october  the agreements were amended to lock in future payments under the agreements until maturity in july the net result of the amendments is that these swaps will not be subject to interest rate risk 
under the amendments  the company will be required to pay million in total from december  through the remaining term of the five year agreements 
the company has collateralized its payment obligations under the amended agreements with a million letter of credit and liens on six pieces of company owned real property 
the company is currently in negotiations with the counterparty to reduce collateral requirements for and beyond 
during october as part of the financial restructuring see financial restructuring  the company entered into a revolving credit facility the credit facility with foothill capital corporation foothill  which replaced the company s prior bank facility 
at the time of the financial restructuring  the credit facility provided for revolving loans and letters of credit and or letter of credit guarantees of up to million 
in june  the company renegotiated its credit facility the new credit facility 
the new credit facility provides for revolving loans  letters of credit and letter of credit guarantees up to a maximum commitment of million 
as of december   there were approximately million in issued and undrawn standby letters of credit outstanding under the new credit facility  and no revolving borrowings outstanding under the new credit facility 
syndication commitments under the new credit facility  including foothill s commitment as the lead agent  total million at march  availability under the new credit facility is limited to the aggregate of the following revolving advances of up to million based on a formula of certain eligible accounts receivable  revolving advances of up to million the fixed asset advances based on the value of certain fixed asset collateral pledged to foothill  and a bus purchase facility of up to million the bus purchase facility 
borrowings under the new credit facility mature on may   although availability under the fixed asset advances will be subject to quarterly reductions after april  unless additional collateral is pledged 
the new credit facility is secured by liens on substantially all the assets of the company  excluding real estate purchases and new bus purchases that are specifically pledged to support borrowings under the bus purchase facility 
the new credit facility allows the company to dispose of certain non core real estate properties 
in addition  non bus capital expenditures are limited to million annually with no spending limitations on bus purchases as long as financed through debt  or operating or capital leases with maturities of no less than five years 
the company is currently completing negotiations to increase the commitments under the new credit facility to million and extend the agreement to january  the company expects to successfully complete these negotiations by april the new credit facility is subject to financial covenants  including maintenance of a minimum net worth and an agreed ratio of cash flow to interest expense 
at december   the company was in compliance with these covenants 
in addition  the new credit facility provides for a reduction in interest rates if certain ratio levels of cash flow to interest expense  in excess of a minimum  are achieved 
as of december   the company had exceeded the first threshold level and  as a result  the applicable interest rate on any borrowings under the new credit facility will be reduced from above the prime rate to above prime effective february  the company has embarked on an aggressive risk reduction and claims reduction program 
due to a decrease in the pending inventory of claims  certain insurance carriers have reduced their collateral and security requirements for previous years claims  which resulted in a return of collateral and security to the company of approximately million during april and approximately million during december nevertheless  a decision by the company s insurers to modify the company s program substantially  by either increasing cost  reducing availability or increasing its collateral requirements  could have a material adverse effect on the future liquidity and operations of the company 
during the company s bankruptcy in  certain funds were set aside to cover claims arising under the interstate commerce commission now the dot trust fund 
those claims have been concluded  and a final distribution has been made to the claimants 
the interstate commerce commission trust fund was collateralized with a million letter of credit which was released to the company during september pension plan status 
funding requirements 
the company has five defined benefit pension plans 
the most significant plan is the greyhound lines  inc retirement and disability trust the atu plan which covers approximately  current and former employees  primarily drivers  fewer than  of whom are active employees as of december  the atu plan was closed to new participants in november and  as a result  over of the participants are or more years old 
for financial reporting and investment planning purposes  the company uses a mortality table that closely matches the actual experience related to the existing participant population 
in december  the congress passed the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt legislation 
included in this bill was a specification that employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa funding requirements for pension plans be calculated using a specific actuarial mortality table gatt specified table 
this gatt specified table differs significantly from the table the company has been using to value the pension liabilities for financial reporting purposes 
if the company is required to measure the pension liability  for erisa funding purposes  utilizing the gatt specified table  it will be required to begin making contributions to the atu plan at some time after in annual amounts potentially ranging from million to million 
management believes  however  that the atu plan is currently adequately funded to meet the future benefit obligations 
if the company is required to measure erisa funding requirements using the gatt specified table  the company believes that the atu plan will be over funded on an actual basis 
additionally  the atu plan documents provide that if the company is required to make contributions  benefits will be frozen and active participants will not accrue any further benefits for continued service 
this freeze could contribute to further over funding since the earnings on the assets that are normally applied to fund current service accruals would be entirely applied to increase the funding levels of the atu plan 
if the atu plan is over funded  the excess assets cannot be returned to the company 
the company is exploring whether it may be able to obtain general or specific relief from this requirement 
pension plan accounting treatment 
in addition to the potential impact on the company s cash flow due to funding requirements  the atu plan represents a potential risk to the company s compliance with the minimum net worth covenant in the new credit facility  particularly due to the size of the atu plan liabilities million at december  relative to the company s net worth 
generally accepted accounting principles  which are different from erisa funding requirements  require that if the liabilities of a pension fund exceeds its assets  a reduction in stockholder s equity be taken for the amount that liabilities exceed assets for any particular pension plan 
at december   the atu plan s assets exceed the liabilities by million  as measured for accounting purposes 
a substantial further decline in market interest rates  among other factors  could result in the atu plan s liabilities exceeding the atu plan s assets as measured for accounting purposes 
additionally  in the event that the atu plan s liabilities exceed assets  the prepaid pension asset related to the atu plan million at december  would be reversed and stockholder s equity would be reduced by this amount  as well 
there is no cash impact of such an event 
although management feels that it is unlikely that events would require the company to record such a charge to equity  if the company were required to record a substantial reduction to equity due to the above described pension accounting requirements  it could reduce the company s net worth below the minimum covenant levels 
in such an instance  the company would seek a waiver for the minimum net worth requirement to the extent that it is caused by a reduction to stockholder s equity related to the atu plan 
the determination of the requirement of a reduction to stockholder s equity is made on a plan by plan basis 
stockholder s equity reflects a reserve of million related to the greyhound lines  inc salaried employees defined benefit plan the salaried plan 
the related size of the salaried plan million in plan liabilities at december  does not present substantial risk to the company s net worth 
capital expenditures 
the company s operations require significant annual capital and maintenance expenditures related to the company s bus fleet  properties and systems software 
for the year ended december   the company s capital expenditures totalled million  of which million related to the purchase of buses 
during june and july  the company took delivery of new buses from mcii 
these buses were initially subject to a month to month operating lease but were purchased by the company during december the company intends to sell and lease back these buses during the first half of the company also took delivery of and purchased buses from mcii in september  and an additional buses in december these twenty three buses were sold and leased back by the company in december for net proceeds of million 
the average age of the bus fleet increased to years at december  compared to years at december   a change the company believes is immaterial 
as of december   approximately of the company s bus fleet was more than years old compared to at december  the company s experience indicates that as the age of its fleet increases  the dependability and quality of service declines  which may make the company less competitive 
while the company could continue to use older buses  the company intends  over time  to replace older  less reliable vehicles with new buses 
as a result  during the company expects to retire buses that are or more years old 
to replace these buses and to support the planned increase in the size of the bus fleet  the company expects to acquire up to new buses in at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
the company intends to finance these purchases through cash flows from operations  operating leases and vendor financing 
management believes that a continuing significant delay in acquiring these new buses could adversely affect future operations due to the higher operating costs associated with operating older buses and the inability to implement fully the company s plans to increase total bus miles 
the company s ability to finance these and other capital expenditures and to meet its other financial obligations will depend on the company s future operating performance  which will be subject to financial  economic  legal and other factors affecting the business and operations of the company  many of which are beyond its control 
although cash flows from operating activities and the new credit facility are expected to be sufficient to make a portion of the company s planned expenditures  the company s operating strategy will depend on the availability of additional sources of financing  such as operating and capital lease financing or funds provided through sales of assets or sales of securities 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain financing on suitable terms for these purposes 
certain contingencies 
the company is subject to various contingencies that could affect its liquidity position in the future 
see item legal proceedings 
financial restructuring during the fall of  the company initiated a comprehensive change to its capital structure the financial restructuring 
the financial restructuring was completed in january and consisted of i the execution of the credit facility  ii the conversion of million in aggregate principal amount of the convertible debentures into shares of common stock  and iii a rights offering the rights offering to the company s stockholders of the opportunity to subscribe for and purchase million new shares of common stock for a total consideration of million 
and results of operations the company s business is seasonal in nature and generally follows the pattern of the travel business as a whole  with peaks during the summer months and the thanksgiving and christmas holiday periods 
historically  the company has experienced substantial seasonal variances in its results of operations with the third quarter  which includes the summer peak travel season  providing the largest contribution to the company s annual operating income 
the second and fourth quarters generally reflect a net loss or reduced income  and the first quarter is typically a loss period 
however  primarily due to weak demand for the company s passenger service throughout and certain operating charges  the company experienced a significant loss during each quarter of that year 
the following table presents certain of the company s consolidated operating statistics for the three and twelve months ended december  and three months ended twelve months ended december  december  regular service miles     total bus miles     passenger miles     available seat miles     passengers carried a     average trip length miles a load factor of available seats filled yield passenger revenue per passenger mile cents passenger revenue per regular service mile dollars total operating revenue per total bus mile dollars total operating expense per total bus mile dollars cost per total bus mile cents maintenance transportation insurance and safety station costs as a of total revenue a see operating revenues for discussion of restatements charges to results of operations 
the results of operations for the year ended december   include certain operating charges of million  an interest expense adjustment of million  a tax expense adjustment of million and an extraordinary gain of million 
the inclusion of these items in the results of operations affects the comparability to the results of operations 
to facilitate comparison  the significant items that comprise these adjustments are discussed in the affected expense categories below 
operating income loss 
operating income for was million compared to an operating loss of million for operating revenues increased million or for  while operating expenses decreased million or for  compared to the operating loss for included million of certain operating charges including write down to the expected market value of certain real estate assets which were expected to be classified as surplus  charges to reflect the payment of pre claims that the bankruptcy court allowed notwithstanding that those claims previously had been barred by the court  adverse claims development in  certain litigation exposure and costs related to the company s strategic and operational reorganization 
operating revenues 
passenger service revenues increased million or for the twelve months ended december   compared to the same period in  due to increased ridership 
the following chart reflects the increase in passenger revenues by quarter for compared to the prior year first second third fourth full quarter quarter quarter quarter year passenger revenue s      passenger revenue s      percentage increase decrease the number of passengers carried increased for compared to management believes the increase in ridership resulted from the introduction of everyday low pricing  improvements in handling customer telephone calls and more convenient bus schedules 
although the short haul business has increased  the everyday low pricing strategy had a more significant impact on long distance travel producing a increase in average trip length for the company expects the trends of increasing ridership and longer average trip lengths to continue in  as well 
also contributing to higher passenger revenues was an improvement in interline activity  which reflects an increase in the number of tickets being sold by other carriers for all or a portion of the travel occurring over the routes of the company 
the company expects improvements in its interline relationships to continue 
the statistical information for has been restated from that previously published 
package express revenues declined million or in compared to package express revenues continued to decline throughout reflecting the impact of reductions in routes and terminal hours which were made in these reductions resulted in decreased convenience and level of service for the package express customers 
as a result  many customers discontinued the use of the company s package express service during late and early and began using competitors services 
in an effort to reduce this revenue decline  the company has made improvements to its service levels in the package express business by increasing hours and providing more convenient schedules to its customers 
other operating revenues increased approximately million or for compared to due primarily to an increase in interest income  which comprises of other operating revenues 
as a result of higher interest rates during  interest earned on the company s deposits increased 
prepaid ticket order revenue has also increased 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses decreased million or for compared to regular service miles operated in compared to increased by million miles or 
operating expenses for included a total of million of the certain operating charges discussed above 
maintenance costs for decreased million to million 
a primary reason for the decrease compared to were certain operating charges of million taken in  in part  to reserve for the increased costs of environmental remediation 
the remainder of the decrease relates to savings realized in building related costs repairs  utilities  etc 
due to the closure of several garages in and the closure of the new york city garage in january the impact of these savings was to reduce costs  in spite of the increase in miles operated and the slight increase in the average age of the fleet from years at december   to years at december  as a result  maintenance expenses decreased to cents per mile in versus cents per mile in  as reported  or cents per mile in  excluding the million in certain operating charges 
maintenance costs  on a per mile basis  during the first six months of may exceed current levels due to the company s efforts to accelerate engine changes during this off peak season for buses that are projected to have engine failures during the busy summer period  when seasonal demands require high utilization of the entire bus fleet 
transportation expenses increased million or in compared to  due in part to an increase of million bus miles operated 
on a comparable cost per mile basis  the added miles represented approximately million of the increase 
the remainder of the increase is due to increases in the year over year cost per mile for transportation expenses  which increased from cents per mile in to cents per mile in the increase in the cost per mile reflects a contractually specified increase in drivers wages  an increase in room rents due primarily to limited availability of the new new york dormitory  and increased driver hiring and training due to the greater schedule offerings in driver hiring and training contributed million to the variance for the year ended december   compared to the same period in agents commissions and station costs increased million or in compared to the company handled million or more telephone calls in than in the company achieved the improved call handling by opening a new telephone center and improving staffing levels in its other center 
as a result  telephone information salaries and communication costs reflect million of the increase in this expense category 
ticket commission expenses have increased due to the general increase in sales compared to and the conversion of company operated facilities to commission agencies 
although the ticket commission expense increased as a result of these conversions  it was offset by a related decrease in payroll  facility costs  utilities and supplies since those became the responsibility of the agent upon conversion 
interline commissions paid have also risen due to an increase in the number of interline tickets honored by the company in during  certain operating charges of million were recorded in agents commission and station costs which relate primarily to the writeoff of certain receivables 
marketing  advertising and traffic costs decreased million or in compared to  due primarily to a planned spending reduction in in direct advertising expenditures 
management plans an increase in advertising spending in compared to principally to cover an increase in advertising rates  as well as  the impact of a full year of advertising in in contrast to which reflected very little advertising spending during the first quarter 
insurance and safety costs decreased million or in compared to the decrease is primarily due to certain operating charges in of million which related primarily to charges recorded to increase reserve levels for bankruptcy claims previously considered barred and adverse claims development in baggage claims expense decreased by million in compared to  due to a new baggage handling policy put into place in october which has reduced the number of baggage claims and also the payout on baggage claims 
the automobile and general liability expense increased due to the additional claims exposure related to the increased miles operated  as well as to the impact of a change in the company s claims management strategy 
a significant component of the claims management strategy is to settle claims more quickly 
this strategy is expected to reduce insurance claims expense for automobile and general liability over the longer term 
additionally  the company has begun the implementation of a safety and loss reduction program that management believes will generate additional savings over the longer term 
however  management continues to monitor trends in exposure and to review the adequacy of related reserves in light of any changes in exposure or claims experience 
general and administrative expenses increased million or in compared to  due in part to a million accrual for expense related to the company s management incentive plan in there was no similar expense recorded during also  pension income was million or lower in than in further  accounting salaries increased in compared to due to the increased use of temporaries and increased headcounts 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in group insurance expenses over due to a reduction in both the employee and company related portions of these expenses  and a decrease in legal expenses of million due to reduced outside counsel fees in depreciation and amortization decreased by million or in compared to  primarily due to an operating charge of million taken in to recognize impairment of certain operating facilities which were less than fully utilized 
this favorable variance is partially offset by a full year of depreciation in on buses purchased in mid in addition  during the fourth quarter of a million charge was recorded to write down to realizable value some older  high maintenance buses and certain real estate which will be sold 
operating taxes and licenses increased million or in compared to  in part  as a result of a reserve recorded in the first quarter of for past sales taxes potentially owed on interstate bus tickets sold in oklahoma 
payroll related taxes have increased in due primarily to increased driver and telephone center headcounts 
fuel and oil taxes have increased in compared to due to the increase in miles run by the company 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in real estate taxes due to the closure of the new york city garage in early january  a lower valuation of the chicago maintenance facility for property tax purposes  and a refund received from new york for a settlement of property taxes 
operating rental expense decreased million or in compared to  primarily due to the closing of several maintenance facilities 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in station rents  primarily for the new york terminal where the company pays a portion of its rent based on ticket sales which were up over levels 
casual rents for buses increased million due to the increased ridership during peak periods 
operating rental expense for leased buses was million for and million for other operating expenses decreased million or in compared to included in are certain operating charges of million  which relate to a million write down taken to reflect the expected market value of real estate properties which were not being utilized by the company and were expected to be sold 
additionally  the company reevaluated all software and systems on its books 
this reevaluation resulted in million in charges to write off certain systems which  due to operational changes in  have limited or no functionality 
in late  the company also discontinued use of the vorad radar detection system because an extensive investment would have been required to upgrade and maintain its effectiveness 
additionally  other operating expenses in were reduced by a million gain on the repurchase of the senior notes 
interest expense 
for the year ended december   interest expense was million compared to million in interest expense included net expense of million in and net savings of million in resulting from the interest rate swap agreements entered into during see capital resources and liquidity 
interest expense decreased million or in compared to  due to a million interest reduction related to the conversion of the convertible debentures see financial restructuring 
this reduction was offset by increased expense paid on an installment note relating to bus purchase financing entered into during mid also offsetting the reduction is the interest component of a settlement with the internal revenue service for adjustments to the  and federal tax returns 
the weighted average of the company s effective interest rates on long term debt outstanding as of december   was income taxes 
during the third quarter of  the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset was increased to reserve for the remaining million deferred tax asset 
due to the uncertainty as a result of the restructuring  the company believed it no longer met the more likely than not realization criteria of sfas no 
in  the company did not record any tax benefit 
the income tax expense for results from the settlement of the through irs audit and state income taxes 
at december   the company s net deferred tax assets total million  less a valuation allowance of the same amount 
future use of the deferred tax asset would normally reflect the recognition of tax expense and an equal benefit due to the reversal of the valuation allowance  resulting in no net impact to the company s net earnings 
however  million of the deferred tax asset arose prior to the fresh start date and  as a result  the reversal of the related valuation allowance will increase capital in excess of par  rather than reduce tax expense 
the financial restructuring at december   resulted in an ownership change  as defined under section of the internal revenue code the code 
the provisions of the code  as they apply to the company  require that an annual limitation be placed on the amount of net operating loss nol existing at december   which may be utilized 
consequently  the company s nol carryforwards from and prior tax years are now subject to an annual limitation of million 
any unused portion of the current annual limitation may be carried forward to the following year 
as a result  the company had million in nol carryforwards available at december  the company estimates a nol for of million 
none of the nol is subject to limitation under section the company will also carry forward the unused annual limitation of million from the nol carryover 
the company now has million in nol carryovers to  million of which is subject to the annual million limitation 
extraordinary item 
the company recorded an extraordinary loss of million during  for the write off of debt issue costs related to the prior credit facility  and an additional million of extraordinary loss for professional fees related to the financial restructuring 
the extraordinary loss was offset by a million extraordinary gain on the conversion of the convertible debentures to common stock recorded in the fourth quarter of and results of operations for  the company had an operating loss of million  which included million in certain operating charges  compared to million in operating income for those charges related to the write down to the expected market value of certain real estate assets which were expected to be classified as surplus  charges to reflect the payment of pre claims that the bankruptcy court allowed notwithstanding that those claims previously had been barred by the court  adverse claims development in  certain litigation exposure  and costs related to the company s strategic and operational reorganization 
in addition  in the third quarter of  the company recorded a noncash  non operating charge when it fully reserved its million deferred tax asset 
the company also incurred a million extraordinary loss for the write off of deferred financing charges related to the prior credit agreement  which the company refinanced in october that extraordinary loss was offset by a million extraordinary gain resulting from the conversion of million of convertible debentures in the financial restructuring 
operating revenues 
regular route revenues declined million or in compared to overall demand for the company s passenger service declined as reflected in a decrease in passengers carried of million or in compared to in an effort to increase ridership  under previous management  an aggressive advertising campaign offering discounted fares was initiated early in which continued through the third quarter 
although ridership began to increase  the lower fares resulted in lower yields revenue per passenger mile and did not produce revenue equal to the prior year 
package express delivery service revenues declined million or in compared to package express revenues continued to decline in due to intense competition in the package express delivery service business from overnight carriers and the de emphasis by the company of this service 
food services revenues increased million or in compared to however  cost of goods sold for food services also increased million or in compared to in  the company opened new locations and closed non profitable locations 
additionally  in an effort to gain control over the quality of service provided in the terminals  the company converted locations  during through  from agent operated to company operated locations 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses increased by million or in compared to despite a slight increase in regular service miles operated for the year  maintenance costs continued to decline in as a result of a reduction of fleet age  successful efforts to reduce overhead including downsizing certain garage locations to service islands  and increased training and more efficient use of maintenance personnel 
the decrease in maintenance expenses was partially offset by million in certain operating charges 
transportation costs showed only a slight increase of million in compared to due primarily to an increase in drivers wages 
agents commissions and station costs decreased million primarily due to decreased ticket commissions and salaries 
ticket commissions decreased primarily due to a decrease in ticket sales and the conversion of certain terminals operated by independent contractors to company operated terminals during during  terminals were converted to company operated terminals 
during  the company returned of the smaller locations to agent operated terminals when it was determined that the conversion process was no longer profitable at the smaller locations 
also  salaries decreased as a result of the company s elimination of certain field management positions in a continuing effort to reduce overhead 
these decreases in costs were partially offset by million in certain charges primarily due to the write off of certain receivables 
marketing expenses increased million in compared to advertising expense for the year ended december   was million which was a million increase compared to an aggressive advertising campaign was initiated in the first quarter of in an effort to improve traffic following the california earthquake and severe winter weather in the northeast  and in response to the generally weak demand for the company s passenger services 
this advertising campaign continued into the third quarter 
also  communication costs related to trips increased million because trips was operational for a full year in and only on a limited basis in in addition  approximately manual field locations were converted to trips sites 
insurance and safety costs increased million in compared to this increase was primarily due to certain operating charges of million which adjusted insurance reserves to recognize the pre bankruptcy claims previously barred by the courts and adverse claims development in charges were also included to reflect other potential legal exposures 
general and administrative expenses increased million in compared to this is due to an increase in salaries as a result of severance packages and overall wage increases resulting from moving the company s accounting center from west des moines to dallas 
additionally  information systems costs have increased as trips was functional for a full year in and only a partial year in which increased equipment lease costs and usage fees 
offsetting these increased expenses is a net million increase in pension income as compared to depreciation and amortization costs increased million in compared to excluding charges of million  depreciation expense decreased million resulting from fewer buses owned than in the prior year due to sale leaseback transactions 
the million was recorded to recognize impairment of certain properties which are less than fully utilized 
operating rents increased million in compared to  caused primarily by the increase in leased bus rental expense relating to the sale leaseback of buses in december and buses in march operating rental expense for leased buses for the years ended december  and  was million and million  respectively  excluding casual rents and other short term leases during peak periods 
other operating expenses increased million in compared to primarily due to certain operating charges 
these charges included million in write downs taken to reflect the expected market value of real estate properties which were no longer being utilized by the company and which were expected to be sold 
additionally  the company reevaluated all software and systems on its books 
this reevaluation resulted in million in charges to write off certain systems which  due to current year operational changes  have limited or no functionality 
in late  the company discontinued use of the vorad radar detection system because an extensive investment would have been required to upgrade and maintain its effectiveness 
expenses of million were recorded during related to the company s strategic and operational reorganization 
this amount consists primarily of severance costs related to management overhead reductions 
interest expense 
for the year ended december   interest expense was million compared to million in interest expense included net savings of million in and million in resulting from the interest rate swap agreements entered into during the company amended its two remaining interest rate swap agreements on october   to lock in the future payments under the agreements until maturity in july the net result of the amendments is to ensure that these swaps will not be subject to interest rate risk 
consequently  should interest rates increase  the company s payments under the agreements would not be adversely affected 
conversely  should interest rates decline  the company would not receive any benefit 
income taxes 
for the quarter ended march   the company recorded an income tax benefit of million as a result of its pre tax loss and increased its deferred tax asset 
at that time  projections indicated that it was more likely than not that the income tax benefit would be utilized to offset future period income tax expense 
at june   projections were revised  and the company expected to have a net loss for the year  due  in part  to its strategic and operational reorganization 
as a result  there was less of a likelihood that the company would utilize the income tax benefit  recognized during the first quarter and therefore  the income tax benefit recorded for the quarter ended march   was reversed during the second quarter 
in addition  as the projected losses continued to grow during the third quarter  the company concluded that the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset should be increased to reserve for the remaining million asset 
due to the uncertainty as a result of the financial restructuring and the ongoing strategic and operational reorganization by the company  the company believed it no longer met the more likely than not realization criteria of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 

in addition  the company did not provide an income tax benefit on the loss for the year ended december  at december   the company s net deferred tax assets totaled million  less a valuation allowance of the same amount 
future use of the deferred tax asset would normally reflect the recognition of tax expense and an equal benefit due to the reversal of the valuation allowance  resulting in no net impact to the company s net earnings 
however  million of the deferred tax asset arose prior to the fresh start date  and as a result  the reversal of the related valuation allowance will be used to increase capital in excess of par  rather than reduce tax expense 
the financial restructuring generated significant amounts of income from discharge of indebtedness dod income for income tax purposes 
the dod income was offset by losses  thus eliminating the tax exposure created by the financial restructuring 
the financial restructuring also resulted in an ownership change  as defined under section of the internal revenue code the code 
the provisions of the code  as they apply to the company  require that an annual limitation be placed on the amount of net operating loss nol existing at december   which may be utilized
