material  labor and other production costs increased in and were of net sales 
in addition to the impact of higher cost products  the cost of greeting card cabinets and point of purchase displays in the united states increased by million in to support both new customers and the expanded product offerings 
the corporation s practice is to charge the cost of these cabinets and displays to expense when they are shipped to customers 
material  labor and other production costs also reflected slower than expected integration of the corporation s north american plan 
this plan  which was initiated in  included the conversion of the canadian production facility to the just in time manufacturing processes used in the united states 
the progress on this conversion did not occur as quickly as originally anticipated  resulting in unfavorable product cost variances 
without these variances  material  labor and other production costs would have been of net sales in in  these costs were of net sales  down from in the improvement in reflected higher selling prices and a product mix which included more lower cost card products than in selling  distribution and marketing expenses increased from to after increasing from to in  the increase in amortization of deferred costs and other competitive expenses was tempered by the control of other selling  distribution and marketing costs 
these deferred costs result from the payment of competitive advances under the corporation s agreements with certain retail customers 
see note c to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of deferred costs related to customer agreements 
selling  distribution and marketing expenses other than amortization of deferred costs and other competitive expenses increased just in compared to a increase in in addition to the impact of general cost control measures  selling expenses reflected the sale of the corporation s retail operations in the united kingdom in september  as a result of this transaction  million of selling expenses were not incurred in the corporation s advertising costs  which are expensed as incurred  were million in  million in and million in the increase in was primarily due to an expansion of the cooperative advertising program

administrative and general expenses decreased million or in expense for the united states profit sharing plan decreased million as a result of the lower pre tax income in in  this expense was million  comparable to the expense 
the reduction in profit sharing expense in was partially offset by the increase in the pre tax costs of corporate owned life insurance 
these cost increases of million in and million in were less than the increase in the related tax benefits which are reflected in the corporation s effective tax rate 
administrative and general expenses in also included a million loss related to an investment accounted for under the equity method 
this loss resulted from a restructuring charge incurred in december  by the company in which the corporation holds the investment 
in the third quarter of  the corporation adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
this statement requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in november   the corporation determined that the trends in the creatacard business indicated that the undiscounted future cash flows from that business would be less than the carrying value of the long lived assets related to that business 
as a result  the corporation recognized a pre tax  non cash loss of million for the asset impairment 
after the effect of income taxes  the loss was million or 
cents per share 
see note b to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the impairment loss 
in  interest expense increased million after remaining level between and this increase was due to the growth in inventories required to support the increased sales of non card products and higher payments made under agreements with certain retailers

the effective tax rate in was  lower than both the and rates which were and  respectively 
the rate in was negatively impacted by the asset impairment loss  which included the write down of nondeductible goodwill 
excluding the impairment loss  the effective rate was 
the decrease in each year was due to higher tax benefits of the corporate owned life insurance which resulted from non taxable death benefits and increases in cash surrender value of the policies which exceeded the related premium and interest expenses 
in  net income including the impact of the asset impairment loss recognized upon the adoption of sfas no 
was million or per share 
however  without this non recurring charge  net income would have been million or per share compared to net income of million or per share 
in  net income was million which included a one time charge of million or 
per share associated with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions and a one time benefit of million or 
per share resulting from the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources the financial condition of the corporation remained strong in operating cash flows and credit facilities were employed to fund both the growth of new products and markets and to sustain existing market share 
one such use was the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of the john sands group  the largest greeting card business in australia and new zealand effective january  the impact of this transaction is described in more detail in the discussion of cash flows related to investing and financing activities 
cash flow from operations was million in compared to million in and million in the lower operating cash flow in was due to higher levels of accounts receivable  inventories and cash payments related to deferred costs 
in  increases in inventories were offset by a slower growth in accounts receivable and deferred costs 
trade accounts receivable increased million from the end of and reflected the strong fourth quarter sales which increased over the fourth quarter of as a percent of net sales  accounts receivable were  comparable to the in in  accounts receivable were of net sales 
the improvement in this percent in both and reflected the effective management of extended payment terms which had increased in inventories at the end of represented of material  labor and other production costs for the year 
excluding the impact of the inventories acquired as part of the john sands purchase and the partial year of costs related to this business  inventory would have been of material  labor and other production costs in this percent was in and in the increase in was due primarily to the growth in non card product inventory  which has a higher cost than greeting cards  to support expanding sales 
the higher inventory balances at the end of were due to increases in finished goods in the united states and advance purchases of paper for gift wrap production 
in  funding of agreements with certain retailers increased 
cash advances under these agreements net of related amortization increased million in after decreasing million from to cash advances in were made in connection with both new and existing agreements 
the timing of the payments under these agreements is subject to a number of factors and year to year fluctuations are not a reliable indication of the cash which can be required in any particular year 
although the actual cash payments may vary  the resultant deferred costs are amortized over the effective period of the agreement 
the total commitments under the agreements are capitalized as deferred costs when the agreements are consummated 
future payment commitments are recorded as liabilities at that time 
commitments under existing agreements at the end of were million with million due within the next year 
see note c to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of deferred costs related to certain customer agreements 
effective january   the corporation acquired substantially all of the assets from the john sands group for million in cash 
this acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and the purchase price was allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities based upon their fair market values at the date of acquisition 
results of operations were included prospectively from the acquisition date 
the acquisition was not significant to the financial position or results of operations of the corporation 
capital expenditures were million in  down from million in and million in the decreases in both and were due to the impact of the creatacard business 
the mass introduction of these machines occurred in and early the expenditures were primarily for the automation of distribution systems and the replacement and upgrade of manufacturing equipment 
capital expenditures for are expected to approximate million 
the corporation s investment in corporate owned life insurance did not have a significant impact on cash flow from investing activities in or as policy loans offset increases in cash surrender value in both years 
in  additional policy loans  net of the increase in cash surrender value  provided million of cash 
other investing activities used million more cash in than in and has increased million from this increase was due primarily to investments related to expanded product offerings 
financing activities  which provided million of cash in  included an increase in long term debt to fund the purchase of assets from the john sands group 
the increase in long term debt also reflected a shift in canadian borrowings from short term to long term 
in  financing activities used million less cash due to the repayment in of the corporation s million notes with funds on hand 
debt as a percent of total capitalization increased to in from in and in see note d to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the corporation s credit facilities 
the corporation s operations are funded through operating cash flow and credit facilities for both domestic and foreign businesses which are expected to meet currently anticipated funding requirements 
the seasonal nature of the business results in peak working capital requirements which are financed primarily through short term borrowings 
factors that may affect future results the corporation believes it has the products  service and financial strength to maintain our long term record of strong sales and profitability 
however  future revenue and margin trends are difficult to predict 
the corporation sells its products primarily to customers in the retail trade and is well represented in a wide variety of channels of distribution  such as mass merchandisers  drug stores and supermarkets 
however  this business environment is highly competitive and may be subject to fluctuations in the strength of the retailers 
although the greeting card business has  historically  not been significantly impacted by economic downturns  changes in consumer buying patterns may impact results 
consolidation among retailers  including acquisitions and bankruptcies  may also impact future results 
the competitiveness in the industry has also resulted in a substantial investment in deferred costs related to agreements with certain retailers 
these agreements are entered into to expand and maintain the corporation s business with retail customers when a long term business relationship is advantageous and have contributed to the corporation s growth 
the financial condition of retail customers involved in these agreements is evaluated and monitored to reduce risk
