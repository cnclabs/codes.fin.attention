financial condition  liquidity and capital resources the company believes it has adequate financial resources and sufficient credit lines to meet its working capital needs 
at september   the company had available cash and cash equivalents of million 
inventories including finished homes and construction in progress  residential lots developed and under development  and land had increased by  to million  from million at september  the increase was due to higher business activity and the fact that the company was operating in a greater number of markets and subdivisions 
in several markets  the company is limited in its ability to acquire finished lots under option contracts  which results in an increase in residential lot inventory 
the company financed the inventory increase by borrowing under credit facilities  retaining earnings  and the million net proceeds of a public stock offering in january the company s ratio of notes payable to total capital decreased to at september   from at september  the equity to total assets ratio increased during the year to at september   from at september  the company s financing needs depend upon the results of its operations  sales volume  inventory levels  inventory turnover  and acquisitions of other homebuilding companies

beginning in  the company began acquiring the principal assets of other homebuilding companies  and had made three acquisitions through september  two additional acquisitions were completed in october and december of  the first three months of the company s fiscal year 
to date  all acquisitions have been for cash with the assumption of certain liabilities  typically trade accounts and notes payable 
the acquisitions have been funded through working capital and borrowings under existing credit facilities 
during april  the company entered a new facility with eight financial institutions to provide unsecured borrowings

the completion of the public sale of common stock in january and the new credit facilities provide the company with a strong financial position  with resources adequate to fund near term growth objectives

it is anticipated that future home construction  lot and land purchases and acquisitions will be funded through internally generated funds and new and existing lending relationships 
the company continuously evaluates its capital structure and in the future  may seek to increase unsecured debt and obtain additional equity to further solidify the capital structure or to provide funds for acquisitions 
except for ordinary expenditures for the construction of homes and  to a limited extent  the acquisition of land and lots for development and sale of homes  at september   the company had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
inflation the company  as well as the homebuilding industry in general  may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation  primarily because of higher land and construction costs 
inflation also increases the company s financing  labor and material costs 
in addition  higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers 
the company attempts to pass through to its customers any increases in its costs through increased sales prices and  to date  inflation has not had a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
however  there is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on the company s future results of operations
