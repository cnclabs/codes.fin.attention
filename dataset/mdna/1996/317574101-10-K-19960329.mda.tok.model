investments as of december   the company s investment assets totaled million  as compared to million as of december  the increase is primarily attributable to unrealized capital gains in the fixed maturities for sale segment of the company s total investments

this unrealized gain principally reflects changes in interest rates from the date the respective investments were purchased 
to reduce the exposure to interest rate changes  portfolio investments are selected so that diversity  maturity and liquidity factors approximate the duration of associated policyholder liabilities 
the assets held by family life must comply with applicable state insurance laws and regulations 
in selecting investments for the portfolios of its life insurance subsidiaries  the company s emphasis is to obtain targeted profit margins  while minimizing the exposure to changing interest rates 
this objective is implemented by selecting primarily short to medium term  investment grade fixed income securities 
in making such portfolio selections  the company generally does not select new investments which are commonly referred to as high yield or non investment grade 
the fixed maturities portfolio of family life  as of december   consisted solely of fixed maturities investments which  in the annual statements of the companies  as filed with state insurance departments  were designated under the national association of insurance commissioners naic rating system as a highest quality 
as of december   approximately of the fixed maturities portfolio consisted of investments with an naic rating of and the remaining portion were designated with an naic rating of high quality 
management believes that the absence of high yield or non investment grade investments as defined above in the portfolios of its life insurance subsidiary enhances the ability of the company to service its debt  provide security to its policyholders and to credit relatively consistent rates of return to its policyholders
