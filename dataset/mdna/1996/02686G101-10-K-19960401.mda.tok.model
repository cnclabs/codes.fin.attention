the coinsurance lender is prohibited from entering into any workout arrangement with the borrower without the partnership s consent and must file a claim for coinsurance benefits with hud  upon default  if the partnership so directs 
as an ongoing hud approved coinsurance lender  and under the terms of the participation documents  the coinsurance lender is required to satisfy certain minimum net worth requirements as set forth by hud 
however  it is possible that the coinsurance lender s potential liability for loss on these developments  and others  could exceed its hud required minimum net worth

mortgage investment income remained relatively constant for as compared to part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued general and administrative expenses decreased for as compared to this decrease was primarily a result of non recurring payroll expenses and professional fees incurred in connection with the disposition of hazeltine shores  pinewood park apartments and hamlet at cobb s landing during also contributing to the decrease was a one time payment in for the partnership s initial listing on the american stock exchange 
provision for settlement of litigation decreased for as compared to due to the recognition of a non recurring provision for settlement of litigation  as discussed below 
net gains on mortgage dispositions increased for as compared to gains or losses on mortgage dispositions are based on the number  carrying amounts and proceeds of mortgage investments disposed of during the period 
during  the partnership recognized aggregate gains of approximately million related to the settlement of the coinsurance claims on pinewood park apartments and hamlet at cobb s landing and the prepayment of the mortgage on gilbert greens apartments 
this compares to the recognition in of a gain of approximately million related to the settlement of the coinsurance claim on hazeltine shores  and a loss of approximately  in connection with the disposition of the mortgage on ashbury meadows apartments 
versus net earnings increased for as compared to primarily as a result of an increase in net gains from mortgage dispositions  and a decrease in loan losses as described below 
these amounts were partially offset by a decrease in mortgage investment income and an increase in general and administrative expenses and the provision for settlement of litigation  as discussed below 
mortgage investment income decreased for as compared to this decrease was primarily due to income recognized on the hazeltine shores claim which was classified as interest and other income in and as mortgage investment income in also contributing to the decrease in mortgage investment income was a reduction in mortgage interest rates on acquired insured mortgages purchased in and as compared to the mortgage interest rates on insured mortgages which were disposed of during and the decrease was also attributable to the timing of the reinvestment of net proceeds from mortgage dispositions and settlement of the coinsurance claim on hazeltine shores 
interest and other income increased for as compared to primarily due to the recognition of interest from the hazeltine shores claim for insurance benefits  as discussed above 
also contributing to the increase was interest earned from the short term investment of net disposition proceeds prior to reinvestment in acquired insured mortgages 
asset management fees to related parties increased for compared to primarily as a result of the continued funding of construction loan advances 
general and administrative expenses increased for as compared to this increase was primarily a result of increased payroll expenses related to the management of the partnership s coinsured loans and costs incurred in connection with the disposition of hazeltine shores  pinewood park apartments  and hamlet at cobb s landing during partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in legal and professional fees  as a result of the settlement of litigation  as discussed below

liquidity and capital resources the partnership s operating cash receipts  derived from payments of principal and interest on insured mortgages  plus cash receipts from interest on short term investments  were sufficient during to meet operating requirements 
the basis for paying distributions to unitholders is cash flow from operations  which includes regular interest income and principal from insured mortgages  and gains  if any  from mortgage dispositions 
although the insured mortgages yield a fixed monthly mortgage payment once purchased  the cash distributions paid to the unitholders will vary during each quarter due to the fluctuating yields in the short term money market where the monthly mortgage payments received are temporarily invested prior to the payment of quarterly distributions  the reduction in the asset base and monthly mortgage payments due to monthly mortgage payments received or mortgage dispositions  variations in the cash flow attributable to the delinquency or default of insured mortgages and professional fees and foreclosure and acquisition costs incurred in connection with those insured mortgages and variations in the partnership s operating expenses 
if necessary  the partnership has the right to establish reserves either from the net proceeds of the offering or from cash flow as defined in the partnership agreement 
it should be noted  however  that the partnership also has the right to reinvest the proceeds of mortgage prepayments  sales  and insurance in acquired insured mortgages through december  and generally intends to distribute substantially all of its cash flow from operations 
if any reserves are deemed to be necessary by the partnership  they will be invested in short term  interest bearing investments 
the partnership anticipates that reserves generally would only be necessary in the event the partnership elected to foreclose on an originated insured mortgage insured by fha and take over the operations of the underlying development 
in such case  there may be a need for additional capital 
since foreclosure proceedings can be expensive and time consuming  the partnership expects that it will generally assign the fully insured originated insured mortgages to hud for insurance proceeds rather than initiate foreclosure 
in the case of an originated insured mortgage insured under the hud coinsurance program  the likelihood of foreclosure part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued and the potential need for reserves exists since these coinsured mortgages generally cannot be assigned to hud and the coinsurance lender would be required to acquire title to the property and hold the property for months or until an earlier sale in order to realize the benefit of hud insurance 
the determination of whether to assign the mortgage to hud or institute foreclosure proceedings or whether to set aside any reserves will be made on a case by case basis by the general partner  the advisor and the sub advisor 
as of december  and  the partnership had not set aside any reserves 
cash flow versus net cash provided by operating activities increased for as compared to primarily due to an increase in receivables and other assets during as a result of the disposition of the properties underlying the coinsured mortgages on pinewood park apartments  hazeltine shores and hamlet at cobb s landing  as discussed above 
also contributing to the increase was a decrease in payments made and treated as an addition to ahfs and due from hud during  as compared to  as well as a decrease in general and administrative costs  as previously discussed
