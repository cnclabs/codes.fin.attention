item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
all per share amounts in the following discussion have been restated to reflect a stock dividend paid by the company on november  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
general the company s core businesses are somewhat seasonal with the first fiscal quarter experiencing generally lower sales and earnings due to reduced demand from customers during the period 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the converted products and paperboard industries are also somewhat cyclical due to industry supply and demand factors and tend to fluctuate with the general business cycle of the us economy 
the company s operations are fixed cost intensive 
the company s converting operations do not have the ability to mitigate the effects of high fixed costs because the company s converted products are sold exclusively to third parties 
as a result  unit production costs and earnings from converted products generally vary significantly with shipment levels 
however  as a result of its vertical integration  the company can maintain operating rates at the company s paperboard mills during periods of reduced demand for recycled paperboard because the company s paperboard mills can supply an increased portion of the recycled paperboard consumed by the company s converting operations 
the company s strategy has been to operate its paperboard mills at high operating rates in order to lower unit production costs 
through the first nine months of calendar and during calendar years and  the company s paperboard mills ran at operating rates of and and  respectively  and maintained relatively constant fixed unit production costs 
historically  costs of recovered paper  virgin paperboard and containerboard  the company s principal raw materials  have fluctuated significantly due to market conditions 
the cost of recovered paper generally decreased from fiscal through fiscal  increased significantly beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal through the third quarter of fiscal  decreased significantly beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal through the second quarter of fiscal and have remained fairly stable for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal the company is not able to predict whether recovered paper costs will rise or fall in the future 
the company seeks to manage its raw materials costs through the following measures 
first  the company s ongoing modernization of its manufacturing facilities has reduced waste  which has helped reduce raw materials costs 
second  the company has sought to maximize its use of the expertise developed by the recycled fiber division s recovered paper buyers in order to purchase recovered paper at lower costs 
third  the company has invested in equipment that has enabled it to use lower cost grades of recovered paper in the production of its recycled paperboard while maintaining the high quality of the end product 
segment data the company operates in two industry segments converted products and paperboard 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the converted products segment is comprised of facilities that produce folding cartons  fiber partitions  corrugated containers  corrugated displays  thermoformed plastic products and laminated paperboard products 
the paperboard segment consists of facilities that manufacture recycled clay coated and uncoated paperboard and that collect recovered paper 
intersegment sales are accounted for at prices that approximate market prices

net sales for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal this decrease resulted from reduced customer demand and reduced selling prices  which were offset partially by sales increases resulting from the acquisitions of olympic packaging  inc olympic and alliance display and packaging alliance during january see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
net sales aggregate converted products segment 
net sales of converted products before intersegment eliminations for fiscal increased to million from million for fiscal this increase was primarily the result of the acquisitions of alliance and olympic during january  which was partially offset by reduced customer demand for converted products 
net sales aggregate paperboard segment 
net sales of paperboard before intersegment eliminations for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal this decrease resulted from a decrease in tons shipped and a decrease in average selling prices for fiscal the decrease in tons shipped was primarily the result of i a reduction by several outside customers of their purchases of paperboard manufactured by the company as they increased consumption of internally manufactured paperboard and ii reduced customer demand 
average paperboard prices decreased throughout fiscal and increased throughout fiscal cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for fiscal decreased to from for fiscal the decrease in cost of goods sold and cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of a decrease in the cost of raw materials including recovered paper 
substantially all us inventories of the company are valued at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on the last in  first out lifo inventory valuation method  which management believes generally results in a better matching of current costs and revenues than under the first in  first out fifo inventory valuation method 
in periods of decreasing costs  the lifo method generally results in lower cost of goods sold than under the fifo method 
in periods of increasing costs  the results are generally the opposite 
since some of the company s competitors principally use the fifo method  the following supplemental data is presented to illustrate the comparative effect of lifo and fifo accounting on the company s results of operations 
cost of goods sold determined under the lifo method was million lower and million higher than it would have been under the fifo method for fiscal and  respectively 
net income was million 
per share higher and million 
per share lower than it would have been under the fifo method for fiscal and  respectively 
these supplemental fifo earnings reflect the after tax effect of lifo each year

gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal increased to million from million for fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of the decreased cost of recovered paper  the company s primary raw material  and increased manufacturing efficiencies in the company s laminated paperboard products converting division and at the company s missisquoi mill in vermont  which were partially offset by the impact of reduced volumes in several divisions and nonrecurring severance and other expenses related to a facility closure and consolidation plan

per share after taxes consisting primarily of employee severance  employee relocation and training costs  asset impairment  equipment and inventory relocation costs and lease termination costs related to a facility closure and consolidation plan 
this plan involved the closing of the company s laminated recycled paperboard book cover panels operation in lynchburg  virginia and the relocation of such operations to other rock tenn manufacturing facilities  the conversion of the company s vineland  new jersey recycled paperboard partition plant to a manufacturer of book cover panels and other recycled paperboard products  the closing of the macon  georgia partition plant and the start up of a recently purchased partition plant in hartwell  georgia to absorb some of the vineland and most of the macon  georgia partition production

expenditures for environmental compliance the company does not believe that future compliance with environmental and health and safety laws and regulations will have any material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition 
however  environmental  health and safety laws and regulations are becoming increasingly more stringent 
consequently  unforeseen expenditures required to comply with such laws and regulations  including remediation costs  or unforeseen environmental liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  the company cannot with certainty assess at this time the impact upon its operations or capital expenditure requirements of the future emissions standards and enforcement practices under the amendments to the clean air act 
however  although there can be no assurance  the company believes that any such impact or capital expenditures will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company may choose to modify or replace the coal fired boilers at two of its facilities in order to operate cost effectively while complying with emissions regulations under the clean air act

based upon information currently available  the company believes that it has no material liability at this site 
however  there can be no assurance that such lagoon  together with the landfill  will not be added to the npl as a superfund site or that the company will not be required to conduct some remediation in the future 
based upon currently available information and the opinions of the company s environmental compliance managers and general counsel  although there can be no assurance  the company believes that any liability it may have at any site will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations

the company has changed its method of depreciation for machinery and equipment placed in service after september  to the straight line method 
this change will be applied on a prospective basis to such assets acquired after that date 
the company s previous policy of depreciation for additions of machinery and equipment was the declining balance method 
assets placed in service prior to the effective date of the change continue to be depreciated using accelerated methods 
the company changed its method of depreciation based upon management s shift in operating style over the last several years to focus on capital and technological improvements and related changes in maintenance  management s belief that straight line provides a better matching of costs and revenues and the fact that the straight line method is the predominant industry practice 
given the company s circumstances  management believes the straight line method is preferable 
there is no cumulative effect of this change 
assuming the company implements the million capital expenditures contemplated by its fiscal capital expenditure budget  depreciation expense related to these expenditures in fiscal under the straight line method would be approximately million compared to approximately million under the declining balance method 
the effect of this would be to increase earnings per share by 
after taxes
