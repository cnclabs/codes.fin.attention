the company s operations in japan aflac japan and the united states aflac us service the two principal markets for the company s insurance operations 
aflac japan and aflac us are the primary components for this discussion and analysis due to their significance to the company s consolidated financial condition and results of operations

net earnings increased in each year of the three year period ended december  the increases reflected strong earnings in the functional currencies of aflac s core insurance operations in japan and the united states  improved earnings by the aflac broadcast division in and  a consolidated benefit from additional investment income associated with profit repatriations from aflac japan to aflac us  and reduced income tax expense beginning in resulting from a tax rate reduction in japan 
partially offsetting the increases were higher corporate expenses and increased interest expense from the company s stock repurchase program in and however  the repurchase program benefited earnings per share 
earnings in and benefited from capitalized interest due to construction of the company s administrative office building in japan  which was completed in early due to the relative size of aflac japan  fluctuations in the foreign currency markets can have a significant effect on the company s reported results 
from through  the reported results in us dollars for aflac japan and the company s consolidated earnings were aided by favorable currency translations from yen to dollars 
the continued strength of the japanese yen caused our yen based earnings to be translated for reporting purposes into a greater amount of dollars during each year of the three year period when compared with the results for each preceding year 
as a result of the strengthening yen  operating earnings per share excluding realized investment gains losses increased to in  to in and to in the strengthening of the yen benefited operating earnings by approximately

per share in compared with however  the company sets its objective for growth in operating earnings per share before the effect of foreign currency fluctuations 
excluding the effect of currency fluctuations  operating earnings per share increased  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the yen began to weaken in relation to the dollar in the third quarter of and most currency commentators expect it to remain weaker in than in a weaker yen has a negative effect on net earnings reported in us dollars 
however  all of aflac japan s premiums and most of its investment income are received in yen  and its claims and expenses are paid in yen 
also  the majority of its invested assets are denominated in yen 
therefore  the translation of results from yen into us dollars does not affect aflac japan s financial condition or its results of operations in real economic terms 
the company s objective for is to increase operating earnings per share by  excluding the effect of currency translation 
however  if that objective is achieved and the yen dollar exchange rate averages compared with the average rate of  operating earnings per share including foreign currency translation would increase by in aflac japan s pretax operating earnings excluding realized investment gains losses in yen increased  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the reported us dollar exh results for aflac japan were affected by the increasingly favorable cumulative average yen to dollar exchange rates of in  in and in as a result  percentage increases in us dollars for aflac japan s pretax operating earnings were in  in and in the company s effective income tax rates were in both and  and in most of the company s income tax expense represented japanese income taxes on aflac japan s operating results  which were taxed at japan s corporate income tax rate of for both and  and for changes in the mix of contributions from the company s business components also impacted the effective tax rates for the three year period from through during  the board of directors authorized the purchase of up to an additional million shares of aflac incorporated common stock on the open market 
in total  the board of directors has authorized the purchase of up to million shares since the inception of the repurchase program in february as of december   million shares had been purchased under these repurchase authorizations 
the difference in the percentage increases of net earnings and net earnings per share primarily reflects the impact of the share repurchase program 
the shares purchased were financed with available cash and borrowings under revolving credit and term note agreements 
interest expense related to the share repurchase program was million in and million in consolidated interest expense  including interest expense from insurance operations  was million in  million in and million in aflac japan repatriated profits to aflac us of million in  million in  million in and million in the profit transfers to aflac us adversely impact aflac japan s investment income 
however  profit repatriations benefit consolidated operations because higher investment yields can be obtained on funds invested in the united states 
also  income tax expense is presently lower on investment income earned in the united states 
management estimates that cumulative profit transfers from through have benefited consolidated net earnings by million in  million in and million in insurance operations  aflac japan aflac japan  a branch of aflac and the principal contributor to the company s earnings  is the fourth largest life insurance company in japan in terms of individual policies in force 
as discussed above  aflac japan transferred profits to aflac us  which distorts comparisons of operating results between years 
the aflac japan summary of operations table on the following page presents investment income  total revenues and pretax operating earnings calculated on a pro forma basis in order to improve comparability between years

exh the percentage increases in premium income in yen reflect the growth of premiums in force 
the increases in annualized premiums in force of in  in and in reflect the high persistency of our business  sales of new policies and conversions of existing policies to policies with higher benefits and premiums 
new annualized premiums from sales and conversions were million in  up in yen  million in  up in yen  and million in  up a decline of in yen 
sales for the past three years have been affected by a decline in conversion activity  which has steadily decreased since a peak in management believes sales during the last three years have also been affected by reduced consumer disposable income resulting from the troubled japanese economy 
sales growth  excluding conversions  was positively affected in by product broadening  particularly the introduction of living benefit life  aflac japan s newest product  in the fourth quarter of aflac japan s sales mix is changing  although cancer insurance still accounts for the majority of total new sales and insurance in force 
cancer insurance sales accounted for of total new sales in yen in  in and in sales of a care product  which was introduced in  represented of total new sales in  in and in sales of living benefit life accounted for of total new sales in management believes that the contributions of cancer insurance to new sales will decline in the future and that newer products  such as living benefit life  will increase as aflac japan proceeds with its strategy of product broadening 
due to the continued low level of available investment yields in japan  the ministry of finance has permitted insurers to increase premium rates on new policy issues in recent years 
aflac japan increased premium rates by an average of on all cancer policy sales made after july  premium rates on care policy new issues were increased by an average of in both november and as a result of continuing low yields  the company expects to increase premium rates an additional on all new policy issues beginning in the second half of investment income  which is affected by available cash flow from operations and investment yields achievable on new investments  continually increased during the three year period from to  despite a decline in available investment yields 
funds available for investment during the three year period through were reduced by the annual profit repatriations discussed above and expenditures of million in and million in for the construction of the administrative office building in tokyo 
rates of return on fixed maturity securities in japan have remained low in compared with historical levels 
for instance  the yield on year japanese government bonds  as measured by a composite index  declined from in january to a low of in july  closing the year at 
aflac japan s new money rates for investments made were for  for and for the cumulative effect of lower investment yields is reflected in the overall rate of return net of investment expenses on aflac japan s average invested assets at amortized cost 
this return was in  compared with in and in for aflac japan  the duration of policy benefit liabilities is longer than that of the related assets 
therefore  there is a risk that reinvestment of the proceeds at maturity of such investments will be at a yield below that of the interest required for the accretion of policy exh liabilities 
at december   the average duration of the policy liabilities was approximately years 
the average duration of the related assets denominated in yen was approximately nine years 
the weighted average period to maturity of fixed maturity securities at december   was years  compared with years at december  over the next four years  billion  or of aflac japan s fixed maturity securities  will mature and be reinvested 
by concentrating on selected sectors  the company has secured higher yields than year japanese government bonds would have provided while adhering to conservative standards for credit quality 
the company believes that it can maintain an overall return on invested assets with an adequate spread over premium pricing assumptions and assumed interest rates for policy liabilities for the near term 
the premium increases implemented during the past two years should have a positive impact on these spreads and therefore contribute to stability in the pretax operating profit margin 
during the three year period ended december   the benefit ratio increased  and the operating expense ratio declined slightly 
the increase in the benefit ratio reflects the strengthening of policy liabilities to provide for lower assumed interest rates and some increase in claims experience due to fewer than expected policy lapses 
the company s annual claims experience studies continue to support the current reserving assumptions 
in  the japanese government passed a package of tax reform bills centering on an increase in the consumption tax  which is similar to a sales tax in the united states 
the consumption tax  which was enacted in  is scheduled to increase from the current rate of to effective april  aflac japan currently incurs consumption tax on agents commissions 
had the rate increase been enacted effective january   pretax operating earnings would have been reduced by approximately million million after income tax in during  the governments of japan and the united states held a series of trade talks 
the us japan framework agreement negotiations discussed the possibility of opening various japanese market sectors  including insurance  to expanded foreign competition 
during the discussions  the japanese government agreed to avoid any radical changes in the third sector of the insurance market until a substantial portion of the life and non life insurance sectors are deregulated 
aflac and other foreign owned insurers  as well as some small to medium sized japanese insurers  operate in the third sector 
in  the japanese government will adopt a framework for long term deregulation of the financial services businesses in japan 
the principles upon which deregulation of the japanese insurance industry is based are to promote competition and to enhance efficiency through deregulation and liberalization  to preserve soundness  and to secure fairness and equity in business operations 
as japan begins gradually deregulating the insurance industry  the marketplace should become more competitive  however  the ultimate changes  and their effects on aflac japan  are not presently determinable 
but  due to the company s unique marketing distribution system and low cost operations in japan  aflac believes it should not be directly affected by deregulation in japan in the immediate future 
even with japan s economic slowdown  the company believes the market for supplemental insurance remains bright 
demand for the company s exh products in japan has continued  and the company remains optimistic about increasing penetration within existing groups  selling new products  opening new accounts and developing additional supplemental products for the japanese market 
insurance operations  aflac us aflac us pretax operating earnings benefited from additional investment income earned on profit transfers received from aflac japan 
aflac us received profit transfers in the amounts of million in  million in  million in and million in aflac us in turn increased dividend payments to the parent company in the amounts of million in  million in and million in estimated investment income earned from profits repatriated to and retained by aflac us from through has been reclassified in the presentation on the following page in order to improve comparability between years

this trend is principally due to the mix of business shifting toward accident and hospital indemnity policies  which have lower benefit ratios compared with other products 
management expects future benefit ratios for some of the company s supplemental products to increase slightly due to the company s ongoing efforts to improve policy persistency by enhancing policyholder benefits 
in addition  potential minimum benefit ratio requirements by insurance regulators may also result in an increase to these ratios 
exh at the same time  management expects the operating expense ratio  excluding discretionary advertising expenses  to decline in the future due to continued improvements in operating efficiencies 
by improving administrative systems and controlling other costs  management has been able to redirect funds to national advertising programs without significantly affecting the operating expense ratio 
for more information regarding advertising expenses  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
operating expenses in also reflect the company s decision to settle certain litigation in alabama related to an ancillary line of business 
management expects the pretax operating profit margin  which was excluding the effect of repatriation in  to remain approximately the same in the percentage increases in premium income reflect the growth of premiums in force 
the increases in annualized premiums in force of in  in and in were favorably affected by an improvement in the persistency for several lines of business  increased sales through section plans commonly known as cafeteria plans  the product broadening program and expanding affiliations with insurance brokers 
declining sales of medicare supplement  which has higher persistency  and increasing sales of accident insurance  which has lower persistency  have partially offset these increases in premium in force 
the company continues to de emphasize the sale of medicare supplement insurance  its lowest margin product 
new annualized premiums from sales and conversions were million in  up  million in  up  and million in  up 
new products contributed greatly to new sales growth 
excluding medicare supplement sales  new annualized premium sales were up for  compared with the company continues to believe that there are significant opportunities to market high quality  affordable supplemental insurance products in the us marketplace 
other operations the company s other operations primarily include seven network affiliated television stations located in small to mid size us markets 
broadcast revenues increased in and in primarily due to increased advertising revenues from an improved us economy and from the off year political elections in due to the large size and growth of the company s insurance operations  the broadcast division will remain a small part of the company s overall operating results 
the parent company s operating expenses consist primarily of corporate overhead expenses such as salary costs  retirement provisions and professional fees 
these expenses have increased during the last three years  principally due to the growth in corporate service activities and to increased retirement accruals in and for certain senior officers and beneficiaries due to enhanced benefits  early retirement and certain revisions in actuarial assumptions

analysis of financial condition balance sheet the financial condition of the company has remained strong during the last two years 
the investment portfolios of aflac japan and aflac us have continued to grow and consist of high quality securities 
due to the relative size of aflac japan  changes in the yen dollar exchange rate can have a significant effect on the company s financial statements 
the yen dollar exchange rate at the end of each period is used to convert yen denominated balance sheet items to us dollars for reporting purposes 
the exchange rate at december   was yen to one us dollar  weaker than the december   exchange rate of 
management estimates that the weaker yen rate decreased invested assets  including cash  by million  total assets by million and total liabilities by million over the amounts that would have been reported using the previous year s exchange rate 
for additional information on exchange rates  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 which was adopted january   fixed maturity securities available for sale are carried at fair value 
previously  fixed maturity securities were carried at amortized cost 
net unrealized gains of billion on investments in fixed maturity securities at december   consisted of billion in gross unrealized gains and million in gross unrealized losses 
at year end  net unrealized gains were million 
during  net unrealized gains increased by billion  primarily due to the decrease in general market interest rates in japan and the united states 
since december   aflac japan s net unrealized gains have increased by billion  and aflac us net unrealized gains have increased by million 
for additional information regarding sfas no 
 see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
during  total invested assets  including unrealized gains on fixed maturity securities  increased billion  or

since december   total invested assets  excluding unrealized gains on fixed maturity securities  have increased billion  or 
aflac japan s investments increased billion  while aflac us investments increased million 
during  deferred policy acquisition costs increased  and total assets increased 
the continued growth in assets reflects the strength of the company s primary business  the substantial cash flows from operations  the record breaking new annualized premium sales by aflac us  the substantial renewal premiums earned in aflac japan of aflac japan premiums and the effect of sfas no 
partially offsetting these positive factors was the previously mentioned weaker yen dollar exchange rate 
exh aflac invests primarily within the japanese and us fixed maturity markets 
the company uses specific criteria to judge the credit quality and liquidity of its investments 
the company utilizes a variety of credit rating services to monitor this criteria 
the percentages of the company s fixed maturity securities available for sale  at amortized cost by quality rating  as of december   were as follows aaa aa a bbb private placement investments made up and of the company s total fixed maturity securities available for sale as of december  and  respectively 
aflac japan has made investments in the private sector to secure higher yields than year japanese government bonds would have provided 
at the same time  the company has adhered to its conservative standards for credit quality 
mortgage loans on real estate and other long term investments amounted to less than 
of invested assets at both december  and cash and short term investments totaled million as of december   or of total invested assets  compared with million  or of total invested assets  at december  for additional information concerning investments and market values  see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
policy liabilities increased billion  or  during aflac japan policy liabilities increased billion  or  and aflac us policy liabilities increased million  or 
these increases are due to the addition of new business  the aging of policies in force and the effect of sfas no 
see note 
the weaker yen decreased reported policy liabilities by million in during  policy liabilities increased billion  or 
the stronger yen in compared with increased reported policy liabilities by billion 
loan agreements for the share repurchase program were amended to provide for borrowings of up to million in us dollars with interest at the london interbank offered rate plus basis points or in japanese yen with interest at the tokyo interbank offered rate plus basis points 
principal payments are payable annually over six years beginning in july in august  all outstanding borrowings under the agreement were converted from dollar denominated to yen denominated amounts 
at december   bank borrowings of billion yen million were outstanding in connection with the share repurchase program 
the company has entered into interest rate swaps with a notional amount that approximates the unpaid principal at december  these swaps effectively change the interest rate exposure from floating rate to a fixed rate of 
the company has also designated these yen denominated borrowings as a hedge of its net investment in aflac japan for financial reporting purposes 
the company s ratio of debt to total capitalization debt plus shareholders equity  excluding the unrealized market gains on securities available for sale was and as of december  and  respectively 
exh aflac japan uses short term usually seven days security lending arrangements to increase investment income with minimal risk 
at december  and  the company held japanese government bonds as collateral for loaned securities in the amount of billion and million  respectively  at market value 
the company s security lending policy requires that the market value of the securities received as collateral be or more of the market value of the loaned securities as of the date the securities are loaned  and not less than thereafter 
during  the average month end balance of outstanding security loans was billion 
this program increased investment income in aflac japan by approximately 
million

under insurance guaranty fund laws in most us states  insurance companies doing business in those states can be assessed for policyholder losses up to prescribed limits that are incurred by insolvent companies with similar lines of business 
such assessments have not been material to the company in the past 
the company believes that future assessments relating to companies currently involved in insolvency proceedings will not materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
the japanese government is currently implementing a funding program for the protection of policyholders similar to the guarantee funds in the united states 
the company s insurance operations continue to provide its primary sources of liquidity 
capital needs can also be supplemented by borrowed funds 
the principal sources of cash from insurance operations are premiums and investment income 
primary uses of cash in the insurance operations are policy claims  commissions  operating expenses  income taxes and payments to the parent company for management fees and dividends 
both the sources and uses of cash are reasonably predictable 
the company s investment objectives provide for liquidity through the ownership of high quality investment securities 
aflac insurance policies are generally not interest sensitive and therefore are not subject to unexpected policyholder redemptions due to investment yield changes 
also  the majority of aflac policies provide indemnity benefits rather than reimbursement for actual medical costs and therefore are not subject to the risks of medical cost inflation 
the achievement of continued long term growth will require growth in the statutory capital and surplus of the insurance subsidiaries 
the subsidiaries may secure additional statutory capital through various sources  such as internally generated statutory earnings or equity contributions by the parent company from funds generated through debt or equity offerings 
management believes outside sources for additional debt and equity capital  if needed  will continue to be available for capital expenditures and business expansion 
exh parent company capital resources are largely dependent upon the ability of the subsidiaries to pay management fees and dividends 
insurance regulatory authorities impose certain limitations and restrictions on payments of dividends  management fees  loans and advances by aflac to the parent company 
the georgia insurance statutes require prior approval for dividend distributions that exceed the greater of statutory earnings for the previous year or of statutory capital and surplus as of the previous year end 
in addition  the georgia insurance department must approve service arrangements and other transactions within the affiliated group 
these regulatory limitations are not expected to affect the level of management fees or dividends paid by aflac to the parent company 
a life insurance company s statutory capital and surplus is computed according to rules prescribed by the national association of insurance commissioners naic  as modified by the insurance company s state of domicile 
statutory accounting rules are different from generally accepted accounting principles and are intended to emphasize policyholder protection and company solvency 
a risk based capital formula that establishes capital requirements relating to insurance risk  business risk  asset risk and interest rate risk was adopted by the naic in for us life insurance companies 
these requirements are intended to facilitate identification by insurance regulators of inadequately capitalized insurance companies based upon the types and mixtures of risks inherent in the insurer s operations 
aflac s naic risk based capital ratio continues to reflect a very strong capital and surplus position 
also  there are various ongoing regulatory initiatives by the naic relating to investments  reinsurance  limited benefit insurance policies  dividend restrictions  revisions to the risk based capital formula  recodification of statutory accounting principles and other related matters 
in addition to restrictions by us insurance regulators  the japanese ministry of finance mof imposes restrictions on and requires approval for the remittances of earnings from aflac japan to aflac us payments are made from aflac japan to the parent company for management fees and to aflac us for allocated expenses and remittances of earnings 
total funds received from aflac japan were million in  million in and million in during the last few years  the mof has developed solvency standards  a version of risk based capital requirements  as part of its long term regulatory revisions 
for additional information on regulatory restrictions on dividends  profit transfers and other remittances  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
cash flow operating cash flows for aflac japan are translated using average monthly exchange rates for the year 
the average yen dollar exchange rate  which is used to convert revenues  expenses and cash flows  strengthened in compared with  in compared with and in compared with the average exchange rates for  and were  and  respectively 
in  consolidated cash flow from operations increased to billion  compared with billion in and billion in net cash flow from operations for aflac japan increased to billion in  compared with billion in and billion in aflac japan represented of the consolidated net cash flow from operations in exh and in both and the increasing cash flow from operations was due to the continued growth of the company s insurance operations in japan and the united states  and the stronger yen 
cash flow from operations in was also favorably affected by a one time acceleration of remittances from premium collection agencies to aflac japan in the amount of million 
this cash flow change did not affect earnings 
consolidated cash flow used by investing activities purchases less dispositions of investment securities and additions to property and equipment increased to billion in  compared with billion in and billion in aflac japan accounted for of the consolidated net cash used by investing activities in  compared with in and in included in aflac japan s portion for and were expenditures of million for the construction of an administrative office building in tokyo 
operating cash flow is primarily used to purchase high quality fixed maturity securities 
when market opportunities arise  the company disposes of certain fixed maturity securities to improve future investment yields or lengthen maturities by reinvesting in securities of similar or higher quality 
therefore  dispositions before maturity can vary significantly from year to year 
dispositions before maturity represented approximately of the annual average investment portfolio of fixed maturity securities in  compared with in both and in  net cash used by financing activities principally net purchases of treasury stock  dividends to shareholders  and debt proceeds net of debt repayments was million  compared with million in and million in the treasury stock purchases of million in were funded by proceeds from new borrowings in the amount of million and available cash
