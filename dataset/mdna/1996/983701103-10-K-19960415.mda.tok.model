production sharing agreement summary the company acquired the rights to the exploration  development and production of the zhao dong block by executing a production sharing agreement with cnodc in february under the terms of the production sharing agreement  the company and apache are responsible for all exploration costs 
if a commercial discovery is made  and if cnodc exercises its option to participate in the development of the field  all development and operating costs and related oil and gas production will be shared up to percent by cnodc and the remainder by the company and apache 
in march  the company farmed out a one third interest in its contract rights for the zhao dong block to apache 
to further reduce the company s exploration capital requirements and accelerate the development of the zhao dong block  the company signed an agreement on may   with apache approved by chinese authorities on august  pursuant to which apache became obligated to pay percent of the costs to drill and test two wildcat wells and one appraisal well on the zhao dong block  with a requirement to pay for a third wildcat well  if apache elected to participate in the second phase of the production sharing agreement 
in january  apache so elected and therefore will pay the drilling and testing costs of a third wildcat well 
the amounts advanced by apache are recoverable from revenues generated from zhao dong block production 
future expenditures beyond those described above will be borne percent each by the company and apache 
pursuant to this agreement apache also purchased an additional percent interest in the foreign contractor s share of the oil and gas reserves of the c field 
payment for this purchase will be computed and made to the company from time to time as each segment of the field is placed on production in order to insure that the company will receive the full market value of the percent interest 
in consideration of the above described payments  apache assumed operatorship of the zhao dong block and increased its interest in the zhao dong block from percent to percent of the foreign contractor s share of the zhao dong block 
the production sharing agreement includes the following additional principal terms o the production sharing agreement is basically divided into three periods the exploration period  the development period and the production period 
work to be performed and expenditures to be incurred during the exploration period  which consists of three phases totaling seven years from may   are the exclusive responsibility of the contractor the company and apache as a group 
the contractor s obligations in the three exploration phases are as follows during the first three years  the contractor is required to drill three wildcat wells  perform seismic data acquisition and processing and expend a minimum of million the contractor has drilled two wildcat wells  satisfied the seismic acquisition and minimum expenditure requirements and has received an extension allowing the drilling of the third wildcat well during the first year of the second exploration phase  during the next two years  the contractor is required to drill two wildcat wells  perform seismic data acquisition and processing and expend a minimum of million the contractor has elected to proceed with the second phase of the contract 
the seismic data acquisition requirement for the second phase has been satisfied  during the last two years  the contractor is required to drill two wildcat wells and expend a minimum of million  and work performed and expenditures incurred in any exploration phase in excess of the minimum requirements for such phase will be credited against the minimum work and expenditure requirements for the next phase 
o the development period for any field discovered during the exploration period commences on the date of approval by the ministry of energy of the development plan for an oil and or gas field 
the production period of any oil and or gas field in the area covered by the production sharing agreement the contract area shall be a period of consecutive years each of months commencing  for each field  on the date of commencement of commercial production as determined under the agreement 
prior to the commencement of the production period  during the development period  oil and gas may be produced and sold during a long term testing period 
o after each of the first two phases of the exploration period  two segments of the contract area after deducting areas in which development and production activities are being undertaken must be relinquished 
the first relinquishment which was to occur on may   has been extended for one year 
segments on which no wildcat wells have been drilled shall be relinquished first 
at the end of the last phase of the exploration period  the remaining portions of the contract area except for any development and production areas must be relinquished 
o the production sharing agreement may be terminated by the contractor at the end of each phase of the exploration period  without further obligation 
o while the production sharing agreement requires the contractor to pay all exploration costs  cnodc has the option to participate for up to a percent interest in the development and production periods  paying its corresponding share of development and operating costs and receiving the same percentage of oil and gas production  subject to royalty payments  cost recovery and other adjustments as set forth below 
o operating costs for any given calendar year for an oil and or gas field shall be recovered by the parties in kind out of production from the field during such year 
unrecovered costs are carried forward to the next calendar year 
exploration costs in any area in the contract area shall be recovered by the contractor  in kind  out of production from any field in the contract area and development costs for any field  plus interest at nine percent  shall  after recoupment of exploration costs  be recovered in kind out of the production from such field 
o annual gross production agp of each oil and gas field in the contract area determined separately shall be allocated in the following sequence and proportions percent of agp shall be used to pay the chinese taxes 
determined on a field by field basis  the chinese government shall receive a sliding scale royalty calculated as follows as amended by the ministry of finance and state taxation bureaus effective january  metric tons of annual crude oil production royalty rate less than or equal to  exempt  to   to   to   to  over  one metric ton is roughly equivalent to seven barrels of crude oil 
percent of agp shall be deemed cost recovery oil and shall be used to recover costs incurred by the parties  first for the recovery of operating costs  and then for the recovery of exploration and development costs  in that order 
such cost recovery oil is not subject to the royalty due the chinese government 
the remaining amount of agp shall be deemed remainder oil and shall be further divided into allocable remainder oil and chinese share oil 
allocable remainder oil is calculated based upon a sliding scale formula relating to the amount of production  and is shared by the parties in proportion to their respective interests 
all oil remaining after the above allocations are effected is designated chinese share oil and shall be allocated to cnodc or other chinese government designee 
o apache is now the operator for all operations in the contract area during the exploration period 
the production sharing agreement is administered by a joint management committee comprised of an equal number of representatives designated by the contractor the company and apache as a group and cnodc 
disputes must first be resolved through negotiation and then through arbitration 
if the parties agree  arbitration will be conducted by the china international economic and trade commission in accordance with its provisional rules

united xcl lube oil joint venture on july   the company signed a contract with cnpc united lube oil corporation to form a joint venture company to engage in the manufacturing  distribution and marketing of lubricating oil in china and southeast asian markets 
the joint venture will have a year life unless extended 
the registered capital of the joint venture is million  with the company to contribute million for its percent interest  of which  has been paid 
the chinese side will contribute an existing lubricating oil blending plant in langfang  china  with a china government appraised value of million as its investment for fifty one percent of the stock 
the registration of the joint venture was approved by chinese authorities on december   and a business license was issued 
the company s remaining obligation of million will be satisfied by a series of payments the first of which is due may   in the amount of  and the balance as necessary to complete the modernization of the plant 
in a letter of intent executed contemporaneously with the contract  the parties have agreed to consider the feasibility of i constructing a second lubricating oil blending plant at a port facility near tianjin  china  ii contributing to the joint venture a second existing plant in southwest china and iii other projects  including constructing oil terminals on the north and south coasts of china and engaging in upgrading certain existing refineries within china 
the company expects to fund its share of payments by bringing in a joint venture partner 
coalbed methane project on march   the company signed an agreement with the cnacg  pursuant to which the parties will commence cooperation for the exploration and development of coalbed methane in two areas in china 
during the study period contemplated by the agreement  the company will evaluate the properties  after which the parties are expected to enter into a comprehensive agreement  which may provide the basis for coalbed methane development in other areas of china 
costs of the project are not expected to be significant during the next twelve months 
on december   the company signed a memo of understanding with cnacg to develop a contract for exploration  development and utilization of coalbed methane in the two areas 
us exploration and production activities the company has decided to dispose of its us oil and gas properties to focus its activities in china 
management is seeking a buyer s for its remaining us producing property  the cox field  or exploring the possibility of contributing the property to a joint venture for development 
information has been made available to several potential purchasers  and the company has retained internationale nederlanden us securities corporation to assist in evaluating offers as received 
on january   the company sold its interest in the mestena grande field and on march   the company sold the acre gonzales gas unit at the cox field 
the cox field the cox field  initially discovered in  is located in webb  zapata and jim hogg counties  texas 
present production is associated with numerous deltaic sands of wilcox age which were expanded across a large growth fault system  resulting in a large rollover anticline 
numerous large fields occur in similar settings along this trend in south texas 
on march   the company sold to tesoro e p company  lp its percent working interest in the gonzales gas unit at the northwest corner of the cox field  effective february  after giving effect to the sale of the gonzales gas unit  the company currently participates in productive wells net wells within the field 
the company has an average working interest of approximately percent in the  acre which is equivalent to  net acres productive area  and working interests ranging from percent to percent in an additional  acres  net acres on the flanks of the producing field area 
mestena grande field until it was sold on january   the company had an interest in the mestena grande field  located in jim hogg county  texas  which is an elongate  north south trending faulted anticline which produces primarily from the eocene queen city sand interval 
the company s working interests ranged from approximately percent to percent in  gross acres  net acres and in productive wells net wells within the field 
the sale was effective as of september  oil and gas reserves the company s remaining domestic oil and gas properties are now classified as assets held for sale 
properties with respect to the company s investment in china are unevaluated  accordingly conclusive reserve estimates have not yet been determined

other domestic properties the company presently owns a large tract of fee land referred to as the lutcher moore tract totaling approximately  acres of wetlands along the mississippi river in louisiana 
this property is classified as an asset held for sale 
on may   the company sold its percent fee interest in the phoenix lake tract comprised of  gross acres  net acres of marshland in southwest louisiana for approximately million 
the company retained percent of the mineral interest underlying those lands valued at million 
the purchase price was comprised of approximately million in cash and a  reduction in obligations owed by the company to the purchaser 
no gain or loss was recognized on the sale 
the remaining interest is classified as an investment 
title to properties the company believes that title to its properties is generally acceptable in accordance with prevailing standards in the oil and gas industry  subject to exceptions which do not materially detract from the value of such properties 
the company s properties are subject to royalty  overriding royalty  carried and other similar interests and contractual arrangements customary in the oil and gas industry  to liens incident to operating agreements  to liens for current taxes not yet due and other relatively minor encumbrances 
substantially all of the company s producing properties  as well as the stock of its major subsidiaries  have been pledged to collateralize borrowings under its credit agreement with internationale nederlanden us capital corporation incc 
detailed title examinations have not been made on all of the company s undeveloped oil and gas leases 
as is customary in the oil and gas industry  only a perfunctory title examination is conducted at the time undeveloped properties believed to be suitable for drilling operations are acquired  and therefore  undeveloped properties can be subject to various title defects 
generally  however  prior to the commencement of domestic drilling operations  a thorough title examination is conducted and any significant  known defects remedied before operations are commenced 
markets substantially all of the company s gas production from the cox field was dedicated to midcon texas pipeline corp 
under contracts dated may   as amended effective july  with respect to china  under the terms of the production sharing agreement  the company has both the right and obligation in each calendar quarter to take and separately dispose of its share of oil produced at the zhao dong block 
however  the company shall not deliver its oil to prohibited destinations  which are those that infringe on the political interests of the prc 
during  the prc became a net importer of oil  therefore the company believes it can sell in china  its share of oil produced in china  at world market prices 
competition the oil and gas industry is competitive in all phases  both domestic and internationally 
in pursuing its growth strategy of expanding its participation in the chinese energy industry  the company is in competition with the major integrated oil companies  national oil companies and other independent oil companies 
although many of these competitors have financial resources greater than those of the company  management believes that the company is positioned to compete effectively 
certain risk factors relating to the company and the oil and gas industry general industry risks the company s business is affected by the general risks associated with the oil and gas industry 
the availability of a ready market for oil and gas purchased  sold and produced by the company depends upon numerous factors beyond its control  the exact effects of which cannot be accurately predicted 
generally  these factors include  among other things  the level of production and economic activity  the availability of oil and gas supplies  action taken by oil producing nations  the availability of transportation capacity  the availability and marketing of other competitive fuels  fluctuating and seasonal demand for oil  gas and refined products and the extent of governmental regulation and taxation under both present and future legislation of the production  refining  transportation  pricing  use and allocation of oil  natural gas  refined products and substitute fuels 
accordingly  in view of the many uncertainties affecting the supply and demand for crude oil  natural gas and refined products  it is not possible to predict accurately either the prices or marketability of oil and gas produced from any property in which the company has or may acquire an interest 
general exploration and production risks the company s oil and gas drilling and production activities involve a high degree of risk 
the ratio of dry holes to commercially productive oil and gas wells is high for the industry as a whole 
hazards  such as formations with unusual pressures  or other unforeseen conditions are sometimes encountered in drilling wells which could result in loss of a well and in substantial liabilities or injuries to other persons or property 
in addition  the company may encounter delays due to adverse weather conditions and difficulties in securing supplies  drilling and production equipment and access to trained personnel 
the company seeks to minimize the risks of damage to the environment  property and persons present in its drilling operations and obtains insurance coverage which it believes prudent 
additional financing required considering the company s working capital deficit  outstanding indebtedness and the capital commitments associated with its business activities in the prc  the company projects that it will require substantial additional capital 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note to the consolidated financial statements 
foreign operations the company s activities on the zhao dong block are subject to regulation under chinese law by the ministry of foreign trade and economic cooperation moftec and cnodc 
such regulation covers a wide variety of matters comparable in scope to the type of regulations the company faces in its domestic operations  including  without limitation  the drilling of wells  allowable rates of production  prevention of waste and pollution  protection of the environment  labor regulations and worker safety 
in addition  the company s activities may be exposed to the political and economic risks of operating in a foreign country including loss of revenues  property and equipment from such hazards as expropriation  nationalization  insurrection and other political risks  risks of increases in taxes and governmental royalties  renegotiation of contracts with governmental entities  as well as changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies 
other risks inherent in foreign operations include the possibility of realizing economic currency exchange losses when transactions are completed in currencies other than united states dollars and the company s inability to freely repatriate earnings under changes in exchange control laws 
to date  the company s chinese operations have not been materially affected by these risks 
developments in relations between the prc and the united states as has recently been reported in the press  relations between the prc and the republic of china on taiwan have deteriorated prompting the united states government to publicly criticize the prc 
in addition  the us government has also criticized the prc s failure to protect intellectual property rights  its record with respect to human rights matters and certain exports of military technology  among other matters 
while the company is unable to predict whether these political developments will escalate tensions to the point that the company s chinese operations may become adversely affected  the company maintains excellent relations with chinese governmental authorities in charge of the development of china s energy resources and current indications are that neither the prc nor the us administration is desirous of impairing us prc commercial relations 
concentration of operations the company s oil and gas activities are concentrated in the zhao dong block 
because of this concentration  any event which increases costs  limits production  or limits deliverability of oil or natural gas would impact the company more adversely than if the company were more geographically diversified 
uncertainty of estimates of reserves and future net revenues there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves  including many factors beyond the control of the company 
estimates of proved undeveloped reserves are by their nature less certain 
these estimates are based on various assumptions  including those prescribed by the securities and exchange commission sec 
actual future production  oil and gas prices  revenues  taxes  capital expenditures  operating expenses  geologic success and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in an estimate  and could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of reserves 
in addition  the company s reserves may be subject to downward or upward revision based upon production history  purchases or sales of properties  results of future development  prevailing oil and gas prices and other factors 
reserve value ceiling test under the sec s full cost accounting rules  the company reviews the carrying value of its oil and gas properties each quarter on a country by country basis 
under such rules  capitalized costs of oil and gas properties may not exceed the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves  discounted at percent  plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties as adjusted for related tax effects and deferred tax reserves 
application of this rule generally requires pricing future production at the unescalated oil and gas prices in effect at the end of each fiscal quarter and requires a write down if the ceiling is exceeded  even if prices declined for only a short period of time 
if a write down is required  the charge to earnings does not impact cash flow from operating activities 
as unproved properties become evaluated  their costs will be reclassified to proved and evaluated properties  and any associated future revenue will be included in the calculation of the present value of the company s proved reserves 
costs in excess of the present value of added reserves  or any material reductions in the net future revenues from oil and gas reserves resulting from such factors as lower prices or downward revisions in estimates of reserve quantities  causes a charge for a full cost ceiling impairment  absent offsetting improvements 
environmental matters the company is subject to existing federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
the company believes that its us oil and gas properties  which are held for sale  are in general compliance with applicable environmental regulations 
environmental laws and regulations have changed substantially and rapidly over the last years  and the company anticipates that there will be continuing changes 
the clear trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may impact the environment  such as emissions of pollutants  generation and disposal of wastes and use and handling of chemical substances 
increasingly strict environmental restrictions and limitations have resulted in increased operating costs throughout the united states  and it is possible that the costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations will continue to increase 
the company will attempt to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and to plan accordingly in order to remain in compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations minimizing costs of such compliance 
the company is and will be required to comply with environmental laws in china which at this time are significantly less stringent than us laws 
employees the company currently employs a total of people including executive officers 
none of the employees of the company or its affiliates have employment contracts or are represented by collective bargaining agreements 
the company considers its relationship with employees to be satisfactory 
premises the company owns a two story office building located at rue jean lafitte  lafayette  louisiana 
the building contains approximately  square feet of gross space and was constructed in on approximately one acre of land 
the building is wholly occupied by employees of the company 
the building was originally purchased in from a partnership comprised of messrs

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements  the notes thereto and the unaudited supplemental data included in this annual report 
liquidity and capital resources the company has incurred recurring net losses and currently has a working capital deficit 
the company anticipates insufficient cash flows from operations to meet its current obligations  including expenditures required for the development of the company s assets 
the company has been able to meet its financial obligations to date by obtaining funds from sales of equity in the company  sales of various assets and borrowings from the company s primary lender 
management believes that it will be able to continue to meet its financial obligations and fund the development of its investments through joint ventures with partners  continued sales of assets and continued sales of equity instruments 
however  as of april   the company did not have sufficient commitments in place to insure that all of the company s obligations for could be satisfied 
until alternative sources of funds are obtained  substantial doubt exists regarding the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
management is presently pursuing several financing arrangements which it believes will provide the necessary funds to satisfy its working capital requirements 
in  the company began shifting its focus from oil and gas exploration in the us  primarily along the louisiana and texas gulf coast  to the prc 
this action was taken because management was of the opinion that the opportunities for the discovery of major oil and gas fields were much greater in china than in the united states 
the company obtained its first exploration and production agreement in china in february this contract was the first such contract entered into by cnpc with a foreign entity  in northern china 
this area is the location of a significant portion of china s known oil reserves and production 
the company s first well  drilled in the spring of  was a discovery
