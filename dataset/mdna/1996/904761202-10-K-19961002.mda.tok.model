in switzerland  revenue increased to million for the twelve months ended may  representing an increase of million or from the comparable prior year period 
excluding the effect of the revenues generated by the swiss subsidiary disposed of in fiscal year  the increase in revenue would have been million or  whereas the test mix remained stable 
the stability in the test mix was achieved despite the price change resulting from the implementation by the ofas on january  in the uk  revenue for the year ended may  increased by million or over the prior year period 
the increase is primarily due to the start of the north hertfordshire nhs trust contract and an increase in cytology and histology revenue from fbh 
operating income for the twelve months ended may  increased slightly million over the prior year 
this increase resulted primarily from the increase in sales  but such increase was offset by higher personnel costs and other operating costs relating to the company s expansion and restructuring of the uk operations

although the swiss government has generally reduced the fee schedule for private laboratories  the effect on the swiss operation s revenue was more than offset by an increase in specimen volume testing 
the increase in operating expenses from approximately million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year reflects the acquisition of ull in november exclusive of the operating expenses of ull  the operating expenses of the company for its fiscal year increased approximately million  or over which increased approximately million  or over in fiscal year  the company completed the installation of the uni computer system in all its swiss laboratories which resulted in higher operating costs

ii other information the company operates in europe in the currencies of the countries in which it is located 
for reporting purposes the financial statements are translated in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles which require  generally  that assets  liabilities and equity are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and revenues and expenses at the weighted average rates during each year 
accordingly assets  liabilities and shareholders equity will be affected by changes in such exchange rates 
the company s operating results will continue to be affected by the volume  mix and timing of test orders received during a period and by conditions in the industry including pricing regulations and in the economies in which the company operates  such as recessionary periods  political instability  and fluctuations in interest or currency exchange rates 
the company further experiences both increases and decreases in its volume of testing due to seasonality shifts 
all laboratories experience a slow down during the holiday seasons  primarily in summer 
this may lead to quarterly information which is not indicative of the trend of the company s business 
inflation was not a material factor in either revenue or operating expenses during the year presented  and is not expected to be in the current year
