this division s products are marketed in the united states through the company s direct sales force  in italy through the company s subsidiary  lifecore biomedical spa  and in other countries through distributors 
results of operations net sales 
net sales increased  or in fiscal from fiscal  due to a  increase in sales to hyaluronate customers and a  increase in sales to oral restorative customers 
hyaluronate sales increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal sales to alcon were   and  for fiscal years  and sales to alcon in early fiscal were favorably impacted when the company was required to produce large quantities of hyaluronate to validate its chaska facility 
alcon agreed to purchase a majority of the hyaluronate inventory produced as a result of this validation process 
the company believes that these purchases exceeded alcon s inventory requirements in this period 
thus  sales to alcon since late fiscal have been at contract minimums 
the required minimum purchase under the alcon agreement for calendar is  as a result  sales to alcon are expected to decline further in fiscal net sales to other hyaluronate customers increased  or in fiscal from fiscal oral restorative product sales increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase in oral restorative products sales was a result of increased marketing and sales activities in the domestic market  the introduction of capset barrier  sales from lifecore biomedical spa which was in operation for the entire fiscal year  and higher sales levels internationally 
net sales decreased  or in fiscal from fiscal  due to a  decrease in sales to hyaluronate customers  partially offset by a  increase in sales to oral restorative customers 
hyaluronate sales decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal due to a decrease in sales to alcon in fiscal for the reason set forth above 
net sales to other hyaluronate customers increased  or in fiscal from fiscal oral restorative product sales increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase in oral restorative product sales primarily reflected the expanding product lines and the effect of increased marketing and sales activities 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold  as a percentage of net sales  decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the decrease resulted from two main factors 
first  fixed expenses were spread over increased product sales 
second  continuing direct charges for idle capacity relating to the company s manufacturing facility for hyaluronate products were lower than in the prior year 
these improvements were partially offset by the negative impact incurred for the scale up of aseptic ophthalmic syringe products 
cost of goods sold  as a percentage of net sales  increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase resulted principally from direct charges for idle capacity relating to hyaluronate products  resulting from the lower utilization of the company s manufacturing facility throughout fiscal and in the second half of fiscal in the first two quarters of fiscal and the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company had produced hyaluronate in large quantities to validate its facility  resulting in higher levels of inventory in fiscal and leading to lower production levels in the second half of fiscal and throughout fiscal direct charges for idle capacity related to the utilization of the company s hyaluronate manufacturing capacity are expected to continue to decline in fiscal cost of goods sold  as a percentage of net sales for oral restorative products  decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal the decreases resulted principally from spreading fixed expenses over increased oral restorative product sales in fiscal and  as well as from lower material costs 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased  or in fiscal from fiscal and increased  or in fiscal from fiscal the increase in fiscal resulted principally from the costs associated with human clinical trials on lubricoat gel which began in late fiscal and continued throughout fiscal activity on other products in development was higher in fiscal than in fiscal which accounted for the remainder of the increase 
the increase in fiscal reflected the assumption by the company in august of the research and development for lubricoat gel  which was previously the responsibility of ethicon 
research and development expenses are expected to increase in due principally to the continued funding of human clinical trials for lubricoat gel 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses are primarily costs incurred by the company in support of its oral restorative division 
marketing and sales expenses increased  or in fiscal from fiscal and increased  or in fiscal from fiscal the principal components of the increase in fiscal were  related to compensation costs  primarily associated with additional sales personnel   related to advertising and sales literature costs  primarily resulting from a new product catalog issued in the fall of  increased travel and related expenses from the additional sales staff added in late fiscal and early fiscal  and expenses related to the direct sales force at lifecore biomedical spa  which has been in operation since april the major components of the increase in fiscal were  related to compensation costs  primarily associated with additional sales personnel  and  related to increased advertising and sales literature costs 
the timing of advertising and sales literature costs can be expected to cause marketing and sales expenses to fluctuate from period to period 
marketing and sales expenses are expected to increase in fiscal due principally to the further addition of sales personnel and costs associated with updated sales literature 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased  or in fiscal from fiscal and increased  or in fiscal from fiscal the increase in fiscal resulted mainly from higher personnel related costs and to a lessor extent a full year of expenses from lifecore biomedical spa 
the fluctuation in fiscal resulted from a litigation expense accrual recorded in fiscal and reversed in fiscal and an increase in bad debt expense relating to the account of a single customer 
without the fluctuations resulting from the litigation expense accrual and the increased bad debt expense  general and administrative expenses would have been relatively unchanged from fiscal to fiscal insurance proceeds  net 
in may  the company received net proceeds of  on an insurance claim for product that was damaged in production as a result of an equipment failure 
other income expense 
interest expense decreased in fiscal from fiscal due to a lower average debt outstanding during fiscal interest expense increased in fiscal from fiscal due to the debt related to the acquisition of the iss dental implant business 
interest income increased in fiscal from fiscal and increased in fiscal from fiscal the increase in fiscal reflected the effect of having additional cash available to invest as a result of the proceeds received from the public stock offering completed in fall and the offshore stock offering in april the increase in interest income in fiscal reflected the effect of having additional cash available to invest from the august sale of stock to johnson johnson development corporation and the november cash advance received from alcon 
during fiscal  the company invested its excess cash in a fund rated aaa by standard and poors 
the fund invested in various bonds and other obligations issued or guaranteed as to payment of principal and interest by the us government 
included in the investments of the fund were mortgage related securities and their derivatives  such as interest only and principal only securities and inverse floating rate securities 
during the first quarter of calendar  the fund s value declined and  in april  the company sold its investment and realized a loss of  prior to fiscal  the company s investment in the same fund had yielded gains in excess of the fiscal loss 
in december  the company sold the building which served as a manufacturing facility prior to the present chaska location 
the sale resulted in a gain of  in fiscal liquidity and capital resources inventories consist mainly of finished hyaluronate and oral restorative products and related raw materials 
the portion of finished hyaluronate inventory that is not expected to be consumed within the next twelve months is classified as long term 
the finished hyaluronate inventory is maintained in a frozen state and has a shelf life in excess of five years 
total inventory increased  or in fiscal from fiscal principally due to expansion of the oral restorative product inventory 
the company has had significant operating cash flow deficits for the last three fiscal years 
as the hyaluronate division s sales continue to increase  the company s direct charges associated with excess plant capacity are decreasing  however  research and development costs for lubricoat gel  marketing and sales expenses for the oral restorative products  and personnel costs are increasing 
in addition  the company will have significant fixed obligations in future periods 
obligations under the equipment lease  the industrial development revenue bonds and the iss note total  for fiscal and  for fiscal in addition  the company received a million advance on product purchases from alcon in november  which the company used for working capital in fiscal in fiscal and fiscal  the company shipped million of products due under this advance to alcon 
accordingly  million of product shipments due to alcon in fiscal will not generate additional cash 
the company from time to time has obtained other cash advances and has also obtained permission from its corporate partners to defer scheduled payments for cash management purposes 
if the company were to make such requests in the future  there can be no assurance that its requests would be granted 
the loan agreement between the company and the holder of the industrial development revenue bonds issued to finance the company s chaska facility was amended in july to waive the fixed charge coverage ratio and the cash flow coverage ratio through june  with respect to certain of these covenants  the company anticipates that it will be required to obtain further waivers for fiscal there can be no assurance that future waivers will be granted to the company 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the company completed a public offering of its common stock  providing net proceeds of approximately million 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company completed an offshore stock offering providing net proceeds of approximately million 
the company intends to use net proceeds of these offerings to expand its warehouse and distribution capabilities  to accelerate the scale up of aseptic packaging facilities in anticipation of significant commercial demand for finished hyaluronate products  for working capital  and for possible future redemption of all or a portion of the outstanding industrial development revenue bonds 
the company believes these capital resources are sufficient to meet the company s needs through fiscal  including its fixed obligations and anticipated operating cash flow deficits 
the company s ability to generate positive cash flow from operations and achieve profitability is dependent upon the continued expansion of revenue from its hyaluronate and oral restorative businesses 
growth in the hyaluronate division is unpredictable due to the complex governmental regulatory environment for new medical products and the early stage of certain of these markets 
similarly  expansion of the company s oral restorative division sales is also dependent upon increased revenue from new and existing customers  as well as successfully competing in a more mature market 
in the short term  the company expects its cash requirements to significantly exceed the cash generated from anticipated operations 
no assurance can be given that the company will attain and maintain positive cash flow before its capital resources are exhausted 
while the company s capital resources  including the proceeds from this offering  appear adequate today  unforeseen events  prior to achieving and maintaining positive cash flow  could require additional financing 
if additional financing is necessary  no assurance can be given that such financing will be available and  if available  will be on terms favorable to the company and its shareholders
