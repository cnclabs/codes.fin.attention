item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and business environment the company is a leading provider of technical and information technology it services  including information processing  systems development and systems integration 
the company provides these services to a wide range of clients  including the dod  other federal agencies  state and local governments  healthcare and insurance organizations  and commercial enterprises 
the company was founded in to develop specialized optical sensing capabilities for military weapons and ballistic defense programs 
until fiscal year  virtually all of the company s revenues were derived under contracts with the federal government relating to high technology weapons systems  strategic missile defense and other related aerospace technologies 
areas of particular strength have included tactical technology  smart sensing systems  simulations  data processing  systems engineering and systems integration including software development  networking  hardware acquisition and installation  user training and system operation and maintenance 
beginning in fiscal year  in response to increasing budget pressure on military procurements  the company strategically began to develop applications for its technical capabilities outside its traditional core military business 
although the company s core military business has continued to grow  the company has successfully entered the markets for other government information technology solutions  as well as information technology solutions in the healthcare industry and other commercial markets 
the company s business strategy consists of three key elements i maintain the company s leadership in technology  ii apply the company s technology to create solutions for new clients  and iii make strategic acquisitions and form alliances to expand the business of the company and gain industry knowledge 
the company s business and financial performance are subject to risks and uncertainties  including those discussed below 
in july the company announced a formal organization definition for its four strategic business units 
the organizations reflect the particular market focus of each line of business 
nichols federal provides technical services primarily to us government defense agencies 
nichols infofed provides information and technology services to a variety of governmental agencies 
nichols infotec provides information and technology services to various commercial clients  other than healthcare or insurance industry clients 
nichols select provides information services to clients in the healthcare and insurance industries 
for the year ended august   the percentage of total revenues attributable to the four business units were approximately for nichols federal  for nichols infofed  for nichols infotec  and for nichols select 
expansion through acquisitions is an important component of the company s overall business strategy 
the company has successfully completed seven strategic acquisitions and alliances since september   most of which have centered on it and healthcare information services markets 
since the respective dates of the acquisitions  the company has integrated these acquired entities in order to draw on the company s base of technical expertise and capabilities in designing solutions for government  commercial and healthcare clients 
on may   the company acquired advanced marine enterprises  inc ame  a naval architecture and marine technical services firm headquartered in arlington  virginia 
for its year ended may   ame had million in revenues 
the acquisition provides the company an opportunity to expand its business relationship with the us navy 
the company s continued ability to grow by acquisitions is dependent upon  and may be limited by  the availability of compatible acquisition candidates at reasonable prices  the company s ability to fund or finance acquisitions on acceptable terms  and the company s ability to maintain or enhance the profitability of any acquired business 
as part of the company s business strategy to enter new markets  the company intends to pursue large systems integration contracts in both the government and commercial markets  although competition for such contracts is intense and many of the company s competitors have greater resources than the company 
while such contracts are working capital intensive  requiring large equipment and software purchases to be funded by the company before payment from the customer  the company believes such contracts offer attractive revenue growth and margin expansion opportunities for the company s range of technical expertise and capabilities 
the company s revenues and earnings may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on such factors as the number  size and scope of projects in which the the company is engaged  the contractual terms and degree of completion of such projects  expenditures required by the company in connection with such projects  any delays incurred in connection with such projects  employee utilization rates  the adequacy of provisions for losses  the accuracy of estimates of resources required to complete ongoing projects  and general economic conditions 
under certain contracts  the company is required to purchase and resell to the customer large amounts of computer hardware and other equipment 
revenues are accrued when this equipment is acquired for resale  and as a result  quarterly revenues will be impacted by fluctuations related to equipment purchases which occur on a periodic basis depending on contract terms 
approximately  and of the company s total revenues in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal were derived from contracts or subcontracts funded by the us government 
these us government contracts include military weapons systems contracts funded by dod that accounted for approximately  and of the company s total revenues in such years  respectively 
the company believes that the success and development of its business will continue to be dependent upon its ability to participate in us government contract programs 
accordingly  the company s financial performance may be directly affected by changing us government procurement practices and policies 
other factors that could materially and adversely affect the company s government contracting business and programs include budgetary constraints  changes in fiscal policies or available funding  changes in government programs or requirements  including proposals to abolish certain government agencies or departments  curtailing of the us government s use of technology services firms  the adoption of new laws or regulations  technological developments and general economic conditions 
these factors could cause us government agencies to exercise their rights to terminate existing contracts for convenience or not to exercise options to renew such contracts 
in addition  certain of the company s contracts individually contribute a significant percentage of the company s revenues 
for the year ended august   the company s largest contract by revenues was a contract with the us army space and strategic defense command  which generated approximately of the company s total revenues for such period 
the company s five largest contracts by revenues generated approximately of the company s total revenues for such period 
given the award of the million high performance computing modernization contracts awarded by the us army the hpcm contracts  the company expects revenues to continue to be concentrated in a relatively small number of large us government contracts 
termination of such contracts  or the company s inability to renew or replace such con tracts when they expire  could materially and adversely affect the company 
historically  a majority of the company s revenues for the year ended august  are related to us military weapons systems 
the us military weapons budget has been declining in real terms since the mid s  resulting in some cases in program delays  extensions and cancellations 
a further significant decline in us military expenditures for weapons systems  or a reduction in the weapons systems portion of the defense budget  could materially and adversely affect the company 
the loss or significant curtailment of the company s us military contracts would materially and adversely affect the company 
approximately of the company s revenues in fiscal were from contracts related to ballistic missile defense bmd  compared to of revenues in fiscal and of revenues in fiscal from such contracts 
strategic defense has existed for more than years as a mission of dod through activities such as the bmd program 
if a decision were made to reduce substantially the scope of current bmd programs  management believes that many national and theater missile defense programs would continue to be funded by the us army and air force  and other dod agencies 
while the company has expanded into other markets  a decision to reduce significantly or eliminate missile defense funding would have an adverse effect on the company s revenues and income 
the company performs its services under us government contracts that usually require performance over a period of one to five years 
long term contracts may be conditioned upon continued availability of congressional appropriations 
variances between anticipated budgets and congressional appropriations may result in delay  reduction or termination of such contracts 
contractors can experience revenue uncertainties with respect to available contract funding during the first quarter of the government s fiscal year beginning october  until differences between budget requests and appropriations are resolved 
the company s contracts with the us government and its prime contractors are subject to termination  in whole or in part  either upon default by the company or at the convenience of the government 
the termination for convenience provisions generally entitle the company to recover costs incurred  settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination 
because the company contracts to supply goods and services to the us government  it is also subject to other risks  including contract suspensions  audit adjustments  protests by disappointed bidders of contract awards which can result in the re opening of the bidding process and changes in government policies or regulations 
the company s services are provided primarily through three types of contracts fixed price  time and materials and cost reimbursement contracts 
fixed price contracts require the company to perform services under a contract at a stipulated price 
time and materials contracts reimburse the company for the number of labor hours expended at an established hourly rate negotiated in the contract  plus the cost of materials incurred 
under cost reimbursement contracts  the company is reimbursed for all actual costs incurred in performing the contract to the extent that such costs are within the contract ceiling and allowable under the terms of the contract  plus a fee or profit 
the company assumes greater financial risk on fixed price contracts than on either time and materials or cost reimbursement contracts 
as the company increases its commercial business  it believes that an increasing percentage of its contracts will be fixed priced 
failure to anticipate technical problems  estimate costs accurately or control costs during performance of a fixed price contract may reduce the company s profit or cause a loss 
in addition  greater risks are involved under time and materials contracts than under cost reim bursement contracts because the company assumes the responsibility for the delivery of specified skills at a fixed hourly rate 
although management believes that adequate provision for its fixed price and time and materials contracts is reflected in the company s financial statements  no assurance can be given that this provision is adequate or that losses on fixed price and time and materials contracts will not occur in the future 
to compete successfully for business  the company must satisfy client requirements at competitive rates 
although the company continually attempts to lower its costs  there are other information technology and technical services companies that may provide the same or similar services at comparable or lower rates than the company 
additionally  certain of the company s clients require that their vendors reduce rates after services have commenced 
the company s success will also depend upon its ability to attract  retain  train and motivate highly skilled employees  particularly in the areas of information technology  where such employees are in great demand 
recent contract awards have significantly increased the company s backlog 
contract awards for the year ended august   totaled million 
of this amount  million were the hpcm contracts awarded by the us army information systems and selection acquisition agency 
as a result  backlog has increased to billion at august  from million at august  results of operations the following tables set forth  for the periods indicated  the percentages which certain items in the consolidated statements of income bear to consolidated revenues and the percentage change of such items for the periods indicated percentage of revenues percentage increase years ended august  decrease revenues costs and expenses direct and allocable costs general and administrative expenses total costs and expenses operating profit other income expense  net

revenues increased million in fiscal approximately of the increase was attributable to revenues from the hpcm contracts 
approximately of the increase was attributable to acquisitions completed in fiscal year and late fiscal approximately of the increase in revenues was attributable to the existing contract base 
operating profit 
operating profit increased million in fiscal costs and expenses were of revenues for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the reduction in direct and allocable costs as a percentage of revenues was offset by increases in general and administrative expenses 
the company used contract cost reductions and increased margins to fund increases in business development and marketing efforts  primarily with commercial market opportunities 
other income expense 
other income consists primarily of interest income 
substantially all available cash is invested in interest bearing accounts or fixed income instruments 
the decrease in other income expense for fiscal is the result of the use of cash to make strategic acquisitions and investments and an increase in interest expense on borrowings used to make strategic acquisitions 
income taxes 
income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal net income 
net income increased million for fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase is the result of the reasons discussed above 
comparison of operating results for fiscal with fiscal revenues 
revenues increased million in fiscal approximately of the increase was attributable to increases in funding for existing tactical and theater missile programs  approximately of the increase was attributable to two large contract awards for information technology services and of the increase was attributable to acquisitions during fiscal operating profit 
operating profit increased  in fiscal direct and allocable costs were stable as a percentage of revenues 
general and administrative expenses increased million in this increase reflects the company s aggressive bid and proposal activities for us government information systems and technology contracts and the significant emphasis on marketing the company s information technology services to healthcare and commercial entities 
as a result  the operating profit margin decreased to from in other income expense 
other income increased  in fiscal due primarily to increased rates of return on the company s invested cash balances 
substantially all of the company s available cash is invested in short term or variable interest bearing accounts 
the company recorded  in interest expense related to industrial development borrowings in income taxes 
income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate was due to a decrease in state income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company s positive cash flow from operations and available credit facilities  have provided adequate liquidity and working capital to fully fund the company s operational needs and support the acquisition program 
working capital was million  million and million at august   and  respectively 
operating activities used cash of million for the year ended august  and provided cash of million and million for the years ended august  and  respectively 
the company realized proceeds from the sale of common stock and reissuance of treasury stock of million  million and million for the years ended august   and  respectively 
the company realized net proceeds of million in fiscal from the sale of its common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement covering  shares of the company s common stock as adjusted for a for stock split effective october  
these proceeds were used to repay million of indebtedness under its existing bank line of credit facility  which will provide the company with flexibility to finance the working capital requirements under the company s system integration contracts 
these proceeds will also be used for general corporate purposes and for potential acquisitions 
the company has a bank line of credit of million which expires in march  unless renewed 
the credit agreement provides for interest at london interbank offered rate plus and a commitment fee on the unused portion of the line of credit 
outstanding borrowings are secured primarily by accounts receivable 
in fiscal  there were no borrowings under this line of credit 
in fiscal  the company borrowed million under this line of credit 
these proceeds  together with  shares of common stock from treasury shares  were used to acquire all the outstanding capital stock of ame 
as of august  all outstanding borrowings under the line of credit had been repaid 
in fiscal  the company borrowed million under an alabama state industrial development bond program offering certain incentives which effectively reduced the cost of borrowing 
the proceeds were utilized to expand acquisitions of property and equipment for information technology programs 
in fiscal  the company borrowed million under a term loan agreement 
the proceeds were used to purchase computer hardware for lease to a customer over a period of nine years under a systems integration contract 
purchases of property and equipment including those financed under the term loan agreement were million  million and million for the years ended august   and  respectively 
there are no material capital expenditure commitments at august  the company is regularly evaluating potential acquisition candidates 
in fiscal  the company acquired a interest in three separate information system development and technology companies 
these companies provide services primarily to commercial and healthcare clients 
the aggregate cash consideration for these transactions was approximately million 
in fiscal  the company also acquired a interest in txen for approxi imately million  and has an option to purchase the remaining in july in may  the company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of ame for cash consideration of approximately million and  shares of company stock 
in fiscal  the company was awarded the hpcm contracts for information system development and computer system integration activities  which will require the company to acquire substantial amounts of computer hardware for resale or lease to customers 
the company continues to actively pursue other contracts that could require similar equipment acquisitions 
the timing of payments to suppliers and payments from customers under the company s system integration contracts could cause cash flows from operations to fluctuate from period to period 
the company believes that its existing capital resources  together with available borrowing capacity  will be sufficient to fund operating needs  finance acquisitions of property and equipment for information technology programs and computer system integration activities  and make strategic acquisitions  if appropriate 
effects of inflation substantially all contracts awarded to the company have been based on proposals which reflect estimated cost increases due to inflation 
historically  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company
