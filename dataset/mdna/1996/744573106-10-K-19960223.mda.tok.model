pse g pse g  a new jersey corporation with its principal executive offices at park plaza  newark  new jersey  is an operating public utility company engaged principally in the generation  transmission  distribution and sale of electric energy service and in the transmission  distribution and sale of gas service in new jersey 
pse g supplies electric and gas service in areas of new jersey in which approximately  persons  about of the state s population  reside 
see general enterprise 
pse g s electric and gas service area is a corridor of approximately  square miles running diagonally across new jersey from bergen county in the northeast to an area below the city of camden in the southwest 
the greater portion of this area is served with both electricity and gas  but some parts are served with electricity only and other parts with gas only 
this heavily populated  commercialized and industrialized territory encompasses most of new jersey s largest municipalities  including its six largest cities newark  jersey city  paterson  elizabeth  trenton and camden in addition to approximately suburban and rural communities 
it contains a diversified mix of commerce and industry  including major facilities of many corporations of national prominence 
under the general laws of new jersey  pse g has the right to use the public highways  streets and alleys in new jersey for erecting  laying and maintaining poles  conduits and wires necessary for its electric operations 
pse g must  however  first obtain the consent in writing of the owners of the soil for the purpose of erecting poles 
in incorporated cities and towns  pse g must obtain from the municipality a designation of the streets in which the poles are to be placed and the manner of placing them 
pse g s rights are also subject to regulation by municipal authorities with respect to street openings and the use of streets for erecting poles in incorporated cities and towns 
pse g  by virtue of a special charter granted by the state of new jersey to one of its predecessors  has the right to use the roads  streets  highways and public grounds in new jersey for pipes and conduits for distributing gas 
pse g believes that it has all the franchises including consents necessary for its electric and gas operations in the territory it serves 
such franchises are non exclusive

competition overview the energy utility industry is in transition 
changes in federal and state law and regulation are encouraging new entrants to the traditional markets of electric and gas utilities 
new technologies are creating opportunities for new energy services 
customers  more aware and sophisticated about their choices and dissatisfied with prices and the often limited range of options available from the local utility  are increasingly turning elsewhere for energy supplies and services 
as a consequence of competition  the traditional utility structure consisting of a vertically integrated system and functioning as a natural monopoly is being dramatically altered 
further  pse g s ability to meet competition and change prices to meet customer s needs is impacted by state regulation  including the historic utility mandate to serve all customers 
see md a competition 
for a discussion of pse g s alternative plan of rate regulation  new jersey partners in power alternative rate plan as a response to these demands  see md a and note rate matters of notes 
non health and safety related federal energy laws and regulations are designed to make more efficient use of all energy  introduce price competition  encourage the use of nonconventional energy sources and limit oil imports by increasing production of domestic energy resources 
among other things  these actions encourage development of alternative energy generation  require wheeling of power for wholesale transactions  require state regulatory authorities to consider certain standards on rate design and certain other utility practices  encourage conservation of energy through certain financial incentives  including incentives by individual utilities to customers to help them to conserve energy and deregulate prices on natural gas 
also  federal and state laws designed to reduce air and water pollution and control hazardous substances have had the effect of increasing the costs of operation and replacement of existing utility plants and other facilities 
see environmental controls 
competition from nonutility generators nugs  such as cogenerators  independent power producers ipp and exempt wholesale generators ewgs  as permitted by the public utility regulatory policies act of purpa and the national energy policy act of epact  continues to impact pse g 
as a result of changes brought about by epact  along with proposals in some states to authorize retail wheeling  discussed below  electric customers and suppliers  including pse g and its customers  have increased opportunities for purchase and sale of electricity from and to sellers and buyers outside of traditional franchised territories 
retention of existing customers and potential sales growth will depend upon the ability of pse g to contain costs  meet customer expectations and respond to changing economic conditions and energy regulation 
as a result of such competitive forces  enterprise ventures services corporation ventures has been established as a subsidiary of pse g to develop and market new energy related products and services beyond traditional geographic and or industry boundaries 
competition may also adversely impact upon the economics of certain regulatory created incentives  such as demand side management dsm and conservation

electric in the electric utility industry  competitive pressures began with the enactment of purpa 
this law  together with subsequent changes in federal regulation  has increasingly opened the electric utility industry to competition 
purpa created a class of generating facilities exempt from federal and state public utility regulation cogeneration and small power producers known as qualifying facilities qfs and created an instant market for them by requiring regulated utilities to purchase their excess power production 
epact  by facilitating the development of the wholesale power market  has led to even stronger competition 
the increasing competitiveness of the electric wholesale markets  along with consideration of retail wheeling or direct retail access within utility franchise areas in several states  has brought to the forefront the issue of potential stranded costs within the electric utility industry see md a competition 
epact provides ferc with increased authority to order wheeling of wholesale  but not retail  electric power on the transmission systems of electric utilities  provided that certain requirements are met 
in order to facilitate the transition to increased competition in wholesale power markets made possible by epact  in march  ferc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking nopr which  if adopted  would require electric utilities  including pse g  to provide open access to the interstate transmission network pursuant to non discriminatory tariffs available to all wholesale sellers and buyers of electric energy 
utilities would be required to offer transmission to eligible customers comparable to the service they provide themselves and to take service under the tariffs for their own wholesale sales and purchases 
further  transmission and ancillary service components would be unbundled and  when buying or selling power  utilities would have to rely on the same network for transmission system information as their customers 
the nopr states ferc s general principle that utilities should be entitled to full recovery of legitimate and verifiable stranded costs at the federal and state levels and reiterates its prior proposal that such costs be directly assigned to departing customers 
the nopr further provides that stranded costs due to retail wheeling are a state matter  while stranded costs due to wholesale wheeling  municipalization or a change from retail to wholesale customer class are within ferc s jurisdiction 
pse g cannot predict the impact of any regulations that may be adopted

epact also amended puhca to create a new category of generation owners known as ewgs  which are not subject to puhca regulation 
epact permits both independent companies and utility affiliates to participate in the development of ewg projects regardless of the location and ownership of other generating resources 
the transmission access provisions apply to wholesale  but not retail  wheeling of power  subject to ferc review

another key factor in determining how competition will affect pse g s electric business is the extent to which new jersey public utility regulation may be modified to be reflective of these new competitive realities 
the bpu presented the first phase of the new jersey energy master plan to governor whitman on march  this phase i plan acknowledged the need for regulatory flexibility as competition unfolds and called for legislation that would allow new jersey utilities to propose  subject to bpu approval  alternatives to existing rate base rate of return pricing  allow for pricing flexibility under certain standards for customers with competitive options and equalize the impact of tax policies  such as new jersey gross receipts and franchise tax njgrt which is currently assessed only on utility retail energy sales 
on july   governor whitman signed into law legislation which provides utilities the flexibility to propose alternative regulatory pricing and to offer negotiated off tariff agreements see pse g customers 
on january   pse g filed a petition with the bpu for its alternative rate plan designed to fulfill the objectives of this new regulatory reform legislation 
this alternative rate plan represents a regulatory transition designed to provide pse g with the mechanisms and incentives to compete more effectively on several fronts  including the ability to develop revenue from non regulated products and services  accelerate or modify depreciation schedules to help mitigate any potential stranded asset issue and more aggressively manage costs 
for more information regarding the alternative rate plan see md a and note organization and summary of significant accounting policies  note rate matters and note deferred items of notes 
on june   the bpu issued its order initiating a formal phase ii proceeding to the new jersey energy master plan 
this proceeding is intended to investigate and consider the future long term structure of the electric power industry in new jersey 
the proceeding will address wholesale and retail competition  ownership of generation  transmission and distribution facilities  operation of the transmission system and stranded investments 
a phase ii report proposing policy restructuring is expected by march pse g cannot predict what impact  if any  the phase ii report will have 
gas over the last decade the natural gas industry has experienced a dramatic transformation as several ferc initiatives have subjected the industry to competitive market forces 
on the interstate level  the pipeline suppliers that serve pse g have unbundled gas supply and service and now offer transportation services that move gas purchased from numerous natural gas producers and marketers to pse g s service territory 
this unbundling effort has moved to the local level and  in late  the bpu approved unbundled transport tariffs for pse g 
these tariffs allow any non residential customer  regardless of size  to purchase its own gas  transport it to pse g and require pse g to deliver such gas to the customer s facility 
to date  over  commercial and industrial customers out of a potential of  customers have decided to utilize this service 
it is expected that this number will continue to grow as marketers become more active in new jersey and encourage customers to convert from sales service 
the transportation rate schedules produce the same non fuel revenue per therm as existing sales service rate schedules 
thus  pse g s earnings are unaffected whether the customers remain on sales service or convert to transportation service

customers as of december   pse g provided service to approximately  electric customers and  gas customers 
pse g is not dependent on a single customer or a few customers for its electric or gas sales 
for the year ended december   pse g s operating revenues aggregated billion  of which was from its electric operations and from its gas operations 
pse g s business is seasonal in that sales of electricity are higher during the summer months because of air conditioning requirements and sales of gas are greater in the winter months due to the use of gas for space heating purposes 
these revenues were derived as follows revenues electric gas millions of dollars residential  commercial  industrial transportation service gas other total   customers of pse g  as well as those of other new jersey electric and gas utilities  pay the njgrt which  in effect  adds approximately to their bills 
the njgrt is a unit tax based on electric kilowatthour and gas therm sales 
this tax differential provides an incentive to large volume electric and gas customers to seek to obtain their energy supplies from nonutility sources not subject to njgrt 
to the extent pse g experiences a loss of customers seeking to avoid this cost  it could result in a significant decrease in pse g s revenues and earnings 
on november   the bpu issued an order approving a stipulation regarding pse g s proposed experimental hourly energy pricing tariff and the first service agreement thereunder with its second largest customer 
under the agreement  the tariff will result in a bill reduction for the customer of approximately million or about 
this reduction in revenues will be partially offset by a decrease of million in pse g s njgrt liability 
under the agreement between the customer and pse g  the customer will forego an opportunity to relocate to another state and remain a pse g customer for ten years 
on january   an appeal seeking to overturn the bpu s november  decision and order was filed by a third party in the appellate division of the superior court of new jersey 
pse g cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
pse g has signed each of its three existing wholesale electric customers  aggregating mw of load  to year full service agreements with mid term extension options 
in addition  under the terms of a previously negotiated year wholesale power transaction  pse g receives million in annual revenues from an out of state electric cooperative

integrated resource plan pse g s construction program focuses on upgrading electric and gas transmission and distribution systems and constructing new transmission and distribution facilities to serve new load 
pursuant to its integrated resource plan irp  pse g periodically reevaluates its forecasted customer load and peak growth and the sources of electric generating capacity and dsm to meet such projected growth see demand side management below 
the irp takes into account assumptions concerning future customer demand  future cost trends  especially fuel and purchased power expenses  the effectiveness of conservation and load management activities  the long term condition of and projected additions to pse g s plants and capacity available from other electric utilities and nonutility suppliers 
pse g s irp consists principally of plant additions  power purchases through pjm and from nugs and dsm 
pennsylvania new jersey maryland interconnection pse g is a member of the pjm which integrates the bulk power generation and transmission supply operations of utilities in pennsylvania  new jersey  delaware  maryland  virginia and the district of columbia  and  in turn  is interconnected with other major electric utility companies in the northeastern part of the united states 
the pjm is operated as one system and provides for the purchase and sale of power among members on the basis of reliability of service and operating economy 
as a result  the most economical mix of generating capability available is used to meet pjm daily load requirements 
pse g s output  as shown under electric fuel supply and disposal  reflects significant amounts of purchased power because at times it is more economical for pse g to purchase power from pjm and others than to produce it 
as of december   the aggregate installed generating capacity of the pjm companies was  megawatts mw 
the all time record peak one hour demand experienced by the pjm power pool was  mw which occurred on august  the peak was  mw higher than the record setting summer peak of  mw which occurred on july  pse g s capacity obligations to the pjm system vary from year to year due to changes in system characteristics 
pse g expects to have sufficient installed capacity to meet its obligations during the period 
pjm has developed a comprehensive proposal intended to meet or exceed the goals expressed by ferc in its open access nopr  including a number of innovations that were designed to harmonize the requirements of the nopr with the benefits of power pooling 
in this proposal  pjm intends to satisfy the nopr s goals by building upon the foundation of pjm s power pooling operations 
the member companies of pjm intend to file this proposal with ferc by may and implement a restructured pool by year end under this proposal  the current members of pjm and other load serving entities in the pjm control area will purchase regional network transmission rights that are intended to enable them to reliably and economically integrate generation and load 
for deliveries to retail customers  this service will remain part of the bundled rates for retail electric service  subject to state jurisdiction  but with terms and conditions comparable to the service provided for wholesale users 
because this service will cover all deliveries to loads located in the pool  generators selling power to serve pool load will not have to purchase transmission service independently 
this is intended to create a regional wholesale power market in which all sellers and buyers operate on a level playing field 
under the proposal  transmission service will be provided under a regional point to point transmission service tariff 
this tariff will apply a uniform ratemaking methodology to all wholesale transactions involving deliveries outside the pool  including off system sales by the current members of pjm and other load serving entities in the pool 
accordingly  all transmission service associated with sales outside the pool will be provided on a comparable basis 
in order to meet the requirements to functionally unbundle transmission  pjm has proposed to reorganize into an independent system operator iso with responsibility for operating the bulk power system  administering the regional transmission service tariffs and managing the pool s competitive energy market 
the iso will be governed by a board of directors that is not controlled by the transmission owning members of pjm or their affiliates  and its responsibilities will be set forth in contracts filed with the ferc 
the iso will contract with the various pool participants to supply control area services  administer the transmission service tariffs and be responsible for maintaining the reliable operation of the system throughout each day 
one of the key elements of pjm s restructuring proposal is the creation of an expanded regional market for energy transactions 
pjm will replace the existing system of cost based centralized dispatch with an expanded  hourly bid price pool in which all sellers will be able to bid their energy into the pool and all load serving entities will be able to buy energy from the pool 
the energy market will clear in each hour at the highest bid price for energy that must be dispatched to serve load 
further  under the proposal  pjm will retain most of the existing pool procedures for ensuring reliable electric service  but will create new contractual mechanisms to ensure participation by all entities responsible for serving load in decisions affecting reliability 
each load serving entity that chooses to operate in the pjm control area will be required to execute an agreement to maintain adequate generation reserves and to share those reserves on a reciprocal basis 
pjm will establish an enhanced regional planning process  under the supervision of the iso  to meet mid atlantic area reliability council maac reliability requirements applicable to both generation and transmission 
in short  all load serving entities in the pool will be subject to the same reliability standards and will participate in decisions relating to the establishment of regional reliability requirements 
power purchases a component of pse g s irp consists of expected capacity additions from nugs 
these additions are projected to aggregate mw and are scheduled for service by nug projects are expected to comprise approximately of energy resources by this availability of nug generation will reduce the need for pse g to build or acquire additional generation 
pse g is also a party to the maac which provides for review and evaluation of plans for generation and transmission facilities and other matters relevant to reliability of the bulk electric supply systems in the mid atlantic area 
pse g expects to be able to continue to meet the demand for electricity on its system through operation of available equipment and by power purchases 
however  if periods of unusual demand should coincide with outages of equipment  pse g could find it necessary at times to reduce voltage or curtail load in order to safeguard the continued operation of its system 
demand side management integrated resource planning brings together demand side and supply side strategies 
in order to encourage dsm  the bpu adopted rules in providing special incentives to encourage utilities to offer these load management conservation services 
the rules are designed to place dsm on an equal regulatory footing with supply side or energy production investments 
both epact and phase i of the energy master plan call for conservation to play a significant role in meeting new jersey s energy needs over the coming decade 
pse g s dsm plan has been approved by the bpu 
the irp calls for pse g to utilize conservation and dsm to meet most of the incremental resource needs for the next decade see competition 
pse g s dsm plan is designed to encourage investment in energy saving dsm activities in new jersey 
these activities involve new techniques and technologies  such as high efficiency lighting and motors  that help reduce customer demand for energy 
the dsm plan consists of two major program areas for both electric and gas a core program which includes many specialized programs such as energy audits  seal ups and rebates for high efficiency heating and cooling equipment  and a standard offer program which is performance based and provides payment for measurable energy savings resulting from the installation of qualified measures that improve the energy efficiency of end uses 
pse g s most recent irp includes a demand forecast average compound annual rate of growth through the year of electric system peak demand of 
pse g s irp projects mw of passive dsm and mw of active dsm by the year pse g has established a wholly owned subsidiary  public service conservation resources corporation pscrc  to offer dsm services 
pscrc has its principal office at campus drive  parsippany  nj pscrc finances  markets and develops energy conservation projects  mostly within the pse g service territory

nuclear operations operation of nuclear generating units involves continuous close regulation by the nuclear regulatory commission nrc 
such regulation involves testing  evaluation and modification of all aspects of plant operation in light of nrc safety and environmental requirements and continuous demonstrations to the nrc that plant operations meet applicable requirements

pse g owns of the salem units and operates them on behalf of itself and three other owners peco atlantic electric company  and delmarva power and light company 
as of january   pse g s net book value for salem nuclear production units is approximately million for salem  million for salem and million in common plant between the two units 
each salem unit represents approximately of pse g s installed electric generating capacity and approximately of its total assets 
salem and have been out of service since may  and june   respectively 
since that time  pse g has been engaged in a thorough assessment of each unit to identify and complete the work necessary to achieve safe  sustained  reliable and economic operation 
pse g has stated that it will keep each unit off line until it is satisfied that the unit is ready to return to service and to operate reliably over the long term and the nrc has agreed that the unit is sufficiently prepared to restart 
on june   the nrc issued a confirmatory action letter documenting these commitments of pse g 
on december   pse g presented its restart plan for both units to the nrc at a public meeting 
on february   the nrc staff issued a letter to pse g indicating that it had concluded that pse g s overall restart plan  if implemented effectively  should adequately address the numerous salem issues to support a safe plant restart  and describing further actions the nrc will undertake to confirm that pse g s actions have resulted in the necessary performance improvements to support safe plant restart 
as a part of pse g s comprehensive review  an extensive examination is being performed on the steam generators  which are large heat exchangers used to produce steam to drive the turbines 
within the industry  certain pwrs other than salem have experienced cracking in a sufficient number of the steam generator tubes to require various modifications to these tubes and replacement of the steam generators in some cases 
until the current outage  regular periodic inspections of the steam generators for each salem unit have resulted in repairs of a small number of tubes well within nrc limits 
as a result of the experience of other utilities with cracking in steam generator tubes  in april the nrc issued a generic letter to all utilities with pressurized water reactors 
this generic letter requested utilities with pressurized water reactors to conduct steam generator examinations with more sensitive inspection devices capable of detecting evidence of degradation 
subsequently  pse g conducted steam generator inspections of the salem units using the latest technology available  including a new  more sensitive  eddy current testing device 
with respect to salem  the most recent inspection of the steam generators is not complete  but partial results from eddy current inspections in february using this new technology show indications of degradation in a significant number of tubes 
the inspections are continuing and pse g has decided to remove several tubes for laboratory examination to confirm the results of the inspections 
removal of the tubes should be completed in march and preliminary results of the state of the salem tubes from the subsequent laboratory examinations should be known in april 
however  based on the results of inspections to date  pse g has concluded that the salem outage  which was expected to be completed in the second quarter of  will be required to be extended for a substantial additional period to evaluate the state of the steam generators and to subsequently determine an appropriate course of action 
degradation of steam generators in pwrs has become of increasing concern for the nuclear industry 
nationally and internationally  utilities have undertaken actions to repair or replace steam generators 
in the extreme  degradation of steam generators has contributed to the retirement of several american nuclear power reactors 
after the salem tubes are fully examined  pse g will be able to evaluate its course of action in light of nrc and other industry requirements 
the examination of the salem steam generators was completed in january using the same testing device used in salem the results of the salem inspection are being reviewed again to confirm their results in light of the experience with salem although this review has not yet been completed  results to date appear to confirm that the condition of the salem steam generators is well within current repair limits at the present time 
pse g will also remove tubes from the salem steam generators for laboratory analysis to further confirm the results of this testing 
pse g had planned to return salem to service in the second quarter of and salem in the third quarter of as a result of the extent of the recently discovered degradation in the salem steam generators  pse g is focusing its efforts on the return of salem to service in the third quarter 
the conduct of the additional steam generator inspections and testing on salem is not expected to adversely affect the timing of its restart 
however  the timing of the restart is subject to completion of the requirements of the restart plan to the satisfaction of pse g and the nrc as well as to the normal uncertainties associated with such a substantial review and improvement of the systems of a large nuclear unit  so that no assurance can be given that the projected return date will be met 
pse g s share of additional operating and maintenance expenses associated with salem restart activities in was million  and capital was million 
pse g s share of total operating and maintenance expenses for both salem units for the year was million and capital costs were million 
for  pse g does not presently expect its share of operating and maintenance expenses or capital costs for salem station to exceed amounts  however this could change as a result of the steam generator inspection results referred to above 
the outage of a salem unit causes pse g to incur replacement power costs of approximately to million per month 
such amounts vary  however  depending on the availability of other generation  the cost of purchased energy and other factors  including modifications to maintenance schedules of other units 
pse g s aggregate capacity factor for its five nuclear units was  below the minimum annual standard established by the bpu see nuclear performance standard  resulting in a penalty of approximately million 
based upon current projections and assumptions regarding pse g s five nuclear units during  including the return of hope creek to service in early march  the return of salem in the third quarter  and the continued outage of salem for the remainder of the year  the aggregate capacity factor would be approximately  which would result in a penalty ranging from to million

an nrc enforcement conference was held on july  related to certain violations of nrc requirements at salem 
the violations included valves that were incorrectly positioned following a plant modification in may  non conservatisms in setpoints for a pressurizer overpressure protection system and several examples of inadequate root cause determination of events  leading to insufficient corrective actions 
on october   the nrc imposed cumulative civil penalties of  related to these violations 
pse g did not contest the penalties 
on january   the nrc provided pse g with its latest systematic assessment of licensee performance salp report on salem for the period between june  and november  salp is a process pursuant to which the nrc periodically reviews the performance of nuclear power plant operations 
salp reports rate licensee performance in four assessment areas operations  maintenance  engineering and plant support the plant support area includes security  emergency preparedness  radiological controls  fire protection  chemistry and housekeeping 
ratings range from a high of to a low of for each assessment area 
salem received a rating of in the operations and maintenance areas  a rating of in engineering  and a rating of in the plant support area 
the nrc noted an overall decline in performance and evidenced particular concern with plant and operator challenges caused by repetitive equipment problems and personnel errors 
the nrc also noted that although pse g has initiated several comprehensive actions within the past year to improve plant performance  and some recent incremental gains have been made  these efforts have yet to noticeably change overall performance at salem 
on march   representatives of the nrc staff met with the boards of directors of enterprise and pse g to reiterate the previously expressed concerns with regard to salem s operations 
the nrc staff acknowledged that pse g had made efforts to improve salem s operations  including making senior management changes  but indicated that demonstrated sustained results have not yet been achieved 
pse g s own assessments  as well as those by the nrc and the institute of nuclear power operations  indicate that additional efforts are required to further improve operating performance  as reflected in the restart plans referred to above 
pse g is committed to taking the necessary actions to address salem s performance needs 
it is anticipated that the nrc will continue to maintain a close watch on salem s restart activities and subsequent operational performance 
no assurance can be given as to what  if any  further or additional actions may be taken or required by the nrc to improve salem s performance

hope creek is presently scheduled to return to service in early march as a result of an internal allegation report  pse g submitted a licensee event report to the nrc on october  which stated that in  the hope creek control room was understaffed for approximately three minutes and a decision was made by those involved that the incident did not warrant initiation of nrc reporting documentation 
a meeting with region i nrc personnel was held on october  in which the nrc expressed a high degree of concern over the issue 
both the nrc and pse g investigated the validity of the allegation and  on september   the nrc issued two level iv violations with no civil penalty for this incident 
a small amount of low level radioactive material was released to the atmosphere at hope creek on april  the release did not exceed federal limits nor pose any danger to the public or plant employees  however  a trailer driven offsite had exceeded the limit for releasing materials and was later cleaned 
pse g and the nrc have investigated the event  and on june  an enforcement conference was held 
on july   the nrc issued a notice of violation for the hope creek unplanned release which noted four violations 
no fine was issued  partly because of the comprehensive corrective actions taken following the event and the plant s history of limited enforcement action 
on june   the nrc provided pse g with the latest periodic salp report for hope creek for the period between june  and april  the operations  maintenance and engineering areas each received a rating of  while the plant support area received a rating of 
however  the nrc noted an overall decline in performance in the operations  maintenance and engineering areas compared to the previous salp period and cited weak root cause analysis as a dominant factor 
on july   during a manual shutdown of hope creek in order to repair control room ventilation equipment  operators partially opened a valve for a period of time and inadvertently reduced the effectiveness of the shutdown cooling system 
although the impact of the event to plant safety was minimal  the positioning of the valve and the resulting temperature change violated plant procedures and technical specifications 
on july   nrc staff met with plant management concerning this issue and subsequently determined to assign a special inspection team to independently evaluate this event as well as pse g s response to it  including pse g s procedures and training for operator handling of abnormal conditions 
an nrc enforcement conference was held on november  on december   the nrc issued a level iii violation for this event  with a civil penalty of  pse g did not challenge the fine 
by letter dated january   the nrc requested a meeting with pse g senior management to discuss its concerns regarding declining trends in performance at hope creek 
the meeting has not yet been scheduled but is expected to occur after the restart of hope creek from its current refueling and maintenance outage 
peach bottom the outage of a peach bottom unit causes pse g to incur additional replacement energy costs of approximately to million per month per unit 
such amounts vary  however  depending upon the availability of other generation  the cost of purchased energy and other factors including modifications to maintenance schedules of other units 
pse g has been advised by peco that on january   the nrc issued its periodic salp report for peach bottom for the period may  to october  peach bottom received a rating of in the areas of plant operations  maintenance  and plant support 
engineering received a rating of 
the nrc found continued improvement in performance during the period 
operator performance continued to be a strength as well as operations management oversight 
effective engineering management actions to improve the overall self assessment and system performance evaluation programs were noted  as well as good management oversight activities 
response to emerging issues  equipment problems and event related issues were noted as particularly strong 
however  lapses in the quality of technical work and in modification implementation indicated inconsistent performance  and resulted in a repeat rating of for the engineering area 
peco has advised pse g that it will be taking actions to address weaknesses discussed in the salp report 
pse g has been advised by peco that  by letter dated october   the nrc has approved peco s request to re rate the authorized maximum reactor core power levels of both peach bottom units by to  mw from the current limits of  mw 
the amendment of the peach bottom facility operating license was effective upon the date of the nrc approval letter and the hardware changes were completed during the fall refueling outage 
the amendment of the peach bottom facility operating license became effective when the hardware changes for unit were completed during its fall refueling outage 
pse g has been advised by peco that on august   the nrc held an enforcement conference regarding three alleged violations identified by the nrc at peach bottom 
the nrc s findings included alleged violations in control and design activities and technical specification requirements regarding operability of the emergency diesel generators 
as a result  on august   the nrc issued peco a level iii violation with no civil penalty 
other nuclear matters in  general electric ge reported that crack indications were discovered near the seam welds of the core shroud assembly in a ge boiling water reactor bwr located outside the united states 
as a result  ge issued a letter requesting that the owners of ge bwr plants take interim corrective actions  including a review of fabrication records and visual examinations of accessible areas of the core shroud seam welds 
pse g hope creek and peco peach bottom participated in a ge bwr owners group to evaluate this issue and develop long term corrective actions 
during the spring refueling outage  pse g inspected the shroud of hope creek in accordance with ge s recommendations and found no cracks 
in june  an industry group was formed and subsequently established generic inspection guidelines which were approved by the nrc 
due to the age and materials of the hope creek shroud and the historical maintenance of low conductivity water chemistry  hope creek has been placed in the lowest susceptibility category under these guidelines 
hope creek must do another shroud inspection during its next refueling outage in  or install a preemptive repair that would maintain the structural integrity of the shroud under all normal and design basis accident conditions for the remaining life of the plant 
peco has advised pse g that peach bottom was last examined during its fall refueling outage and the extent of cracking identified was determined to be within industry established guidelines 
in a letter to the nrc dated november   peco concluded that there is a substantial margin for each core shroud weld to allow for continued operation of unit peco has also advised that peach bottom was examined in october during its refueling outage 
although some crack indications were identified  peco advised that they were considered to be much less severe than those found on unit  and no repairs were required to operate unit for another two year cycle 
as a separate matter  as a result of several bwr s experiencing clogging of some emergency core cooling system suction strainers  which supply water from the suppression pool for emergency cooling of the core and related structures  the nrc is drafting rules which tentatively require compliance by december alternative resolution options will be subject to nrc approval 
pse g cannot predict what other actions  if any  the nrc may take on this matter 
nuclear decommissioning in accordance with nuclear waste policy act of  as amended nwpa  utilities owning an interest in nuclear generating facilities are required to determine the costs and funding methods necessary to decommission such facilities upon termination of operation

coal approximately of pse g s coal supply for its new jersey facilities is obtained under a contract which expires in the balance of the supply is contracted annually from various suppliers  many of whom pse g has dealt with on a continuing basis for a number of years  and is supplemented by spot market purchases 
the new jersey air pollution control code njapcc permits the burning of coal with a sulfur content of up to at existing coal fired generating stations including pse g s three coal fired new jersey units  hudson and mercer and the weighted monthly average sulfur content of the coal received at hudson station and at mercer station must not exceed dry weight basis 
pse g has been able to obtain sufficient quantities of or less sulfur coal and does not presently anticipate any difficulties in obtaining adequate coal supplies to replace expiring contracts 
see environmental controls air pollution control 
pse g has approximately a interest in the keystone and conemaugh coal fired generating stations located in western pennsylvania and operated by pennsylvania electric company 
at least of the fuel required by the keystone station is supplied by one coal company under a contract which expires december  at least of the fuel required by conemaugh station is supplied by another coal company under a contract which expires on december  in addition  approximately of conemaugh s coal requirements is supplied by a short term contract which expires on november  the balance of the fuel requirements for each station is supplied through spot purchases obtained from local suppliers 
the keystone conemaugh projects office  which runs project administration at these plants on a day to day basis  has advised pse g that it does not expect any difficulties in obtaining adequate coal supplies 
see environmental controls 
natural gas pse g utilizes natural gas available from various spot  short term and long term gas contracts  to replace other fuels for electric generation 
presently  there are no effective legal restrictions on the use of natural gas for electric generation in existing plants 
however  approval by ferc is required for the interstate transportation of natural gas  either by virtue of existing blanket authority or through individual proceedings 
pse g does not expect any difficulties in obtaining natural gas supplies 
oil pse g uses residual oil in its conventional fossil fired  steam electric units 
the supply of residual oil is furnished by contract suppliers  supplemented by occasional spot market purchases 
pse g uses distillate fuel in its combustion turbines which is acquired by spot market purchases 
pse g does not presently anticipate any difficulties in obtaining oil supplies 
nuclear fuel disposal after spent fuel is removed from a nuclear reactor  it is placed in temporary storage for cooling in a spent fuel pool at the nuclear station site 
under nwpa  the federal government has entered into contracts for transportation and ultimate disposal of the spent fuel 
the federal government s present policy is that spent nuclear fuel will be accepted for long term storage at government owned and operated repositories 
however  at present  no such repositories are in service or under construction 
in december  the us department of energy doe announced that it would not be able to open a permanent  high level nuclear waste storage facility until  at the earliest 
however  the doe has also indicated that progress on the repository will be delayed beyond if sufficient funds are not appropriated by the congress for this program 
in conformity with the nwpa  pse g entered into contracts with the doe for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel from salem and hope creek 
similarly  peco contracted with the doe in connection with peach bottom and under these contracts  the doe is required to take title to the spent fuel at the site  then transport it and provide for its permanent disposal at a cost of one mil per kwh of nuclear generation  subject to such escalation as may be required to assure full cost recovery by the federal government 
in addition  a one time payment was made to the doe for permanently discharged spent fuels irradiated prior to on april   the doe published its final interpretation on the nuclear waste acceptance issues in which it stated that it had no legal obligation to begin waste acceptance in  in the absence of a repository or other storage facility 
pse g s contracts with doe call for doe to begin accepting spent fuel from pse g in as a result  on september   pse g  along with other utilities and a combination of states  state regulatory agencies and municipal power agencies  filed a lawsuit in the us district court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit against the doe to protect its contractual rights 
pursuant to nrc rules  spent nuclear fuel generated in any reactor can be stored safely and without significant environmental impact in reactor facility storage pools or in independent spent fuel storage installations located at reactor or away from reactor sites for at least years beyond the licensed life for reactor operation which may include the term of a revised or renewed license 
as a result of reracking the two spent fuel pools at salem  the availability of adequate spent fuel storage capacity is conservatively estimated through for salem and for salem  prior to losing an operational full core discharge reserve 
the hope creek pool is also fully racked and it is conservatively expected to provide storage capacity until  again prior to losing an operational full core discharge reserve 
the units can be safely operated for many years beyond these dates  as pool storage capacity will continue to be available 
these dates simply assist in planning the need for additional storage capacity that may be needed to operate the units until the expiration of their operating license 
in addition  peco has advised pse g that spent fuel racks at peach bottom have storage capacity until for unit and for unit  prior to losing full core reserve capability  and that expansion of storage capacity beyond such dates is being investigated 
low level radioactive waste llrw as a by product of their operations  nuclear generating units  including those in which pse g owns an interest  produce llrw 
such wastes include paper  plastics  protective clothing  water purification materials and other materials 
such materials are accumulated on site and disposed of at a federally licensed permanent disposal facility in barnwell  south carolina 
in  new jersey enacted legislation providing for funding of the estimated million cost of establishing a llrw disposal facility 
the state would recover the costs through fees paid by llrw generators 
pse g s overall share is expected to be about of the total cost and has provided about million to date 
new jersey has introduced a volunteer siting process to establish a llrw disposal facility by the year public meetings have been held across the state in an effort to provide information to and obtain feedback from the public 
to date  there have been no volunteers identified 
because of the uncertainties in disposal  pse g built an on site facility completed in september this facility provides five years storage for llrw from hope creek and salem 
the facility was used from july through june  while the barnwell facility was temporarily unavailable  and emptied when barnwell re opened in it will be used for interim storage of radioactive materials and waste  and if it proves necessary in the future  to temporarily store waste until new jersey provides a permanent disposal facility 
peco has advised pse g that it has an on site llrw storage facility for peach bottom  which will provide at least years of temporary storage 
peco has also advised pse g that pennsylvania is pursuing its own llrw site development via state selected candidate sites  along with a volunteer plan option 
pse g has paid million as its share of siting costs due to its ownership in the peach bottom units 
gas operations and supply pse g supplies its gas customers principally with natural gas 
pse g supplements natural gas with purchased refinery gas and liquefied petroleum gas produced from propane 
the adequacy of supply of all types of gas is affected by the nationwide availability of all sources for energy production 
as of december   the daily gas capacity of pse g was as follows type of gas therms per day natural gas  liquefied petroleum gas  refinery gas  total  about of the daily gas capacity is high load factor natural gas and is available every day of the year 
the remainder comes from field storage  liquefied natural gas  seasonal sales  contract peaking supply  propane and refinery gas 
pse g s total gas sold to and transported for its various customer classes in was billion therms which consisted of approximately natural gas 
included in this amount is billion therms of gas delivered to customers under pse g s transportation tariffs and individual cogeneration contracts 
see operating statistics of pse g 
during  pse g purchased approximately billion therms of gas for its combined gas and electric operations directly from natural gas producers and marketers and the balance from interstate pipeline suppliers 
these supplies were transported to new jersey by pse g s four interstate pipeline suppliers 
this diversification of supply sources provides pse g with reliability of supply  purchasing flexibility and lower overall costs 
pse g s gas supply contracts expire at various times over the next two to ten years 
pse g does not presently anticipate any difficulty in negotiating replacement contracts 
since the quantities of gas available to pse g under its supply contracts are more than adequate in warm months  pse g nominates part of such quantities for storage  to be withdrawn during the winter season  under storage contracts with its principal suppliers 
underground storage capacity currently is approximately million therms 
pse g does not presently anticipate any difficulty in obtaining adequate supplies of natural gas 
pse g s annual average cost of natural gas sendout is shown below cents per year million btu a a excludes contribution by pse g s electric operating units for a gas reservation charge and natural gas refunds from suppliers 
substantially all of pse g s gas sales are made under rates which are currently designed to permit the recovery of projected increases in the cost of natural gas and gas from supplemental sources  when compared to levels included in base rates  on a current annual basis 
see note rate matters of notes 
the demand for gas by pse g s customers is affected by customer conservation  economic conditions  weather  the price relationship between gas and alternative fuels and other factors not within pse g s control 
presently  the majority of gas sold in interstate commerce has become deregulated 
the ability of gas prices to respond to market conditions has improved in recent years because of actions taken by the ferc 
pipeline companies are able to adjust their gas rates up or down through their purchased gas adjustment mechanism more often than the semi annual filings of prior years 
as discussed above in competition  ferc actions provided pipeline customers  such as pse g  with the opportunity to convert a portion of their pipeline sales contracts to transportation agreements and purchase natural gas supplies directly from a producer or other seller of natural gas 
this has increased competition in the gas market by encouraging pipeline companies to act as non discriminatory transporters of natural gas 
pse g has taken advantage of these actions to lower its overall gas costs through the displacement of higher cost contract supplies with lower cost spot gas purchases and long term producer contract supplies 
see competition 
pse g was able to meet all of the demands of its firm customers during the winter season and expects to continue to meet such energy related demands of its firm customers during the winter season 
however  the sufficiency of supply could be affected by several factors not within pse g s control  including curtailments of natural gas by its suppliers  the severity of the winter  the extent of energy conservation by its customers and the availability of feedstocks for the production of supplements to its natural gas supply 
during the heating season through february   it was necessary for pse g to interrupt service to interruptible customers for days as permitted by the applicable tariff 
during the heating season  service to such customers was interrupted for eight days

the new jersey public utility accident fault determination act fault act requires the bpu to make a determination of fault with regard to any accident at any electric generating or transmission facility prior to granting a request by any utility for a rate increase to cover accident related costs in excess of million 
fault  as defined in the fault act  means any negligent action or omission of any party which either contributed substantially to causing the accident or failed to mitigate its severity 
however  the fault act allows the affected utility to file for non accident related rate increases during such fault determination hearings and to recover contributions to federally mandated or voluntary cost sharing plans and allows the bpu to authorize the recovery of certain fault related repair  clean up  power replacement and damage costs if substantiated by the evidence presented and if authorized in writing by the bpu 
the fault act could have a material adverse effect on pse g s financial position if such an accident were to occur at a pse g facility  it was ultimately determined that the accident was due to the fault of pse g and the bpu were to deny recovery of all or a portion of the costs related thereto

under new jersey law  the bpu is required to audit all or a portion of the operating procedures and other internal workings of every gas or electric utility subject to its jurisdiction  including pse g  at least once every six years 
under the law  the audit may be performed either by the bpu staff or under the supervision of designated members of such staff by an independent management consulting firm  chosen by the utility from a list provided by the bpu 
the bpu may  upon completion of the audit and after notice and hearing  order the utility to adopt such new practices and procedures that it shall find reasonable and necessary to promote efficient and adequate service to meet public convenience and necessity 
the last such management audit of pse g was completed in in  as a follow up to its management audit  the bpu conducted a focused audit of enterprise s nonutility businesses to ascertain whether nonutility activities had harmed pse g 
enterprise has consistently maintained a clear and distinct separation of its utility and nonutility operations and believes that its nonutility activities have not in any way adversely affected the utility 
the results of the focused audit confirmed that there has been no harm to pse g as a result of enterprise s nonutility activities 
however  as a result of recommendations made by the bpu s auditors regarding operations and intercompany relationships between pse g and edhi s nonutility businesses  the bpu approved a plan which  among other things  provides that enterprise will not permit edhi s nonutility investments to exceed of enterprise s consolidated assets without prior notice to the bpu such assets at december  were approximately  for a restructuring of the pse g board to include nonemployee enterprise directors with an annual certification by such board that the business and financing plans of edhi will not adversely affect pse g  for an enterprise agreement to a limit debt supported by the minimum net worth maintenance agreement between enterprise and capital to million  and b make a good faith effort to eliminate such support over a six to ten year period from april  and the payment by edhi to pse g of an affiliation fee of up to million a year which will be applied by pse g through its lgac and leac to reduce utility rates 
effective january   the debt supported by the minimum net worth maintenance agreement will be limited to million and such affiliation fee will be proportionately reduced as such supported debt is reduced 
in addition  enterprise and edhi and its subsidiaries continue to reimburse pse g for all costs of services provided by employees of pse g 
the issue of enterprise sharing the benefits of consolidated tax savings with pse g or its ratepayers was not resolved by the plan approved as a result of the focused audit and remains open 
enterprise believes that pse g s taxes should be treated on a stand alone basis for rate making purposes  based on the separate nature of the utility and nonutility businesses 
however  neither enterprise nor pse g is able to predict what action  if any  the bpu may take concerning consolidation of tax benefits in future proceedings 
on july   the bpu reported to pse g that it had fully evaluated all available information regarding the recommendations of the focused audit conducted by the bpu s consultant and determined that have been implemented pursuant to the bpu s order approving audit implementation plans 
the remaining issue regarding enterprise sharing the benefits of consolidated taxes with pse g or its ratepayers may be considered in the context of a future base rate case  or in a filing that considers an alternative form of regulation 
pse g cannot predict what actions  if any  the bpu may take regarding the consolidated tax issue

certain federal legislation confers similar rights on individuals 
the principal laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment which affect pse g s operations are described below 
air pollution control the federal clean air act caa imposes emission control requirements across the united states  including requirements related to the emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides nox and requires attainment of national ambient air quality standards naaqs 
pse g s two wholly owned and operated coal fired generating stations in new jersey are presently expected to be able to meet caa sulfur dioxide requirements with only modest expenditures 
pse g also has approximately a interest in conemaugh and keystone  coal fired generating stations located in western pennsylvania 
with respect to conemaugh  in order to comply with the caa sulfur dioxide requirements  the station s co owners  including pse g  approved the installation of scrubbers flue gas desulfurization systems 
pse g s share of the remaining conemaugh scrubber cost is less than million and is included in pse g s estimate of construction expenditures 
scrubber construction at conemaugh unit was completed in november keystone is presently expected to comply with the sulfur dioxide requirements by utilizing excess emission allowances from the over scrubbing of the conemaugh units 
the caa established a national emission trading system for sulfur dioxide allowances 
yearly allowances have been allocated according to a formula specified by the caa and applicable to owner operators of large boilers and power generating equipment 
new jersey and other northeastern states have imposed reasonably available control technology ract requirements on each major source of nox 
additionally  these states have committed to additional overall nox emission reductions on power plants and large industrial boilers of 
pounds per million btus by with potential additional reductions of 
pounds per million btus by all of pse g s fossil generating units are currently in compliance with ract requirements 
the njdep  in concert with other states in the northeast  is implementing a regional caa nox allowance emission trading system for power plants and large industrial boilers 
this includes the allocation of emission allowances to these sources in the nox allowance trading system is scheduled to be operational by the beginning of and could result in additional changes to equipment  methods of operation or fuel 
epa has promulgated six naaqs 
pse g s fossil generating stations are all located in areas of non attainment for ozone 
each state has the responsibility under the caa to adopt a plan  and regulations  to attain and maintain compliance to these standards 
in new jersey  njdep is using the new jersey air pollution control code njapcc to achieve compliance with  and maintenance of  the naaqs 
the njapcc provides stringent requirements restricting the sulfur content in coal and oil fuels 
see pse g electric fuel supply and disposal coal 
the increased cost of purchasing low sulfur fuel is offset by rates which are designed to permit the recovery of fuel costs on a current annual basis 
in accordance with the proposed alternative rate plan  separate mechanisms would be established to ensure continued recovery of costs associated with activities mandated or approved by state or federal agencies or otherwise out of pse g s control 
see pse g electric fuel supply and disposal and note rate matters of notes 
the caa also requires that each major facility apply for and receive a facility wide operating permit 
the facility wide operating permit terms and conditions are enforceable by both the epa and njdep 
pse g filed permit applications for its major facilities in new jersey in the operating permit program will require some pse g facilities to assess emissions  which could require the installation of emission monitoring equipment and changes to facility operations or technology 
to the extent estimates of the costs of complying with these requirements through the year are quantifiable  they are included in pse g s construction expenditures 
in accordance with the filed alternative rate plan  pse g has requested to have separate mechanisms to ensure continued recovery of costs associated with activities mandated or approved by state or federal agencies  although no assurances can be given as to what action may be taken by the bpu 
in addition  the revised caa requirements will increase the cost of producing electricity for the pennsylvania and ohio valley region generating units supplying electricity to the pjm and new jersey 
all of pse g s current purchased power costs are included in pse g s leac 
see note rate matters of notes 
in non attainment areas  one of the effects of the caa is to allow construction or expansion of a facility only upon a showing that any additional emissions from the source will be more than offset by reductions in similar emissions from existing sources 
in prevention of significant deterioration areas  construction or expansion of a facility would be permitted only if emissions from the source  together with emissions from other expected new sources  would not violate air quality increments for particulates and sulfur dioxide that are more stringent than naaqs 
all of these requirements may affect pse g s ability to locate  construct or expand generating facilities in the future 
pse g has been working collaboratively with environmentalists  a select number of other electric utilities in the northeast  njdep and other northeast environmental regulators  epa  and a number of large manufacturing companies to achieve significant emission reductions from power plants in the midwest 
pse g has also been working with these respective groups to establish a flexible nox and volatile organic compound voc emissions trading system as a compliance alternative to caa compliance requirements for industrial facilities  highway and off highway emission sources  state transportation caa conformity and automobile inspection and maintenance 
significant emission reductions from midwest are expected to improve new jersey s and the northeast s air quality thereby lessening the need for additional new jersey emission controls over and beyond those already regulatorily adopted 
these collaborative efforts  coupled with growing environmental regulator and industry concerns for cost effective compliance with caa requirements  have resulted in the creation of a thirty seven state environment forum called ozone transport assessment group otag 
this includes midwest  northeast and southern states east of the mississippi river 
otag s charter is to produce consensus recommendations concerning the need for additional emission controls and to identify the level and sources to which those controls should be applied 
otag is expected to conclude its work by the fall of if the otag process fails to produce consensus that leads to an agreement by individual states to undertake timely necessary control actions  affected downwind states such as those in the northeast are required as part of their epa approved caa state implementation plans to submit petitions to epa seeking epa s imposition of controls on upwind states 
it is difficult to determine at this time the likely outcome of this process 
recently  the issue of transported air pollution from the midwest power plants and their negative impact on air quality in the northeast has become the subject of concern before the ferc 
the ferc has performed a draft environmental impact statement to assess the environmental impact of developing a generic rule by which electric utilities will be required to provide full non discriminatory transmission access to all wholesale power providers 
pse g and a number of other utilities  environmental groups and regulators have submitted comments seeking ferc s mitigation of expected additional power plant emissions resulting from the implementation of ferc s open access policies 
it is too soon to determine to what extent ferc will act on the concerns raised 
water pollution control the federal water pollution control act fwpca authorizes the imposition of technology and water quality based effluent limitations to regulate the discharge of pollutants into the surface waters of the united states through the issuance of national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permits 
the new jersey water pollution control act njwpca authorizes the njdep to regulate discharges to surface waters and ground waters of the state through the new jersey pollutant discharge elimination system njpdes permits 
njdep also administers the npdes njpdes permit program 
certain pse g facilities are directly regulated by njpdes permits issued pursuant to fwpca and the njwpca 
in addition  the fwpca also imposes additional requirements with respect to the control of toxic discharges to degraded waterbodies under section 
although five pse g electric generating stations bergen  hudson  kearny  linden and sewaren were originally subject to requirements imposed pursuant to section l  the njdep and epa have proposed delisting these stations from the l program for the present time 
the fwpca also authorizes the imposition of less stringent thermal limits pursuant to a variance procedure set forth in section a and the regulation of cooling water intake structures pursuant to section b 
pse g has filed information with the njdep in support of section a variance requests and section b best technology available determinations for several of its electric generating stations which are pending before the njdep presently and may be required to submit information for other stations as a result of the permit renewal process 
with respect to section b requirements  the epa initiated a rulemaking procedure in to develop regulations implementing this provision 
pursuant to a consent decree entered by a federal district court resolving an action to compel the rulemaking brought by a number of environmental groups including certain of those who opposed the salem njpdes permit  epa must propose draft regulations on or before july  and promulgate final regulations by august while the content and scope of these regulations can not be predicted at this time  they may have a considerable effect on agency review of section b determinations pending in or after 
see discussions on hudson  mercer  and salem njpdes permits below 
the fwpca and the njwpca also authorize the discharge of stormwater from certain facilities including steam electric generating stations 
in many instances  this is accomplished through the development of stormwater pollution prevention plans sppp 
similarly  both laws authorize publicly owned treatment works potw to issue permits for significant industrial users siu of the treatment facility 
certain of pse g s facilities have permits under the sppp and siu programs 
a brief discussion on pending permit proceedings which have the potential to impose new or more stringent terms or conditions which could require changes to operations or significant expenditures follows hudson station s njpdes permit is in the process of being renewed by the njdep 
as part of that renewal  the njdep has requested updated information in connection with pse g s a and b demonstrations  in part  to address issues identified by a consultant hired by njdep 
the consultant recommended that hudson be retrofit to operate with closed cycle cooling to address alleged adverse impacts associated with the thermal discharge and intake structure 
pse g is in the process of collecting additional data which will be used in the updated demonstrations 
pse g anticipates submitting these documents to njdep in the first quarter of it is impossible to predict the njdep s determinations on these demonstrations  however  pse g presently estimates that the cost of retrofitting hudson to operate with closed cycle cooling could be in excess of million in dollars 
njdep has advised pse g that it is preparing a renewal permit for mercer station and  in connection with that renewal  will also be reexamining mercer s compliance with section a b 
this may result in pse g s being required to submit updated a and b demonstrations for njdep review 
it is impossible to predict at this time the outcome of such review 
pse g is implementing the njpdes permit issued for salem station which requires  among other things  water intake screen modifications and wetlands restoration 
in addition  pse g is seeking permits and approvals from various agencies needed to fully implement the special conditions of the permit 
no assurances can be given as to receipt of any such additional permits or approvals 
the estimated capital cost of compliance with the final permit is approximately million  of which pse g s share is and is included in pse g s construction program 
in accordance with the filed alternative rate plan pse g has requested to have separate mechanisms to ensure continued recovery of costs associated with activities mandated or approved by state or federal agencies  although no assurances can be given as to what action may be taken by the bpu 
pse g must apply to renew the salem permit in march which renewal application must provide updated section a and b demonstrations for the njdep s review 
see the discussion above regarding epa s section b rulemaking 
see md a liquidity and capital resources construction  investments and other capital requirements forecast 
in june   pse g filed an application with the delaware river basin commission drbc seeking a modification to the heat dissipation area previously established based upon the njdep s grant of a section a variance for salem station 
drbc issued a modified docket in september granting pse g s request 
pse g must reapply to the drbc in for a continuation of this heat dissipation area 
pse g anticipates that njdep will issue a draft renewal permit for hope creek station in which will not propose effluent limitations or other requirements significantly more stringent than those in the existing permit

this discussion refers to the consolidated financial statements and related notes of enterprise and should be read in conjunction with such statements and notes 
overview enterprise has two direct wholly owned subsidiaries  public service electric and gas company pse g and enterprise diversified holdings incorporated edhi 
enterprise s principal subsidiary  pse g  is an operating public utility providing electric and gas service in certain areas in the state of new jersey 
edhi is the parent of enterprise s nonutility businesses energy development corporation edc  an oil and gas exploration and production and marketing company  community energy alternatives incorporated cea  an investor in and developer and operator of cogeneration and independent power production ipp facilities and exempt wholesale generators ewgs  public service resources corporation psrc  which has made primarily passive investments  and enterprise group development corporation egdc  a diversified nonresidential real estate development and investment business 
edhi also has two finance subsidiaries pseg capital corporation capital  which provides privately placed debt financing on the basis of a minimum net worth maintenance agreement from enterprise and enterprise capital funding corporation funding  which provides privately placed debt financing guaranteed by edhi but without direct support from enterprise 
enterprise has been conducting a controlled exit from the real estate business since and  in december  announced that it intends to divest edc 
as of december  and december   pse g comprised of enterprise assets 
for each of the years  and  pse g revenues were of enterprise s revenues and pse g s earnings available to enterprise for such years were  and  respectively  of enterprise s net income 
the major factors which will affect enterprise s future results include general and regional economic conditions  pse g s customer retention and growth  the ability of pse g and edhi to meet competitive pressures and to contain costs  the ability to respond to and take advantage of opportunities arising from increasing competition in the utility business  the adequacy and timeliness of rate relief  cost recovery and necessary regulatory approvals  the ability to continue to operate and maintain nuclear programs in accordance with nuclear regulatory commission nrc and new jersey board of public utilities bpu requirements  the impact of environmental regulations  continued access to the capital markets and continued favorable regulatory treatment of consolidated tax benefits 
see note rate matters  note federal income taxes and note commitments and contingent liabilities of notes to consolidated financial statements notes 
competition the regulatory structure which has historically embraced the electric and gas industry is in the process of transition 
legislative and regulatory initiatives  at both the federal and state levels  are designed to promote competition and will continue to impose additional pressures on pse g s ability to retain customers 
in addition  new technology and interest in self generation and cogeneration have provided customers with alternative sources of energy 
over the last several years  the gas industry has been transformed 
today  commercial and industrial customers can negotiate their own gas purchases directly with producers or brokers  while pse g is required to provide intrastate transportation of such purchased gas to the customers facilities 
although pse g is not providing gas sales service to certain commercial and industrial customers  to date there has been no negative impact on earnings since sales service and transportation service tariffs result in the same non fuel revenue per therm 
additionally  as a result of this restructuring  pse g has been able to negotiate lower cost gas supplies for those customers who continue to be part of its bundled rate schedules 
a potential significant competitive challenge could emerge if interstate pipeline companies are permitted to expand their facilities into pse g territory and provide intrastate transportation to customers 
however  this type of expansion would require federal and state regulatory approvals not currently in existence 
the restructuring of the electric industry is more complex and evolving at a slower pace than that of the gas industry 
federal legislation  such as the national energy policy act epact has eased restrictions on independent power producers ipp in an effort to increase competition in the wholesale electric generation market 
as the barriers to entry in the power production business have been lowered  the construction of cogeneration facilities and independent power production facilities has been growing  with the result of creating lower cost alternatives for large commercial and industrial customers 
presently  pse g is in the process of assessing the potential for individual arrangements with commercial and industrial customers which have such competitive alternatives  but pse g believes that it does not currently have a material exposure with respect to such customers 
further  epact authorized the federal energy regulatory commission ferc to mandate utilities to transport and deliver or wheel energy for the supply of bulk power to wholesale customers 
in march  ferc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking nopr that would require utilities to establish open access to all wholesale sellers and buyers  offer transmission service comparable to service they provide themselves and take transmission service under the same tariffs offered to other buyers and sellers 
ferc s stated position is that it will ensure that utilities have a fair opportunity to recover prudently incurred investments that could become stranded costs as a result of the nopr 
in the wholesale electric market  other competitive pressures  such as municipalization  may also have an impact on utilities in the evolving electric power industry 
municipalization involves the acquisition and operation of existing investor owned facilities by a municipal utility muni through condemnation  purchase or lease or the construction and operation of duplicate  parallel facilities within a municipal boundary 
as a result  utilities  such as pse g  could lose customers residential  commercial and industrial in the municipality that is served by the muni  as well as lose the municipal entity itself as a customer 
epact granted the states sole authority to mandate retail wheeling 
new jersey regulators have been reviewing existing regulations in an effort to develop a revised regulatory structure that would afford public utilities  such as pse g  increased flexibility to meet the competitive challenges of the future 
phase i of the new jersey energy master plan phase i  a two phase plan to better manage the future energy needs of the state  has been completed 
phase i called for legislation that would allow new jersey utilities to propose  subject to bpu approval  alternatives to rate base rate of return pricing  allow for pricing flexibility under certain standards for customers with competitive options and equalize the impact of tax policies  such as the new jersey gross receipts and franchise tax njgrt currently assessed on retail energy utility sales  upon all energy producers 
on july   governor whitman signed into law legislation which provides utilities the flexibility to propose  subject to bpu approval  alternatives to existing rate base rate of return pricing and offer negotiated off tariff agreements to customers with competitive options 
on june   the bpu issued its order initiating a formal phase ii proceeding of the master plan 
the proceeding will address wholesale and retail competition in new jersey 
recoverability of stranded costs is largely dependent on the transition rules established by regulators  including ferc and the bpu 
stranded costs that could result as the industry moves to a more competitive environment include investments in generating facilities  transmission assets  purchase power agreements where the price being paid under such an agreement exceeds the market price for electricity and regulatory assets for which recovery is based solely on continued cost based regulation 
at this time  management cannot predict the level of stranded costs  if any  or the extent to which regulators will allow recovery of such costs 
increased competition and the shift of risks and opportunities between rate payers and pse g resulting from pse g s filing of its proposed alternative rate plan discussed below will increase the emphasis upon electric operational reliability  efficiency and cost 
while the incremental cost of nuclear production is less expensive than pse g s other sources of generation  comparatively high embedded costs for nuclear plants increase the need for pse g to optimize the utilization of its nuclear generating capacity in order to make its actual generation output cost competitive 
in order to succeed in this increasingly competitive environment  enterprise and its subsidiaries have taken the following steps designed to retain customers  reduce costs  improve operations and strategically position itself for future operation on january   pse g filed its proposed alternative rate plan  the new jersey partners in power plan alternative rate plan 
this seven year proposed alternative rate plan allows for a transition to a competitive energy marketplace while substantially shifting the business and financial risks and opportunities involved in such transition away from customers to pse g 
some of the key features of the proposal are a an indexed or price capped approach to replace the rate base rate of return form of regulation including the discontinuance of the electric levelized energy adjustment clause leac and the bpu s nuclear performance standard nps  b a productivity gains sharing mechanism with electric and gas customers  c continued recovery of costs associated with activities mandated by state or federal agencies and d a program of rewards and penalties based on the performance of certain key overall service indicators  such as the duration of customer power outages compared to a five year average 
for a full discussion of the alternative rate plan  see note rate matters of notes 
pse g reorganized its senior nuclear leadership team to address operation and performance issues at pse g operated nuclear facilities and completed a thorough work scope assessment of salem and salem in order to return these units to safe  reliable operation over the long term 
pse g reorganized to reflect the evolution toward stand alone energy and energy services businesses designed to compete successfully in the future 
the reorganization unbundled the services previously provided by the electric and gas businesses 
the focus is now on areas of business generation  transmission and distribution and customer services 
also as part of the corporate reorganization  a new business was created  enterprise ventures services corporation  to pursue products and services which can be marketed beyond traditional geographic and industry boundaries 
among these are natural gas marketing in the wake of deregulation of that industry  conservation and energy management services and a product development venture with at t corp 
to pilot and eventually market two way customer communications systems and services 
pse g developed initiatives  including the announced closure of five older  less efficient generating units  to reduce annual fossil generation operating and maintenance expenses  as well as to reduce annual fossil capital expenditures 
pse g has established a deleveraging plan to retire more than billion of outstanding debt over the next five years and to fund its current five year construction program entirely through internally generated cash 
pse g became the first utility in the northeast to implement a service guarantee program 
it covers nine key service areas and provides direct bill credits to customers should pse g fail to live up to its promises 
the strategic account marketing organization was created within pse g to provide more individualized service to its largest customers 
pse g received bpu approval for its proposed experimental hourly energy pricing tariff and the first service agreement thereunder with its second largest customer 
this type of agreement serves as an incentive to retain customers with other energy alternatives in pse g s customer base  as well as in new jersey 
also in  pse g completed the bergen repowering project which improved the efficiency and environmental effectiveness of the facility 
fuel costs for the facility will be reduced by approximately million annually 
cea pursued business opportunities in certain international markets 
during  cea closed on three projects and a strategic alliance in china and south america 
enterprise announced that edhi will pursue the divestiture of edc 
the decision to divest edc stems from enterprise s conclusion that ownership of large oil and natural gas reserves is no longer necessary to provide efficient energy solutions to customers and that the true market value of edc is not reflected in the price of enterprise common stock 
enterprise and its subsidiaries remain committed to the pursuit of initiatives to contain costs and retain customers 
accounting for the effects of regulation currently  pse g accounts for the effects of regulation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas  pse g defers certain expenses regulatory assets on the basis that they will be recovered from customers as part of the ratemaking process 
pse g believes that if its proposed alternative rate plan is approved essentially as proposed  it would continue to meet the criteria to account for certain utility revenues and expenses in accordance with sfas however  if future events or regulatory changes limit pse g s ability to establish prices to recover its costs  pse g might conclude that it no longer meets the application criteria to defer certain expenses in accordance with sfas if pse g were to discontinue the application of sfas  the accounting impact would be an extraordinary  non cash charge to operations that could be material to the financial position and results of operations of enterprise and pse g 
pse g has certain regulatory assets resulting from the use of a level of depreciation expense in the rate making process that is less than the amount that would be recorded under generally accepted accounting principles gaap for non regulated companies 
pse g cannot presently quantify what the financial statement impact may be if depreciation expense were required to be determined absent regulation  but the impact on the financial position and results of operations of pse g and enterprise could be material 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets sfas effective for  establishes accounting standards for the impairment of long lived assets 
sfas also requires that regulatory assets which are no longer probable of recovery through future revenues be charged to earnings 
the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of pse g and enterprise 
pse g energy and fuel adjustment clauses under the existing regulatory framework  pse g has fuel and energy tariff rate adjustment clauses  the levelized gas adjustment charge lgac and the leac  which are designed to permit adjustments for changes in electric energy and gas supply costs and certain other costs as approved by the bpu  when compared to cost recovery included in base rates 
presently  charges under the clauses are primarily based on energy and gas supply costs which are normally projected over twelve month periods except for large gas commercial and industrial customers for which commencing january   gas supply costs are projected monthly 
the changes in the clauses do not directly affect earnings because such costs are adjusted monthly to match amounts recovered through revenues except for the financing costs of carrying underrecovered balances and required interest payments on net overrecovered balances 
under the clauses  if actual costs differ from the costs recovered  the amount of the underrecovery or overrecovery is deferred 
actual costs otherwise includable in the leac are subject to adjustment by the bpu in accordance with the nps 
see note rate matters and note commitments and contingent liabilities of notes 
the alternative rate plan proposes discontinuing leac and nps and would substantially shift the risks and opportunities involved in managing changes in fuel and replacement power costs from customers to pse g 
accounting for stock compensation statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for stock based compensation sfas is effective for fiscal years that begin after december  sfas establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for stock based compensation plans and includes all arrangements by which employees receive shares of stock or other equity instruments of the employer or by which the employer incurs liabilities to employees in amounts based on the price of the employer s stock 
the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of pse g and enterprise 
corporate policy for the use of derivatives enterprise and its subsidiaries have established a policy to use derivatives only for the purpose of managing financial risk and not for speculative purposes 
edhi currently uses derivatives to manage financial risk for edc and psrc  including its subsidiary united states energy partners usep 
the derivatives are used to mitigate the impact on earnings of volatile gas prices for edc and usep and volatile security prices for psrc s investing activities 
for details  see note financial instruments and risk management of notes 
although pse g does not currently use derivatives  if the alternative rate plan is approved as proposed  pse g could find derivatives to be a useful and appropriate tool in managing the volatility of fuel prices  among other things 
nuclear operations operation of the salem units has continued to present challenges to pse g 
the units have experienced equipment failures which  combined with personnel errors  have precipitated or contributed to plant events or trips which have led to a number of outages over the lifetime of the units 
both of the salem units are currently out of service and their return dates are subject to completion of testing  analysis  repair activity and nrc concurrence that they are prepared to restart 
restart of salem  which had originally been scheduled for the second quarter of  will be delayed for a substantial period as a result of the ongoing steam generator inspection and analysis 
salem  which is also undergoing steam generator inspection and analysis is still scheduled to return to service in the third quarter of the inability to successfully return these units to continuous  safe operation could have a material effect on the financial position  results of operation and net cash flows of enterprise and pse g 
results of operations earnings per share of enterprise common stock were in  in and in in  enterprise earnings decreased principally due to increased operating expenses and lower gas sales from pse g 
these decreases in earnings were partially offset by improved electric sales  edc revenues resulting from the settlement of litigation related to a take or pay sales contract and from gains realized on sales of properties by edc
