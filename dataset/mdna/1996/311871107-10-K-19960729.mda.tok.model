this amount includes  required to fund the net loss  after adjusting for non cash expenses consisting principally of depreciation  amortization and provision for doubtful accounts and inventory obsolescence 
this was offset principally by  used by increases in accounts receivable   generated by decreased inventory and  generated by increased accounts payable and other current liabilities 
this increase is primarily attributable to increased inventory purchases associated with increased sales 
accounts receivable increased during fiscal due to significantly higher revenue associated with two major contracts which accounted for approximately of total revenue and of accounts receivable at april  subsequent to year end  but prior to the issuance of this report  accounts receivable from these customers was collected 
on an overall basis  cash collections from the company s distributors and resellers improved and the days sales in accounts receivable declined 
further  product returns from customers declined during fiscal year and management anticipates that this trend will continue 
accordingly  management decreased the allowance for doubtful accounts during fiscal to  from  management believes that the allowance for doubtful accounts at april  is adequate 
during fiscal year  two customers accounted for and of total sales 
such sales were made to an end user and to a large system integrator with a designated end user customer 
the order received from the end user was for approximately  frads against which approximately  units have been shipped 
the remaining  units will be shipped through december  the order received from the system integrator was for approximately  units 
the final units will be shipped in the first quarter of fiscal the company was unable to reduce its inventory levels as much as anticipated during fiscal in response  the company has increased  on a quarterly basis during the current fiscal year  its reserve for inventory obsolescence by  to  at april  although management believes it will be able to ship and or liquidate substantially all its current inventory levels profitably  the inventory levels remain higher than anticipated and  accordingly  management concluded that increasing its reserve for obsolescence is prudent and necessary at this time

the company believes that current levels of cash and cash equivalents  at april  plus expected cash generated from the ongoing collection of its current and future accounts receivable and inventory levels in the normal course of events will be sufficient to meet the company s current cash requirements during fiscal and into the foreseeable future
