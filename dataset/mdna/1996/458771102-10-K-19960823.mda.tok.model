results of operations compared to in fiscal total revenues increased approximately compared to fiscal sales of magnetic products declined approximately while sales of refrigeration products increased approximately 
gross margin  as a percentage of sales  decreased in the magnetic products segment by and by in the refrigeration products segment 
the increase in revenues was due to a substantial increase in sales of refrigeration products  royalty and interest income  and a gain on the sale of investments 
gross margins  as a percentage of net sales  declined due to substantial competitive pressure on selling prices for magnets and superconducting wire for mri systems  yield losses in the wire operation  rework costs associated with the introduction of certain refrigeration products and slower than planned reductions in magnet production costs 
see note i of notes to consolidated financial statements  located elsewhere in this report  for financial information by industry segment 
looking forward  the company expects increased revenue in fiscal with a commensurate increase in net income provided the market for mri systems continues to grow  the company can successfully contend with continued competitive pressure on selling prices in the mri marketplace  the planned reductions in production costs in both business segments are achieved and planned sales of refrigerants occur 
most of this improvement should be reflected in the second half of fiscal company funded product research and development was slightly higher in fiscal compared to fiscal with increased spending on magnetic products and reduced spending on refrigeration products 
third party contracts and government programs to conduct research and development projects increased approximately 
during fiscal  the company s average employment level increased to the point where it no longer qualified as a small business and thus is no longer eligible for future small business innovation research awards 
although existing grants and contracts are not affected  this source of externally funded research and development contracts will no longer be available and the company must look to other external sources or increase its use of internal funds to maintain its commitment to a high level of research and development activity 
marketing  general and administrative expenses increased approximately in fiscal compared to fiscal  most of which was due to the creation of a separate organization  intercool energy corporation  to develop and market frigc r refrigerants 
interest expense was lower in fiscal due to the conversion of  of the company s convertible  subordinated debentures in september  during the first quarter of fiscal  the company made an additional investment in surrey medical imaging systems limited smis  bringing its ownership to approximately 
smis is a uk company engaged in the manufacture and sale of electronics and software for magnetic resonance imaging and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy applications 
due to its increased ownership  the company adopted the equity method of accounting for its investment 
as a result  the company recorded a loss on its investment of approximately  in fiscal the company s effective income tax rate decreased slightly in fiscal due primarily to the increased tax benefits derived from the company s foreign sales corporation and lower state income taxes 
see note f of notes to consolidated financial statements  located elsewhere in this report  for detailed information regarding income taxes 
magnetic products segment 
sales in this segment  which consists of the design  development  manufacture and sale of superconductive magnets and materials  permanent magnets and other magnetic products  decreased approximately in fiscal compared to the prior year 
magnet sales decreased by approximately and material sales increased nominally 
the sales decline in this segment reflects the effect of reduced selling prices for mri products and a leveling off in the growth of the mri market 
gross profit margins  as a percentage of net sales  declined for both magnets and materials  reflecting lower selling prices  slower than planned reductions in magnet production costs and yield losses in wire manufacturing 
refrigeration products segment 
this segment  which consists of the design  development  manufacture and sale of cryogenic refrigeration equipment and refrigerants had increased sales of approximately in fiscal this increase was primarily the result of sales of fr tm refrigerant and a substantial increase in sales of shield coolers for mri magnet systems 
gross profit margin  as a percentage of net sales decreased slightly in fiscal compared to fiscal due to price reductions for shield coolers and substantial rework costs associated with the introduction of certain cryogenic refrigeration equipment 
in september   the company entered into a long term master distributorship agreement with pennzoil products company pennzoil to market fr refrigerant in north america and in july   pennzoil announced that it was accelerating the rollout of this refrigerant by one year  initially in jiffy lube stores in houston and eventually about stores nationwide 
in november   the company announced that it had signed a long term agreement with ausimont spa of milan  italy a montedison affiliate to distribute fr refrigerant in europe 
the distributorship covers the territory of italy  scandinavia  the united kingdom  germany  spain  portugal  austria and france 
in march   the company announced that it had reached an agreement with al murjan environmental management and technology co  ltd 
of jeddah  saudi arabia to be its sales representative for fr refrigerant in the middle east 
the company continues to look for qualified distributors in other international territories 
results of operations compared to in fiscal total revenues increased approximately compared to fiscal sales of magnetic products increased approximately while sales of refrigeration products increased approximately 
gross margin  as a percentage of sales  decreased in the magnetic products segment by and by in the refrigeration products segment 
see note i of notes to consolidated financial statements  located elsewhere in this report  for financial information by industry segment 
the substantial increase in revenues was due primarily to increased sales of a new family of magnet systems for mri 
these new magnet systems range in field strength from t to t and the company delivered a large quantity more than of shipments of the higher field strength magnets 
previously  the company mainly sold t magnets 
gross margin  as a percentage of net sales  declined slightly reflecting the higher than normal costs associated with the initial production of new products 
during fiscal  the company received epa final acceptance of its cfc refrigerant replacement with the trademark frigc fr refrigerant for use in mobile air conditioning systems and also received a us patent for frigc fr refrigerant 
the company also signed agreements with schenectady international  inc to manufacture frigc fr refrigerant  with aeroquip to manufacture the necessary field couplings  adapters and hose assemblies for fr refrigerant adaption and with robinair for the necessary fr refrigerant installation equipment 
the first commercial order of fr refrigerant was shipped to a military base and the company announced that fr refrigerant was being made available to the fleet vehicle market 
company funded product research and development increased approximately in fiscal compared to fiscal as the company continued its engineering effort on internally funded development programs related to cryogenic products  high temperature superconductors  frigc refrigerants and other highly proprietary product areas 
the higher levels of company expenditures were required since third party contracts and government programs to conduct research and development projects  continued to decline 
these externally funded contracts which are included in net sales  decreased approximately in fiscal compared to fiscal total research and development internally and externally funded rose from approximately million to approximately million 
because the company s continued growth may disqualify it for small business research awards at some point in the near future  the ability of the company to look to the government as a significant source of external funds for research and development activities will continue to diminish 
marketing  general and administrative expenses increased a modest in fiscal compared to fiscal  all of which was in the marketing area  as the company continued tight control over general and administrative expenditures 
interest expense was higher in fiscal due to the issuance of the convertible  subordinated debentures in september  and the mortgage on the company s new facility in april  the company s effective income tax rate decreased slightly in fiscal due primarily to the tax benefits derived from the establishment of a foreign sales corporation 
see note f of notes to consolidated financial statements  located elsewhere in this report  for detailed information regarding income taxes 
magnetic products segment 
sales in this segment increased approximately in fiscal compared to the prior year 
magnet sales increased by approximately and material sales increased approximately due to strong demand for the new family of magnet systems for mri and increased demand for superconductive wire for mri magnets 
gross profit margin  as a percentage of net sales  declined for magnet systems  reflecting the higher costs associated with the initial production of a newly designed product line 
refrigeration products segment 
this segment had increased sales of approximately in fiscal this increase was primarily the result of a substantial increase in sales of shield coolers for mri magnet systems and sales of a new line of cryogenic refrigeration equipment cryotiger r 
gross profit margin  as a percentage of net sales decreased slightly in fiscal compared to fiscal due to price reductions for shield coolers and higher initial production costs for the new cryotigero line 
liquidity and capital commitments in fiscal the company generated net cash of approximately  from operating activities which was partially used to purchase property  plant and equipment and to make additional investments in surrey medical imaging systems  limited 
in june   the company announced the formation of a joint venture with smis  called imig mri tm systems  llc to commercialize a new low cost permanent magnet based magnetic resonance imaging system which the parties have jointly developed for use by the medical diagnostic industry worldwide 
the company does not expect the imig mri system to be competitive with higher field mri systems 
the initially targeted markets include the territories of southeast asia  india  south america  the former soviet union and eastern europe 
the company expects to meet its funding obligations of the joint venture from working capital 
during the year the company sold  shares of ultralife batteries  inc for approximately  the company may make similar sales in the future as market conditions warrant 
in september   the holders of  of the company s convertible  subordinated debentures due september  converted those debentures into  shares of common stock 
in connection with the conversion  the company paid these holders a payment of of the face amount of the converted debentures to induce early conversion and in lieu of all accrued interest due 
in march  the company announced a stock buy back program under which the company may  from time to time through december  subsequently extended indefinitely  repurchase up to  shares of its common stock depending on market conditions 
the repurchases are expected to be financed from working capital and would be used  among other things  to meet future obligations under stock option plans and outstanding convertible securities 
during fiscal  the company repurchased a total of  shares for approximately  see the consolidated statements of cash flows in the consolidated financial statements  located elsewhere in this report  for a detailed description of the sources and uses of cash during fiscal as well as the two preceding years 
the company s capital resource commitments as of july  consisted principally of capital equipment commitments of approximately  and maturing installment notes with a payment of  due december  the company has a three year  unsecured  line of credit with a bank which bears interest at the london interbank offered rate libor plus or prime and will expire in november   none of which was in use on july  the company believes that it will have sufficient working capital to meet its needs for the short term by using internally generated funds and existing credit facilities 
however  on a longer term basis with substantial increases in sales volume and or unusually large expenditure requirements to commercialize the frigc family of refrigerants  the company may be required to obtain additional lines of credit for working capital purposes and possibly make periodic public offerings or private placements in order to meet the liquidity needs of such growth 
while the company does not believe it will be restricted in financing such growth  there can be no assurances that such sources of financing will be available to the company in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms 
under such circumstances  the company would expect to manage its growth within the financing available
