overview ortel has been a pioneer in the adoption of linear fiberoptic technologies for communications applications 
from the company s founding in until  ortel devoted much of its resources to contract research and development work 
in october  the company entered into a product development agreement with gic to develop a new laser based product to meet the demanding specifications of the catv industry 
the company delivered initial prototypes of laser transmitter products in early and shipped production volumes later that same year 
until the fiscal quarter ended april   the company sold its laser based products for use by catv operators in the united states and canada exclusively to gic 
while the company intends to expand its oem customer base in the united states and canada  the company believes that sales to gic will continue to represent a substantial portion of the company s revenues see results of operations

approximately  and of the company s revenues during fiscal years   and  respectively  were derived from sales of products designed for use in broadband rf communications worldwide  mainly for catv 
during this same three year period  sales to gic accounted for approximately  and of total revenues  respectively 
while the company has enjoyed a long term relationship with this customer  there can be no assurance that gic will not secure a second source or continue buying products from the company 
the decrease in the rate of revenue growth from in fiscal to in fiscal reflects a slowdown in the growth of broadband revenues from in fiscal to in fiscal broadband revenues in fiscal reflect a decrease of in revenues from gic following a increase in the previous year primarily reflecting a slowdown in spending by us catv operators as they awaited the outcome of legislation which would deregulate the industry

international revenues were up in fiscal and in fiscal gross profit 
gross profit margins were  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the decrease in gross profit margin from to in fiscal was primarily due to a higher mix of product sold for wireless and satellite communications applications as these products generally have lower gross margins commensurate with lower production volumes as compared to the company s broadband products 
the decrease from to in fiscal was related primarily to lower prices initiated by the company in order to speed adoption of the company s linear fiberoptic technology by catv operators and to respond to competitive pricing 
the company anticipates that gross margins in the near term may trend lower as the company seeks to lower prices on its broadband products while the mix of wireless product increases ahead of the economies of scale that come with higher shipment volumes and on going cost reduction efforts associated with the introduction of a number of new products for broadband and wireless applications

establishes accounting standards for the recognition and measurement of impairment of long lived assets  certain identifiable intangibles  and goodwill either to be held or disposed of 
the company s policy is to account for goodwill and all other intangible assets at the lower of amortized cost or fair value 
as part of an ongoing review of the valuation and amortization of intangible assets  management assesses the carrying value of the company s intangible assets if facts and circumstances suggest that it may be impaired 
if this review indicates that the intangibles will not be recoverable  as determined by an undiscounted cash flow analysis over the remaining amortization period  the carrying value of the company s intangibles would be reduced to its estimated fair market value
