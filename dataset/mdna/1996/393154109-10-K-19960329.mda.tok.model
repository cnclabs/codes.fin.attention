on october   the vpsb and the vermont department of public service the department convened a roundtable on competition and the electric industry  consisting of representatives of utilities including the company  customers  environmental groups and other affected parties 
on july   a subgroup of the roundtable agreed on a set of fourteen principles intended to guide the debate in vermont concerning competition 
these principles  among other things  call for exploration of the potential for retail competition  honoring of past utility commitments incurred under regulation  protection for low income customers  and continued exploration of renewable resources  energy efficiency and environmental protections 
on september   governor dean of vermont announced his desire to provide for competition and a restructuring of the utility industry 
the governor s announcement included proposed legislative adoption of restructuring principles in  a vpsb proceeding to address the issue  filing by vermont electric utilities of detailed plans by may   and implementation of restructuring by the end of in response to a department petition  the vpsb opened a proceeding on utility industry restructuring by order dated october  on december   the company released its proposed restructuring plan  calling for corporate separation into a regulated company for transmission and distribution functions  and an unregulated company for generation and sales functions 
increased competitive pressure in the electric utility industry may restrict the company s ability to charge prices high enough to recover embedded costs and may lead to changes in the manner in which rates are set by regulators from cost based regulation to a different form of regulation that approximates market conditions in which prices charged could be higher or lower than the company s costs 
because the company purchases most of its power supply from other utilities  it does not anticipate that it will incur any material direct cost increases as a result of the federal clean air legislation 
furthermore  only one of its power supply purchase contracts  which expires in  relates to a generating plant that is likely to be affected by the acid rain provisions of this legislation 
overall  approximately percent of the company s committed electricity supply a contract to purchase coal fired generation that expires in is expected to be affected by federal and state environmental compliance requirements 
the company continues to implement conservation programs to mitigate the increasing demand for electricity 
the company is reviewing its future conservation plans in light of various factors  including competition  changing avoided electricity costs  its experience and increased effectiveness in delivering conservation programs  and its total resource mix 
even with continued existing conservation programs  the company anticipates  assuming normal weather  that the demand for electricity in its service territory will grow by approximately percent per year over the next five years 
the company regularly reviews rates and forecasts costs 
as these forecasts change  the company will seek changes in rates that will enable it to recover operating costs 
financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and report operating results in terms of historic costs 
this accounting provides reasonable financial statements but does not always take inflation into consideration 
as rate recovery is based on these historical costs and known and measurable changes  the company is able to receive some rate relief for inflation 
it does not receive immediate rate recovery relating to fixed costs associated with company assets 
such fixed costs are recovered based on historic figures 
any effects of inflation on plant costs are generally offset by the fact that these assets are financed through long term debt 
diversification the company has a plan of diversification into energy related businesses intended to complement the company s basic utility enterprise 
the company plans to limit diversification to percent of the company s consolidated revenue 
mountain energy  inc performed well in  producing an after tax profit of million  an increase of  from  and contributed cents of earnings per share to the company s consolidated earnings 
during the year  mountain energy made new  long term investments totaling million in a new england hydroelectric facility and in energy efficiency projects in new england  california  new york and new jersey 
mountain energy has now invested almost million in nine different projects  eight of which are renewable energy related 
the company s cash investment in mountain energy at december  was million 
environmental matters in recent years  public concern for the physical environment has brought about increased government regulation of the licensing and operation of electric generation  transmission and distribution facilities 
the company must meet various land  water  air and aesthetic requirements as administered by local  state and federal regulatory agencies 
the company maintains an environmental compliance and monitoring program that includes employee training  regular inspection of company facilities  research and development projects  waste handling and spill prevention procedures and other activities

specifically  the company proposed rate recognition of its unrecovered expenditures between january and june  a total of approximately million for technical consultants and legal assistance in connection with the epa s enforcement actions at the site and insurance litigation 
while reserving the right to argue in the future about the appropriateness of rate recovery for pine street marsh related costs  the company and the department reached agreements in these cases that the full amount of pine street marsh costs reflected in those rate cases should be recovered in rates 
the company s rates approved by the vpsb on april   on may   and on june   reflected the pine street marsh related expenditures referred to above 
in a rate case filed on september   the company sought recovery in rates of approximately million in expenses associated with the pine street site 
this amount represented the company s unrecovered expenditures between july and june for technical consultants and legal assistance in connection with epa s enforcement action at the site and insurance litigation 
while reserving the right to argue in the future about the appropriateness of rate recovery for pine street related costs and whether recovery or non recovery of past costs and any insurance proceeds is relevant to such issue  the parties to the case have reached agreement that the full amount of pine street costs reflected in the company s rate case should be recovered in rates 
this agreement is currently pending before the vpsb

as is more fully set forth in note i 
of notes to consolidated financial statements  the company is unable to predict at this time the magnitude of liability that may be imposed on it resulting from potential claims for the cost of studies undertaken by the epa or performance of any remedial action in connection with the pine street marsh site 
the company is one of several parties that the epa has identified as potentially responsible for the cost of studying and remedying the results of releases of allegedly hazardous substances at the site 
the company will continue to pursue claims against other responsible parties seeking to ensure that they contribute appropriately to reimburse the company for any costs incurred 
in december  the company brought suit against several previous insurers seeking recovery of unrecovered past costs and indemnity against future liabilities associated with environmental problems at the site 
discovery in the case is largely complete  with the exception of expert discovery which was stayed by the magistrate pending the resolution of summary judgment motions filed by the company 
in august  the magistrate granted the company s motion for summary judgment with respect to defense costs against one defendant and denied it against another defendant 
the united states district judge affirmed those orders on september  the company has reached confidential settlements with two of the defendants in its insurance litigation 
one of these defendants provided the company with comprehensive general liability insurance between and  and with environmental impairment liability insurance from to these policies were in place in when the epa first notified the company that it might be a potentially responsible party at the pine street marsh site 
the other defendant provided the company with second layer excess liability coverage for a seven month period in liquidity and capital resources construction the company s capital requirements result from the need to construct facilities or to invest in programs to meet anticipated customer demand for electric service 
the policy of the company is to increase diversification of its power supply and other resources through various means  including power purchase and sales arrangements and relying on sources that represent relatively small additions to the company s mix to satisfy customer requirements 
this permits the company to meet its financing needs in a flexible  orderly manner 
planned expenditures over the next five years will be primarily for distribution and conservation projects 
capital expenditures over the past three years and projected for the next five years are as follows total net actual generation transmission distribution conservation other expenditures dollars in thousands and net of afudc and customer advances for construction forecasted includes million projected for wind project 
other cash requirements in  the company may devote million to unregulated investments

the agreement was approved by the vpsb on june  on september   the company filed a request with the vpsb to increase retail rates by percent

the company and the department reached a settlement agreement providing for a percent retail rate increase effective june   and a target return on equity for utility operations of percent 
the settlement was based on a newly negotiated agreement with hydro quebec that will result in a reduction of the company s power supply costs below that which was anticipated  allowing the company to reduce the amount of its rate request 
the rate settlement must be reviewed and approved by the vpsb before it can take effect 
financing and capitalization for the period through  internally generated funds  after payment of dividends  provided approximately percent of total capital requirements for construction  sinking funds and other requirements
