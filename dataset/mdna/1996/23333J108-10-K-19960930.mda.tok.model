historically  gross margins for the components segment have not fluctuated significantly between periods 
operating margins for the special machines segment differ from the components segment

any revisions in the estimated total costs or values of the contracts during the course of the work are reflected when the facts that require the revisions become known 
revenue from the sale of products manufactured by the company s components segment is recognized upon shipment to the customer

strong year end sales  orders and backlog resulted in a significant increase in accounts receivable and inventories at june  an increase in customer advances and accounts payable partially offset the increases in working capital assets 
accrued liabilities decreased during the year reflecting reductions in the income tax payable balance and accrued acquisition costs 
in fiscal  cash provided by operating activities was affected by a million increase in working capital largely resulting from high sales activity at the end of the year thereby resulting in an increased accounts receivable balance 
working capital balances can fluctuate significantly between periods as a result of the significant costs incurred on individual contracts and the relatively large amount invoiced and collected by the company for a number of large contracts 
during the fiscal year ended june   cash provided by operating activities was used to finance capital expenditures of approximately million  pay dividends of million and provide funding towards four acquisitions

during august  the company entered into an amended and restated credit facilities agreement amended credit agreement with six institutions to provide funding for working capital and acquisitions

the amended credit agreement provided for a million revolving credit facility  a million term loan and a million letter of credit facility denominated in a foreign currency to secure loans to finance the swiftpack acquisition 
as of june   the balances outstanding under the revolving credit facility and term loan were million and million  respectively 
the facilities generally bear interest at floating rates based upon libor or the bank s base rate plus a specified percentage which is determined by the company s ratio of funded debt to operating cash flow 
at june   interest rates on these facilities ranged from to 
on november   the company  through its wholly owned subsidiary  dt industries uk limited dtuk  acquired ninety five percent of the issued and outstanding stock of swiftpack and an option the option to acquire the remaining five percent of swiftpack stock 
the acquisition was financed by entering into a credit agreement  specific counter indemnity and debenture collectively  the foreign credit agreements with a foreign bank which provided approximately million in cash and will provide funding of the principal amount of million in notes loan notes upon their maturity 
the loan notes issued by dtuk directly to certain of the prior shareholders bear interest at and mature the earlier of november   at the holder s option  or december  the foreign credit agreements provided funding of approximately million upon the exercise of the option in july the foreign credit agreements are denominated in a foreign currency and bear interest at a variable rate based upon libor approximately including letter of credit fees at june  
principal payments are due quarterly with the remaining principal balance due on august  principal payments range from approximately  to  the foreign credit agreements are secured by the letter of credit facility provided through the amended credit agreement 
to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  on june   the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement for a notional principal amount of million  maturing june  swap agreements involve the exchange of interest obligations on fixed and floating interest rate debt without the exchange of the underlying principal amount 
the differential paid or received on the swap agreement is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense 
the swap agreement provides a fixed rate of with a floating rate payment equal to the three month libor determined on a quarterly basis with settlement occurring on specific dates 
on july   the company acquired the issued and outstanding stock of mid west in a transaction accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the purchase price paid by the company of approximately million  net of cash acquired  was obtained by the company pursuant to the company s second amended and restated credit facilities agreement which replaced the amended credit agreement 
the new facility of million provided by two institutions includes a million revolving credit facility  a million term loan  a million acquisition facility and a million foreign currency denominated letter of credit 
the term loan requires quarterly principal payments ranging from million to million commencing in january with final maturity on july  borrowings under the agreement bear interest at prime or libor at the option of dti plus a specified percentage based on the ratio of funded debt to operating cash flow 
the company made capital expenditures of million in fiscal such capital expenditures in fiscal included a total of approximately million related to the completion of building expansions for the company s manufacturing facilities in lebanon  mo  benton harbor  mi and the expansion in progress at the facility in erie  pa 
the building expansions reflect the growth occurring at these locations 
additionally  due to significant internal growth being experienced by aaa  the company is currently expanding its leased facility in dayton  oh 
the addition is not expected to result in significant capital expenditures by the company  but will result in an increase in annual lease costs 
subsequent to the completion of the current building expansion programs  the company believes that its principal manufacturing facilities will have sufficient capacity to accommodate future internal growth without major additional capital improvements 
management anticipates that capital expenditures in future years will include recurring replacement or refurbishment of machinery and equipment  which will approximate depreciation expense  and purchases to improve production methods or processes or to expand manufacturing capabilities 
the company paid quarterly cash dividends of per share on september   december   march  and june  to shareholders of record on august   november   february  and may   respectively 
based on its ability to generate funds from operations and the availability of funds under its current credit facilities  the company believes that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its currently anticipated operating and capital expenditure requirements 
tax matters the company files a consolidated federal income tax return 
the fiscal   and federal income tax returns for dti and its predecessor company  detroit tool group  inc  have been audited by the internal revenue service the irs 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company reached an agreement in principle to settle with the irs 
the additional taxes due under the agreement are not material to the company s financial position  results of operations or liquidity and are expected to be paid prior to december  there are no other material audits underway or notification of audits for dti or any of its subsidiaries 
backlog the company s backlog is based upon customer purchase orders that the company believes are firm 
as of june   the company had million of orders in backlog  which compares to a backlog of approximately million as of june  the million increase is due to the acquisitions of ami  swiftpack  arrow and kalish 
excluding the effects of acquisitions  backlog was comparable to the prior year 
the backlog for the special machines segment at june  was million  which increased million from a year ago 
backlog for the components segment increased million to million from million 
the level of backlog at any particular time is not necessarily indicative of the future operating performance of the company 
additionally  certain purchase orders are subject to cancellation by the customer upon notification 
certain orders are also subject to delays in completion and shipment at the request of the customer 
the company believes most of the orders in the backlog will be recognized as sales during fiscal seasonality and fluctuations in quarterly results in general  the company s business is not subject to seasonal variations in demand for its products 
however  because orders for certain of the company s products can exceed a few million dollars  a relatively limited number of orders can constitute a meaningful percentage of the company s revenue in any one period 
a relatively small reduction or delay in the number of orders can have a material impact on the timing of recognition of the company s revenues 
gross margins in the special machines segment may vary between comparable periods as a result of the variations in profitability of contracts for large orders of special machines as well as product mix between the various types of custom and proprietary equipment manufactured by the company 
accordingly  results of operations of the company for any particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any subsequent quarter or related fiscal year
