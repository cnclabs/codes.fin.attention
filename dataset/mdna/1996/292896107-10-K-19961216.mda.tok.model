the company s financing needs depend upon its construction volume  asset turnover and land acquisitions 
prior to the company s initial public offering  the company s most significant source of funds were acquisition  development and revolving construction loans provided by financial institutions and seller financing for land purchases 
in january  the company completed an initial public offering of its common stock and received net proceeds of approximately million 
in february  the company issued an aggregate of million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due and received net proceeds of approximately million 
in march  the company issued an aggregate of million principal amount of senior notes due and received net proceeds of approximately million 
the proceeds from these offerings were generally used for repayment of debt  land acquisition and general corporate purposes 
in august the company entered into two credit agreements agreements with various lending institutions which provide for a combined million collateralized revolving line of credit 
borrowings under these three year agreements bear interest at rates ranging from libor plus to prime plus 
at the company s election 
available borrowings under the agreements are limited to certain percentages of finished lots  construction costs  land and land under development 
these agreements replaced certain credit facilities in place prior to august at october   the company had outstanding borrowings of approximately million  and aggregate available funds of approximately million pursuant to various credit lines including the agreements 
the company believes that funds generated from operations and expected borrowing availability under existing and future bank credit facilities will be sufficient to fund the company s working capital requirements  with the exception of major land acquisitions during fiscal for a further description of the company s borrowings  see note of the company s consolidated financial statements 
in addition  phmc has a warehouse line of credit for million which is guaranteed by the company 
at october  the outstanding balance was million to service origination of mortgage loans 
the company believes that this line is sufficient for its mortgage banking operation for the fiscal year 
land acquisition and construction financing 
the company is continually exploring opportunities to purchase parcels of land for its homebuilding operations and is  at any given time  in various stages of proposing  making offers for  and negotiating the acquisition of various parcels  whether outright or through options 
the company has continued to increase its land development and construction activities in response to current and anticipated demand and expects to pursue additional land acquisition and development opportunities in the future 
debt service 
in addition to land acquisition expenditures incurred by the company  principal commitments during the next several years relate to repayment of debt 
scheduled and estimated maturities of the company s borrowings aggregate approximately million during fiscal and approximately million in fiscal the company anticipates that it will fund the maturities of its debt and required expenditures relating to its developments primarily with cash flow from operations and existing credit lines  new or renewed credit lines or term loans 
see note of notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
cash flows 
the company has experienced negative cash flows from operating activities during fiscal this is primarily the result of increasing land inventory to meet expected sales demand and site development costs associated with pembroke falls 
however  cash flows from operating activities during the fourth quarter of fiscal increased million as a result of an increase in the deliveries of homes 
cash flows from investing activities during the fiscal year ended october  increased million as compared to as a result of the sale of three commercial properties 
they included the sales of the company s  square foot shopping plaza located in boca raton  florida on december   a unit rental apartment complex in orlando  florida on december  and a  square foot mixed use office building located in boca raton  florida on july  cash flow provided from financing activities totaled million in due to an increase in net bank borrowings partially offset by distributions to shareholders compared to an increase of million in fiscal such activities resulted in a net increase in cash in the amount of approximately million for fiscal management does not anticipate that phmc s expansion of its operation will significantly impact the company s liquidity because the mortgages are generally sold within a short period of time after their origination to the federal national mortgage association fnma or other qualified investors 
phmc has established the capability to retain the servicing of loans  however  during fiscal all servicing rights were sold 
inflation the company  as well as the homebuilding industry in general  may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation  primarily because of higher land and construction costs 
in addition  higher mortgage interest rates may significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective purchasers 
inflation also increases the company s interest costs and costs of labor and materials 
the company attempts to pass through to its customers any increases in its costs through increased selling prices and  to date  inflation has not had a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
however  there is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on the company s future results of operation 
interest rates the company s operations are interest rate sensitive 
overall housing demand is adversely affected by increases in interest costs 
if mortgage interest rates increase significantly  this may negatively impact the ability of a homebuyer to secure adequate financing 
such results of higher interest rates may result in adversely affecting the company s revenues  gross margins and net income
