schawk client services consulting group was formed during the third quarter of to service the graphic arts software  hardware and training needs of the imaging group s customers

in  schawk s imaging group completed the acquisition of the noral company 
the imaging group combined this operation with its total reproductions and subsquently merged both operations into its schawkgraphics operation 
during the first quarter of  schawk announced the intent to acquire waselle graphics  inc waselle is a graphics design and print production studio located in chicago

schawk effectively acquired a controlling interest of the outstanding equity of filtertek in september on june   filtertek purchased plastic molded concepts pmc in eagle  wisconsin 
pmc is a manufacturer of specialty plastic components for the healthcare and industrial industries 
on october   filtertek purchased three plastics thermoforming operations robinson industries and fuzere midwest  both located in huntley  illinois  from schawk  and fuzere manufacturing company  inc  located in stockton  california  from the stockholders of schawk collectively  the robinson fuzere transaction 
these thermoforming companies are now operated as the tek packaging group  inc the plastics group  during the first quarter  has executed a letter of intent to purchase ownership in acoplast  a plastic injected molded automotive filter manufacturer in sao paulo  brazil 
acoplast will give us additional products for our automotive line as well as provide a conduit to south american customers for our healthcare products 
during a strategic review of operations during late  the schawk  inc executive management team made the decision to divest pmc in eagle  wi 
pmc no longer fits into the realigned product focus 
pmc is being sold to a management led group of employees 
during the strategic review  schawk also merged total reproductions noral into schawkgraphics to further increase our product offerings and improve the operating margins of these two separate companies 
filtertek and schawk had been operating under common control and management since september during that time  it became apparent to management that combining the companies would simplify and enhance the operations  management  and strategic direction 
in november  filtertek and schawk agreed to merge  and  following receipt of the requisite stockholder approval by more than of the independent stockholders of filtertek  schawk merged with and into filtertek effective as of december  the merger 
filtertek s name was changed then to schawk  inc basis of presentation the merger was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
because schawk owned a controlling interest in filtertek prior to the merger  under aicpa accounting interpretation of accounting principles board opinion no 
 the merger was required to be accounted for as if schawk had acquired the minority interest in filtertek s class a common stock outstanding at the effective time of the merger 
accordingly  the consolidated financial statements of schawk are treated as the company s historical financial statements in future financial reporting 
such historical financial statements of schawk include the results of filtertek since schawk s acquisition of its controlling interest in september in light of the changes made in accounting presentations in  the following discussion of periods prior to the consummation of the merger includes an analysis of i pro forma consolidated income statement data for the company  and ii the historical consolidated results of operations and financial condition of schawk  which include of sales but only of earnings for and  since schawk s controlling interest in filtertek beginning september pro forma calculations the earnings per share presented for and are pro forma calculations 
the company believes that the pro forma presentation best represents the actual results of the combined operations as if they had been merged for the comparable periods of and the actual earnings per share for schawk are not informative because schawk was a privately owned s corporation and had a limited number of outstanding shares prior to the merger with filtertek on december  further  as an s corporation  taxation of the corporate entity was minimal 
the shares outstanding in the pro forma earnings per share calculations account for the shares exchanged in the merger as if the exchange occurred at the beginning of each of the periods presented 
consequently  the minority interest in the earnings of filtertek has been eliminated 
in addition  pro forma purchase accounting adjustments for increased goodwill amortization  increased depreciation for fair value adjustments to property and equipment  and reductions in compensation expense for new employee stockholder agreements effective january  have also been made to present pro forma earnings per share 
additionally  the earnings have been adjusted as if the imaging group had been taxed at regular corporate income tax rates instead of s corporation rates 
schawk terminated s corporation tax status on december  management s discussion and analysis consolidated results versus net sales 
sales were million for versus sales of million 
revenue was a record level due in part to labeling law changes required by the nlea national labeling and education act 
this decrease in sales was due to a decline in imaging group sales as clients adjusted their typical package redesign cycles as a result of the deadline of nlea combined with large increases in paper prices 
the result was that many of the imaging group clients elected to postpone package changes from the record levels in order to use up existing packaging inventories 
the company does not anticipate that these two factors will be repeated in the future
