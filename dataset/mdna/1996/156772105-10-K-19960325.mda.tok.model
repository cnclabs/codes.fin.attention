the major needs for cash for the company are central reserve life insurance company s central ability to pay claims and expenses as they come due 
central s primary sources of cash are premiums and investment income 
central s payments consist of current claim payments to insureds  managed care expenses  operating expenses such as salaries  employee benefits  commissions  taxes  etc  and shareholder dividends payable to the company 
by statute  the state regulatory authorities set minimum liquidity standards to protect both policyholders and shareholders and limit the dividends payable by central to the company 
see item the majority of the company s assets are in investments which were  after a net unrealized holding gain of  before taxes  see below  or of the total assets at december  fixed maturities are the primary investment of the company and were  or of total investments at december  the company is carrying fixed maturities of  at amortized cost held to maturity and fixed maturities of  at fair value available for sale at december  the company does not hold any so called junk bonds or what are generally considered high yield type securities  and of the bonds are of investment grade quality 
in accordance with sfas  the company recorded an increase in investments of  to reflect the reporting of investments classified as available for sale at fair value estimated market value which was higher than amortized cost 
the credit is reflected in shareholders equity as a net unrealized holding gain 
in addition to the fixed maturities  the company also had million in unrestricted cash and million in short term investments at december  central also has an unused million line of credit with a major bank 
during  total assets increased about million  or to  mainly due to a positive cash flow from operations during the year from premiums  investment income and the  net unrealized holding gain 
liabilities accrued for future policy benefits and policy claims payable increased  or about million to  primarily because of a strengthening of reserves and increased premiums 
shareholders equity increased  after paying dividends of  and an increase of  for a net unrealized holding gain 
capital resources the only long term debt the company has at december   is  which is the principal amount payable under a loan secured by a mortgage on the company s home office building 
the company entered into the loan agreement in for million for a term of years bearing interest at per annum with a year amortization period payment schedule 
at the same time  the company also entered into a year lease agreement with central for of the space 
the company will use the monthly rental payments to pay  among other expenses  the required mortgage loan payments 
in  the company started a search for a new computer system for claims and administration which includes  among other things  billing  rating and commission functions 
the increase in the company s business  new state mandates and new products have created the need for this new system 
a system of this nature is expected to cost between million and million  including software  hardware and implementation  over an estimated three year period 
the company estimates these costs could be recovered over a to year period  through a combination of payroll cost savings  expense controls and new production capacity 
the company has not entered into any contract or commitment for the purchase of such a computer system  although such an acquisition is planned for in light of the company s growth over the last several years  the company is also planning an addition to its existing headquarters building 
the addition would provide space for training  managed care and computer facilities 
the preliminary plans indicate an estimated cost between million and million however  the company has not made any capital commitment with respect to the addition as of march  results of operations compared to during  premiums increased to  from  in the increase was primarily in the group life and health division which accounted for about of total premiums 
group certificates in force increased about to  in from  in certificates issued for new group policies were  in  up  from  in the increase came primarily from a new product  the professional multi option pmo  which was introduced in late and targets small businesses with to lives 
total lapses net of additions decreases in were  down slightly from  in overall  the lapse ratio was in line with the company s expectations and was lower than the industry average for small group business 
not included in premiums  for generally accepted accounting principles gaap purposes  were annuity considerations in the amounts of  and  for and net investment income decreased about to  in from  in the decrease was primarily due to the overall decrease in interest rates during also  during the company reduced its holdings in mortgage backed securities and convertible bonds 
the proceeds were invested in short term government type securities at lower interest rates  but produced a more liquid and stable position 
benefits and claims incurred expenses increased in to  from  in this compares to a increase in over the incurred loss ratio was for and for the major increase in claims was during the last quarter  primarily the last month 
the loss ratio increased to for the fourth quarter of compared to in the same quarter in during the fourth quarter the company experienced  as many small group carriers did  an increase in claims due to utilization  state mandates and accidents 
this trend continued into january in response  the company has increased premium rates  not renewed certain blocks of business and is updating several managed care controls 
commissions decreased slightly to  in from  in and were of premiums in compared to in the decrease is attributed to a lower commission rate for the new product pmo sold in and the growth in renewal premiums which carry a lower commission rate 
expenses  such as salaries  premium taxes  fees  etc  increased  in total  in over however  as a percentage of premiums the ratio was lower in  compared to in net income tax as a percentage of pretax income was in compared to in the current portion of the tax decreased to  in from  in the main reason for the decrease was the decrease in pretax income 
the decrease in the deferred tax expense is primarily due to the change in the valuation allowance due to an unrealized holding gain in compared to an unrealized holding loss in net income for was  or per share compared to  or per share in the decrease is primarily due to the increase in the benefit loss ratio to from and a decrease in investment income for the year 
because group accident and health represents of central s business  a higher loss ratio from this division has a negative effect on the company s earnings 
the statutory loss ratio in the group accident and health division increased to in from in the federal income tax returns for the company and its subsidiaries have been examined by the internal revenue service irs for and during the third quarter of  the irs issued a proposal for adjustments to the company s returns for and the proposed deficiencies are approximately million of which  pertaining to some non deductible expenses and certain assets expensed and not capitalized  was agreed to and paid in the balance primarily deals with whether or not the company s subsidiary  central  qualified as a life company  for tax purposes 
the company is vigorously protesting the proposed deficiency and management believes existing law supports the company s position 
therefore  the company has not recorded a liability for the difference 
if the irs were to pursue litigation and prevail in its position that central no longer qualifies as a life company for tax purposes  federal income taxes would increase in the future 
presently  as a small life company  central is permitted  among other things  a deduction from the first million of income of or million 
as central s income increases above million  the special deduction is reduced proportionately 
besides relying on favorable existing case law  central may have  under certain circumstances  the ability to change and market policies that could insure its qualification as a life company for tax purposes in the future  if the need arises 
results of operations compared to during  premiums increased to  from  in the increase was primarily in the group division which accounted for about of total premiums 
group certificates in force decreased to  in from  in certificates issued for new group policies were  in  down from  in management believes that the health care reform bill activity in caused many policyholders to remain with their existing coverage and others not to seek new coverage 
also certain new state mandates curtailed some sales in some states  until the company made certain adjustments to comply with those mandates 
total lapses net of additions decreases in were  compared to  in the increase is due to a combination of certain groups that were not renewed and the continued higher lapses in an association type product which is being used as a short term policy 
not included in premiums  for generally accepted accounting principles gaap purposes  are annuity considerations in the amounts of  and  for and the decrease in annuity considerations was primarily due to increasing interest rates available in other investments 
net investment income increased to  from  in favorable cash flows in and aided in the increase in investments  primarily fixed maturities which generated the majority of the investment income 
offsetting the effect of the increase in investments was the effect of lower interest rates during the first half of benefits and claims incurred expenses increased in to  from  in this compares to a increase in over the incurred loss ratio was in and in the improvement can be attributed to managed care cost controls  certain rate adjustments  reduction in large claims and an overall moderation in the medical inflation rate for commissions increased to  in from  in and were of premiums in compared to in the decrease in the ratio is primarily due to the increase in renewal premiums  which carry a lower commission than new business 
expenses increased in over and were of premiums compared to in net income tax expense as a percentage of pretax income was in compared to in the current portion of the tax  increased to  from  in the main reason for the increase in current taxes is the increase in pretax income 
the increase in the deferred tax expense is primarily due to the increase in the valuation allowance 
since the company s recovery rates for prior years were lower than current tax rates a higher valuation allowance is required 
also in the valuation allowance is  recorded directly to shareholders equity for the net unrealized holding loss  offsetting the same amount shown as a deferred tax asset 
net income for was  or per share compared to  or 
per share in the increase is primarily due to a increase in investment income  slightly lower benefit loss ratio of compared to in and a decrease in the ratio of operating expenses to premiums from to 
because group accident and health represents of central s business  investment income and a lower loss ratio from this division has a positive effect on the company s earnings 
along with an increase in investment income in the group accident and health division  the statutory loss ratio decreased to in from in impact of inflation inflation rates impact the company s financial condition and operating results in several areas 
changes in inflation rates impact the market value of the investment portfolio and yields on new investments 
inflation has had an impact on claim costs and overall operating costs and although it has been lower in the last few years  hospital and medical costs have still increased at a higher rate than general inflation 
while to a certain extent these increased costs are offset by interest rates investment income  hospital charges increased  while the rate of income from investments decreased 
the company will continue to establish premium rates in accordance with trends in hospital and medical costs along with concentrating on various cost containment programs 
legislative developments it appears that no major federal health care reform is scheduled to take effect in however  incremental changes such as portability and limited pre existing conditions  are probable and even more likely to be enacted on the state level 
the company cannot predict the ultimate timing or effect of any legislative efforts  and no assurance can be given that any such efforts will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations
