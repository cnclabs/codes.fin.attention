item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items of the company s consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total revenues and the percentage change of the dollar amounts from period to period 
percentage of revenues period to period percentage year ended march  increase decrease revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and engineering total operating expenses operating income loss other income expense interest income expense  net other  income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
consolidated revenues decreased  due to a decrease in revenues from flowmole drilling activities in north america flowmole operations offset by a increase in north american cablecure revenue and a increase in revenue from the company s international operations 
flowmole revenues in fiscal were million  compared to million in fiscal flowmole operations accounted for and of consolidated revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in revenue from flowmole operations in fiscal was primarily a result of a planned crew reduction which occurred between april and july  in addition to the continued impact of competition on pricing and on the company s ability to obtain work 
as a result of the crew reductions  the company experienced periods of limited capacity during much of fiscal  and did not rebuild its crew count to the prior year level until november in addition  severe winter weather throughout the eastern united states adversely affected the company s flowmole revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal flowmole revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal were million  compared to million in the same period of fiscal as a result of the above factors  the weighted average number of fully utilized flowmole drilling systems in operation during fiscal was  compared to in fiscal cablecure revenues in north america increased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the total cable injected in north america increased to million feet in fiscal  compared to approximately  feet in fiscal much of this increase is attributable to increased revenues from customers choosing a test  treat or replace contract 
under such a contract  the company is assigned certain spans of cable which are tested for splices or corrosion  and either injected with cablecure fluid or replaced by the company s flowmole crews 
most cable can be injected  and the company attempts to schedule the replacement portions of such work in a manner that affords maximum productivity 
revenue from the company s international operations increased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  due to increased revenues from service operations and spare parts sales in asia 
increased sales of equipment in asia offset decreased sales of equipment in europe 
total revenues from equipment sales was unchanged at million in both fiscal and fiscal gross profit 
gross profit  as a percentage of revenues  decreased to of total revenues in fiscal  compared to of total revenues in fiscal gross profit from flowmole operations was adversely affected by the lower revenue levels and increasing customer requirements for additional ancillary services under drilling contracts 
the fixed costs of flowmole operations are a significant component of total costs  and gross profit as a percentage of revenue declined significantly in fiscal this effect was partially offset by higher gross profit levels from increased cablecure activities 
the company restructured its cablecure hiring and training practices in fiscal  and crews began to achieve a high level of improved productivity  measured in terms of feet injected per day  during the second quarter of fiscal  which served to boost gross profit 
the company experienced an increase in gross profit percentage in its international operations compared to fiscal the company generates a higher margin on international services and international spare parts sales  so the increased mix of services and spare parts revenue aided overall gross profit 
average profit margins on equipment sales improved slightly as well 
operating expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by in fiscal compared to fiscal research and engineering expenses decreased by in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to having a full year of expenses in fiscal from sales and administrative positions added during fiscal  as well as a  provision for severance and outplacement benefits recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal the decreased research and engineering costs in fiscal reflect the completion of the company s fiscal efforts to refine and improve its series f drill and fpu  as well as a reduction in the level of contracted research expenses performed in connection with its cablecure activities 
operating income 
as a result of the foregoing factors  the company reported an operating loss of  or of revenues  in fiscal  compared to an operating loss of  or of revenues  in fiscal other income and expense 
net interest income expense was an expense of  in fiscal  compared to income of  in fiscal  due to higher levels of borrowing on the company s line of credit during fiscal in fiscal  the company reported an expense of  due to its share of the startup losses of its environmental joint venture  fesc 
in fiscal  the company reported a gain of  from the operations of fesc  which ceased operations in december see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item income tax benefit 
the company reported a provision of  in the fourth quarter of fiscal to provide a valuation allowance against the full amount of its net deferred tax assets 
excluding this charge  the company s income tax benefit for fiscal would have been  and the effective federal and state tax rate would have been in fiscal  compared to in fiscal in fiscal and  nondeductible expenses reduced the company s income tax benefit and were the primary causes of the low effective tax rate in comparison to the federal tax rate 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item net loss 
as a result of the foregoing factors  the company reported a net loss of   before the provision for a deferred tax valuation allowance in fiscal  compared to a net loss of  in fiscal fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
consolidated revenues increased  due to an increase in revenues from flowmole operations offset by decreases in north american cablecure revenue and revenue from the company s international operations 
flowmole operations accounted for and of consolidated revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
the increased revenue from flowmole operations in fiscal was primarily a result of a increase in total footage drilled during fiscal  compared to fiscal the weighted average number of fully utilized flowmole drilling systems in operation during fiscal was  up from in fiscal the company has experienced a long term trend of declining prices  particularly for smaller diameter utility installations  due to competitive pressures and changes in utility bidding practices 
although the company s average price per foot drilled in fiscal increased slightly over its fiscal results  the company attributes this increase to having performed a larger percentage of more difficult projects eg  larger diameters for which the company receives a higher price per foot 
adjusting for the increased work difficulty  the company believes that its average price for identical work has decreased in fiscal  compared to fiscal pricing 
cablecure revenues in north america decreased in fiscal  compared to levels 
much of this decrease is attributable to lower revenues from florida power light  which had previously been the company s largest cablecure customer 
the company has successfully obtained initial projects from a large number of new customers since acquiring the cablecure business in fiscal in fiscal  the number of customers increased to  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal however  these initial demonstration projects typically are not large in scope and there can be no assurance of the ultimate revenue to be earned from such new customers in the future 
in addition  the market price for cablecure injection services is affected by the decreasing prices for cable replacement  and the company has decreased the price per foot charged for its injection services 
revenue from the company s international operations decreased by in fiscal  compared to fiscal the company reported a nonrecurring gain in fiscal from the settlement of arbitration with flowtex  accounting for of the decrease 
the remainder of the decrease was due to decreased revenue from international sales of equipment  offset in part by increased revenues from service operations in the united kingdom  international cablecure revenues  and spare parts sales 
the price at which the company is able to sell its equipment in certain international markets decreased in fiscal  compared to fiscal levels  primarily due to increased competition for equipment sales from competitor manufacturers 
the number of flowmole drilling systems sold in fiscal was adversely affected by delays in receiving orders for the company s new series f drill 
the company shipped its first prototype series f drill at the beginning of fiscal for use in demonstration projects 
subsequently  the company made minor modifications to the series f drill and companion fpu  and began manufacturing and shipping the modified series f drill and fpu in the third quarter of fiscal revenues from the company s revalt division were not significant in fiscal  and the division was sold at the end of the first quarter of fiscal gross profit 
gross profit  as a percentage of revenues  decreased to of total revenues in fiscal  compared to of total revenues in fiscal gross profit from flowmole operations was adversely affected by the continued trend of declining prices and requirements to provide additional ancillary services under drilling contracts 
in addition  in certain regions the company experienced high levels of employee turnover and high percentages of remote work 
in late december  the company closed its atlanta office and merged the southeast region into another region 
consequently  two service centers were opened in locations closer to customers in an effort to reduce costs associated with crew travel 
gross profit was also adversely affected by additional reserves provided in the third quarter of fiscal for casualty losses under the company s loss sensitive insurance program and for increased state tax reserves due to current audits by state and local jurisdictions 
the company experienced a lower gross profit percentage from cablecure operations  primarily attributable to performing a large number of smaller demonstration projects and to lower pricing from florida power light 
the company also relied heavily on specialized subcontractors for services in order to meet a short term increase in the volume of work required by customers during the third quarter of fiscal  which adversely affected overall gross profit 
the company experienced a decrease in gross profit percentage in its international operations compared to fiscal fiscal gross profit was favorably affected by having a gain from settlement of arbitration  and having recorded several sales of previously leased equipment  which generated large gross profit amounts as the equipment was fully depreciated 
competitive pressures on pricing in fiscal caused further reductions in gross profit 
operating expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  including royalties and profit sharing expenses  as a percentage of revenues  decreased by in fiscal  compared to fiscal research and engineering expenses  as a percentage of revenues  increased by in fiscal  compared to fiscal during fiscal  the company temporarily reduced its north american sales force from eight to five employees 
in january  the company hired three new sales employees in geographic regions where the company believes it can gain additional market share 
the company also hired  in late fiscal  a full time employee dedicated to central and south american sales activities  replacing a consultant used previously 
royalties and profit sharing expenses are no longer a significant portion of the company s expenses  as the company ceased paying royalties to flowmole partners after fiscal the company is required to pay dow corning one half of the adjusted net profits before tax generated by its cablecure operations pursuant to its license agreement  no such payments were earned in connection with fiscal operations 
the increased research and engineering costs in fiscal reflect the company s efforts to refine and improve its series f drill and fpu  as well as to continue developing new tools designed to enhance crew profitability and the attractiveness of flowmole drilling systems to international customers 
operating income 
as a result of the foregoing factors  the company reported an operating loss of  or of revenues  in fiscal  compared to operating income of  or of revenues  in fiscal other income and expense 
interest income decreased to  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal due to lower levels of cash available for investment during fiscal in fiscal  the company reported an expense of  due to its share of the startup losses of its environmental joint venture  fesc 
income tax expense benefit 
the company s effective federal and state tax rate was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal in fiscal  nondeductible expenses and state income tax effects were the primary causes of the low effective tax rate in comparison to the federal tax rate 
in fiscal  the reversal of a deferred tax valuation reserve was the primary contributor to the low effective tax rate 
net loss 
as a result of the foregoing factors  the company reported a net loss of  in fiscal  compared to net income of  in fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company funded its early growth and the commercial introduction of its services through equipment sale leaseback financing  and the issuance of debt and equity securities  including the sale of common stock in an initial public offering in march since its initial public offering  the company has primarily financed its operations through cash flow from operations  cash reserves  and periodic usage of its line of credit 
the company s cash and cash equivalents totaled  at march  during fiscal  the company incurred capital expenditures of approximately  primarily for upgrades and additions to its fleet of drilling equipment and purchases of conventional and other equipment in order to respond to its customers requests for expanded ancillary service capabilities 
uses of cash also included approximately  to fund insurance and other reserves accrued during fiscal the company expects to continue the periodic use of its line of credit to meet its short term financing needs  due to seasonal and other factors which impact the carrying amounts of accounts receivable  inventories  accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
at march   the company had an available bank credit facility of  and an outstanding balance on the facility of  the credit facility expires during fiscal  however  the company expects to be able to obtain a renewal of the facility 
review and outlook flowmole operations 
the company currently has equipment to field flowmole systems  and personnel to field between and crews  depending on the mix of work available 
the personnel level is consistent with the peak level achieved during fiscal the equipment level reflects the addition of five vector drilling systems and one series f drilling system  these additions were targeted at changing the mix of equipment available 
the company typically plans for excess equipment to allow time for preventative maintenance  matching of equipment to job types  mobilization time  or other equipment downtime factors 
the company s current crew capacity exceeds its fiscal level  and the company plans to maintain these higher levels throughout fiscal however  the company s revenue levels from flowmole operations  and the weighted average number of systems in operation on any given day  are also affected by factors which include weather  pricing  competition  customer work release practices  soil and other work difficulty determinants  and permitting 
the company may also choose to increase or decrease its capacity  however the current plan is to only add crews or equipment when a high degree of confidence exists in the company s ability to keep the added crews busy 
see also the discussion under competition  seasonal factors and utilities budgetary considerations included under risk factors  below 
cablecure operations 
the company expects a continuation of the trend towards increased customer acceptance of the cablecure process  including an increased level of work under test  treat or replace contracts 
the company has projected an increase to million feet of cable injected with cablecure fluid in the united states in fiscal the company anticipates that the trend towards lower pricing for cable replacement will continue to place downward pressure on the price for cablecure services 
see competition under part i  item i 
the increased trend towards customer requirements for turnkey services will also place pressure on the level of labor and other costs required to deliver the cablecure service 
because the company s customers can typically cancel their work on short notice  a certain degree of uncertainty always exists in the company s future revenue levels 
see also the discussion under competition  seasonal factors  utilities budgetary considerations and dow corning corporation included under risk factors  below 
international operations 
the company intends to emphasize its service businesses and continuation of its spare parts revenues in future international operations 
the company operated three drilling crews in the united kingdom in fiscal and fiscal  and has increased to four crews in fiscal with plans for further expansion 
revenues from drilling operations in the united kingdom were and of revenue from international operations in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
customer orders for united kingdom drilling services are typically of very short duration  so sudden unanticipated changes in the level of competition or customer demand could have an immediate adverse impact on the company s operations 
cablecure services in europe have been concentrated in germany and austria 
revenue levels  primarily from small demonstration projects  were approximately  in both fiscal and fiscal the company believes that potential exists for growth in european cablecure services  but customer acceptance of the cablecure process is proceeding slowly in europe  as it did in past years in the united states 
the company plans to continue expanding its sales efforts throughout europe spare parts sales accounted for and of revenue from international operations in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the company expects to be able to maintain or increase its spare parts sales  due to the sales of additional new equipment in fiscal and any such sales in the future 
the company currently has inventories of new equipment available for sale in the first two quarters of fiscal  at levels equivalent to the prior year 
see the discussion below under operating expenses and restructuring activities 
because the company has yet to make any final decisions about future sources of manufacturing of new equipment  it cannot predict the level of any future equipment sales  and risk exists that its potential equipment customers and existing spare parts customers may award their business to competitors prior to any final such decision being implemented 
therefore  the company cannot predict any future level of equipment sales  and spare parts sales may also be adversely affected 
operating expenses and restructuring activities 
on april   the company announced a restructuring designed to reduce headcount  overhead and inventory costs by outsourcing its internal manufacturing of new flowmole drilling equipment 
as a result of this restructuring  the company also initiated a plan designed to eliminate manufacturing and administrative jobs at its kent  washington headquarters  and to reduce operating expenses by million in fiscal  compared to fiscal levels 
because the company has not yet operated at these reduced levels  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve or maintain the targeted expense reductions 
also  subsequent changes in the company s business may require offsetting spending increases in other areas 
previously  the company had designed and engineered its own equipment and assembled the equipment from components manufactured by outside vendors 
as a result of the restructuring  the company plans to outsource all manufacturing and assembly of equipment 
no final decision has yet been made about the vendor for the final assembly process 
although the company expects to have multiple options for obtaining such services  the ultimate cost of new equipment in the future may increase from past levels 
the company has a prototype series g drill under testing  and expects that the testing process  finalization of design  selection of a final vendor and receipt of completed series g drills  will not be completed until at least late or early the company is required to pay a royalty to dow corning based on the net profits from cablecure services  as defined in the underlying exclusive license agreement 
the level of such provisions for royalty expenditures will increase if the projections of improving levels of cablecure revenues are achieved 
such royalty payments were not material in fiscal or fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item capital expenditures and other matters 
the company expects to continue to require substantial levels of capital spending 
in fiscal  capital spending will emphasize upgrading of existing field power units to support existing series d drills and future production of series g drills  as well as the purchase of additional conventional equipment  such as backhoes  to support customer requirements for increased turnkey capabilities 
in addition  if the company is unable to sell its remaining inventory of existing equipment  such equipment may be placed into service with the company s own crews 
the company s line of credit expires on november  the company expects to be able to negotiate an extension of this credit facility  or obtain a replacement facility from another financial institution  at similar terms and interest rates 
the company s financial performance through september  will be a factor in determining the company s ability to achieve the renewal without an increase in borrowing costs 
the company expects to be able to finance its capital expenditures through cash generated by operations  together with the periodic use of its line of credit 
the company may also rely on lease financing for the acquisition of capital equipment 
however  there can be no assurance that such sources of financing will be available on acceptable terms  and the company may be forced to delay or reduce its capital spending as a result 
other matters 
in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item forward looking information 
this fiscal form k contains forward looking statements  in addition to those under the caption review and outlook 
such statements are subject to substantial risk 
actual results may vary materially due to risks and uncertainties inherent in the company s business  including those described under review and outlook and those described under risk factors  below 
risk factors competition 
the company has experienced a long term trend of declining prices for guided boring services  particularly for smaller diameter utility installations  due to competitive pressures and changes in utility bidding practices 
this trend has also caused the company to lower its prices for cablecure injection services  which are priced at a discount to replacement costs  including replacement via guided boring 
in addition  the company s utility customers are increasing their requests for turnkey installation  replacement and restoration services  requiring their drilling contractors to take responsibility for switching circuits  terminating circuits  and other non incidental tasks 
these tasks require additional equipment and labor  and the cost increases can offset any price increase the company is able to negotiate for the expansion of its services 
the company s average price per foot drilled or injected in fiscal decreased slightly over its fiscal results 
the trend of falling prices for guided boring services is expected to continue into the future  as more customers award work based on competitive bidding  more customers require their drilling contractors to perform additional tasks as part of the drilling contract  and more conventional contractors acquire drilling capabilities in order to enter into this segment of the construction industry 
this trend will continue to put downward pressure on the market price for cablecure services 
the company cannot predict the ultimate duration or the magnitude of these decreases 
seasonal factors 
weather and other seasonal factors may decrease the company s revenues and profits in any given period 
adverse weather may preclude the company from operating its flowmole drilling systems or providing its cablecure services at certain times of the year 
in addition  the company believes that the regular budgetary cycles of certain of its north american utility customers tend to concentrate demand for the company s services during the third quarter of its fiscal year the fourth quarter of the calendar year  although other budgetary factors described below may override this trend in any given quarter 
as a result of these factors  results of operation in any given fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results in any other fiscal quarter 
utilities budgetary considerations 
budgetary considerations  arising from unfavorable regulatory determinations on matters such as rate setting  capitalization of services performed by the company  or siting of power production facilities  or from reductions in new housing starts  reductions in electric utility revenues due to mild weather  and general economic downturns have affected the ability of some of the company s utility customers to sustain their cable replacement or other maintenance programs and accordingly adversely impact the company s revenues and profits 
although the company has broadened its customer base  one customer  virginia power  continues to generate a significant portion of the company s consolidated revenues  and a small number of customers generate more than half of its cablecure revenues 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item because cable replacement  restoration and other maintenance programs are  to a substantial extent  deferrable and the company s contracts with its utility customers permit termination of orders on relatively short notice  postponement or cancellation of such programs by customers can interject substantial volatility into the company s revenues and profits 
dow corning corporation 
the company purchases its cablecure fluid exclusively from dow corning 
in may  dow corning filed for protection under chapter while the company has been informed by dow corning that it intends to continue the cablecure business  there can be no assurance that the bankruptcy trustee will not seek to amend or terminate the cablecure license agreement 
see the discussion under the cablecure service in part i  item impact of inflation and changing prices 
inflation has had only a minimal effect on the company s revenues and expenses and is not expected to have a significant impact on revenues or expenses in fiscal foreign currency fluctuations 
the company s financial results are affected by fluctuations in certain foreign currencies  particularly the british pound sterling
