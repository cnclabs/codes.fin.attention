this increase resulted from improved sales at each of the company s three divisions million in finished fabrics  million in apparel  and million in narrow fabrics 
the finished fabrics division improved primarily as a result of increased demand and delivery of many of the division s synthetic fabrics to the junior girls  women s wear and export markets 
apparel sales increased primarily as a result of the division s continued emphasis on selling primarily to customers in the private label and retail areas of the t shirt business 
cost of goods sold cgs  as a percentage of net sales  decreased from to in this decrease resulted primarily from a combination of changes in the product mix at the appparel division to products with higher margins and a reduction in volume related operating costs within both the finished fabrics and narrow fabrics divisions 
these improvements were partially offset by increased raw material costs  primarily cotton and synthetic yarns 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a as a percentage of sales decreased from in the prior year to in this decrease is primarily a result of the company s success in keeping the fixed portion of these costs relatively constant approximately of sg a is fixed in nature as the company increased its sales volume when compared to financial information as to industry segments is contained in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
interest expense increased million during when compared with despite the company reducing total debt and factor advances by approximately million primarily during its second and third fiscal quarters of interest expense rose primarily due to increases in the prime rate of interest and other comparable interest rate measures  which occurred throughout late fiscal and fiscal other income decreased to  in as compared to million in which included receipt of approximately million for the settlement of a lawsuit

fiscal year compared with fiscal year net sales for fiscal decreased to million compared to net sales of million in this million decrease resulted from the decreased sales of finished fabrics million which offset increased sales of knit apparel primarily t shirts million and narrow fabrics 
the decreased sales of finished fabrics resulted primarily from the continued weakness of the retail market for apparel made from synthetic finished fabrics  primarily polyester and rayon 
the increased sales of knit apparel resulted from the company s change of its product mix from basic t shirts to more fashion and value added products as well as improved market conditions in the overall t shirt market

capital resources and liquidity during and  the company s business exhibited seasonality  primarily due to temporary plant shutdowns during the christmas new year s holiday season 
as a result  sales have been and are expected to be lower during the first quarter of the fiscal year while working capital requirements increase in anticipation of higher second quarter sales 
working capital is comprised chiefly of accounts receivable and inventory 
traditionally  the company has maintained financing capacity for working capital and other general corporate purposes under certain factoring agreements and other comparable short term borrowing arrangements 
the company may be advanced funds in amounts not to exceed of eligible accounts receivable plus of eligible inventories  not to exceed a maximum of million 
the amounts reported on the balance sheet as due from factor represent accounts receivable with factors net of advances 
as of november   the company had approximately million of funds available under its factoring arrangements 
as of november   working capital equaled million  a decrease of million from the fiscal year ended october  this decrease in working capital is due primarily to decreases in inventory million and accounts receivable million which more than offset decreases in current maturities of long term debt million and accounts payable million and increases in property  plant and equipment held for disposal million 
reductions in inventories and accounts receivable resulted primarily from the discontinuance of certain company operations as previously discussed 
the company s operating activities generated million in net cash during the fiscal year 
adjustments to the fiscal year net loss of million included non cash transactions of million and the net loss on disposition of property  plant and equipment of million 
in addition  while reductions in inventories  prepaid and other assets provided million  increases in receivables and decreases in liabilities required million

the facility balance outstanding at the end of the fiscal year totaling million is payable in monthly installments through the end of fiscal the credit facility places limitations on the company s rental expense  additional indebtedness  acquisitions  capital expenditures and sale or disposal of assets 
the company is also required to maintain a stated amount of working capital and tangible net worth as well as certain financial ratios  including stated ratios of assets to current liabilities and of earnings to fixed charges 
this facility has been periodically amended as follows i to make the restrictive covenants less restrictive in order that the company would remain in compliance with all covenant requirements  ii defer and reduce principal payments to assist the company in meeting its cash demands  iii provide for the applicable interest rate margin on the prime  cd and libor rates of interest to be changed within a certain range based on the ratio of the company s senior debt plus factor advances to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amoritzation and raise the margin associated with the cd and libor rates of interest  and iv effect certain other changes 
the company is in compliance with all of the facility s covenant requirements 
as of november  the company has approximately million of its series c debentures outstanding 
the annual interest rate of these debentures may be adjusted at the sole discretion of the company on april st of each year until maturity in the year the series c debentures are redeemable on april st of each year  in whole or in part  at the option of the holder or the company for the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest through the date of redemption 
on september   the company issued million in principal amount of senior subordinated debentures due august  debentures 
the debentures  which cannot be called prior to their maturity date  are unsecured obligations but contain covenants that place limitations on the use of proceeds from disposal of assets and on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and senior indebtedness as defined in the indenture if such indebtedness would exceed stated ratios of capitalization and earnings after such incurrence 
under the most restrictive of these covenants  the company may not incur additional indebtedness if  after giving effect to such incurrence  the aggregate amount of indebtedness of the company would exceed of the sum of all indebtedness and stockholders equity 
advances under the company s factoring agreements are not considered indebtedness for the purpose of these covenants 
the company is currently prohibited by this covenant from incurring aditional indebtedness because of the reduction in common stockholders equity primarily resulting from the million charges to record discontinued operations

these funds were used to redeem all outstanding shares of preferred stock million and all outstanding series a and series b debentures million  repay long term debt million and reduce factor advances million

the aggregate future minimum lease payments under these leases for their initial or remaining noncancellable terms were million as of november   including million for fiscal the company plans to place into service million of machinery and equipment during fiscal this equipment primarily will increase fabric dyeing and finishing capacity and further automate the inspection process at the company s finished fabrics division as well as increase knit apparel production sewing capacity 
management anticipates that approximately million of the million of equipment will be placed into service through a committed operating lease line and thus excluded from the company s balance sheet 
management believes cash flows from operations and funds available under factoring agreements will provide the company with sufficient sources of funds to meet its cash needs and  assuming no significant deterioration in current market conditions  for the foreseeable future
