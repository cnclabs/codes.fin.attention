these buying patterns have typically adversely affected orders for the company s products in the third quarter of each fiscal year 
although it is difficult to predict the future seasonality of sales  the company believes that future seasonality should be influenced at least in part by customer and user buying patterns similar to those that have historically affected the company 
quarterly financial results are also affected by new product introductions and line extensions  the timing of large orders  changes in product sales or customer mix  vendor and customer pricing  production levels  supply and manufacturing delays and general industry and economic conditions 
the seasonality of the company s financial results and the unpredictability of the factors affecting such seasonality make the company s quarterly and yearly financial results difficult to predict and subject to significant fluctuation

the average collection period of accounts receivable at june  increased to days from days at june  inventories decreased by  or  from the june  amount primarily because of better control and management of inventory levels

the company is currently negotiating its line of credit and expects that it will be able to renew it for one year on terms no less favorable that those of its current credit line 
the company has not incurred significant losses or gains from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the continuing expansion of the company s hong kong  mexican and united kingdom subsidiaries could  however  result in larger gains or losses as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as those subsidiaries conduct business in whole or in part in foreign currencies 
the company believes that cash flow from operations  vendor credit  its existing working capital and its bank line of credit will be sufficient to satisfy the company s anticipated cash requirements at least through fiscal nonetheless  the company may seek additional sources of capital as necessary or appropriate to finance acquisitions or to otherwise finance the company s growth or operations  however  there can be no assurance that such funds if needed will be available on favorable terms  if at all
