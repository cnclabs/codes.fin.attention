item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview in analyzing petro s results  one should consider a variety of factors that are unique to the company and its industry 
these include the company s active acquisition program  the rapid rate of amortization of customer lists purchased in heating oil acquisitions  the seasonal nature of the demand for residential heating  the general ability of heating oil distributors to pass on variations in wholesale costs to their customers and the company s recent history with star gas 
the following highlights and describes certain of these factors 
first  the financial results of a given year do not reflect the full impact of that year s acquisitions 
historically  most acquisitions have been made during the non heating season  as many sellers desire to retain winter profits and avoid summer losses 
accordingly  the effect of acquisitions made after the heating season are not fully reflected in the company s sales volume and operating and financial results until the following calendar year 
second  substantially all purchased intangibles have been comprised of customer lists and covenants not to compete 
amortization of customer lists is a non cash expense which represents the write off of the amount paid for customers acquired in connection with acquisitions who later terminate their relationship with the company 
based on the company s analysis of historical purchased fuel oil customer attrition rates  customer lists are amortized over a six year period and the balance over a year period 
historically  lost purchased accounts have been largely offset by new customers obtained through internal marketing 
approximately of the company s customer losses result from homeowners moving  of which approximately two thirds have been retained by the company 
the covenants not to compete are amortized over the lives of the covenants  which generally range from five to seven years 
third  the seasonal nature of the company s business results in the sale by the company of approximately of its annual volume of fuel oil in the first quarter  in the fourth quarter  and in the second and third quarters combined 
as a result  acquisitions made during the spring and summer months generally have a negative effect on earnings in the calendar year in which they are made 
most of the costs associated with an acquired distributor are incurred evenly throughout the remainder of the year  whereas a smaller percentage of the purchased company s annual volume and gross profit is realized during the same period 
fourth  changes in total dollar sales do not necessarily affect the company s gross profit or net income 
since the company historically has added a per gallon margin onto its wholesale costs  variability in supply prices has affected net sales  but generally has not affected net income 
as a result  the company s margins are most meaningfully measured on a per gallon basis and not as a percentage of sales 
while fluctuations in wholesale prices have not significantly affected demand to date  it is possible that significant wholesale price increases over an extended period of time could have the effect of encouraging conservation 
if demand were reduced and the company was unable to increase its gross profit margin or reduce its operating expenses  the effect of the decrease in volume would be to reduce net income 
finally  as described in detail in the investment in star gas section of this report  the company transferred all of its propane assets  principally those of star gas  to star gas partners  lp and its operating subsidiaries as part of a master limited partnership transaction in december as a result of this transaction  the company received approximately million of proceeds  in addition to retaining a interest in the partnership  including the general partnership interest 
to provide a more meaningful analysis of the company s results  the following to comparison discusses the company s results both including and excluding those propane assets transferred 
results of operations and other data compared with volume 
total home heating oil and retail propane volume increased to million gallons in  as compared to million gallons in this increase was primarily due to petro s ongoing acquisition program  which resulted in eleven home heating oil and propane acquisitions in  as well as twelve home heating oil and propane companies in  including star gas  whose volume is fully reflected for the first time in excluding the impact of the propane assets transferred in the star gas conveyance to the partnership the propane assets in both and  volume declined  from million gallons to million gallons 
this decline was largely due to warmer weather in and a change in the company s scheduling of fuel oil deliveries  which  while improving operating efficiency  negatively impacted the year to year volume comparison 
heating oil volume was further impacted by the sale of the company s lower profitability business in new hampshire  as well as by the loss of certain low margin interruptible  will call and bid customers  and by account attrition  which together offset the impact of heating oil acquisitions 
net sales 
net sales increased to million for  as compared to million in this increase was due to retail and wholesale sales associated with the company s acquisitions 
excluding the impact of the propane assets in both and  net sales declined from million to million 
this decrease was smaller than the decline in volume as a result of a slight increase in home heating oil selling prices and a rise in service and installation revenues due to the acquisition of branches with  on average  higher service revenues than at the company s historic locations 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million for  as compared to million for excluding the impact of the propane assets  gross profit fell  from million to million 
this decrease was also smaller than the decline in volume  largely as a result of increased heating oil margins and a decline in net service loss  caused both by the growth in service and installation revenues and by the establishment of customer service departments  which resulted in the reclassification of certain service costs as general and administrative expenses in which were treated as service expenses in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for  as compared to million for  due largely to the additional expenses associated with star gas  which accounted for million  or  of the increase 
excluding the propane assets  as well as the impact of the customer service reclassification and one time expenses related to a consulting study discussed in the following paragraph  selling  general and administrative expenses increased only in  despite the company s expansion into three new geographic markets since in  as part of petro s focus on operational excellence  the company commissioned a study by a nationally renowned consulting firm to examine and recommend potential areas of opportunities 
the results of the study suggested that the company should be able to increase operational efficiency  improve its marketing efforts and provide greater levels of customer satisfaction by taking advantage of its unique size and capabilities within the home heating oil industry to access developments in organizational structure and technology and communications 
the company is currently considering actions to be taken as a result of this study 
direct delivery expense 
direct delivery expense increased to million for  as compared to million for excluding the impact of the propane assets  direct delivery expenses decreased  from million to million  due both to the company s ability to reduce direct delivery expenses in response to the decline in volume and to improved performance resulting from the change in delivery scheduling 
as a result of these efforts  the company s per unit delivery cost fell in amortization of customer lists 
amortization of customer lists increased to million for  as compared to million for this increase was primarily due to customer list amortization associated with star gas 
excluding the propane assets  the company experienced a decline in customer list amortization  from million to million  as a result of certain customer lists becoming fully amortized 
depreciation and amortization of plant and equipment 
depreciation and amortization of plant and equipment increased to million for  as compared to million for this increase was largely due to depreciation associated with star gas 
excluding the propane assets  the company experienced a increase in depreciation  from million to million  as a result of the company s increased size and asset base 
amortization of deferred charges 
amortization of deferred charges remained virtually unchanged from the prior fiscal year at million for  as the million increase in amortization associated with star gas was offset by a like amount of deferred charges associated with prior heating oil acquisitions which became fully amortized 
provision for supplemental benefits 
provision for supplemental benefits increased to million for  as compared to million for this non cash expense is related to the extension of the exercise date related to certain options previously issued 
this event occurred late in fiscal year  accordingly  the full impact is first reflected in fiscal year operating income 
operating income declined million to million for  as compared to million for excluding the propane assets  operating income declined from million to million  primarily due to the decline in volume and the one time cost of the consulting study 
interest expense and interest income 
net interest expense increased by million to million for  as compared to million for  due to increased average borrowings of million  a substantial portion of which was used to finance the purchase of star gas 
the remaining increase in average debt outstanding was primarily associated with the funding of the other home heating oil and propane acquisitions completed in and  as well as with increasing petro s working capital to fund future expansion 
while the company was successful in refinancing million of its debt in april at a lower borrowing rate  the average borrowing rate for the company increased by from to as a result of the company s extension of its average maturity on its debt outstanding 
as a result of the star gas conveyance in december  petro has applied approximately million of its proceeds from the master limited partnership transaction to the retirement of long term debt in december and february  with the remainder of the approximately million in proceeds used to increase working capital to fund the company s future growth 
other income 
other income of million for primarily represents the net gain recorded on the sale of certain customer lists and fixed assets  including the sale of the new hampshire operations 
income taxes 
income taxes were million for  as compared to million for  and represent certain state taxes 
the company had losses for federal income tax purposes in both and as of december   net operating loss carryforwards amounted to million 
equity in earnings of star gas 
for  the company recorded equity in losses of star gas of million 
this amount represented the share of star gas loss associated with the company s minority interest prior to its purchase of the remainder of star gas on december  from that date until december   the company owned of star gas  accordingly  star s results were consolidated with the company s  and the company showed no such equity in losses 
subsequent to the december  conversion of star gas into a master limited partnership  the company owned of star gas  and star gas results were again accounted for under the equity method of accounting  resulting in equity in earnings of million in extraordinary item loss on early extinguishment of debt 
in april  the company recorded an extraordinary charge of million in connection with the refinancing of million of debt due in march this refinancing yielded a reduction in the borrowing rate on that debt of over in in the comparable period in  the company also recorded an extraordinary charge of million  when it refinanced million in long term notes that were scheduled to mature in june net loss 
net loss increased from million for to million for this was primarily due to the decline in home heating oil volume  increased interest expense associated with the company s acquisition of star gas  and an increase in non cash depreciation and amortization expense at star gas 
ebitda 
ebitda increased  or million  to million for  as compared to million for  due to an increase in ebitda of million at star gas  largely offset by the decline in heating oil volume and one time expenses related to the consulting study 
nida 
nida declined from million for to million for this decline was primarily due to the volume related home heating oil ebitda decline and increased interest expense associated with the company s acquisitions  primarily star gas 
ebitda is defined as operating income before depreciation  amortization  non cash charges relating to the grant of stock options to executives of the company  non cash charges associated with deferred compensation plans and other non cash charges of a similar nature  if any 
nida is defined as net income loss before extraordinary items  plus depreciation  amortization  non cash charges relating to the grant of stock options to executives of the company  non cash charges associated with deferred compensation plans and other non cash charges of a similar nature  if any  less dividends accrued on preferred stock  excluding net income loss derived from investments accounted for by the equity method  except to the extent of any cash dividends received by the company 
compared to volume 
in  retail volume of home heating oil and propane increased to million gallons  greater than the million gallons delivered in  due to the star gas acquisition million gallons and the impact of the nine home heating oil acquisitions completed in  whose annual volume was fully reflected for the first time in  and the eleven home heating oil and propane acquisitions completed in partially offsetting the positive impact of the acquisitions was warmer weather experienced in the heating oil division  and attrition in the company s home heating oil customer base 
in  the company also sold million gallons of other petroleum products and wholesale propane  greater than the million gallons sold in this increase of million gallons was primarily due to the wholesale propane volume associated with the star gas acquisition 
net sales 
net sales in increased to million from million in this million increase was due to the star gas acquisition  which increased sales by million  offset by a decline of million in the heating oil division 
sales were lower in the heating oil division as volume growth was more than offset by lower selling prices  reflecting a lower wholesale cost of product 
gross profit 
gross profit increased from million in to million for due to both the million of gross profit realized by star gas in december and a million increase in gross profit in the heating oil division 
the increase in the heating oil division gross profit from million to million was attributable to an increase in volume and to improved gross profit margins from cent per gallon to cent per gallon 
the increase reflects an increase in heating oil gross profit margins on the sale of home heating oil  offset in part by an increase in the net cost of providing heating equipment repair and maintenance services and the additional costs associated with the severe winter weather experienced during the first quarter of selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in  from million in while expenses declined by million in the heating oil division despite larger volume  this decline was offset by million of expenses at star gas for december on a per gallon basis  the expenses in the heating oil division declined by due primarily to a million reduction in marketing expenses 
the marketing expense decline resulted from the company s more disciplined customer service oriented marketing strategy 
this decrease in marketing expenses was offset by increases in insurance and operating expenses attributable to the first quarter severe winter weather conditions 
direct delivery expense 
direct delivery expense increased million  from million in to million in this increase was due to the additional costs associated with larger volume and temporary delivery inefficiencies experienced during the first quarter of as a result of severe winter weather conditions  as well as to delivery costs of million associated with the star gas volume 
amortization and depreciation 
amortization of customer lists and deferred charges decreased  or million  to million 
these non cash expenses declined as certain customer lists and deferred charges became fully amortized 
depreciation and amortization of plant and equipment increased million to million due primarily to the star gas acquisition 
operating income 
operating income increased to million for from million in this significant improvement was due to volume growth and to improved home heating oil margins  which were partially offset by first quarter weather related increases in service  delivery and operating expenses 
the decline in depreciation and amortization expense also contributed to the increase in operating income 
net interest expense 
net interest expense increased million to million for  due primarily to an increase of million in total average borrowings from million to million  offset by a reduction in the average borrowing rate from to 
also contributing to the increase was million of interest expense of star gas 
income taxes 
income taxes were million in  as compared to million in and represent certain state income taxes applicable to profitable subsidiaries that are not included in consolidated state returns 
the company had losses for federal income tax purposes in each of these periods 
the company has available million of net operating loss carryforwards at december  equity in losses of star gas corporation 
based on petro s ownership percentage of star gas prior to december   million was recorded as a loss under the equity method of accounting 
in december  the company exercised certain options to acquire the remaining common equity of star gas  and its results are included in the consolidated financial statements of the company 
extraordinary item loss on early extinguishment of debt 
the extraordinary loss of million for represents the cash premium paid in connection with the february refinancing of million in long term notes which were scheduled to mature in june in the company recorded an extraordinary charge of million representing a cash premium of million and the write off of million in debt discount and related deferred charges when million of subordinated debt scheduled to mature in and was refinanced 
net loss 
the net loss decreased from million in to million in  due to the million increase in operating income  offset by an increase in net interest expense of million and the million of equity in losses of star gas 
ebitda 
despite being approximately warmer than  ebitda increased to million in from million in this million improvement was due to volume expansion associated with the company s acquisition program  an increase in home heating oil gross profit margins and operating expense control 
liquidity and financial condition one of the company s primary financial strategies has been to finance its growth through a combination of internally generated capital  the sale of common stock  the issuance of redeemable preferred stock and debt 
this strategy has been pursued by financing acquisitions and other asset requirements made in the last five years in the following manner with internally generated cash and funds from common stock offerings  with redeemable preferred stock and long term debt  and from the net proceeds of the star gas first mortgage notes and the star gas mlp offering 
in february  the company completed public offerings of million of its subordinated debentures due february  and approximately million shares of class a common stock 
the net proceeds of the two offerings were approximately million 
during  the proceeds were used to purchase million of long term debt and preferred stock of star gas  to retire approximately million million shares of class a common stock issued in the star transaction  and to repay million of long term debt due in march along with a premium of approximately million to retire such portion of debt 
the balance of the net proceeds  approximately million  was made available for general corporate purposes 
in december  the company received net proceeds from the transfer of its propane assets to the partnership of million  million from star gas corporation s first mortgage notes  and million from the star gas mlp offering 
the company used million of these proceeds to repay long term debt and reserved million to guarantee the partnership s minimum quarterly distribution  leaving a balance of approximately million 
approximately million of this balance was used in february to pay million of the million subordinated debentures due at an eleven percent premium 
net cash used by operating activities of million  along with the million remaining from the million subordinated debenture and million class a common stock offerings  combined with the million remaining from the star gas mlp transaction amounted to million for the year ended december  these funds were utilized in investing activities for acquisitions and the purchase of fixed assets totaling million  in financing activities to pay dividends of million  to repay working capital borrowings of million  to purchase redeemable preferred stock of million  to repurchase common stock of million  to pay consents and other fees in connection with the star mlp offering of million  and for other financing activities of million 
in addition  the company financed a portion of its acquisitions with notes payable in the aggregate amount of million 
as a result of the above activity  the company s cash balance increased by million at december  the company currently has available a million working capital revolving credit facility 
at december  there were no outstanding working capital borrowings  and the company had million of working capital 
for  the company anticipates paying dividends on its common stock before dividend reinvestment of approximately million  redeeming million of redeemable preferred stock and paying million in preferred dividends 
based on the company s current working capital position  bank credit availability and expected net cash provided by operating activities  the company expects to be able to meet all of the above mentioned obligations in currently  the company has no material commitments for capital expenditures
