item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations consolidated earnings the company reported net income of million  or per common share after payment of preferred dividends 
this reflects a significant improvement over excluding the effect of merger and restructuring costs and net income of million and million  respectively 
after payment of preferred dividends  the respective and earnings per share were and 
the percent increase in earnings over was attributable to five principal factors o benefits from the merger with american oil and gas corporation aog  o year to year business growth  o improved irrigation deliveries as a result of normal weather  o higher natural gas liquids ngls prices  and o the annualized impact of rate increases 
the earnings improvement over resulted from rate increases in both retail and interstate jurisdictions  higher deliveries to irrigation customers and expense reductions resulting from the merger of aog into k n 
mild fourth quarter weather and lower prices for ngls partially offset the positive factors 
additionally  net income was reduced by a million pre tax write down of an investment 
in the third quarter of  the company expensed million of non recurring costs related to the merger and to the restructuring of the retail natural gas services segment 
these costs reduced net income by million  or per common share 
results of operations comparative operating results by business segment  excluding the million non recurring merger and restructuring charges  and consolidated other income and deductions and income taxes are reviewed below 
as the company s interstate pipeline segment was not a separate business unit until the company s october  implementation of federal energy regulatory commission ferc order no

retail natural gas services operating revenues gas sales transportation and other operating costs and expenses gas purchases operations and maintenance depreciation  depletion and amortization taxes  other than income taxes operating income systems throughput trillion btus gas sales transportation system wide heating degree days   the significant improvement in operating income over primarily reflects increased deliveries gas sales and transportation to irrigation customers  and the annualized impact of rate increases on the rocky mountain distribution system during the latter part of irrigation deliveries in exceeded the previous year by trillion btus  as summer temperatures and rainfall approximated normal weather patterns 
deliveries to customers for space heating requirements exceeded volumes by trillion btus as temperatures  although milder than normal  were colder than this segment s operations and maintenance expenses include profit sharing provisions million higher than due to improved earnings and the impact of the merger related cost reductions and efficiencies on operating results 
additionally  operations and maintenance expenses were reduced by million resulting from favorable resolutions of certain regulatory and environmental matters 
excluding these items  and despite increased systems throughput  operations and maintenance expenses were relatively flat with as the company implemented cost reduction initiatives to further enhance its competitive position 
interstate transportation and storage services operating revenues transportation and storage natural gas liquids and other operating costs and expenses gas purchases operations and maintenance depreciation  depletion and amortization taxes  other than income taxes operating income systems throughput trillion btus natural gas liquids millions of gallons operating results for were positively impacted by higher rates due to the late ferc rate case settlement which provided for an million annual increase in revenues 
however  this positive was partially offset by lower customer nominations for firm storage service and reduced rates  effective june   accompanying the transfer of three storage fields to a nonjurisdictional subsidiary 
the increase in gas purchases costs results from increased ngls recoveries and the resolution of pre order exchange imbalances

as a result of order  merchant services to wholesale customers subsequent to september  were converted to transportation and storage services 
the decline in this combined segment s operating income and ngls sales gallons results from the january  property transfer to the gathering  processing and marketing services segment

in addition to the realized merger benefits  acquisitions of gas transmission and storage assets in february and a processing plant and gathering facilities in october contributed incremental operating income of million 
the increases in gas sales volumes over  reflecting improved irrigation requirements and electric generation load  positively impacted transportation and gathering volumes 
finally  average ngls prices were per gallon above average prices 
the business segment s operating results were positively impacted by the january  transfer of processing and gathering properties from the interstate pipeline 
in addition  revenues  expenses and operating income reflect the full year contribution of the april wattenberg gathering and transmission system and the june acquisition of wind river gathering facilities 
operating results for  compared to  were adversely impacted by declining ngls prices and lower gas sales margins due to unfavorable weather 
gas and oil production operating revenues operating costs and expenses operating income loss gas and oil production equivalent bcf operating results for were adversely impacted by low natural gas prices and shut in production 
results included production from gas and oil reserves acquired in february  in october  the company sold a percent interest in these properties 
in january  tom brown  inc acquired the company s gas and oil subsidiary 
in exchange for the stock of the gas and oil subsidiary  k n received million shares of tom brown common stock and million shares of convertible preferred stock 
other income and deductions interest expense minority interests and other  net increases in interest expense primarily resulted from the issuance of long term debt in and to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions 
the impact of these financings was partially mitigated by the refunding of million of higher coupon debt 
minority interests and other  net in included a million gain from the sale of a texas gathering system 
income taxes provisions effective tax rate the effective tax rate reflects tax credits on production from gas wells qualifying for non conventional fuel credit under section of the internal revenue code  and lower state income taxes provisions resulting from changes in apportionment factors 
the effective tax rate reflects the non deductibility of certain merger costs 
liquidity and capital resources during  the primary sources of cash were generated from operations  short term borrowings and the issuance of common stock for dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans 
non operating cash outflows primarily included capital expenditures and acquisitions  redemptions of long term debt and preferred stock  and interest and dividend payments 
cash flows from operating activities net cash flows from operations totaled million  compared with million and million for and  respectively 
net operating cash flows for  excluding million of proceeds from the sale of contract demand receivables and expenditures of million related to the merger and restructuring  aggregated million 
the substantial improvement in net operating cash flows was largely attributable to the factors resulting in the percent increase in earnings 
additionally  net operating cash flows benefited from enhanced receivable collection efforts  lower gas prepayments and greater sourcing of gas supplies from storage 
capital expenditures and commitments capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  totaled million in  compared with expenditures of million in and million in the significantly higher level of capital expenditures resulted from measurement facilities and systems required for implementation of order and the construction of a new corporate office 
the capital expenditures budget totals million  excluding acquisitions 
in january  k n entered into a letter of intent to acquire a major midwest crude oil pipeline owned by amoco pipeline company 
the mile pipeline extends from riverton  wyoming  southeast through portions of colorado  nebraska and kansas  terminating south of kansas city  missouri 
k n plans to convert the pipeline for transmission of natural gas from supply rich wyoming to midwest markets 
conversion of the pipeline requires approval from the ferc 
total cost of this project  including the acquisition price and conversion to natural gas services is expected to be less than million 
the pipeline is expected to be in service in early in  k n and el paso natural gas company expect to construct the southernmost miles of the transcolorado pipeline to connect with existing gathering systems in southern colorado 
total costs of this phase of the project are estimated at million with k n s share of capital spending totaling million 
the company does not believe it has a material exposure related to take or pay matters 
generally  all amounts paid by the company for take or pay are either fully recoupable under the terms of the gas purchase contracts  or are recoverable from offsetting gas purchase obligations under certain contractual arrangements 
take or pay obligations  including payments of above market prices incurred with respect to the company s retail distribution operations  are recoverable through purchased gas adjustment clauses in existing tariffs 
at december   the cumulative amount of take or pay payments was million 
capital resources the company has credit agreements with banks to either borrow or use as commercial paper support up to million 
additionally  million of debt securities are issuable under k n s shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission 
short term borrowings were million and million at year end and  respectively 
at december   the company had million of equity capital and a long term debt to capitalization ratio of percent 
in september  standard poor s s p affirmed its a rating of k n s senior unsecured debt and preferred stock and its commercial paper rating of a 
however  to reflect its perception of a more competitive environment for the company and the industry  s p revised its ratings outlook for k n from stable to negative 
excluding the cash requirements associated with the acquisition and conversion costs of the crude oil pipeline and the phase of the transcolorado pipeline project discussed previously  the company expects that cash requirements for debt service  preferred stock redemptions  dividends and capital expenditures will be provided  primarily  by internal cash flows 
k n is currently evaluating financing alternatives  which may include a combination of long term debt and equity  to fund the acquisition and conversion of the crude oil pipeline and the transcolorado project 
regulation approximately percent of the company s assets  operating revenues and income are subject to regulation at either the federal  state or local level 
in all of these regulatory jurisdictions  rates are currently determined using cost based regulations 
the company does not expect a significant change in the manner in which rates are set by regulators 
thus far  the primary impact of competition on the company s regulated businesses has resulted in conversion of services from the bundled merchant and transportation function to transportation services only 
the cost of gas component in the bundled service rate recovers only the actual gas costs incurred 
the company anticipates the conversion to transportation service will continue and become more prevalent at the retail level 
in september  k n filed an application with the wyoming public service commission to permit k n to open its system in nine communities to competition from alternative gas suppliers 
this program is expected to go into effect in the spring of risk management to minimize the risk of price changes in the natural gas  crude oil and ngls markets  and interest rate fluctuations  the company uses certain financial instruments for hedging purposes only 
these instruments include energy products traded on the new york mercantile exchange  the kansas city board of trade and over the counter markets  including crude oil and natural gas futures and options contracts  fixed price and basis swaps  and interest rate swaps and caps 
pursuant to its board of directors approved guidelines  the company is to engage in these activities only as a hedging mechanism against pre existing or anticipated physical gas and condensate sales  gas purchases  system use and storage in order to protect profit margins  and is not to engage in speculative trading 
the activities of the risk management group are monitored by the company s risk management committee which is charged with the review and enforcement of the board of directors risk management guidelines 
the risk management committee reviews the pricing and hedging of all commodity transactions  the types of hedging instruments used  contract limits and approval levels 
all energy futures  swaps and options are recorded at fair value 
gains and losses on hedging positions are deferred and recognized as gas purchases expenses in the periods the underlying physical transactions occur 
outlook forward looking information general the company s vision is to be a world class provider of integrated energy services and solutions 
the merger with aog better positions k n to be a major player in the natural gas industry by providing the company with critical mass and access to new markets 
during  k n realized considerable benefit from the integration of assets and reduction in expenses 
k n expects additional economic benefits from additional consolidation and infrastructure reductions initiated during by year end  the company had reduced its workforce by approximately percent  annual savings of approximately million are expected in during  the company s strategy will be directed at o providing customers with choice and superior services  o improving systems utilization and optimizing existing assets while achieving growth via internal opportunities and prudent acquisitions  o forming alliances that create new opportunities or enhance existing operations  and o focusing on new projects that strengthen k n s competitive position within its traditional rocky mountain and mid continent regions 
in regulatory proceedings similar to the proceedings under order which unbundled natural gas services  the ferc has determined the need to unbundle the electric industry  and bring competition to electric rates under a proposed rulemaking 
during  the company began the development of a power marketing business to take advantage of the opportunities to offer both gas and electric energy services to customers 
k n is following the progress of the ferc s proposed rulemaking in order to properly position its power marketing business to be successful in the unregulated electric environment 
another regulatory matter affecting the electric industry  retail wheeling  is being closely monitored by the company 
retail wheeling would bring competition to the distribution of electric services  eliminating the monopoly power of electric utilities in their service territories 
throughout the united states  the recent ferc actions are leading to an opening of a more competitive environment for all gas services 
k n is looking to be a leader in providing customers a choice in services 
in that regard  k n filed an application with the wyoming public service commission in september to allow  residential and commercial customers to choose their energy provider from a qualified list of suppliers 
k n will continue to provide all other utility services and will manage the gas supplies for customers in the program 
in addition  k n is asking that wyoming markets not currently served by k n be allowed competitive choice 
the innovative program is one of the first in the nation that proposes to allow essentially all customers the opportunity to exercise energy choice for natural gas 
litigation and environmental as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  in  the company was sued in dallas county  texas  by westerman  et al  for breach of contractual and fiduciary duties  including take or pay claims  covering properties in colorado 
in a separate lawsuit filed in federal court in colorado  the company sued the plaintiffs and others asserting that contractual provisions require payment of refunds for gas purchased at above market prices and  prospectively  for a reduction in gas prices paid under the contracts to market levels 
the actual damages claimed by westerman  et al  totaled million and the punitive damages claimed totaled million 
during  the company reached settlement with parties representing approximately two thirds of the gas ownership interests held by the producers 
this settlement resolves all disputes between these parties  including the lawsuit filed by the company in colorado 
although substantial claims remain  the company believes it has a meritorious position in this matter  and does not expect this lawsuit to have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the company has reported certain environmental liabilities assumed as a result of the july  merger 
included in these liabilities were certain environmental matters related to the company s acquisition of various assets from the cabot corporation in while the cabot corporation agreed to indemnify the company against certain of these liabilities  the company may be responsible for certain costs associated with remediation in the future 
the company is presently unable to determine what  if any  dollar amount is associated with this contingency 
however  any potential exposure is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
the company expects to resolve this matter in the company s overall potential environmental cost exposure for is estimated to be approximately million 
a substantial part of the company s environmental costs are either recoverable through insurance and indemnification provisions  or have been previously expensed as part of ongoing business 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the company s pending litigation and environmental matters 
company management believes it has established adequate reserves such that resolution of pending litigation and environmental matters will not have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
significant operating variables fluctuations in natural gas prices have relatively little impact on the company s earnings 
to the extent that the company retains its merchant role in the retail natural gas services segment  the actual cost of gas is recovered from customers 
in the nonregulated gas sales arena  the majority of the sales contracts are either supported by fixed cost supplies or tied to indices where the margin is  in effect  locked in 
additionally  where price fluctuation exposure exists with respect to sales contracts or ngls feedstock  this risk is mitigated by hedging instruments 
as part of the processing business  ngls are extracted from the raw natural gas stream and sold 
during  ngls prices recovered from significant declines experienced in late and the first half of the company expects no material price changes during however  a one cent change in average ngls prices impacts the company s pre tax operating income by approximately million
