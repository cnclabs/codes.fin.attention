net income decreased million and net cash provided by operating activities increased million for the year ended december  compared to the decrease in net income for the year was primarily due to a million pre tax impairment loss recorded in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and a million pre tax restructuring charge the company recorded in may relating to its cost reduction program 
in addition  net income was adversely affected by higher product purchase costs associated with the company s third party residue gas sales and increased depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and interest expense  partially offset by higher residue gas volumes sold and higher ngl prices 
revenues from the sale of residue gas increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to average gas sales volumes increased mmcf per day to  mmcf per day for the year ended december  compared to  largely due to an increase of approximately mmcf per day in the sale of residue gas purchased from third parties 
average gas prices decreased 
per mcf to per mcf for the year ended december  compared to the effect of the decrease in residue gas prices on the company s net margin from equity production was partially offset by the company s futures positions  approximately million of gain was recognized in the year ended december  related to such contracts 
the company has entered into futures positions for a portion of its equity gas for see further discussion at forward looking information hedging 
revenues from the sale of ngls increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to average ngl sales volumes remained relatively constant at  mgal per day and average ngl prices increased 
per gallon to 
per gallon for the year ended december  compared to processing  transportation and storage revenues increased million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million of the increase was due to greater ngl revenues from the company s giddings system and increased treating revenue  primarily from gathering systems acquired in december the remaining increase was primarily due to a long term firm storage and transportation agreement at the katy facility that the company entered into in february other net revenue decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the difference was primarily attributable to a million insurance recovery recorded in for business losses associated with the december fire at the company s granger facility 
the increase in product purchases corresponds to the increase in third party residue gas sales 
combined product purchases as a percentage of residue gas and ngl sales increased two percentage points to for the year ended december  compared to the rising gas purchase percentage is a continuing trend based upon the growth of third party sales  which typically have lower margins than sales of the company s equity production 
until recently  the company had experienced narrowing margins related to third party sales due to the increasing availability of pricing information in the natural gas industry 
the company believes by targeting end use markets  these margins will be stabilized 
however  there is no assurance that the company will be successful in capturing these markets 
plant operating expense increased million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to assets purchased in the oasis acquisition in december  primarily for property taxes  and taxes on higher levels of inventory held at the katy facility  partially offset by cost savings resulting from the cost reduction plan initiated in may selling and administrative expense decreased million  primarily due to the cost reduction plan implemented in may depreciation  depletion and amortization increased million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year period 
the increase was primarily attributable to the oasis assets  additional depletion related to the company s oil and gas production and various plant upgrades and equipment additions in interest expense increased million for the year ended december  compared to  due to an increase in the company s average borrowing rate from to per annum and higher average debt outstanding during  primarily due to the redemption of the cumulative perpetual convertible preferred stock 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  includes a  adjustment to reflect management s estimate of deferred taxes

  operating data average gas sales mmcf d  average ngl sales mgal d   average gas prices mcf average ngl prices gal 

net income decreased million and net cash provided by operating activities decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in overall  throughput and sales volumes at the company s facilities remained comparable to historical levels 
the company s decrease in net income and net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to a decline in ngl and residue gas prices and higher interest  selling and administrative and depreciation  depletion and amortization costs associated with the company s acquisitions of black lake and mountain gas  along with the completion of the katy facility construction 
in addition  because of lower demand and lower than expected prices  the katy facility did not generate significant revenue 
as a result  revenues from the katy facility in did not fully offset related depreciation  depletion and amortization  interest and operating costs 
revenues from the sale of residue gas increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  as a volume increase of mmcf per day was somewhat offset by a decrease in average residue gas sales prices of 
per mcf 
approximately mmcf per day of the volume increase was attributable to an increase in the sale of residue gas purchased from third parties  primarily resulting from the acquisition of citizens national gas company assets in the third quarter of the remaining volume increase was the result of increased production volumes at the company s facilities  primarily due to the mountain gas and black lake acquisitions  new well connect activities and consolidations with smaller gathering systems 
revenues from the sale of ngls decreased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to  as a volume increase of approximately mgal per day was more than offset by a 
per gallon decrease in the average ngl sales price 
approximately mgal per day of the volume increase was attributable to an increase in the sale of ngls purchased from third parties 
the remaining volume increase was primarily attributable to the acquisitions of mountain gas and black lake  new well connect activity and consolidations with smaller gathering systems 
this volume increase was somewhat offset by unfavorable economics of ethane and propane extraction in the first quarter of and by limited ngl volumes at the granger facility  primarily as a result of the december fire 
the curtailment of production while plant improvements were completed during the third quarter of at black lake also contributed to lower volumes 
processing  transportation and storage revenues increased million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the increase was due to additional gathering revenue associated with the company s granger gathering system acquired in the mountain gas acquisition in july  increased gathering revenue at the company s lincoln road facility and the recognition of demand fees associated with a winter peaking gas purchase and sales contract at the katy facility during other net revenue increased million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in for the year ended december   the company accrued approximately million as an amount to be recovered under its business interruption insurance policy for business losses associated with the december fire at the company s granger facility and approximately million in rate refunds from a pipeline company 
these recoveries were somewhat offset by a million gain recorded as a result of the termination of interest rate swap agreements in historically  product purchases as a percentage of residue gas and ngl sales from the company s plant production have approximated 
product purchases as a percentage of residue gas and ngl sales from third party purchases were substantially higher in and approximated 
total product purchases as a percentage of residue gas and ngl sales increased approximately percentage points to for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the increase in the company s combined percentage was primarily due to an increasing proportion of residue gas sales revenues resulting from products purchased from third parties 
plant operating expense and oil and gas exploration and production costs increased approximately million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the increase in plant operating expense was primarily due to the additional operating costs associated with three gas processing facilities acquired from mountain gas and black lake in july and the katy facility  which commenced operations in february the oil and gas exploration and production cost increase resulted primarily from costs associated with producing properties acquired in the black lake acquisition 
selling and administrative expense increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  primarily due to administrative expenses necessitated by the acquisitions  an overall increase in insurance expenditures and a reduction in overhead capitalized to the company s construction projects 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in this increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of mountain gas and black lake in july and the commencement of katy facility operations in february  and was partially offset by lower depreciation and depletion expense resulting from the addition of recoverable reserves at black lake and edgewood during interest expense increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  primarily due to additional borrowings necessitated by the mountain gas and black lake acquisitions  a reduction in the amount of interest capitalized to the katy facility and an increase in the company s variable borrowing rate 
liquidity and capital resources the company s sources of liquidity and capital resources historically have been net cash provided by operating activities  funds available under its financing facilities and proceeds from offerings of equity securities 
in the past  these sources have been sufficient to meet the needs and finance the growth of the company s business 
the company can give no assurance that the historical sources of liquidity and capital resources will be available for future development and acquisition projects  and it may be required to investigate alternative financing sources 
net cash provided by operating activities has been primarily affected by product prices  the company s success in increasing the number and efficiency of its facilities and the volumes of natural gas processed by such facilities  as well as the margin on third party residue gas purchased for resale 
the company s continued growth will be dependent upon success in the areas of marketing  additions to dedicated plant reserves  acquisitions and new project development 
the company believes that the amounts available to be borrowed under the revolving credit facility  together with cash provided by operating activities  will provide it with sufficient financing to connect new reserves  maintain its existing facilities and complete its current capital improvement projects 
the company also believes that cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet its debt service and preferred stock dividend requirements 
the company s sources and uses of funds for the year ended december  are summarized as follows s sources of funds borrowings under long term debt agreements  net cash provided by operating activities  other  total sources of funds  uses of funds payments related to long term debt agreements 
 capital investments  redemption of the cumulative senior perpetual convertible preferred stock  payment of preferred dividends  payment of common stock dividends  total uses of funds  additional sources of liquidity available to the company are volumes of residue gas and ngls in storage facilities 
the company stores residue gas and ngls primarily to ensure an adequate supply for long term sales contracts and for resale during periods when prices are favorable 
the company held residue gas in storage for such purposes of approximately bcf at an average cost of per mcf per mmbtu at december  as compared to bcf at an average cost of per mcf per mmbtu at december   primarily at the katy facility 
the company also held ngls in storage of  mgal at an average cost of 
per gallon and  mgal at an average cost of 
per gallon at december  and december   respectively  at various third party storage facilities 
at december   the company had hedging contracts in place for anticipated sales for approximately bcf of stored gas at a weighted average price of per mmbtu for the winter heating season 
as of december   the company had shelf registrations available providing for the sale of up to million of debt securities and preferred stock and up to four million shares of common stock 
on february   the company filed a registration statement registering an additional million of debt securities or preferred or common stock  which the company believes will be declared effective in april the company has been successful overall in replacing production with new reserves 
however  volumes of natural gas dedicated to some of the company s plants have declined in recent years because additions to dedicated plant reserves have not fully offset production 
in  including the reserves associated with westana gathering company westana and acquisitions  the company connected new reserves to its gathering systems to replace approximately of production 
on a company wide basis  dedicated reserves  including certain proved undeveloped properties and revisions to previous estimates  decreased from tcf as of december  as revised to approximately tcf at december  the decrease is primarily due to decreased drilling in all areas in which the company operates and declines in reserves at the company s black lake field 
in may  the company redeemed all of the issued and outstanding shares of its cumulative senior perpetual convertible preferred stock liquidation preference of million pursuant to the provisions of the certificate of designation relating to such preferred stock  at an aggregate redemption price of approximately million 
risk management activities the company s policy is to utilize risk management tools primarily to reduce commodity price risk for its equity production and to lock in profit margins for its storage and marketing activities 
it is the company s objective to maintain a balanced portfolio of financial exposure between physical obligations fixed price purchase and sales  storage inventories and related financial instruments futures  swaps  and options positions 
this effectively allows the company to fix its total margin because gains or losses in the physical market are offset by corresponding losses or gains in the financial instruments market 
hedging and related activities may expose the company to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances when i production is less than expected  ii the company s customers fail to purchase or deliver the contracted quantities of natural gas or ngls  or iii the company s over the counter otc counterparties fail to perform 
to the extent that the company engages in hedging activities  it may be prevented from realizing the benefits of favorable price changes in the physical market 
however  it is similarly insulated against decreases in such prices 
in  the board of directors adopted its natural gas futures trading procedures and created a committee of officers to oversee the company s risk management activities 
as an additional control  the company has developed information systems that allow daily monitoring of its risk management activities and its exposure related to futures  swaps and options positions resulting from changes in the market 
the company uses futures  swaps  and options to reduce price risk and basis risk 
basis is the difference in price between the physical commodity being hedged and the price of the futures contract used for hedging 
basis risk is the risk that an adverse change in the futures market will not be completely offset by an equal and opposite change in the cash price of the commodity being hedged 
basis risk exists in natural gas primarily due to the geographic price differentials between cash market locations and futures contract delivery locations 
the company enters into futures transactions on the new york mercantile exchange and the kansas city board of trade and through otc swaps with creditworthy counterparties consisting primarily of financial institutions and other natural gas companies 
the company conducts its standard credit review of otc counterparties and has agreements with such parties which contain collateral requirements 
otc exposure is marked to market daily for the credit review process 
the company generally uses standardized swap agreements which allow for offset of positive and negative exposures 
gains and losses on hedges of product inventory are included in the carrying amount of the inventory and are ultimately recognized in residue and ngl sales when the related inventory is sold 
gains and losses related to qualifying hedges  as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for futures contracts  of firm commitments or anticipated transactions are recognized in residue and ngl sales when the hedged physical transaction occurs 
the million of losses deferred in inventory at december  were recognized in january and were more than offset by margins from the company s related forward fixed price hedges and physical sales 
as of december   the company held a notional quantity of approximately bcf of natural gas futures  swaps  and options extending from january to february this was comprised of approximately bcf long and bcf short of exchange traded futures and long and short bcf of otc swaps and options 
as of december   the company held a notional quantity of approximately bcf of futures  swaps  and options extending through december this was comprised of approximately bcf long and bcf short of exchange traded futures and long and short bcf of otc swaps and options 
the company enters into speculative futures trades on a very limited basis for purposes which include testing of hedging techniques 
company procedures contain strict guidelines for such trading including predetermined stop loss requirements and net open positions limits currently  a total position of net contracts long or short 
speculative futures positions are marked to market at the end of each accounting period and any gain or loss is recognized in income for that period 
net gains from such speculative activities for the year ended december  were not material 
see further discussion of hedging activities at liquidity and capital resources forward looking information and discussion of other hedging activities at interest rate swaps 
capital investment program between january  and december   the company expended approximately million on new projects and acquisitions 
for the years ended december   and the company expended million  million and million  respectively  on acquisitions  the construction of the katy facility  connection of new reserves  the acquisition of consolidating assets for existing systems and upgrades to existing and newly acquired facilities 
capital expenditures related to existing operations are expected to be approximately million during consisting of the following capital expenditures related to gathering  processing and pipeline assets are expected to be million  of which million will be used for new connects  system expansions and asset consolidations and million for maintaining existing facilities 
the company expects capital expenditures on the katy gas storage facility katy facility  exploration and production activities and miscellaneous items to be million  million and million  respectively 
depending on the timing of the company s future projects  it may be required to seek additional sources of capital 
the company s ability to secure such capital is restricted by its credit facilities  although it may request additional borrowing capacity from the banks  seek waivers from the banks to permit it to borrow funds from third parties  seek replacement credit facilities from other lenders or issue additional equity securities 
while the company believes that it would be able to secure additional financing  if required  no assurance can be given that it will be able to do so or as to the terms of any such financing 
financing facilities revolving credit facility 
the company s variable rate revolving credit facility  as restated on september  and subsequently amended  with a syndicate of eight banks  provides for a maximum borrowing base of million  of which million was outstanding at december  if the facility is not renewed  its commitment period will terminate on october  any outstanding balance thereunder at such time will convert to a three year term loan  which shall be payable in equal quarterly installments  commencing january  the revolving credit facility bears interest  at the company s option  at certain spreads over the eurodollar rate  at the federal funds rate plus  or at the agent bank s prime rate 
the interest rate spreads are adjusted based on the company s debt to capitalization ratio 
at december   the spread was over the eurodollar rate  resulting in an interest rate of 
the company pays a commitment fee on the unused commitment ranging from 
to 
based on the debt to capitalization ratio 
at december   the company s debt to capitalization ratio was 
to resulting in a commitment fee rate of 
term loan facility 
the company also has a term loan facility with four banks for million which bears interest at 
payments on the term loan facility of million are due in september and september  respectively 
the company intends to finance the million payment due in through amounts available under the revolving credit facility 
the agreements governing the company s revolving credit and term loan facilities the credit facilities agreement contain certain mandatory prepayment terms 
if funded debt of the company  which has a final maturity on or before october   exceeds four times to the sum of the company s last four quarters cash flow as defined in the agreement less preferred stock dividends projected to be paid during the next four quarters  the overage must be repaid in no more than six monthly payments  commencing days from notification 
this mandatory prepayment threshold will be reduced to to at september  at december   taking into account all the covenants contained in the credit facilities agreement  the company had approximately million of available borrowing capacity 
the term loan and revolving credit facilities are unsecured 
pursuant to the credit facilities agreement  the company is required to maintain a current ratio as defined therein of at least to  a minimum tangible net worth equal to the sum of million plus of consolidated net income earned after june  plus of the net proceeds received after june  from the sale of equity securities  a debt to capitalization ratio as defined therein of no more than through october  and thereafter  and an ebitda to interest ratio of not less than to through october   to from november  through october  and to thereafter 
the company is prohibited from declaring or paying dividends on or after december  that in the aggregate exceed the sum of million plus of consolidated net income earned after december  plus of the cumulative net proceeds received by the company after december  from the sale of any equity securities 
the dividends declared in the fourth fiscal quarter of  payable in  are excluded from this calculation 
at december   million was available under this limitation  which is sufficient to pay required preferred stock dividends in the company generally utilizes excess daily funds to reduce any outstanding revolving credit balances and associated interest expense and it intends to continue such practice 
the million cash balance at december  is an overnight investment necessitated by the timing of cash receipts 
master shelf agreement 
in december  the company entered into a master shelf agreement the master shelf with the prudential insurance company of america prudential pursuant to which prudential agreed to quote  from time to time  an interest rate at which prudential or its nominee would be willing to purchase up to million of the company s senior promissory notes the master notes 
any such master notes will mature in no more than years  with an average life not in excess of years  and are unsecured 
the master shelf contains certain financial covenants which substantially conform with those contained in the revolving credit facility  as restated and amended 
in july and july  prudential and the company amended the master shelf to provide for additional borrowing capacity for a total borrowing capacity of million and to extend the term of the master shelf to october  the master shelf agreement  as restated and amended  is fully utilized  as indicated in the following table s interest final issue date amount rate maturity principal payments due october   october   each on october  through october   october   each on october  through september   september  single payment at maturity december   december  single payment at maturity october   october  single payment at maturity october   october  single payment at maturity july   july   each on july  through senior notes 
on april  the company sold million of senior notes due to a group of insurance companies 
annual principal payments of million on the senior notes are due on april of each year from through  with any remaining principal and interest outstanding due on april  the senior notes contain certain financial covenants that substantially conform with those contained in the master shelf agreement  as restated and amended 
senior notes 
the company sold million of senior notes to a group of insurance companies in the fourth quarter of  with an interest rate of per annum and principal due in a single payment in december the senior notes contain certain financial covenants that conform with those contained in the master shelf agreement  as restated and amended 
the company used the net proceeds from the sale to reduce borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
receivables facility 
in april  the company entered into an agreement with receivables capital corporation rcc  as purchaser  and bank of america national trust and savings association ba  as agent  pursuant to which the company will sell to rcc at face value on a revolving basis an undivided interest in certain of the company s trade receivables 
as part of the sale  the company granted to rcc a security interest in such receivables 
the company may sell up to million of trade receivables under the receivables facility  at a rate equal to rcc s commercial paper rate plus  of which million was funded at a rate of as of december  the receivables facility has a day term and contains financial covenants similar to those in the credit facilities agreement  as restated and amended  along with certain covenants regarding the quality of the trade receivables pool 
on september   in anticipation of entering into the receivables facility  ba entered in a master note agreement the short term note with the company and advanced the company million at the eurodollar rate plus  which resulted in an interest rate of per annum at june  the company used the million drawn on the receivables facility to repay the short term note  which was then canceled 
covenant compliance 
at december   the company was in compliance with all covenants in its loan agreements 
interest rate swap agreements 
historically  the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to changes in interest rates 
the transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed and floating interest payment obligations or the exchange of foreign and us currencies  without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts 
the net effect of interest rate swap activity is reflected as an increase or decrease in interest expense 
any gains on termination of interest rate swap agreements and the effects of foreign currency positions that were marked to market are included in other income 
at december  and  the total notional principal amount of outstanding interest rate swap agreements was and million  respectively 
in addition to the financial risk  which will vary during the life of these swap agreements in relation to the maturity of the underlying debt and market interest rates  the company is subject to credit risk exposure from nonperformance of the counterparties to the swap agreements 
in anticipation of issuing the senior notes in the fourth quarter of  the company entered into an interest rate lock on a notional amount of million  linked to the ten year us treasury bill rate  with a creditworthy counterparty to hedge against the risk of rising interest rates while it completed the senior notes placement 
at the time the company terminated the rate lock  interest rates had decreased  which resulted in the realization of a  loss 
the company considered the loss to be a cost of obtaining the privately placed debt and is therefore amortizing it over the ten year term of the senior notes 
the following table summarizes the results of the company s interest rate swap and foreign currency positions for each of the three years in the period ended december  s net increase decrease to interest expense  interest rate swap losses capitalized gains on swap termination  losses on foreign currency positions  environmental the construction and operation of the company s gathering lines  plants and other facilities used for the gathering  transporting  processing  treating or storing of residue gas and ngls are subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  including those that can impose obligations to clean up hazardous substances at the company s facilities or at facilities to which the company sends wastes for disposal 
in most instances  the applicable regulatory requirements relate to water and air pollution control or solid waste management procedures 
the company employs six environmental engineers to monitor environmental compliance and potential liabilities at its facilities 
prior to consummating any major acquisition  the company s environmental engineers perform audits on the facilities to be acquired 
in addition  on an ongoing basis  the environmental engineers perform systematic environmental assessments of the company s existing facilities 
the company believes that it is in substantial compliance with applicable material environmental laws and regulations 
environmental regulation can increase the cost of planning  designing  constructing and operating the company s facilities 
the company believes that the costs for compliance with current environmental laws and regulations have not had and will not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operation 
in  the congress enacted the clean air act amendments of the clean air act which impose more stringent standards on emissions of certain pollutants and require the permitting of certain existing air emissions sources 
many of the regulations have not yet been promulgated and until their promulgation  the company cannot make a final assessment of the impact of the clean air act 
however  based upon its preliminary review of the proposed regulations  the company does not anticipate that compliance with the clean air act will require any material capital expenditures  although it will increase permitting costs in and may increase certain operating costs on an ongoing basis 
the company does not believe that such cost increases will have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company believes that it is reasonably likely that the trend in environmental legislation and regulation will continue to be towards stricter standards 
the company is unaware of future environmental standards that are reasonably likely to be adopted that will have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations  but it cannot rule out that possibility 
the company is in the process of voluntarily cleaning up substances at facilities that it operates 
in addition  the former owner of certain facilities that the company acquired in is conducting remediation at those facilities pursuant to contractual obligations 
the company s expenditures for environmental evaluation and remediation at existing facilities have not been significant in relation to the results of operations of the company and totaled approximately million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   the company paid an aggregate of approximately  in air emissions fees to the states in which it operates 
although the company anticipates that such environmental expenses will increase over time  the company does not believe that such increases will have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
forward looking information the company has developed a three part business plan to increase profitability through continued growth of the company s core businesses 
the company plans to expand its marketing activities  acquire or develop gas gathering and processing assets that meet the company s target rates of return and increase the efficiency of its existing facilities 
marketing the company s existing natural gas and ngl marketing was a by product of the company s processing activities and was directed towards selling natural gas and ngls processed at its plants to ensure their efficient operation 
as the company expanded into new basins and the natural gas industry became deregulated  the company began to increase its third party marketing 
the company believes that the knowledge and understanding gained through its gas gathering and processing operations coupled with its understanding of the pipeline network are the basis for its success in marketing natural gas and ngls 
average daily gas sales increased to  mmcf per day and ngl sales increased to  mgal per day for the year ended december  compared to mmcf and mgal  respectively  for the year ended december   a and increase  respectively 
natural gas the company plans to expand its gas marketing by i targeting special needs of end users willing to pay higher margins  ii increasing its use of the katy facility and iii entering the recently deregulated electric power marketing sector 
the company s marketing department has recently been restructured along more specialized lines to include separate managers for national accounts  end use sales and electric power marketing 
in  the company plans to hire four experienced marketers who will primarily be involved in seeking national accounts with companies having multiple facilities throughout the country 
there is no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining such accounts 
the company has also expanded its marketing activity to areas beyond its traditional gas supply centers houston and the gulf coast to demand centers  such as chicago  new york and california 
the katy facility  which commenced operations in february  utilizes a partially depleted natural gas reservoir with bcf of working gas capacity and a pipeline header system  currently connected to eleven pipelines 
the katy facility has the capability to deliver up to mmcf per day of natural gas from the reservoir 
in the first two years of the facility s operation  the company used a majority of the storage for its own account to take advantage of the price differential between summer and winter gas 
as part of its marketing plans  the company intends to increase its long term firm storage agreements with local distribution companies from to up to of the available capacity 
ngls the company s plans for ngl marketing are focused on increasing third party sales 
the company is also pursuing industrial end users of ngls and recently entered into a long term agreement for the sale of approximately two thirds of the propane produced at the granger plant to a mining company through a transporter wholesaler 
in addition  the company plans to spend approximately million in to upgrade certain processing facilities which will allow for production of higher value ngls 
for example  the company is installing a butane splitter at the granger plant which will permit fractionation of field grade butane into normal butane and iso butane  products that receive a premium over the field grade butane 
electric power the company believes that the anticipated deregulation by states of retail power marketing will offer the company significant opportunities to offer both natural gas and electric power to its existing end user customer base and to utilize the company s demonstrated ability in the natural gas sector to respond quickly to changing regulatory and market conditions 
in  the company received a certificate from the ferc to sell electric power at the wholesale level 
the company intends to dedicate six employees to power marketing by the end of the company is in the process of developing the contractual infrastructure necessary to market power and has already put into place blanket transmission agreements with carriers and tolling agreements with power generators to trade natural gas for electric power 
there is no assurance that the retail electric power marketing industry will develop or that the company will be successful if the industry develops 
business development the company s business development activities are oriented towards i identifying and acquiring gas gathering and processing assets and ii obtaining additional gas supplies to maintain or increase throughput levels at the company s existing facilities to offset natural production declines 
historically  the company has expanded primarily through acquisitions 
since december   the company has had a net increase of gas processing plants and has increased its gas gathering system miles by to  miles  resulting in an increase in gas throughput of for the five year period ended december  as part of its business plan  the company will continue to pursue aggressively gas gathering and processing assets which meet the company s target rate of return  with an emphasis on acquisitions that complement its existing operations or provide growth in marketing 
the company s business plan assumes that the company will spend million in each of  and on acquisitions and projects that complement its current asset base 
one of the significant criteria for the company in making acquisitions or entering into development projects is that such transactions have a projected internal rate of return of per year  before income taxes and financing costs  for a year period  although the company will also consider lower return transactions if they provide other opportunities or benefits 
the primary factor affecting internal rates of return is the price of natural gas  which also generally affects the volumes of natural gas produced by both the company and third parties 
other assumptions underlying the company s business plan are that for every million in investment  the company will i spend an additional  in each succeeding year for new well connects and related expansion an aggregate of million per year if the full million is spent and ii incur an additional  in general and administrative costs 
the company believes that the foregoing criteria and assumptions are reasonable under current industry and general economic and market conditions 
however  the company cannot predict the volumes and prices of natural gas and ngls  and actual industry and general economic and market conditions could differ  perhaps significantly  from the conditions that the company has assumed in projecting rates of return for transactions 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the company will identify any qualifying transactions or that it will ultimately be able to acquire assets or enter into such projects 
operations the company continually monitors the economic performance of each of its operating facilities to ensure that it meets a desired cash flow objective 
if an operating facility is not generating desired cash flows or does not fit in with the company s strategic plans  the company will explore various options  such as consolidation with other company owned facilities  dismantlement  asset swap or outright sale 
in  the company sold the waha header and certain non strategic assets acquired in the oasis acquisition and completed the consolidation of its lamont gathering system with the chaney dell system 
the company anticipates completing the salvage of substantially all of the lamont processing plant by the end of the first quarter of in  the company sold its sligo plant  swapped its pyote treating facilities for gathering assets in kansas which were subsequently disposed of during the second quarter of  consolidated assets in the powder river basin and sold its walnut bend gathering system 
the company anticipates that the salvage of the walnut bend processing plant will be substantially completed by the end of the third quarter of commencing in march  the company and its joint venture partner at the lincoln road gas plant temporarily suspended processing operations at that plant and began processing the associated gas at the company s granger facility 
if volumes increase substantially beyond granger s capacity  the lincoln road plant might be re started 
the company anticipates that this consolidation will result in lower overall plant operating expenses for the combined systems 
in january  koch  which operates the teddy roosevelt and williston assets under a lease agreement  exercised its option to purchase certain gas gathering assets located in north dakota from the company and williston
