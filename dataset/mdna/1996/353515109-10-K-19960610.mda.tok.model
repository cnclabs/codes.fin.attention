item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s results of operations during the three fiscal years ended march  have generally been characterized by increased sales  particularly outside the united states 
during this period  the company has benefitted greatly from the improvement in the price performance of ic rom chips 
because ic rom chips are a significant part of the cost of a franklin product  declining semiconductor prices have allowed the company to lower product prices significantly 
another factor enabling the company to reduce its product prices has been the company s cost reduction program 
management believes that lower prices  in turn  have led to marked increases in sales in both unit and dollar terms 
in addition  the introduction of new titles and platforms has contributed significantly to the company s sales growth during this period 
international sales have also exhibited very strong increases over this period due to the reasons mentioned above as well as the company s increased marketing efforts  primarily in france  the united kingdom  canada and australia 
the company expects any sales growth in the future to be driven primarily by the sale of new bookman units and bookman compatible ic rom cartridges  coupled with continued increased international marketing efforts 
as the company continues to introduce new foreign language books  bilingual electronic dictionaries and books targeted at the esl market  management anticipates that the company s international sales will continue to increase as a percentage of total sales 
over the last three fiscal years  the company s gross margins have increased primarily due to the decline in cost of ic rom chips and the company s cost reduction efforts which have enabled the company to lower its product prices  the introduction of new  higher end products which command higher gross margins and increased international sales through subsidiaries in certain foreign markets 
the company expects any improvements in gross margin in the future to be driven largely by shifts in the company s revenue mix toward the more profitable ic rom cartridges for its bookman products and the expansion of its international operations 
operating expenses excluding the effect of certain non operating charges  as a percentage of sales  have remained relatively constant over the last three fiscal years 
the company has gradually increased  and expects to continue to increase  research and development expenditures in an effort to maintain its recent growth rate in sales  however  the company expects its research and development expenses  as a percentage of sales  to remain relatively constant in the near future 
the increase in general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales  is primarily attributable to increased staff and the personnel needed to operate the company s international subsidiaries 
the company anticipates that  as it furthers its strategy of popularizing bookman units  its sales and marketing expenses  as a percentage of sales  will continue to increase 
during the and fiscal years  the company s effective tax rate was minimal due to the realization of net operating loss carryforwards 
however  these net operating loss carryforwards were fully utilized in fiscal accordingly  the company began reporting its earnings on a fully taxed basis 
over the next few years  the company anticipates that it will also commence paying foreign income taxes

inflation and currency transactions inflation has had no significant effect on the operations of the company for the three years ended march  however  competitive pressures and market conditions in the future may limit the company s ability to increase prices to compensate for general inflation or increases in prices charged by suppliers 
the company s operating results may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates

seasonality the christmas selling season october  november and december and the back to school season mid august to mid september are the strongest selling periods for the company s products
