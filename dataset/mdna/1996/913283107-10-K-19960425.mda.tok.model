the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns at various times 
while the semiconductor industry in recent periods has experienced increased demand and constraints in production capacity  it is uncertain how long these conditions will continue 
as a result of these and other factors  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis 
presently  the company s manufacturing facilities are operating at close to full capacity 
in fiscal year  the company is planning to increase its manufacturing capacity through expansion of its production facilities and increased use of third party foundries 
there can be no assurance that the company will complete the expansion of its production facilities on time or that third party foundries will meet the company s production requirements or that the combined capacity will be sufficient to satisfy demand for its products 
any constraints in manufacturing capacity could adversely affect the business of the company s customers and cause them to seek alternative sources for the products currently obtained from the company 
the company s additional capacity will result in a significant increase in operating expenses  such as depreciation  and if revenues do not increase to offset these additional expenses  the company s future operating results could be adversely affected 
meanwhile  other semiconductor manufacturers are also expanding or planning to expand their production capacity over the next several years 
there can be no assurance that the expansion by the company and its competitors will not lead to overcapacity in the company s targeted markets  which could lead to price erosion that could adversely affect the company s operating results
