these statements concern matters that involve risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to those set forth below  that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
in any event  the matters set forth below  as well as the matters set forth under business sales and distribution  competition  proprietary rights  and manufacturing and shipping should be carefully considered when evaluating the company s business and prospects 
macromedia has grown in substantial part from combinations with other companies 
in january  macromedia acquired altsys  which developed the freehand graphic design and illustration product whose revenues prior to that date consisted primarily of royalties from aldus corporation  which had marketed freehand until january  and revenues from fontographer

there can be no assurance that sales of the company s existing products will either continue at historical rates or increase  or that new products introduced by the company  whether developed internally or acquired  will achieve market acceptance 
the company s historical rates of growth should not be taken as indicative of growth rates that can be expected in the future 
the company s quarterly operating results may vary significantly depending on the timing of new product introductions and enhancements by the company 
the company s quarterly results of operations also may vary significantly depending on the timing of product introductions by competitors  changes in pricing  execution of technology licensing agreements  and the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter  which are difficult to forecast 
the future operating results of the company may fluctuate as a result of these and other factors  including the company s ability to continue to develop innovative products  its product and customer mix  and the level of competition 
the company s results of operations may also be affected by seasonal trends 
a significant portion of the company s operating expenses are relatively fixed  and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts 
as a result  if revenues do not meet the company s forecasts  operating results may be materially adversely affected 
although the company has been profitable each quarter since the quarter ended september   there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain profitability in the future 
the markets for the company s products are highly competitive and characterized by pressure to reduce prices  incorporate new features  and accelerate the release of new product versions 
a number of companies currently offer products that compete directly or indirectly with one or more of the company s products 
these companies include adobe  aimtech corporation  apple computer  inc  asymetrix corporation  autodesk  inc  corel corporation corel  microsoft corporation microsoft  and strata incorporated 
as the company competes with larger competitors such as adobe  corel  and microsoft across a broader range of product lines  the company may face increasing competition from such companies 
the developing multimedia market  internet  and online services  and the personal computer industry in general are characterized by rapidly changing technology  resulting in short product life cycles and rapid price declines 
the company must continuously update its existing products to keep them current with changing technology and must develop new products to take advantage of new technologies that could render the company s existing products obsolete 
the company s future prospects are highly dependent on its ability to increase functionality of existing products in a timely manner and to develop new products that address new technologies and achieve market acceptance 
new products and enhancements must keep pace with competitive offerings  adapt to new platforms and emerging industry standards  and provide additional functionality 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in these efforts 
the company has in the past experienced delays in the development of new products and enhancement of existing products  and such delays may occur in the future 
if the company were unable  due to resource constraints or technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce such products in a timely manner  this inability could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
for the twelve months ended march   the company derived approximately of its total revenues from international sales 
the company expects that international sales will continue to generate a significant percentage of its total revenues  and the company is seeking to increase international sales to approximately half of its total revenues 
the company relies on distributors for sales of its products in foreign countries and  accordingly  is dependent on their ability to promote and support the company s products  and in some cases  to translate them into foreign languages 
international business is subject to a number of special risks  including foreign government regulation  general geopolitical risks such as political and economic instability  hostilities with neighboring countries and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  more prevalent software piracy  unexpected changes in  or imposition of  regulatory requirements  tariffs  import and export restrictions and other barriers and restrictions  longer payment cycles  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  potentially adverse tax consequences  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  and other factors beyond the control of the company 
the revenues generated through international sales are denominated in us dollars  but the expenses are denominated in the local currency in the countries in which the company has offices 
as a result  the company s operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
this impact to date has been immaterial  and the company has not had to engage in hedging activities to protect it from foreign currency fluctuations
