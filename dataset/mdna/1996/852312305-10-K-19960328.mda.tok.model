highly competitive industry  technological change competition in the medical device field is intense  and is characterized by extensive research and development and rapid and significant technological change 
although the company believes it is an industry leader with respect to the development of its products  there are a number of companies and or academic institutions that have the financial  technical  marketing and support resources and trade name recognition which make them capable of successfully developing and or marketing products based on similar technologies or approaches as those used in the company s established or new products  or developing products based on other technologies or approaches  which are  or may be  competitive with those used in the company s established or new products  and which could make the company s products obsolete or less competitive
