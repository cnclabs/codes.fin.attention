results of operations during fiscal years   and  the company reported net income of    and  respectively  representing sixteen consecutive profitable quarters 
the company began growing its own lease portfolio during the latter half of fiscal year and continued growing its portfolio during fiscal year see schedule below 
the company intends to continue growing its own lease portfolio 
the changes in the company s equipment under lease during fiscal year consisted of the following in thousands discounted lease direct finance rentals  net of leases  operating discounted lease leases  net and rentals assigned net investment equipment held to lenders arising in lease for sale or re lease from equipment sales portfolio as of may     leases added to the company s lease portfolio a significant portion of which will be sold during fiscal year financed through the use of the company s cash  accounts payable  non recourse bank debt and recourse bank debt under its warehouse facility    leases sold to private investors   related provision for losses change as a result of portfolio run off    as of may     in growing the portfolio discussed above  operating results are subject to fluctuations resulting from several factors  including seasonality of lease originations  variations in the relative percentages of the company s leases entered into during the period which are classified as dfls or ols  or are sold for fee income as well as the level of fee income obtained from the sale of leases in excess of lease equipment cost 
the company will adjust the mix of ols and dfls and volume of leases sold to private investors from time to time  when and as the company determines that it would be in its best interests  taking into account profit opportunities  portfolio concentration and residual risk 
during the four fiscal years preceding fiscal year  leasing revenue and assets declined as a result of the fact that the company used a substantial portion of its cash flow to repay its prior recourse debt facility  and until the company closed the new bank facility in december  the company did not have the funds necessary to significantly add to its leasing portfolio

results of operations  continued however  the company s assets adjusted for accounting gross ups required in accordance with gaap have increased during fiscal years and the company s assets adjusted for accounting gross ups are calculated as follows in thousands may  total assets    less accounting gross ups notes receivable arising from sale leaseback transactions    discounted lease rentals assigned to lenders arising from equipment sale transactions    assets adjusted for accounting gross ups    the gross up asset balances have decreased because the company has not i entered into a sale leaseback transaction since fiscal year or ii added significant discounted lease rentals assigned to lenders arising from equipment sale transactions since fiscal year for further discussion  see footnote to notes to consolidated financial statements 
in the ordinary course of business  the company will continue to sell new lease originations to its pifs to the extent the pifs have funds available for such purpose or private investors and sell seasoned lease transactions previously originated leases held in the company s portfolio to private investors 
presented below is a schedule showing new lease originations volume and the placement of new lease originations by fiscal year in thousands 
year ended may  placement equipment under lease sold to pifs    equipment under lease sold to private investors    leases added to the company s lease portfolio a significant portion of which will be were sold during the subsequent fiscal years   total lease origination volume    leasing is an alternative to financing equipment with debt 
therefore  the ultimate profitability of the company s leasing transactions is dependent  in part  on the general level of interest rates 
lease rates tend to rise and fall with interest rates  although lease rate movements generally lag interest rate movements 
because the company finances its lease transactions with recourse and non recourse debt  the ultimate profitability of leasing transactions is dependent  in part  on the difference between the interest rate inherent in the lease and the underlying debt rate rate spread 
certain of the company s competitors have access to lower cost funds than the company 
however  the company has developed relationships with various private investors and formed various strategic alliances with companies that have a lower cost of capital enabling the company to originate and sell leases at competitive prices

equipment sales to pifs equipment sales to pifs increased during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year principally because more leases were identified and closed as a result of the increased productivity of the field lease originations team see further discussion below 
equipment sales to the pifs were lower during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily because the pifs were more fully leveraged during fiscal year and  therefore  had less available borrowing capacity to acquire additional equipment 
equipment sales to private investors equipment sales to private investors increased during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year principally because more leases were identified and closed as a result of increased productivity of the field lease originations team 
the increased volume of the field lease originators is primarily due to the company s efforts to improve its marketing activities  including focusing on customer relationships and vertical integration ie  the development of specialized equipment and remarketing expertise into material handling equipment 
in this regard  lease originations from one customer relationship comprised of leases of material handling equipment and machine tools accounted for approximately one half of the total lease originations volume for fiscal year of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations i 
results of operations  continued equipment sales  continued equipment sales to private investors  continued equipment sales to private investors margin as a percentage of equipment sales revenue decreased primarily because the company records leasing revenue while it uses its bank facility to hold leases pending sale to private investors 
equipment sales to private investors during fiscal year were less than in the prior year primarily because lease originations identified for sale to private investors were less than the prior year 
remarketing of the portfolio and related provision for losses the company has been successful in realizing gains on the remarketing of its equipment after the initial lease term for the past sixteen consecutive quarters 
the remarketing of equipment for an amount greater than its book value is reported as equipment sales margin if the equipment is sold or as leasing margin if the equipment is re leased 
the realization of less than the carrying value of equipment which is typically not known until remarketing after the expiration of the initial lease term is recorded as provision for losses 
as shown in the tables above  the realizations from sales exceeded the provision for losses for fiscal years  and  even without considering realizations from remarketing activities recorded as leasing margin 
residual values are established equal to the estimated value to be received from the equipment following termination of the lease 
in estimating such values  the company considers all relevant facts regarding the equipment and the lessee  including  for example  the likelihood that the lessee will re lease the equipment 
the nature of the company s leasing activities is that it has credit exposure and residual value exposure and  accordingly  in the ordinary course of business it will incur losses arising from these exposures 
the company performs ongoing quarterly assessments of its assets to identify other than temporary losses in value 
margins from remarketing sales ie  sales occurring after the initial lease term are affected by the number and dollar amount of equipment leases that mature in a particular quarter 
as shown in the table above  because the company sold substantially all new lease originations to its pifs and retained very few lease originations for its own account during the fiscal years preceding fiscal year  and in accordance with gaap  the company does not consolidate the results of its pifs  fewer leases have matured and less equipment has been available for remarketing each quarter since may  for this reason  remarketing revenue and the related margin declined 
remarketing revenue and margin are expected to decline further as maturing leases continue to decrease 
the company s ability to remarket additional amounts of equipment and realize a greater amount of remarketing revenue in future periods is dependent on adding additional leases to its portfolio 
however  adding leases to the company s portfolio will not immediately increase the pool of maturing leases because new leases typically are not remarketed until after their initial term which averages approximately four years 
of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations i 
results of operations  continued remarketing of the portfolio and related provision for losses  continued a summary of the company s fiscal year and allowance for losses follows in thousands fiscal year ended may  balance  at beginning of period   provision for losses  d deduct chargeoffs retained residuals  a  e leased equipment  b  f less litigation settlement recoveries c net chargeoffs   balance  at end of period   the company s policy is to record allowances for losses as soon as any other than temporary declines in asset values are known 
however  chargeoffs are recorded upon the termination or remarketing of the underlying assets 
as such  chargeoffs will primarily occur subsequent to the recording of the allowances for losses 
the majority of fiscal year chargeoffs were related to allowances for losses recorded in prior periods 
in addition  fiscal year chargeoffs included the following significant activity a approximately  to write down the carrying value of certain retained residuals to fair market value based upon current third party quotes and  to write down the carrying value of a helicopter retained residual to fair market value due to the passage of time without remarketing prospects 
b approximately  for equipment originally expected to remain with the lessee upon lease termination which the company now believes will be returned and  related to the sale for million of a note receivable on a jet aircraft with a million carrying value 
the company recently determined that it would be in its best interest to sell this note receivable and reinvest the proceeds in another income producing asset or assets 
the company had originally anticipated that it would hold the related note to term  in which case the company would have received the full carrying value of the aircraft 
c related to a settlement of litigation involving equipment with approximately million of net book value see footnote to notes to consolidated financial statements 
of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations i 
results of operations  continued remarketing of the portfolio and related provision for losses  continued the majority of fiscal year chargeoffs were also related to allowances for losses recorded in prior years 
in addition  fiscal year chargeoffs included the following significant activity d  for litigation involving equipment with a net book value of approximately million see footnote to notes to consolidated financial statements and  for litigation with another lessee 
remainder discussed in e and f below 
e approximately  to write down the carrying value of ibm equipment retained residuals to fair market value based upon current third party quotes 
in prior years  the company and one of its pifs have suffered substantial losses with respect to ibm equipment 
f approximately  for equipment originally expected to remain with the lessee upon lease termination which was returned to the company and  to write down the carrying value of one of the company s aircraft to fair market value because of the deteriorating financial condition of the lessee 
mbank sale proceeds the parties in the mbank litigation settled their claims to the cash collateral for the original mbank lease and the company received approximately million including million the company has agreed to refund to bankone  texas na the company recorded million in equipment sales margin from the mbank sale ie  net proceeds of approximately million less a carrying value of approximately million 
on september   the company deposited the million of the settlement that it had agreed to refund to bankone in an escrow account included in cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets pending resolution of on going claims 
for a discussion of this matter  see footnote to notes to consolidated financial statements 
leasing margin leasing margin consists of the following in thousands fiscal years ended may  leasing revenue    leasing costs and expenses    net non recourse interest expense on related discounted lease rentals   leasing margin    leasing margin ratio of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations i 
result of operations  continued leasing margin  continued the increase in leasing revenue  leasing costs and expenses and leasing margin during fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year  was primarily due to growth in the company s lease portfolio 
these revenue and expense amounts are expected to increase further as the company continues to grow its lease portfolio 
net interest expense on discounted lease rentals ie  leases funded with non recourse debt did not grow proportionately because the company is using its bank facility to finance certain leases held for its own account and leases held pending sale to the pifs and private investors 
leasing margin and related leasing revenue and costs and expenses decreased during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily for the reasons discussed above under remarketing of the portfolio and related provision for losses 
other income other income consists of the following in thousands fiscal years ended may  fees and distributions from the company sponsored pifs    gain on sale of the investment in corporate express  inc stock cancellation of option agreement to acquire certain mining equipment interest on income tax refunds interest on mbank settlement and hold back recovery of sales and property tax amounts previously expensed other operating and other expenses operating and other expenses decreased million for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the decrease included i million of capitalized initial direct costs due to lease origination volume  ii  related to on going efforts to minimize costs  and iii a  reimbursement to the company from its pifs for insurance costs related to prior fiscal years 
the decrease also included the following significant expense reductions  of legal fees primarily related to the mbank litigation and the hemmeter litigation 
 of warehouse and other lease portfolio and asset management costs 
 of current insurance costs 
 difference between estimated fiscal year incentive compensation and actual payments as modified by the company s board of directors 
 of costs associated with the company s prior recourse debt facility 
operating and other expenses decreased approximately million for fiscal year compared to fiscal year due to on going efforts to minimize costs 
of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations i 
result of operations  continued employee stock option buyout effective on may   the company purchased a portion of outstanding employee stock options in order to make options outstanding as a percentage of shares outstanding consistent with that of other companies 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the employee stock option buyout 
termination of stockholders agreement expense see note to notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the termination of the stockholders agreement  the termination of the company s obligation to continue to make premium payments on certain key man life insurance policies and the payments the company received from the two stockholders to whom the policies were assigned 
interest income and expense interest income arises when equipment financed with non recourse debt is sold to investors 
the accompanying consolidated statements of income reflect an equal amount of non recourse interest expense 
the decline in interest income and the related non recourse interest expense is due to a decline in the average outstanding balance of non recourse debt with respect to equipment sold to investors 
net non recourse interest expense on related discounted lease rentals decreased due to a decrease in the average outstanding balance of related discounted lease rentals 
however  it is anticipated that net non recourse interest expense on related discounted lease rentals will increase in the future as the company adds additional leases financed with non recourse debt to its portfolio 
recourse interest expense increased during fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year as discussed above  the company is financing more lease originations with its bank facility 
income taxes as shown in the table in note to notes to the consolidated financial statements  the company s significant deferred tax assets consist of an itc carryforward of million which expires from through and alternative minimum tax amt credits of million which are not subject to expiration 
these tax assets are available to offset federal income tax liability 
however  the amount of itc and amt credit carryforward that may be utilized to reduce tax liability is significantly limited due to the computation of amt liability 
as a result of this limitation on the itc carryforward  the company has established a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reflect the uncertainty that the itc carryforward will be fully utilized prior to expiration 
during fiscal years and  the valuation allowance was reduced by  and  respectively  to reflect utilization of itc carryforward for which a valuation allowance had previously been provided 
income tax expense is provided on income at the appropriate statutory rates applicable to such earnings 
the appropriate statutory federal and state income tax rate for fiscal years  and was 
adjustments to the valuation allowance are recognized as a separate component of the provision for income tax expense 
consequently  the actual income tax rate for fiscal years and was less than the effective rate of primarily due to the reduction in the valuation allowance 
of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations i 
result of operations  continued income taxes  continued as discussed in note to notes to consolidated financial statements  a transaction was completed in which the company s largest shareholder obtained more than fifty percent of the ownership and voting rights of the company within a three year period a change in control 
upon a change in control  provisions of the internal revenue code limit the amount of itc carryforwards and amt carryforwards that could be utilized to reduce income tax liability in any year 
however  the company had previously established a valuation allowance for deferred taxes due to uncertainty that the full amount of the itc carryforward would be utilized prior to expiration and therefore  the change in control and any resulting limitation on the itc and amt carryforward is not expected to reduce the recoverability of the amount of the deferred income tax assets  net of the valuation allowance 
ii 
liquidity and capital resources the company s activities are principally funded by proceeds from sales of on lease equipment to its pifs and private investors  non recourse debt  recourse bank debt see note to notes to consolidated financial statements  rents  fees and distributions from its pifs  sales or re leases of equipment after the expiration of the initial lease terms and other cash receipts from non recurring items such as settlements of legal proceedings 
management believes the company s ability to generate cash from operations is sufficient to fund operations  as shown in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows 
on august   the company received million in settlement of its claims in the mbank litigation which was included in net cash from operating activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows 
on september   the company deposited million of the settlement proceeds in an escrow account with norwest bank  na  pending resolution of bank one s ongoing claims to the mbank equipment 
the company used the balance of the settlement proceeds  ie  million less million of income taxes  to paydown the working capital facility and warehouse facility components of its bank facility 
for a discussion of this matter  see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s bank facility  which was scheduled to mature on january   has been extended  without material changes  through november  during july  the company and certain of its pifs entered into an agreement with a lender to finance up to million of lease receivables as part of a lease securitization program 
under this program  the company s financing obligations are collateralized by the leased equipment and related rentals  and the company has no recourse liability to the lender for repayment of the debt 
in addition  this securitized debt vehicle provides an attractive interest rate 
aggregate closings through may  were million for the company and its pifs 
the company completed the offering of units of its sixth pif  cpyf iii  for sale to the public in april during fiscal year  the company sold a total of million of class a units of cpyf iii bringing total sales of class a units of cpyf iii to million  the maximum offering amount 
the company began offering units of a succeeding program  cpyf iv  for sale during april during fiscal year  the company has up to million of class a units in cpyf iv available for sale  which will represent a source of liquidity and acquisition fee income for the company 
three of the company s pifs  including cpyf iv  are using a portion of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ii 
liquidity and capital resources  continued of their available cash to purchase additional equipment from the company 
the company expects to sell approximately million of equipment to these pifs during fiscal year four of the company s pifs are in their liquidation stage and are no longer purchasing material amounts of equipment 
inflation has not had a significant impact upon the operations of the company 
iii 
business plan the company believes that it has the necessary funding capability for fiscal year to continue to build its lease origination function and increase its lease origination volume by expanding its field sales force and by marketing its ability to customize products that meet customer needs  continue to modestly increase the size of its own lease portfolio  originate acquire additional leases for sales to pifs and private investors and build and strengthen its residual remarketing expertise in identified equipment types such as material handling equipment by vertical integration of individuals or companies with requisite equipment expertise 
the company s operating results may be affected by the availability of additional sources of capital and the related costs of such capital 
the cost of funds for many of the company s competitors is lower than the company s cost of funds 
therefore  the company has expanded its debt and equity placement capabilities with lower cost of capital sources including private investors  private partnerships  a private income fund with an off shore investor and other strategic alliances 
these funding sources should provide funds at a cost necessary to facilitate the company s competitiveness in the lease originations market
