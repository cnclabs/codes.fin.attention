item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company derives its revenues primarily from the sale of semiconductor products falling into two main groups  dsp circuits and sram circuits 
the revenue and gross margin contributed by each of the products making up these groups are subject to i availability of such product from the wafer foundry producing it  ii market demand for the product  iii average selling price for the product and iv costs of production 
the company s net revenues  gross margin  operating income and net income can depend upon the success of one or a small number of its products in any given accounting period 
the company believes that in the future its net revenues and operating results may change from period to period depending upon the success of new product introductions  the timing of large orders  and other cyclical factors affecting the semiconductor industry in general 
the company has derived revenues from technology licensing fees  but does not expect such fees to be a significant portion of revenues in the future 
the company believes that relationships with silicon wafer suppliers can provide it with reliable sources of wafers while sparing the company the substantial investment in capital equipment required to establish a wafer fabrication facility 
during and again in  the company was unable to receive adequate supplies of processed wafers conforming to the company s quality standards from its then foundry suppliers  and accordingly  the company s business and relationships with its customers were adversely affected 
see business background 
the company works closely with the foundries in order to take advantage of their processing capabilities and continues to explore and develop additional foundry relationships in order to minimize its dependence on any single relationship 
see business wafer fabrication technology 
the company s in house production capabilities consist of wafer testing  package marking  hot and cold testing  assembled product testing  final inspection  and quality reliability screening 
these production activities are included as cost components in the company s cost of sales 
the company began subcontracting its assembly operations in as a means for further cost savings and more efficient operations 
the company historically has maintained high levels of inventory in recognition of the economics of having relatively small amounts of product processed by third party suppliers and in order to protect against disruptions in supplies 
the company believes that it presently maintains a level of inventory appropriate to its business 
it is the company s policy to provide reserves for any product material that is over one year old with no back log or sales activity  and to book reserves for future obsolescence 
the company expects to continue to make substantial commitments to research and development of new products and to improve existing products 
the company introduced new products in in addition to the catalog products currently offered  the company began the development of additional products which are expected to be introduced in the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage of net revenues rounded to the nearest whole percent represented by certain items of the company s consolidated statements of income year ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations interest expense  net income before income taxes income taxes net income results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net revenues for the year ended december  were  a increase over the  in the year ended december  the increase was due to the increased demand for and availability of the company s products during sales of the company s sram products increased substantially over the former period  as the company was able to support a portion of the heavy demand for the company s sram product experienced mid with a limited amount of wafer material

such after tax cash earnings  in   in  and  in have served as the company s primary source of financing for working capital needs and for capital expenditures during these years 
during  the company s after tax cash earnings provided funding for increases of  in inventories   of accounts receivable and  in net other resulting in net cash used by operations of  capital equipment expenditures and increases to other assets used  net in cash 
the company completed three private placements of securities during the period which provided  in net cash

the company was also provided with cash flow from the exercise of certain warrants and employee stock options which provided  in cash flow for the period

working capital the company s investment in inventories and accounts receivable has been significant and will continue to be significant in the future 
over prior periods  the company as a nature of its business  has maintained these levels of inventories and accounts receivable 
the company relies on third party suppliers for raw materials and as a result maintains substantial inventory levels to protect against disruption in supplies 
the company has historically maintained inventory levels from approximately days to days  since the low point in inventory levels came in and when the company had supply disruptions from one of its major suppliers 
the company  looks at its inventories in relationship to its sales which have ranged from days to days within the periods between and this inventory to sales ratio is a more stable measure of inventory levels  versus the traditional inventory turnover measure because  at the times when the company is experiencing supply disruptions  and therefore lower inventory levels  the company is also experiencing increased costs of goods due to inefficiencies in its operations stemming from sporadic deliveries which skews the numerator and denominator in different directions for inventory turns calculations 
the lowest days on hand of inventory to sales has been experienced when the company has had supply disruptions as in and the company provides reserves for any product material that is over one year old with no back log or sales activity  and reserves for future obsolescence 
the company also takes physical inventory write downs for obsolescence 
for the year ended december   the company took physical inventory write downs of approximately  the company s accounts receivable level has been consistently correlated to the company s previous quarter revenue level 
because of the company s customer scheduled backlog requirements  up to of the quarterly revenues are shipped in the last month of the quarter 
this has the effect of placing a large portion of the quarterly shipments reflected in accounts receivable still not yet due per the company s net day terms 
this  combined with the fact that the company s distributor customers which make up of the company revenues generally pay days and beyond  results in the accounts receivable balance at the end of the quarterly period being at its highest point for the period 
this has been consistent over prior periods 
although current levels of inventory and accounts receivable impact the company s liquidity  the company believes that it is a cost of doing business given the company s fabless operation 
the company is in the process of diversifying its supplier base to reduce the risk of supply disruption 
however  this will require a significant investment in product development to tooling with new suppliers 
the company believes that as it expands its customer base it will be able to even out the flow of its shipments within its quarterly reporting periods

in  the company established an esop and borrowed  from a bank and loaned the proceeds to the esop on the same terms and conditions as its loan from the bank 
the company made monthly contributions to the esop in order that the esop could make principal and interest payments on its debt obligations to the company 
the loan was fully retired in july of the loan was secured by the shares of the company s common stock purchased by the esop 
in  the company terminated the esop 
at the termination date   shares of common stock were vested  and the company is in the process of distributing the shares to eligible participants 
the company filed a registration statement under the securities act to register the shares being distributed 
following the distribution of the shares held by the esop  the distributees will be free to sell such shares without restriction 
on april   the company acquired certain assets from star semiconductor corp  including patents  processes and technology regarding a proprietary stream processor sproc which is a programmable dsp architecture that offers a significant performance advantage in data flow signal processing applications 
such assets were acquired in return for  shares of the company s common stock 
these shares were registered under the securities act in october warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock had been issued in connection with an extension of the shareholder loan under a loan extension and warrant purchase agreement entered into in march warrants to purchase  shares were exercised during the year ended december  and warrants to purchase  were exercised in february of the exercise price of the warrants was per share 
on february   the non employee directors of the company were granted warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
the grants were ratified by shareholders of the company at the company s annual meeting of shareholders held june  the warrants have an exercise price of per share  which was the last reported transaction price of the common stock on february   and expire on february  certain other warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock were issued by the company in connection with two of the private placements described above 
under one transaction  the warrant gives the holders the right to purchase from the company up to  shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to per share the last reported transaction price on august
