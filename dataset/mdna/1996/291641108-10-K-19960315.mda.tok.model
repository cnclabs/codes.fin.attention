item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations operating revenues and kilowatt hour sales of the company s total electric operating revenues during  approximately were from residential customers  from commercial  from industrial and from wholesale on system customers 
the remainder of such revenues was derived from miscellaneous sources 
the percentage changes from the prior year in kilowatt hour kwh sales and revenue by major customer class were as follows kwh sales revenues residential commercial industrial wholesale on system residential kwh sales and revenue increased during  due primarily to the effect of significantly warmer summer temperatures experienced during compared to the mild summer weather in a return to more normal winter temperatures during december  after extremely mild weather experienced during december  also contributed to increased residential sales and revenue during the year 
an increase of in the average number of residential customers served compared to the year ago period further contributed to the increased sales and revenues experienced during residential revenues were also positively affected by the missouri rate case described below 
commercial kwh sales and revenue increased during reflecting primarily warmer than normal summer temperatures  a return to normal winter temperatures during december  and an increase of in the average number of commercial customers 
during  both commercial and industrial kwh sales and related revenues were positively impacted by continuing increases in business activity throughout the company s service territory 
commercial and industrial revenues were also positively affected by the missouri rate case discussed below 
the company s residential  commercial and industrial revenues all increased by a greater percentage than the increase in kwh sales would indicate due mainly to the effect of electric rate increases 
in addition  a restructuring of the company s rates in connection with the missouri electric rate case resulted in a greater overall rate increase for the company s residential customers than for its commercial and industrial customers  and in the shifting of revenue from winter billing periods to summer billing periods 
on system wholesale kwh sales were up during due primarily to the weather conditions discussed above 
revenues associated with these kwh sales increased at a lower relative amount due to the operation of the fuel adjustment clause applicable to such ferc regulated sales 
kwh sales to  and related revenues from  the company s residential customers were up during  due primarily to an increase in the average number of customers served 
the level of customer growth more than offset the effect of mild summer weather experienced during commercial and industrial kwh sales and revenue for that year were positively impacted by continuing increases in business activity throughout the company s service territory  particularly in the branson  missouri area 
revenues from on system wholesale kwh sales were up slightly during due primarily to the operation of the ferc fuel adjustment clause 
the following table sets forth information regarding electric rate increases affecting the revenue comparisons discussed above percent date increase date increase increase jurisdiction requested requested effective granted granted missouri   missouri   oklahoma   kansas   the company s future revenues from the sale of electricity will continue to be affected by economic conditions  business activities  competition  weather  regulation  changes in electric rate levels and changing patterns of electric energy use by customers 
inflation affects the company s operations in that historical costs rather than current replacement costs are recovered in the company s rates 
off system transactions in addition to sales to its own customers  the company also sells power to other utilities as available and also provides transmission service through its system for transactions between other energy suppliers 
during  income from such off system transactions exceeded related expenses by approximately million  compared with approximately million during both and the increase in income from off system transactions during was due primarily to an increase in revenue from transmission service transactions through the western systems power pool 
operating revenue deductions during  total operating and maintenance expenses increased approximately million million  or  exclusive of the one time charge discussed below relating to the company s voluntary early retirement program compared to levels 
total fuel costs were up approximately million during compared to the prior year 
during  the company substantially increased its generation from its higher cost  gas fired combustion turbine units following completion of the conversion of the company s energy center to utilize gas as a primary fuel  as well as the commercial availability of the company s new state line power plant 
partially offsetting such increases were more favorable prices experienced by the company during for both natural gas and iatan coal 
purchased power costs were up approximately million during the company supplements its own generating capacity with purchases of capacity and energy from neighboring utilities in order to meet the demands of its customers and the capacity margins applicable to it under the mokan power pool agreement 
during  such purchases were higher due to increased customer demand 
other operating expenses increased approximately million during compared to levels  due primarily to higher general and administrative costs 
during the third quarter of  the company incurred a one time pre tax charge of approximately million related to the implementation and acceptance by qualifying employees of an enhanced voluntary early retirement program 
costs associated with the proceedings relating to the proposed purchase of energy from ahlstrom development corporation and the competitive positioning process cpp other than the voluntary early retirement program  discussed further under competition below  totaled approximately million during the year 
the remainder of the increase in other operating expenses was due to additional costs related to implementation of fas  increased work on the company s distribution system and increased customer accounts expenses 
maintenance and repair expense increased approximately million during compared to prior year levels  due primarily to increased maintenance performed on the company s riverton and asbury generating units as well as increased maintenance on the company s distribution system resulting in part from the system s growing size 
in addition  the company s riverton unit no 
underwent an extended outage to remove cracks in the turbine rotor shaft during the second quarter of the total cost of the repair and the related inspection was approximately million 
further  more maintenance was performed during the scheduled spring maintenance outage at the company s asbury plant during the second quarter of than was performed during the spring outage 
depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately million during the year due to increased levels of plant and equipment placed in service  particularly at the company s state line power plant 
total income taxes decreased slightly during due primarily to lower taxable income during the current period 
see note of notes to financial statements for additional information regarding income taxes 
other taxes were up approximately million during the year reflecting increased property tax rates  higher levels of plant in service and increased franchise taxes relating to higher revenues 
during total operating and maintenance expenses were higher compared to levels primarily due to increased purchased power costs  which were up due to an increase of megawatts in capacity purchases during the year 
fuel costs were up during compared to the prior year primarily due to increased fuel generated kwhs to meet greater customer demand 
fuel costs did not increase at the same rate as kwhs generated  primarily because of a increase in generation at the jointly owned iatan plant  one of the company s lowest cost generating units 
this increase more than offset the effects of a slight decrease in generation at the asbury plant and higher fuel costs incurred during increased usage of higher cost units 
other operating and maintenance expenses were virtually level with prior year amounts 
depreciation and amortization expense increased due to the additional plant and equipment placed in service 
total income taxes increased due primarily to higher taxable income  while other taxes were up reflecting increased property tax rates  higher levels of plant in service and increased franchise taxes relating to higher revenues 
nonoperating items total allowance for funds used during construction afudc amounted to approximately of earnings applicable to common stock during  during and during the significantly increased level of afudc during and over prior year levels reflects a higher level of construction work in progress  particularly due to construction of the state line power plant  as well as higher rates for afudc determined in accordance with formulas prescribed by the ferc 
see note of notes to financial statements for more discussion of afudc 
interest income increased during compared to prior year levels reflecting higher rates of interest earned on investments and the temporary investment of the proceeds from the company s issuance of a new series of first mortgage bonds prior to the redemption of another series of first mortgage bonds 
interest charges on first mortgage bonds increased compared to the prior year due to additional issuances of the company s first mortgage bonds 
other interest charges were down during the year due to decreased levels of short term borrowing 
competition federal regulation  such as the national energy policy act of the energy act and that proposed by ferc s march notice of proposed rulemaking nopr are expected to promote competition in the electric utility industry 
the energy act  among other things  eases restrictions on independent power producers  delegates authority to the ferc to order wholesale wheeling and grants individual states the power to order retail wheeling 
at this time  none of the states in which the company operates has taken any such action 
the rules proposed in the nopr  if adopted  would require utilities providing transmission service under ferc jurisdiction to establish nondiscriminatory open access transmission tariffs and make them available to all wholesale buyers and sellers  offer transmission service comparable to service they provide themselves  and take transmission service under the same tariffs offered to other buyers and sellers 
the ferc has stated that it intends to allow utilities to recover their investment in transmission facilities 
in addition  under the public utility regulatory policy act of  the company is required to purchase energy from a qualifying facility qf if the qf can sell the energy at a price equal to or less than the company s avoided cost as reasonably determined by the company of generating the energy or acquiring it elsewhere 
by report and order issued november   effective november   the missouri commission dismissed a complaint by ahlstrom development corporation and cottonwood energy partners  lp  collectively ahlstrom which was filed with the missouri commission on august  that complaint had requested that the missouri commission require the company to purchase megawatts of power from ahlstrom s proposed jayhawk energy center waste coal project  which ahlstrom claimed to be a qf  beginning in the year on december   the kansas corporation commission dismissed a similar complaint filed by ahlstrom 
the company s analysis indicated that more economical sources of power are available  such as the western resources agreement 
several factors exist which may enhance the company s ability to compete as deregulation occurs 
the company is able to generate and purchase power relatively cheaply  during  the company s retail rates were approximately less than the electric industry average 
in addition  only of the company s electric operating revenues are derived from sales to on system wholesale customers  the type of customer for which ferc is already requiring wheeling 
at the same time  the company could face increased competitive pressure as a result of its reliance on relatively large amounts of purchased power and its extensive interconnections with neighboring utilities 
in response to the changing competitive environment that it now faces  the company in initiated and completed the cpp  to maximize efficiency and effectiveness in providing service 
as part of the cpp  the company has redesigned its organizational structure 
further  the company has reduced planned construction expenditures and entered into an agreement with western resources for purchased power to reduce the uncertainty of owning new plants 
in addition  the company implemented an enhanced voluntary early retirement program which was accepted by of eligible employees and resulted in a pre tax charge of approximately million 
earnings earnings per share of common stock were during compared to in increased revenues resulting from weather conditions conducive to increased kwh sales  continued customer growth and the rate increases received in missouri  kansas and oklahoma were largely offset by increased operating expenses and the one time charge related to the enhanced voluntary early retirement program discussed above which reduced earnings by approximately per share 
earnings per share also reflect increased first mortgage bond interest  resulting from greater levels of first mortgage bonds outstanding  increased preferred stock dividend requirements resulting from the company s issuance of preferred stock in a public offering in june and the company s issuance of  shares of common stock in april earnings per share of common stock were during compared to in the increase in earnings reflects rate increases received in missouri  kansas and oklahoma combined with the effect of continued customer growth 
these increases were offset in part by increased fuel and purchased power costs  and by increased preferred stock dividend requirements resulting from the company s issuance of preferred stock in a public offering in june liquidity and capital resources the company s construction related expenditures totaled approximately million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
approximately million of construction expenditures during were related to the construction of unit no 
at the state line power plant  which was placed in service on may  initial expenditures for the construction of a second megawatt combustion turbine unit at that site totaled approximately million during unit no 
is scheduled for completion in mid  at a total projected cost of approximately million 
additions to the company s transmission and distribution systems to meet projected increases in customer demand constituted the majority of the remainder of construction expenditures during approximately one half of construction expenditures and other funds requirements for were satisfied internally from operations  the remainder was provided from public offerings of the company s common stock and first mortgage bonds  the issuance of commercial paper  and from the sale of common stock through the company s dividend reinvestment plan and employee stock purchase plan 
the company estimates that its construction expenditures will total approximately million in  million in and million in of these amounts  the company anticipates that it will spend million  million and million in  and  respectively  for additions to the company s distribution system to meet projected increases in customer demand 
also included are expenditures of million and million anticipated in and  respectively  for new generating facilities 
the company estimates that internally generated funds will provide approximately one half of the funds required between and for estimated construction expenditures 
as in the past  the company intends to utilize short term debt to finance the additional amounts needed for such construction and repay such borrowings with the proceeds of sales of public offerings of long term debt or equity securities  including the sale of the company s common stock pursuant to its dividend reinvestment plan and employee stock purchase plan and from internally generated funds 
subject to market and other conditions  the company currently plans to issue common stock during the second quarter of and may issue first mortgage bonds later in the year 
the company will continue to utilize short term debt as needed to support normal operations or other temporary requirements
