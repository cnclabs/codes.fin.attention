business review weatherford enterra is a diversified international energy service and manufacturing company that provides a variety of services and equipment to the exploration  production and transmission sectors of the oil and gas industry 
the company s principal business segments are oilfield services  energy products and services  gas compression and pipeline services 
weatherford enterra operates in virtually every oil and gas exploration and production region in the world  with more than locations in countries 
in  the company s management implemented a business strategy focused on offering a broader mix of services and products in domestic and international markets  becoming a leading participant in each of its core businesses and pursuing cost efficiencies in its existing operations and its newly acquired businesses 
management has pursued this strategy through a series of acquisitions  having acquired businesses since november as a result of these acquisitions  management believes it has positioned the company as a market leader in its oilfield services  gas compression and pipeline services segments and in certain businesses included in its energy products and services segment 
the acquisitions have allowed the company to expand its product and service lines  improve its worldwide market position and realize significant consolidation cost savings 
on october   the company completed the enterra merger  which represents the company s most significant business combination to date 
management believes that the enterra merger strengthens the company s position as the worldwide leader in the rental and fishing tool services business 
in addition  the enterra merger adds gas compression  pipeline services and several additional energy product and service businesses to the company 
in connection with the enterra merger  the company effected a one for two reverse stock split and changed its name to weatherford enterra  inc in this report  all per share amounts and numbers of shares of common stock have been restated to reflect the reverse stock split 
weatherford issued approximately  shares of common stock in exchange for all the outstanding shares of enterra common stock based on an exchange ratio of of a share of weatherford common stock for each share of enterra common stock outstanding 
the enterra merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
accordingly  the consolidated financial statements have been restated for all periods presented to include the accounts and results of operations of enterra with those of weatherford  as if the two companies had been combined since inception 
on december   the company acquired substantially all of the assets of energy industries  a natural gas compression business complementary to the company s gas compression business  for approximately  in cash  subject to adjustment  and the assumption of certain liabilities totaling approximately  the results of the energy industries operations are included in the accompanying financial statements since the date of acquisition 
management believes that the company will achieve operating efficiencies and annualized consolidation cost savings in excess of  after combining the operations of weatherford  enterra and energy industries  and that most of the cost saving measures will be in place by the summer of on august   enterra entered the gas compression business and several energy products businesses through its acquisition of the outstanding common stock of total energy services company total energy in exchange for shares of enterra common stock valued  in the aggregate  at  enterra also acquired the minority interests in two total energy subsidiaries for  in cash  paid transaction costs and employment related obligations totaling approximately  and assumed total energy s long term debt of  other significant acquisitions within the past three years  all made by weatherford  include the september merger with h h oil tool co  inc h h which was accounted for as a pooling of interests  the april acquisition of the rental division of odfjell drilling and consulting company odfjell rental for  and the assumption of certain contractual rights and obligations and the april acquisition of substantially all of the assets of homco international  inc and its subsidiaries collectively  homco for  in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities totaling approximately  the results of the odfjell rental and homco operations are included in the accompanying financial statements since the date of their respective acquisition

the increased indebtedness primarily related to the acquisitions of energy industries in december  total energy in august  odfjell rental in april and homco in april income taxes 
the income tax provision benefit consists of taxes on foreign earnings  foreign taxes withheld on certain remittances from international subsidiaries  us alternative minimum and state taxes and the recognition of deferred tax credits relating to financial statement losses that are not currently deductible for tax purposes 
the income tax provision does not include us regular federal income tax due to the availability of us net operating loss carryforwards 
income tax provision benefit as a percentage of income loss before income taxes and minority interests was  and for  and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rates was primarily a result of differences in the components and tax rates applicable to foreign taxable income  and a result of nondeductible goodwill amortization related to the total energy acquisition 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  the company s operations provided cash of  during compared to  during and  in operating cash flow before changes in working capital accounts increased to  in over and to  in compared to  reflecting the impact of the acquisitions and growth in the company s operations 
changes in working capital and other operating accounts used cash of  during compared to  in and  in working capital of  at december  increased  from december   primarily due to the energy industries acquisition  and december  working capital of  increased  from december  as a result of the acquisition of total energy 
capital expenditures  excluding business acquisitions  decreased to  in compared to  in  reflecting lower capital spending in the oilfield services segment due to the consolidation of the weatherford and enterra rental and service equipment inventories which was partially offset by the capital requirements of the total energy operations acquired in august capital expenditures  excluding business acquisitions  increased in to  primarily to support the growth of the company s operations resulting from the acquisitions of total energy  odfjell rental  h h  homco and other businesses 
management anticipates that the company s capital spending levels will continue to be primarily influenced by market opportunities and growth in the company s operations 
in addition to the enterra and h h mergers and the acquisitions of energy industries  total energy  odfjell rental and homco  the company has made several other acquisitions  principally in its oilfield services and energy products and services segments 
the total cash consideration paid in connection with these acquisitions  net of cash acquired and notes issued  was   and  in  and  respectively 
the company s consolidated indebtedness increased to  at december  from  at december   primarily as a result of debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of energy industries 
the company s total debt to total capitalization ratio was at december  compared to at december in connection with the enterra merger  the company entered into new bank credit facilities the facilities consisting of a  term loan the term loan and a  revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility 
the facilities replaced the previous primary bank credit facilities of weatherford and enterra 
the term loan is payable in equal quarterly installments commencing march  the revolving credit facility matures on september  amounts outstanding under the facilities accrue interest at a variable rate ranging from to above a specified eurodollar rate  depending on the company s total debt to total capitalization ratio 
the applicable interest rate on amounts outstanding at december  was 
a commitment fee ranging from to per annum  depending on the company s total debt to total capitalization ratio  is payable quarterly on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility 
the facilities agreement requires that the company maintain certain financial ratios and limits the company s ability to incur indebtedness  make investments and dispose of assets 
at december   the balances outstanding under the term loan and the revolving credit facility were  and  respectively  and the company had  available to borrow under the revolving credit facility 
subsequent to december   the company has repaid  of the balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
in addition  at december   the company had  available for borrowing under working capital facilities of certain of its international subsidiaries 
the company also has various credit facilities available only for stand by letters of credit and bid and performance bonds  pursuant to which funds are available to the company to secure performance obligations and certain retrospective premium adjustments under insurance policies 
the company had a total of  of letters of credit and bid and performance bonds outstanding at december  the company conducts a portion of its business in currencies other than the us dollar  including the canadian dollar  the german mark  the us pound sterling  the norwegian krone  certain latin american currencies and the italian lira 
although most of the revenues of the company s foreign operations are denominated in the local currency  the effects of foreign currency fluctuations are largely mitigated because local expenses of such foreign operations also generally are denominated in the same currency 
as a result of a weaker us dollar  the weighted average currency exchange rates used to translate the statements of income of the company s international subsidiaries were generally lower during and compared to  thereby increasing the amount of us dollars reflected on the company s and consolidated statements of income 
had the average exchange rates in and been the same as in  revenues for would have been approximately  lower and revenues for would have been virtually unchanged 
the impact on net income would not have been material 
the company occasionally enters into forward exchange contracts only as a hedge against certain existing economic exposures  and not for speculative or trading purposes 
these contracts reduce exposure to currency movements affecting existing assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies  such exposure resulting primarily from trade receivables and payables and intercompany loans 
the future value of these contracts and the related currency positions are subject to offsetting market risk resulting from foreign currency exchange rate volatility 
settlement of forward exchange contracts resulted in net cash outflows totaling  and  during and  respectively 
the company entered into no forward exchange contracts during the company has entered into a letter of understanding with and currently is engaged in negotiations relating to the possible acquisition of the assets and business of nodeco as  a norwegian company engaged in the energy products business 
the company would fund any cash portion of such acquisition with borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
there can be no assurance that such acquisition will be consummated or  if consummated  that the terms thereof will not change 
management believes the combination of working capital  the unused portion of existing credit facilities and cash flows from operations provide the company with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to manage its routine operations 
the company continues to seek opportunities to enhance its competitiveness through strategic acquisitions 
in addition to the potential acquisition mentioned above  the company is currently considering several other potential acquisitions  which are at various stages of negotiation or due diligence 
management believes that any borrowings made in connection with any such acquisitions will not have a materially adverse impact on the company s liquidity 
management believes that it is premature to provide specific information with respect to any other such possible acquisitions because of the status of  and possible adverse impact on  negotiations  and because  in any event  there can be no assurance that any of such possible acquisitions will be consummated 
the company intends to file in the first or second quarter of a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission with regard to the possible issuance of public indebtedness 
net proceeds from the sale of any such public indebtedness would be used primarily to repay all or a portion of the amounts then outstanding under the facilities 
the company will determine whether to issue any such public indebtedness based upon existing market conditions  however  there can be no assurance that the company will issue any such public indebtedness 
like most multinational oilfield service companies  the company has operations in certain international areas  including parts of the middle east  north and west africa  latin america  the asia pacific region and the commonwealth of independent states the cis  that are inherently subject to risks of civil disturbance and political activities that may disrupt oil and gas exploration and production activities  restrict the movement of funds or limit access to markets for periods of time 
historically  the economic impact of such disruptions has been temporary and oil and gas exploration and production activities have eventually resumed in relation to market forces 
certain areas  including algeria  nigeria  angola and parts of the middle east  have been subjected to political disruption or social unrest in the past twelve months 
generally  business interruptions resulting from civil or political disruptions negatively impact near term results of operations  however  management believes that it is unlikely that any specific business disruption caused by existing or foreseen civil or political instability will have a materially adverse impact on the financial condition or liquidity of the company 
the company has not declared dividends on common stock since december and management does not anticipate paying dividends on common stock at any time in the foreseeable future
