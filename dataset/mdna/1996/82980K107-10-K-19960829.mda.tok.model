item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview sitel was founded in by its chief executive officer  james f 
lynch 
from its inception  the company has focused on clients in the insurance and financial services industries 
in october  sitel acquired may telemarketing  inc  which primarily served companies in the telecommunications and publishing industries 
the company formed its first industry group in fiscal when it separated its insurance activities into a separate division 
after realizing the important competitive advantages created by this divisional structure  the company decided to organize its other operations into four additional divisions 
each division operates autonomously and has its own management team and call and data management systems 
four of these divisions focus on specific industries 
to take advantage of economies of scale  the fifth division historically handled the company s inbound teleservicing activities 
in recent years as the amount of revenues from inbound customer service applications has increased  these inbound activities have been moved into the appropriate industry focused division 
today  the fifth division  called client services  handles those activities which do not fit in one of the industry groups  including new initiatives the company is seeking to develop into additional industry groups 
as a result of this divisional structure  the company has made significant investments in divisional management personnel  systems and facilities 
while the company was first implementing this structure in fiscal  operating income as a percentage of revenues declined as a result of these additional expenses 
having fully implemented its divisional reorganization during fiscal  the company increased its operating margin for fiscal to of revenues excluding the non recurring  non cash special compensation expense and the one time forgiveness of amounts owed by two stockholders incurred in february from of revenues in fiscal operating margins in fiscal increased to of revenues from of revenues excluding the non recurring non cash special compensation expense and the one time forgiveness of amounts owed by two stockholders incurred in february in fiscal the increase in operating margins is primarily due to the company s ability to increase revenues without a commensurate percentage increase in divisional or corporate overhead 
remote operation sites rops are third party operated facilities that service a portion of sitel s outbound teleservicing activities 
the company has used rops as a method of temporarily expanding capacity without increasing fixed costs 
in fiscal  sitel decided to focus on expanding its workstation capacity through company operated facilities 
as a result  the percentage of revenues from teleservicing conducted by rops has steadily declined since fiscal this decline has been a factor in decreasing sitel s cost of services as a percentage of revenues from fiscal levels since rops typically provide services at a higher cost than the company would incur through its own facilities 
the company has experienced and expects to continue to experience quarterly variations in revenues from its largest clients 
these variations relate primarily to the timing and duration of clients telephone based customer service programs and to the addition of new clients 
in fiscal  the company incurred a non recurring  non cash special compensation expense of million resulting from the grant of stock options with an exercise price of 
per share to employees of the company to replace stock appreciation rights previously granted under the company s employee equity benefit plan and previously granted stock options 
this compensation expense also resulted in a deferred tax benefit of million to the company which will be available to reduce future income taxes 
through fiscal  the company s effective income tax rate was less than the statutory us rate primarily as the result of state income tax credits earned in nebraska under a job creation and investment incentive program 
in fiscal and  the effective tax rate was 
as the company has opened new facilities in states or countries without job or investment tax credits or in states or countries with corporate income taxes  its effective tax rate will continue to increase 
the company expects to account for the mitre and nafs acquisitions as a pooling of interests and the teleaction acquisition as a purchase for financial reporting purposes 
the resulting goodwill arising from the acquisition of teleaction  estimated to be million  will be amortized on a straightline basis over years 
however  goodwill will be increased by the amount of any future contingent payment made if certain profitability targets are achieved by teleaction during the two years following the closing 
the company consummated the acquisition of teleaction on june  results of operations the following table sets forth statement of operations data as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated

quarterly results and seasonality the company has experienced and expects to continue to experience quarterly variations in operating and net income principally as a result of the timing of clients teleservicing campaigns and the commencement of new contracts  revenue mix and the timing of additional selling  general and administrative expenses to support new business 
while the effects of seasonality on sitel s business often are obscured by the addition of new clients or new programs for existing clients  the company s business tends to be slower in the fiscal quarters ending in february and august 
the february quarter often is affected by reduced teleservicing activities during the december holidays and by client transitions to new marketing programs at the beginning of the calendar year 
these transitions may be accompanied by delays in introducing the new programs 
the august quarter is affected by reduced marketing activities during the summer 
as a result  sitel may experience lower operating margins during these fiscal quarters than during the other fiscal quarters 
liquidity and capital resources historically  sitel s primary source of liquidity has been cash flow from operations  supplemented by borrowings under its revolving bank line of credit

advances under the revolving bank line of credit bear interest at under the bank s national prime lending rate 
the agreement provides that the bank will review the revolving line of credit on an annual basis and will consider renewal based on the company s audited financial statements
