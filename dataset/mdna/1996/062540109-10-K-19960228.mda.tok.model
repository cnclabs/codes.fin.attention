the reduction in the provisions for loan loss in reflects the stabilization of loan quality measured by the level of npa and the general level of net charge offs 
table shows the activity through the reserve 
the levels of the loan loss reserve are primarily derived from an extensive review of the loan portfolio with a strong emphasis on the line driven loan grading system for the larger commercial loans in bank of hawaii and fnba 
this loan grading system was implemented in and is continuously monitored for accuracy by the credit review department 
in addition  actual charge offs  delinquency data  recoveries and historical trends are considered in the analysis 
the ratio of reserves to loans outstanding is one indicator of the adequacy of the reserve  however  the absolute dollar amount of the reserve and its relationship to non performing loans and historical charge offs also need to be considered

these endeavors have proven important in the strategy of bridging customers across the pacific to the us mainland  europe and within asia itself 
bancorp pursues this strategy on three fronts the international group  the south pacific division  and the western pacific division 
through the international group of bank of hawaii  bancorp offers international banking services to its corporate  financial institution and individual customers in most of the major asian financial centers supported by its honolulu operations 
as of year end  the international group of bank of hawaii had offices in hong kong  the philippines manila  cebu  and davao  korea  singapore  japan  taiwan and new york 
the international group of bank of hawaii continues to focus on trade related financing activities and lending to customers with which it has a direct relationship 
bancorp s foreign lending consists of both local currency and cross border lending 
local currency loans are those that are funded and will be repaid in the currency of the borrower s country and involve the same types of risk as domestic lending 
cross border lending  on the other hand  involves loans that will be repaid in currencies other than that of the borrower s country 
this type of lending involves greater risk because the borrower s ability to repay is additionally dependent on the availability of foreign exchange and the stability of the host country s currency 
bancorp controls its exposure to the risks of international lending by evaluating the political and economic factors that bear on a country s ability to meet its foreign debt obligations 
based on these analyses  maximum credit limits both short and long term are established for each country to ensure that the international portfolio is diversified and that exposure is limited in countries that may experience future problems 
these credit limits are reviewed on a regular basis so that exposures are understood and properly assessed 
bancorp s strategy for foreign lending is to deal  on a direct basis  primarily with countries and companies that have a strong interest in hawaii  the south and west pacific  or the asian rim 
the south pacific region is made up of the investments in affiliated banks in the south pacific and bancorp s operations in fiji and american samoa 
investments in affiliate banks in the south pacific include banks in tahiti  tonga  new caledonia  vanuatu  solomon islands and western samoa see organization chart 
total assets at year end of all such affiliates were billion 
all of these investments in affiliate banks  except those in vanuatu and the solomon islands  are accounted for using the equity method 
both nbsi s and banque d hawaii vanuatu limited s financial statements are consolidated with bancorp s financial statements 
in  bancorp expanded its investments in this area of the world by acquiring the remaining of the banque d hawaii vanuatu limited  creating banque d hawaii vanuatu  a wholly owned subsidiary of the bancorp family 
bank of hawaii s investments in these affiliate banks are all considered international 
in january  bancorp entered into an acquisition agreement  subject to regulatory approvals  under which its ownership interest in banque de tahiti and banque de nouvelle caledonie would increase to approximately and  respectively from and  respectively 
the acquisition would require these affiliates to be consolidated in bancorp s financial statements once the transaction is finalized 
the combined assets of these entities at year end  converted to us dollars  were approximately billion 
bank of hawaii operates branches in the south pacific region in fiji and american samoa 
since fiji uses its own currency  it is included with the other foreign operations and is considered international  even though its operations are reflective of consumer small business activities much like domestic branches 
the level of activity in fiji exceeded expectations 
by year end  branches were opened in suva and nadi with a third branch in lautoka  fiji opened in january the operations in american samoa are similar to fiji  but since the us dollar is used  it is not considered foreign for reporting purposes 
the operations of the south pacific region  since they are largely investments  are monitored on a regular basis 
the countries in which the affiliates are located are also evaluated on a periodic basis 
exposure  in terms of foreign currency fluctuations  is limited as each affiliate primarily deals in its own currency 
the carrying value of the investments in affiliates  accounted for using the equity method  was million at year end for nbsi and banque d hawaii vanuatu limited  combined assets of million are included in the consolidated totals 
bank of hawaii also operates branches and offices in several pacific island locations  offering traditional banking services 
west pacific division provides customary commercial banking services through branches in commonwealth of the northern mariana islands saipan  federated states of micronesia pohnpei  kosrae  and yap  guam  republic of the marshall islands majuro  and the republic of palau koror 
since the us dollar is used in these locations  they are not considered foreign for reporting purposes and are included in domestic operations 
table summarizes key totals for international operations of bancorp for net income for decreased to million  compared to the million in this translates into a return on assets for these operations of  down from the for the reduction in income for international operations was due to declines in net interest margin and a decline in total earning assets

potential problem assets bancorp s management emphasizes the importance of early recognition and monitoring of loans as a means to control delinquency 
demonstrating this commitment  management continuously reviews loans to various borrowers and industry segments that may be experiencing financial difficulties even if these loans have been generally current as to their terms 
as mentioned earlier  a loan grading system provides the process for this early warning system 
loans are graded by lending officers and validated by an independent credit review department to ensure accuracy in the grades and timely re grading 
this process is also utilized to determine the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses 
asset and liability management assets and liabilities are managed to maximize long term risk adjusted returns to our shareholders 
the asset and liability management process is one of financial risk management 
risk in the form of capital adequacy  interest rate sensitivity  liquidity and operating efficiency is balanced with expected returns to yield high relative earnings performance and market value of equity  while limiting the volatility of each 
this process is carried out through regular meetings of divisional management 
capital adequacy at year end  bancorp s equity has grown to billion  a increase from million at year end bancorp s capital ratios at year end were tier capital ratio of  total capital ratio of  and leverage ratio of 
all three exceeded the minimum threshold levels to qualify as well capitalized 
under those minimum threshold levels implemented in by bank regulators  capital must exceed the following standards tier capital  total capital  and the leverage ratio 
table presents a five year history of activity and balances in capital accounts as well as capital ratios for bancorp 
bancorp s strategy is to maintain its capital at a level to qualify as well capitalized 
the financial and regulatory impact of maintaining this status is important to bancorp 
the financial impact is reflected in lower deposit insurance premiums  while the regulatory impact allows for fewer restrictions on activities 
bancorp s strategy is to be well capitalized  but not significantly overcapitalized 
the lesser loan demand and asset growth diminished the need for building capital levels 
rather than disrupting long established programs  including the dividend reinvestment plan  profit sharing plan  and stock option plan  which provide a consistent source of new capital  bancorp embarked on a stock repurchase program several years ago 
this program to repurchase stock has had the benefit of enhancing shareholder value while still maintaining capital ratios that exceed well capitalized guidelines 
more than million shares were repurchased in  with another million shares repurchased in in  repurchases of million shares were made under the program approved in by bancorp s board to repurchase up to million shares of bancorp stock 
the remaining million shares were repurchased under an existing strategy to repurchase bancorp shares in the market to offset the needs of the plans previously mentioned

interest rate risk and derivatives for financial institutions  interest rate movements can have an impact on earnings depending on the position of the balance sheet 
at bancorp  interest sensitivity analysis is coupled with computer simulation techniques to measure the exposure of our earnings to interest rate movements 
the major factors used to manage interest rate risk include the mix of fixed and floating interest rates  pricing  and maturity patterns for all asset and liability accounts  as well as off balance sheet interest rate swaps 
the objective of this process is to position the balance sheet to optimize earnings without unduly increasing risk 
table presents the possible exposure to interest rate movements for various time frames at year end the distribution in the interest rate sensitivity table consists of a combination of maturities  call provisions  repricing frequency and prepayment patterns 
bancorp constantly analyzes and estimates  based on historic data  the interest rate sensitivity characteristics of all balance sheet items 
for example  a portion of bancorp s interest bearing demand and savings balances are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates 
consequently  bancorp has allocated portions of those balances to longer term interest rate sensitivity periods 
at december   bancorp s one year cumulative liability sensitive gap totaled billion  representing of total assets 
this position was very similar to year end  when bancorp s cumulative liability sensitive gap totaled billion or of total assets 
the one year gap is a commonly used benchmark of interest rate risk 
throughout  bancorp s liability sensitive gap position remained relatively stable 
unlike  when net interest margin declined from a first quarter average of to a fourth quarter average of  net interest margin averaged throughout the year 
bancorp uses interest rate swaps as a cost effective risk management tool for dealing with movements in interest rates 
notional amounts of interest rate swaps at year end totaled billion compared with billion at year end and billion at year end no new swaps were entered into in credit exposure on interest rate swaps is determined and monitored according to the same strict standards and policies applied to bancorp s commercial lending activity 
bancorp s policy is to utilize interest rate swaps for purposes other than trading 
bancorp utilizes interest rate swaps to alter the interest rate characteristics of identified groups of assets or liabilities 
limits on the total notional amounts of contracts outstanding at any time have been established 
limits have also been established for each counter party 
activity is monitored on a monthly basis in conjunction with normal asset liability management committee meetings 
further disclosure of bancorp s interest rate swap activity is included in the footnotes to its financial statements following

these negotiated placements totaled million and were all issued for a term of three years 
bancorp s access to such private placement counterparties further enhances its balance sheet liquidity 
control of net overhead bancorp s emphasis on control of net overhead has several measurement indicators 
these indicators are its net overhead ratio  its net income per employee and its efficiency ratio 
each of these is discussed in the following paragraphs 
bancorp defines its net overhead ratio as the ratio of non interest expense to non interest income without securities transactions 
bancorp s long term goal is to have a ratio of to  where fee income offsets at least half of the cost of operations 
with the slowdown in the economy of hawaii  and increased competition for deposits  the efficient managing of the net overhead ratio grows in importance 
trust operations  electronic financial services  insurance and annuity sales  and brokerage services are expected to make significant contributions to this process 
for  bancorp s net overhead ratio was  compared with and in and  respectively

as mentioned earlier  bancorp restructured its retirement benefit plans in in conjunction with this change  bancorp offered staff members meeting certain eligibility requirements an option to elect early retirement 
almost of the eligible staff members elected the early retirement option 
offsetting this staff reduction was an increase in staffing attributable to the expansion of certain business segments like bank of hawaii s in store banking locations  the expansion of the brokerage services through bancorp investment group  and the acquisition of pacific capital asset management  inc s first investment management team 
for  total average fte staff count was  compared with the year end total fte of  reflecting the impact of staff members electing the early retirement option in occupancy expense for increased to million from million in the change reflects the costs of expansion for the in store branches and the placement in service of the new kapolei facility

however  hawaii remains bancorp s focus for low income housing credits 
bancorp also continues to provide lease financing as a method by which to defer taxes 
however  with the current interest rate environment and competitive market  many opportunities require the lessor to take on much more tax risk and  therefore  bancorp has not been as active in this market as in the past
