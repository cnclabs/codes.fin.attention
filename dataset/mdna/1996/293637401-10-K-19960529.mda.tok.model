new accounting pronouncement in october  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which established financial accounting and reporting standards for stock based employee compensation plans 
companies are encouraged  rather than required  to adopt a new method that accounts for stock compensation awards based on their fair value using an option pricing model 
companies that do not adopt this new method will be required to make pro forma footnote disclosures of net income as if the fair value based method of accounting required by sfas no 
had been applied 
the company is required to adopt sfas no 
beginning in fiscal adoption of this pronouncement is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations because the company intends to make pro forma footnote disclosures instead of adopting the new accounting method
