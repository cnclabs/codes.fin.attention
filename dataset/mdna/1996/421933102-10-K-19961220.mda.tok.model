legislative and regulatory action has resulted in continuing change in the medicare and medicaid reimbursement programs which will continue to limit payment increases under these programs 
however  the company believes that these continued changes will not have a material adverse effect on the company s future revenue or liquidity 
within the statutory framework of the medicare and medicaid programs  there are substantial areas subject to administrative rulings  interpretations and discretion which may further affect payments made under those programs  and the federal and state governments might  in the future  reduce the funds available under those programs or require more stringent utilization and quality reviews of hospital facilities  either of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s future revenue and liquidity 
additionally  any future restructuring of the financing and delivery of health care in the united states and the continued rise in managed care programs could have an effect on the company s future revenue and liquidity
