environmental matters the company is among several potentially responsible parties named in an environmental protection agency matter involving discharge of hazardous materials at an old waste site in south carolina 
this action seeks primarily cleanup costs 
the ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be predicted with certainty  however  to the extent to which not previously reserved against by the company  management does not believe this matter will have a material adverse effect on the company 
impact of recently issued accounting standards the company plans to adopt statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  in sfas no 
requires that impaired assets or assets to be disposed of be accounted for at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value of the assets less costs of disposal 
the adoption of the new standard is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
in october  sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  was issued 
companies will have the option of recognizing compensation expense for virtually all stock based compensation arrangements based upon the fair value of the option at the grant date  or alternatively  continuing to recognize compensation expense based on the excess of the quoted market price over the option price on the measurement date in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
this statement is required to be adopted in the company has not yet adopted sfas no 
and has not yet determined the impact it may have on future financial statement disclosures 
impact of inflation and changing prices the inflation rate  as measured by the consumer price index  has been relatively low in the last few years  and therefore pricing decisions by the company have largely been influenced by competitive market conditions 
during  however  the cost of recycled corrugated scrap paper dramatically increased  particularly in the first half of the year  resulting in price increases of thermo ply insulative sheathing 
the company uses the lifo method of inventory pricing for of its inventories  which results in the most recent costs of lifo priced inventory being reflected in the income statement 
current costs of the company s remaining inventories  priced on a fifo basis  are also reflected in part in the income statement because of the relatively high turnover of these inventories 
depreciation expense is based on the historical cost to the company of its fixed assets and therefore is considerably less than it would be if it were based on current replacement cost 
while buildings  machinery and equipment acquired in prior years will ultimately have to be replaced at significantly higher prices  it is expected that this will be a gradual process over many years
