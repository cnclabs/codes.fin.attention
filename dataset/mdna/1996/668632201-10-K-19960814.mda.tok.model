capital expenditures during fiscal were curtailed due to significant constraints imposed on the cash flows of the registrant 
the capital expenditures were resumed to their normal level during mid fiscal year the drilling segment anticipates capital expenditures of approximately  for fiscal to be funded from existing bank credit lines  cash flow from operations and proceeds from sales of assets 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included as a part of item of this report 
due to numerous uncertainties regarding the availability  price and delivery of certain drilling equipment  the registrant s anticipated level of capital expenditures may fluctuate commensurate with the volatility of the industry 
management of the registrant believes that cash flows from operations and borrowing if available should be sufficient to fund continuing operations and adequately service the registrant s debt for the next twelve months 
however  the ability of the registrant to perform under the existing terms of its debt agreements and adequately extinguish certain other liabilities associated with its discontinued segments is contingent upon the registrant s ability to successfully negotiate with its creditors primarily creditors of the mri and nursery segments 
furthermore  the inherent macroeconomic risks associated with the oil and gas industry  such as the volatility of oil and gas prices  could adversely affect the registrant s operations

the company plans to continue using the intrinsic value based method
