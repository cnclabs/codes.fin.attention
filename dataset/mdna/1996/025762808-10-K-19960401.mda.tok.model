civil action no 
alleging generally that the defendants engaged in fraudulent activities in connection with the marketing and sale of interests in various limited partnerships  including the nylog programs  and the subsequent operation of such partnerships  breached implied covenants and fiduciary duties owed to investors and violated various federal securities and state laws and rules 
the plaintiffs purport to represent a class of all persons who purchased or otherwise assumed rights and title to interests in the partnerships that were created  sponsored  marketed  sold  operated or managed by the defendants from january  through march  the plaintiffs have asked for compensatory damages for their lost original investment  plus interest  costs including attorneys fees  punitive damages  disgorgement of any earnings  compensation and benefits received by the defendants as a result of the alleged actions and other unspecified relief to which plaintiffs may be entitled 
the lawsuit was preceded by two similar but separate lawsuits filed by the plaintiffs in the district courts in harris county  texas on january  the defendants expressly deny any wrongdoing alleged in the complaints and do not concede any liability or wrongdoing in connection with any of the facts or claims that have been alleged against them in the lawsuits described above  including any liability or wrongdoing in connection with the sale of the units of limited partner interest in the partnerships 
nevertheless  to reduce the burden of protracted litigation  the defendants have entered into a stipulation of settlement the settlement agreement with the plaintiffs because  in their opinion  the settlement would i provide substantial benefits to the limited partners in a manner consistent with new york life s prior determination to wind up the nylog programs through orderly liquidation because the continuation of the business no longer served the intended objectives of either the limited partners or the defendants and to offer the limited partners an enhancement to the liquidating distribution they would otherwise receive  ii provide an opportunity to wind up the partnerships on a schedule favorable to the limited partners and to resolve the issues raised by the lawsuits and iii reduce the burdens and uncertainties associated with protracted litigation of the claims underlying the lawsuits 
if the settlement agreement is approved by the florida court and becomes final  a limited partner of a limited partnership who participates in the settlement will receive from an affiliate of new york life a cash payment that  together with prior distributions to such settling limited partner from such limited partnership  will result in the settling limited partner having received in the aggregate an amount at least equal to his total investment in such partnership 
if the proposed settlement becomes final  the defendants and various other related parties will be released and discharged from any and all claims a limited partner may have against the defendants in connection with the partnerships 
the american parties will not be liable for any payment of advances or refunds to the nylog investors 
on march   the florida federal district court issued a hearing order and certified the class for settlement purposes only and directed the defendants to cause a class notice to be mailed to potential class members 
the settlement agreement is not yet final  is subject to a number of conditions and may be terminated in certain circumstances

pursuant to the indemnity agreement  nylife has assumed control of the joint defense of the nylog litigation at nylife s expense including  but not limited to  any settlement discussions or settlements

as of december   american s net share of the nylog programs oil and gas reserves totaled approximately mmboe  or of the company s total proved reserves  and american s share of cash flows from the nylog properties totaled approximately million 
if the nylog liquidation is approved  approximately million of annual cost reimbursements to american will be eliminated  however  the liquidation process will streamline american s property base and enable the company to reduce overhead and interest expense

the impact on american of such liquidation will depend in part upon the amounts realized upon the sales of the nylog properties

american s share of the acquisition was funded through million in borrowings under the company s bank credit facility 
the acquired properties will add estimated proved reserves totaling bcf of natural gas and mbbls of crude oil and liquids  net to american s interest 
american s share of current daily production from the acquired properties is approximately mmcf of gas and bbls of crude oil per day 
management believes that in addition to the positive impact on reserve value  production and cash flow  this acquisition fits well with american s strategy of establishing a position in areas of the gulf of mexico 
subsequent to the acquisition  the company entered into a fixed price contract on approximately  mmbtu of gas per day for two years commencing april  at an average price of per mmbtu

three of the lawsuits have been dismissed 
american has remediated several of these properties and believes these remediation efforts will significantly reduce the basis for the plaintiffs damage claims 
although the company cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings  management does not expect the outcome of the two remaining cases to have a material adverse impact on american s financial position or results of operations 
changing oil and gas prices the company s revenues and cash flows are affected by changes in oil and gas prices 
moreover  the company s bank borrowing capacity is largely dependent upon oil and gas prices
