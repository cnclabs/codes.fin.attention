the company has taken certain actions to adjust its expected production to the reduced order flow in these actions include adjustments to operations and overhead expenses in the short term 
accordingly  sales and operating results for are not anticipated to equal results 
the company is implementing cost reduction measures to minimize the impact of the slowness of orders on future earnings 
the expected benefits of such cost reduction measures may not be fully realized  however  until the second half of fiscal year liquidity and capital resources the company requires capital primarily to fund working capital for ongoing operations  to provide for the expansion of manufacturing capacity  to service its existing debt and to pursue its strategic objectives  including the development of new products and the penetration of international markets 
historically  the company has funded its capital requirements with cash provided by operating activities  borrowings under credit facilities  issuances of long term debt and the sale and private placement of common stock 
net cash provided by used in operating activities was million in  million in and million for net cash provided by used in operating activities before working capital requirements has improved from million in to million and million in and  respectively 
working capital provided used cash of million in  million in and million during the company s working capital needs increase during periods of sales growth because of a number of factors  including the duration of the manufacturing process and the relatively large size of most orders 
the large increase in working capital requirements during reflected increasing sales  particularly a growing proportion of international orders  which typically have less favorable cash flow terms  and the introduction of new products 
the company believes that continued sales growth  particularly growth of international orders and the introduction of new products  may further increase the company s requirements for working capital 
working capital usage also increased during as a result of more competitive new domestic order terms made necessary by foreign competition  slowing orders and related lower customer deposits during the latter part of the year  and receivables collection delays resulting from new product warranty issues 
capital expenditures for additions to property  plant and equipment for   and totaled million 
these expenditures were used to rebuild the company s rotary die manufacturing facility that was destroyed by a fire in  to modernize equipment at all locations and to expand capacity  including the reopening of the fort worth  texas facility which occurred during approximately million of the capital expenditures were funded by insurance proceeds 
in addition  the company received million from the sale of the post division assets in and million in from the sale of an idle facility located in grapevine  texas 
the company anticipates that its capital expenditures for will be significantly less than these capital expenditures are anticipated to be used primarily for continued equipment modernization and for capacity expansion 
positive cash flow from operations  as well as asset sales in and and a private placement of series a common stock in  enabled the company to reduce its long term debt by million during the period from to increases in the company s net sales necessitated million in working capital borrowings during at december   the company s indebtedness was comprised primarily of a credit facility and the company s subordinated notes due june  as of december   there was outstanding million in subordinated notes  with principal payments of million being due on june  and each june thereafter  and a final payment of million at maturity 
under its credit facility  the company may borrow up to million in the form of direct borrowings and letters of credit 
as of december   there was million in direct borrowings and million in standby letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility 
as a result of the increased borrowings under the credit facility  the company s debt to total capital ratio increased to compared to at the beginning of the year 
the interest rate on direct borrowings under the credit facility is at the lender s prime rate  or at the company s option  an offshore rate generally equivalent to libor plus 
at december   million of the company s borrowings were at the lender s prime rate of interest and million of the borrowings were at an offshore rate plus 
the amounts borrowed under the credit facility have been used for working capital 
both the agreement concerning the credit facility and the agreement with the holders of the subordinated notes provide for joint and several guaranties by the domestic operating subsidiaries of the company 
to secure the indebtedness and the guaranties  a first lien was granted to the lender  and a second lien was granted to the holders of the subordinated notes  on substantially all the assets of the company and its domestic subsidiaries 
the company s domestic operating subsidiaries were merged into the company effective january  the borrowings under the credit facility and subordinated notes agreement are subject to various restrictive covenants related to financial ratios as well as limitations on capital expenditures and additional indebtedness 
the credit facility permits the company to borrow up to million for domestic acquisitions without lender consent 
the company is not allowed to pay dividends 
in march of  the company and its lender reached an agreement for a modification of the credit facility 
the modification will provide for a reduction in the minimum required debt service coverage ratio during consistent with the company s current expectations 
the company anticipates final documentation of the modification to be completed in april management believes that cash flow from operations together with existing borrowing capacity under the company s credit facility will be adequate to fund its existing operations  repay indebtedness  and allow it to pursue its strategic objectives over the next months 
in addition  the company may incur  from time to time  additional short and long term bank indebtedness under its existing credit facility or otherwise and may issue  in public or private transactions  its equity and debt securities to provide additional funds necessary for the continued pursuit of the company s growth strategies  including the financing of possible future acquisitions 
the availability and terms of any such sources of financing will depend on market and other conditions 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available or  if available  will be on terms and conditions acceptable to the company 
in addition to the availability of external financing  management believes that the company s liquidity will be impacted by its ability to achieve a satisfactory resolution of product performance issues  timely deliveries  acceptance of the ace system by the bank of england and final acceptance of the snow press by banque de france  the degree of international orders which generally have less favorable cash flow terms and require letters of credit that reduce credit availability  terms of domestic orders  and timely implementation of cost reduction measures 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in any or all of these areas 
accounting policies the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  which establishes methods for determining and measuring asset impairment and the required timing of asset impairment evaluations 
in addition  the fasb has issued statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which establishes accounting and disclosure guidelines for stock based compensation 
management has evaluated these statements and believes that they will not have a significant effect on the financial results of the company
