item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations earnings summary the company reported net income of  or primary and fully diluted net income per share for the fiscal year ended september  this compares to net income of  primary net income per share of and fully diluted net income per share of in fiscal and  or 
primary and fully diluted net income per share in fiscal results benefited from an increase in net sales due to strong demand for disk drive lead wire assemblies as compared to both fiscal and and from better than expected operating results related to litchfield precision components lpc which was acquired in may the fiscal increased sales volume as compared to more than offset the reduction of the gross margin percent for the same period 
the fiscal gross margins were effected by volume related selling price reductions and initial costs related to the production ramp up of the new wire alignment tab wat product within the precision products division 
the gross margin percent was also effected by the inclusion of sales from the newly acquired litchfield precision components  which currently generate a lower gross margin than the company s overall gross margin percent 
the increase in sales for fiscal also more than offset increases in operating expenses for the year as operating expenses were of sales in fiscal as compared to and of sales in fiscal years and  respectively 
revenue generated by the iconovex and innomedica divisions continue to make up less than of the company s total revenue 
although these two divisions continued to operate at a loss during fiscal  alternatives are being reviewed to improve their performance during fiscal with the intent of maximizing their long term contribution to the company 
results of operations net sales 
net sales 
for fiscal were  an increase of from  in and up substantially from sales of  in sales growth in was generated primarily by increased shipments of lead wire assemblies for the disk drive industry as has been the trend for the past six years 
the rapidly increasing shipments of lead wire assemblies for magneto resistive mr disk drives  which include the new wire alignment tab wat product introduced late in the third quarter  also contributed to the increased sales revenue 
disk drive industry projections indicate that lead wire assembly demand will remain strong in fiscal and the company expects to post record fiscal sales based on these projections 
the company should benefit from its ability to manufacture the smaller and more technically precise four wire lead assemblies required by the new generation mr disk drives 
mr disk drives are the fastest growing segment of the disk drive industry while demand for the previous generation inductive disk drives remains strong 
a significant portion of the sales increase in fiscal is due to sales of high end flexible circuits and chemically etched parts generated by the newly acquired litchfield precision components 
these products were sold primarily to the medical  computer and communication industries 
fiscal should benefit from a full year of litchfield precision component sales 
sales from iconovex and innomedica made up less than of the company s total revenue in fiscal these sales are expected to grow in fiscal as their products and markets continue to develop 
export sales accounted for of the company s revenue in fiscal as compared to for and for  reflecting the high level of lead wire assembly shipments to disk drive manufacturers in japan and other pacific rim countries 
a significant portion of the remaining domestic sales are subsequently shipped internationally by the company s customers 
gross margin 
the company s gross profit margin decreased to of sales in fiscal from in but was up from in the fiscal gross margin dollars increased over and over due to the increase in sales volume which more than offset the reduction of the gross margin percent for the same period 
the precision products division fiscal gross margin percent was effected by volume related selling price reductions and initial costs related to the production ramp up of the new wire alignment tab wat product 
the fiscal and gross margin percentages benefited from volume related efficiencies which resulted in more efficient use of the company s investment in equipment and manufacturing automation technology and the increased utilization of thailand subcontractors for labor intensive processes 
the high sales volume and increased efficiency of the manufacturing process allowed the company to maintain strong margins even while responding to pricing pressures in the market 
although there will be continued pricing pressure  gross margins are expected to remain strong due to increases in volume and continued cost reductions resulting from manufacturing efficiencies and engineering innovation 
the company also intends to begin using a subcontractor in china to expand its practice of outsourcing labor intensive processes 
while litchfield precision components sales made a significant contribution to the company s gross margin  the division s gross margin percent caused a slight reduction in the company s overall gross margin percent 
in addition  the reduction of the fiscal gross margin percent generated by the iconovex and innomedica divisions improved slightly from the reduction in fiscal operating expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to of net sales in as compared to in and in the decrease in is primarily due to the increased precision product division lead wire assembly sales which more than offset the increase in operating expenses from other divisions 
total selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased over primarily due to the addition of the newly acquired litchfield precision components and to an increase in corporate level expenses 
the increase in fiscal expenses over  related to costs of growing innomedica and iconovex  the two divisions which were started in fiscal engineering expense decreased to of net sales in fiscal from in and in the decrease in is primarily due to the increased level of lead wire assembly sales 
the actual spending was virtually unchanged in from similar to  the spending at precision products continued to relate to efforts to develop new products  further automate the manufacturing process and develop material alternatives 
iconovex and innomedica continued to concentrate on new product development 
the increase in engineering spending in fiscal over corresponded to the increase in sales over increases in fiscal engineering spending are expected primarily at precision products to further automate their manufacturing processes including the new wire alignment tab process and at litchfield precision components to increase their long run capabilities 
interest income increased to  in fiscal from  and  in and  respectively 
these increases in the last two years correspond to the increases in average cash and short term investments 
interest expense decreased to  in  from  in and from  in other expense increased in over due to the  write off of intangible assets at innomedica 
these intangible assets related to purchased proprietary technology which is not expected to be supported by revenue from the associated products 
income before provision for income taxes 
income before provision for income taxes was  for fiscal as compared to  for and  for as a percent of net sales  income before provision for income taxes was for as compared to and for and  respectively 
the dollar increase in over both and was due to the large increase in precision product lead wire sales and the inclusion of litchfield precision components operating results 
the reduction in income before provision for income taxes as a percent of sales in is the result of the lower gross margin percent on the increased level of sales 
operating income from all divisions should improve in fiscal precision products is expected to have increased revenues due to projected increases in disk drive industry demand particularly in the rapidly growing magneto resistive segment of the market 
litchfield precision components should benefit from an increase in sales and improvements in their cost structure 
iconovex and innomedica should show improvements as their products become more established 
provision for income taxes the company s effective tax rate of in fiscal decreased from in and from in the decrease in tax rates in from is due in part to an increase in the company s foreign sales corporation tax benefit as a result of the increased level of foreign sales 
liquidity and capital resources cash and short term investments decreased by  to  at september  net cash provided by operating activities increased in to  from  in and  in the decrease in the company s september  cash and short term investments was primarily due to the acquisition of litchfield precision components and capital equipment for the precision products division 
the increase in fiscal cash provided by operating activities over and was primarily due to improved operating results related to the increase in demand for lead wire assemblies 
this increase was reduced by the large increase in operating assets required to support the higher level of sales 
accounts receivable at september  increased by  from the prior year due to the increased level of sales in as compared to and to the acquisition of litchfield precision components 
working capital rose by  to  at september  the company s current ratio was to at fiscal year end  compared to to at the end of fiscal excluding assets from the litchfield precision components acquisition  net property  plant and equipment increased by  to  at september  as fixed asset purchases were primarily offset by depreciation expenses for the year 
excluding intangible assets recorded as a result of the litchfield precision components acquisition  intangible assets decreased  to  at september  the decrease was primarily due to the amortization and write off of innomedica intangibles 
long term debt  net of current maturities  decreased by  to  at september  the ratio of long term debt to stockholders equity was 
at september   compared to 
at the end of fiscal management believes that internally generated funds will provide adequate sources of funds to support projected working capital  capital expenditures and dividends in fiscal forword looking statements statements included in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in the letter to shareholders  elsewhere in the annual report and in the company s form k and in future filings by the company with the sec  except for the historical information contained herein and therein  are forword looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  including the timely availability and acceptance of new products  the impact of competitive products and pricing and a general downturn in the company s principal market
