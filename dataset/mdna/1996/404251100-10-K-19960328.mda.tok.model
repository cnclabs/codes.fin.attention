sales and distribution customers 
office furniture and products are distributed nationally through more than  office product dealers  wholesalers distributors  over national and regional retailers  and various contract customers 
several of the company s office furniture operating units distribute products through common dealers  wholesalers distributors  and retailers 
several operating units also sell products directly to state governments and to the united states government through the general services administration 
government sales are for certain products  for a certain price  and for a certain time period  thus  none are subject to price renegotiation 
one customer  united stationers inc  accounted for approximately   and of the company s consolidated net sales in    respectively 
the industry trend is toward increased consolidation of distribution which implies larger and fewer customers for the company s office furniture and related products

home building products sales tend to have an even larger concentration in third and fourth fiscal quarters 
as of december   the company has an order backlog of approximately million which will be filled in the ordinary course of business within the current fiscal year 
this compares with million as of december   and million as of january  the dollar amount of the ongoing backlog of orders at any point in time is not considered by management to be a leading indicator of the company s expected sales for any particular fiscal period 
large dollar amounts of order backlogs are unusual since most of the company s products are manufactured and shipped within a few weeks following receipt of order  and a low backlog is an indicator of responsive customer service 
competition 
the principal competitive factors for both office furniture and home building products are product performance  product quality  complete and on time delivery to the customer  price  and customer service support 
the company believes it is well positioned to compete in all of its served markets due to its market share  engineering and manufacturing capability  broad product offering  national field sales representation  and long standing customer relationships 
competitive conditions vary for hon industries inc based on the industry  industry segment  channel of distribution  products involved  and the prevailing us general economic environment 
the us office furniture industry for calendar year is estimated by industry sources to be billion  up nearly from it consists of several hundred domestic manufacturing companies plus foreign companies who import products 
the company s primary strength in the office furniture and products industry lies with its products for the middle market segment 
this expanding segment of the industry typically serves the small and medium sized businesses who tend to be more price value sensitive consumers 
however  the company s total office furniture sales makes it a significant player in the broader us office furniture industry 
the company is a niche player in providing computer accessory products in the very large computer accessories industry 
there are many competitors producing similar products  some are much larger than the company s operating unit 
the company s particular home building products  prefabricated metal fireplaces and related products  are manufactured by a number of national and regional competitors 
however  a limited number of manufacturers dominate the sales in this relatively small industry 
heatilator inc is one of the larger us manufacturers of prefabricated metal fireplaces 
for further discussion of the company s competitive situation  refer to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
effects of inflation 
certain business costs may  from time to time  increase at a rate exceeding the general rate of inflation 
however  the company does not consider the current rate of inflation in the us to be a significant business issue or concern 
the company adjusts the selling prices of its products to maintain profit margins whenever possible 
investments are routinely made in modern plants  equipment  support systems  and for rapid continuous improvement programs 
these investments collectively focus on increasing productivity which helps to offset the effect of rising material and labor costs 
ongoing cost control disciplines are also routinely employed 
in addition  the last in  first out lifo valuation method is used for most of the company s inventories  which ensures the changing material and labor costs are recognized in reported income  and more importantly  these costs are recognized in pricing decisions

the company is subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water  the handling  storage  and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials  and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances 
although the company believes it is in material compliance with all of the various regulations applicable to its business  there can be no assurance that requirements will not change in the future or that the company will not incur material cost to comply with such regulations

compliance with federal  state  and local environmental regulations has not had a material effect on the capital expenditures  earnings  or competitive position of the company to date 
there are no financially material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities anticipated during fiscal year it is management s judgment that compliance with current regulations should not have a financially material effect on future earnings

item legal proceedings 
along with several other potentially responsible parties prps  the company has been involved with site investigation and clean up activities imposed by the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla at one waste disposal site in georgia which allegedly received waste materials containing hazardous substances generated by the company or its subsidiaries 
in general  under cercla  each prp which actually contributes hazardous substances to a superfund site is jointly and severally liable for the costs associated with investigating and cleaning up the site 
customarily  the prps will work with the environmental protection agency epa or equivalent state agency to agree upon and implement a plan for site remediation 
prps for the georgia site have been required to institute a monitoring program  a background groundwater study  and a possible remediation work plan 
the epa has issued a record of decision for the site rod following the completion of a remedial investigation feasibility study 
the rod identified manganese  a constituent not included in waste sent by the company to the site  as the sole constituent of concern 
the company also owns a portion of the property which is part of the site 
the original property owner has agreed to repurchase the property from the company and indemnify the company against environmental liabilities arising from the company s ownership of the property 
the company also is involved in certain continuing clean up activities under the supervision of the pennsylvania state environmental authorities at one site formerly used by a company subsidiary 
the costs associated with this site are comprised primarily of investigation and remediation efforts associated with soil and groundwater contamination 
in this matter  the company has worked with appropriate authorities to resolve the issues involved 
the company was named  along with three other prps  as a party to an imminent or substantial endangerment order and remedial action order dated april  by the california department of toxic substances control dtsc in connection with the former firestone tire rubber company facility in south gate  california firestone site 
the dtsc is seeking to cover the cost of investigating soil and groundwater contamination and preparing a remedial action plan for the firestone site 
from to  the site was owned by the firestone tire rubber company now known as bridgestone firestone  inc and operated from to primarily as a tire manufacturing facility 
the company purchased a portion of the firestone site in  and subsequently sold a portion of that property to a company now in bankruptcy proceedings 
the company continues to own a part of the firestone site 
the company believes its potential liability at the firestone site arises from the company s status as an owner of the property and not as a waste generator 
the company has cooperated in the preparation of a remedial investigation feasibility study work plan ri fs work plan which was approved by dtsc in june the investigation under the ri fs work plan began in august and is expected to be completed early in the company has  however  denied liability and believes that substantially all investigation and clean up costs should be born by bridgestone firestone  inc the company has accrued liabilities reflecting management s best estimate of the eventual future cost of the company s anticipated share based upon estimated ranges of remediation costs  the existence of many other larger prps to share in such costs who are financially viable  the company s experience to date in relation to the determination of its allocable share  the volume and type of waste the company is believed to have contributed to the sites  and the anticipated periods of time over which such costs may be paid of remediation costs 
potential insurance reimbursements are not anticipated 
the company also is reviewing available defenses and claims it may have against third parties  including bridgestone firestone  inc due to such factors as the wide discretion of regulatory authorities regarding clean up levels and uncertain allocation of liability at multiple party sites  estimates made prior to the approval of a formal plan of action represent management s best judgment as to estimates of reasonably foreseeable expenses based upon average remediation costs at comparable sites 
while the final resolution of these contingencies could result in expenses in excess of current accruals and  therefore  have an impact on the company s consolidated financial result in a future reporting period  management believes that the ultimate outcome will not have a material effect on the company s financial position or operations 
the company is a guarantor of certain leases for showroom space at the international design center idc in long island city  new york 
on june   the company filed an action in the new york supreme court claiming wrongful eviction and breach of representations and warranties that the idc would be maintained as a showroom facility 
the idc has counterclaimed for back rent and other damages 
the parties have filed cross motions for summary judgment which are currently pending before the court 
on december   haworth  inc  filed a complaint in federal district court in kalamazoo  michigan  alleging that certain products sold by the company and its subsidiaries infringed its patents covering electrified panel systems and asking for damages in an unspecified amount 
these patents expired november   and no claim has been made with respect to company products sold after that date 
the company believes it has meritorious defenses and will vigorously defend its rights

the industry is experiencing a rapid and unprecedented level of consolidation 
fierce competitive conditions in the marketplace  inventory adjustments among certain major office furniture customers in the fast growing budget segment  and non recurring charges drove the company s net income and net income per share to lower than planned levels 
for the year ended december   net sales were million compared to million in and million in the company s sales growth was in  in  and in  and net sales for each of these years represented a record level 
net income for was million compared to million in and million in according to bifma international  us office furniture industry shipments exceeded billion in  up from  billion in  up from  and billion in  up from bifma is predicting industry growth for to a level of billion in sales 
no comparable industry data is available for the hearth products industry 
profitable sales growth continues to be a key business strategy 
the company is focusing its major efforts on further strengthening and increasing its core commercial and budget office furniture business which serves small and medium sized businesses  including home offices 
this market sector demands value oriented products and is served through several intensely competitive channels of distribution  which are characterized by competitive pricing terms and conditions  reliable customer service  and a steady stream of new innovative products 
fiscal year net sales were driven by essentially the same factors as  although with less competitive pricing pressure 
fiscal year net sales were driven by an overall reduced growth rate of the broader office furniture industry  but the company s particular market segments are believed to have been stronger and more vibrant than the overall industry

primarily  efforts include an ongoing program to upgrade production facilities  machinery  and equipment  reengineering manufacturing and distribution processes to make them more efficient and responsive to changing conditions  and managing the procurement of raw materials and substitution of lower cost alternative materials 
however  these efforts were more than offset by other influences in the marketplace in specifically  price realization 
the marketplace demanded a higher level of marketing and sales program support from the company in to meet competitive terms and conditions than had been seen previously 
gross profit margins were   and in   and  respectively 
since the annual us inflation rate has stabilized in the to range  inflation has not been a significant cost factor for the company  although competitive pressures have limited its ability to pass on cost increases through higher selling prices 
the company uses the lifo method for valuing its principal inventories  which results in cost of products sold  reported in the financial statements  approximating current costs 
selling and administrative expenses for were adversely influenced by the cost of increased sales aids and co op advertising allowances  freight costs increasing at a more rapid rate than product price increases  added costs due to disruptions resulting from increasing warehouse capacity  increased investment in new product development efforts  and the nonrecurring expenses
