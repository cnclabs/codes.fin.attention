partially offsetting these negative factors were higher worldwide average crude oil sales prices and higher average sales prices for agricultural products 
comparing the operating results with  the reduction in earnings reflected the adverse effects of lower average crude oil and natural gas prices and lower margins in west coast refining and marketing operations 
these negative factors were partially offset by higher natural gas production  higher foreign crude oil production  stronger agricultural products earnings  and lower domestic oil and gas operating and depreciation expenses 
in the above special items table  the other category for included benefits of million from a bankruptcy settlement with columbia gas transmission corporation columbia settlement and million from a settlement to recover lease bonus and rentals relating to outer continental shelf leases offshore florida and alaska ocs settlement 
partially offsetting these benefits were charges of million for a deferred tax adjustment and million for a receivable write down 
for  the amount included a million gain from the settlement of a lawsuit against mesa petroleum and a million benefit related to the cancellation of the lease on the unocal headquarters building in downtown los angeles 
for  the amount included a million charge for the effect of the federal tax rate change on deferred taxes and a million provision for the closure of the company s credit card center 
revenues consolidated revenues in were billion  up million from year end and up million from the increase from was primarily due to higher petroleum product sales volumes  agricultural products average sales prices and gains on sales of assets 
the decrease in from was mainly due to lower refined product prices and volumes 
costs and other deductions adjusted to exclude special items  crude oil and product purchases  operating expense  and selling  administrative and general expense totaled billion in  compared with billion in and billion in the increase in was primarily due to increased expense for crude oil and product purchases resulting from higher average crude oil prices and increased purchases of refined products for resale due to extended maintenance activities at the refineries 
the higher depreciation  depletion and amortization expense in was due to an million charge resulting from the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s interest expense increased in due primarily to higher debt

millions of dollars net earnings excluding special items special items columbia and ocs settlements asset sales impairment of long lived assets sfas no 
write downs of assets provision for abandonment and remediation of the guadalupe oil field other net earnings including special items the earnings excluding special items reflected lower worldwide crude oil production and lower average domestic natural gas sales prices 
worldwide crude oil production in averaged  barrels per day  down from  in and  in the decrease was mainly due to natural production declines and the sale of nonstrategic domestic properties 
the company s average domestic sales price for natural gas was per thousand cubic feet  down from in and in positive factors in were higher average worldwide crude oil sales prices  lower effective foreign income tax rates and lower domestic operating expense 
unocal s average worldwide sales price for crude oil was per barrel in  up from in and in the decrease in domestic operating expense was primarily due to sales of nonstrategic domestic properties and cost reductions 
in  the company reduced its worldwide average production costs per barrel of oil equivalent to  compared with for and for domestic natural gas production averaged  million cubic feet per day in  up from  in and in the accelerated development program initiated in  primarily in the gulf of mexico  has allowed unocal to keep its domestic natural gas production stable despite the continuing sales of oil and gas properties 
comparing the adjusted results with  the decrease reflected lower worldwide natural gas and crude oil sales prices and lower domestic crude oil production 
the decrease in production was mainly due to asset sales and natural declines 
positive factors in were higher natural gas production  higher foreign crude oil production and lower domestic operating expense 
the increase in foreign crude oil production was due to new production in indonesia and the netherlands 
the results also benefited from a million reduction in depreciation and depletion expense as a result of the change in accounting policy for recognizing the reduction in value of the company s producing properties  as described in note the pro forma effect of this accounting change on results would have been an increase in net earnings of million 
refining  marketing and transportation products company this business segment is principally responsible for the company s west coast petroleum refining operations  marketing and transportation of refined petroleum products  and the manufacturing and marketing of petroleum coke 
millions of dollars net earnings excluding special items special items asset sales write downs of assets litigation environmental remediation provision federal tax rate change closing of the credit card center net earnings including special items the lower earnings excluding special items reflected lower refined product margins and lower refinery production volumes due to extended maintenance and modification activities early in the year 
these negative factors were partially offset by california business tax credits of million net of federal tax effect related to refinery modifications to produce reformulated fuels and by lower operating and selling expenses 
petroleum product sales volumes were  barrels per day in  up from  barrels per day in due to scheduled refinery maintenance in  the increased sales volumes and lower margins were principally related to the outside purchase and resale of refined petroleum products to other than retail customers 
comparing results with  the decrease was principally due to lower margins resulting from weak selling prices for refined products  which were partially offset by lower crude oil and product purchase costs 
geothermal and power operations this segment is involved in the exploration for  and the production and sale of geothermal resources for the generation of electricity 
millions of dollars net earnings excluding special items special items asset sales federal tax rate change net earnings including special items the decreased earnings excluding special items resulted from lower steam production and prices at the geysers in northern california and lower steam production in the philippines primarily due to damage to the tiwi facilities caused by a november typhoon 
the lower production at the geysers was due to seven months of discretionary curtailments by the public utility company that purchases the steam to generate electricity 
the curtailments were the product of abundant supplies of inexpensive hydro power available from record rainfall in the western us and depressed natural gas prices 
these negative factors were partially offset by increased production and prices for indonesian operations 
the increased production resulted from a full year of supplying steam from the gunung salak field to power two megawatt power plants that began commercial operation during the third quarter of the power plants are located on the island of java and are operated by indonesia s state utility company 
comparing the operating results with  the increase reflected higher domestic earnings  primarily due to reduced depreciation expense at the geysers  and the start up of indonesian operations 
diversified businesses agricultural products manufactures and markets nitrogen based fertilizers for wholesale markets to the western united states and to the pacific rim 
carbon and minerals produces and markets petroleum coke other than on the west coast  graphites  solvents and specialty minerals 
pipelines principally includes the company s equity interests in affiliated pipeline companies 
other includes the development and sale of real estate assets and the company s equity interest in the uno ven company  a refining and marketing partnership in the midwestern united states 
millions of dollars net earnings excluding special items agricultural products carbon and minerals pipelines other total special items agricultural products pipelines other net earnings including special items in  agricultural products continued to benefit from significant increases in ammonia and urea product sales prices primarily due to high demand in international markets 
this was partially offset by higher raw materials costs and higher manufacturing costs due to start up expenses associated with an ammonia plant located in finley  washington 
plant improvements were completed and production began in december production from the finley plant is targeted for domestic markets 
this will allow more of the kenai  alaska facility s marketable production of ammonia and urea to target international markets 
comparing the agricultural products earnings with  the increase reflected considerably higher margins on sales of ammonia and urea products  particularly in asian markets 
in  carbon and minerals benefited from higher petroleum coke and lanthanide earnings 
the increase in from was primarily due to higher lanthanide earnings 
corporate and unallocated millions of dollars net earnings effect excluding special items administrative and general expense net interest expense environmental and litigation expense other total special items environmental and litigation provisions tax adjustments other receivable write down other write downs of assets other asset sales other mesa settlement other restructuring costs a g uoc lease termination other net earnings effect including special items the higher administrative and general expense in was primarily due to the income tax effect of allocable expenses to foreign operations for tax purposes and lower pension income 
net interest expense represents interest income and expense  net of capitalized interest 
the increase in was primarily due to higher debt  while the decrease in reflected the benefit of refinancing debt at lower interest rates 
the other category includes all unallocated corporate items and miscellaneous operations 
in addition  this category  especially in prior years  includes the earnings effects and close down expenses of businesses that were sold or being phased out  such as the company s process  technology and licensing business sold in  national auto truckstop system sold in  imperial valley geothermal operations sold in  puregro chemical operations sold in  and southeast marketing operations phased out beginning in 
this category also includes corporate items such as tax adjustments and certain special items noted in the above table 
financial condition dollars in millions current ratio total debt    equity    capital employed    total debt capital employed floating rate debt total debt cash flow from operating activities  including working capital and other changes  was  million in   million in and  million in the amount included million of proceeds from the sale of trade receivables see note to the consolidated financial statements  million from the columbia settlement and million from the ocs settlement 
these benefits were more than offset by temporary working capital changes 
the cash flow reflected decreased working capital requirements and significant income tax refunds received during the year 
these benefits were partially offset by lower operational earnings 
the amount reflected significant payments for legal and tax settlements and an adjustment for a crude oil forward sale 
during  the company generated million in pretax proceeds from sales of assets  primarily nonstrategic oil and gas properties and the company s process  technology and licensing business 
proceeds from sales of assets in totaled million  primarily from the sale of nonstrategic oil and gas properties 
proceeds of million in included million from the sale of the imperial valley and other geothermal assets  million from the sale of the company s national auto truckstop system and million from the sale of various nonstrategic oil and gas properties 
in and  the company also generated approximately million and million  respectively  in cash from the sale of its common stock  primarily through the dividend reinvestment and common stock purchase plan 
the company s total debt at year end increased by million from a year ago to  million 
the increase was primarily due to the carrying values of debt related currency swaps in the amount of million being classified as long term receivables at december  as a result  the principal amounts of the company s foreign currency debt  when stated at the current exchange rates  totaled million  an increase of million from year end the difference between the carrying values of the currency swaps and the increase in the principal amounts of the related foreign currency debt represents the net gain that would have occurred if the currency swaps and debt had been settled at the end of december this classification has no effect on the consolidated cash flow statement 
for  the company expects cash generated from operational earnings and asset sales to be adequate to meet its operating requirements  capital spending and dividend payments 
in addition  the company has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash requirements 
at december   the company had approximately billion of undrawn commitments under various credit facilities with major banks 
the company s foreign operations have limited exposures to foreign currency risks 
in most countries  energy products are valued and sold in us dollars  and foreign currency operating cost exposures have not been significant 
in the philippines and thailand  the company is paid for product deliveries in the local currencies  but at prices indexed to us dollar valuations 
such funds  less amounts required for local currency denominated obligations  are converted to us dollars as soon as practicable and periodically remitted to the us parent 
the company s canadian subsidiary is paid in canadian dollars for its crude oil and natural gas sales 
excess canadian funds generally have been invested in other unocal foreign operations rather than remitted to the us parent 
the company has only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments 
the majority are debt related and are used to manage interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks 
the company also uses futures contracts to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in petroleum commodity prices 
such contracts covered less than one percent of the company s annual oil and gas production at year end authorization from the board of directors is needed before the company hedges more than of its production of oil and gas  refined products  and of crude oil purchased for refinery supply 
capital expenditures estimated millions of dollars exploration and production domestic foreign total refining  marketing and transportation products company geothermal and power operations diversified businesses agricultural products carbon and minerals pipeline other corporate and unallocated total     capital spending in on foreign oil and gas exploration and production was up percent compared with  primarily reflecting increased expenditures in myanmar  indonesia  the netherlands and azerbaijan 
the million spent by products company during primarily reflected refinery upgrades to complete environmental requirements for reformulated gasoline required by the california air resources board  and the addition of refinery units to increase production of higher value products 
capital spending on geothermal energy projects in primarily focused on development work at the salak field on the island of java and exploration drilling on the island of sumatra  in indonesia 
the forecasted capital expenditures will focus on development of overseas oil and gas projects  particularly in myanmar  thailand  indonesia and azerbaijan 
this capital plan reflects unocal s continued emphasis on energy development projects overseas with higher potential rates of return 
the foreign petroleum exploration and production capital spending plan is up percent from the amount 
a major focus of this spending will be the yadana field development and pipeline project offshore myanmar 
this natural gas project is expected to be in operation by mid in thailand  the company plans to develop its existing fields in order to increase natural gas production capacity  as a second pipeline from the gulf of thailand to shore is being constructed by the thai government 
in indonesia  the company plans to further develop new oil and gas reserves offshore east kalimantan and accelerate its successful exploratory drilling program by drilling to exploratory wells in known producing basins as the first phase of a well  multi year program 
another important overseas project is in the caspian sea  offshore azerbaijan 
unocal is a member of an international consortium that is moving forward with a development program to begin initial oil production by mid the louisiana gulf of mexico area accounts for percent of the domestic capital budget  as the company moves ahead with development of key natural gas projects 
the capital spending plan for petroleum exploration and production includes million for worldwide exploration 
of this  million  or percent  is planned for projects near existing operations that have a high potential for success 
planned capital expenditures for products company in are down percent from the allocated capital for this segment has been significantly reduced since refinery modifications have been completed to manufacture california mandated reformulated gasoline 
of the amount  about million is planned for marketing operations  mostly for the addition of new profit centers to existing locations  such as convenience stores  car washes  quick service restaurants and car maintenance services 
another million is planned for the company s california refineries on projects to enhance profitability and meet environmental regulations 
capital expenditures for geothermal and power operations are expected to more than double in  focusing on projects in indonesia 
the company expects to accelerate development of resource production facilities at the salak field and conduct additional exploration at the sarulla contract area on the island of sumatra 
the company also expects to be a percent owner in a venture that expects to build and operate power plants at the salak field that will utilize its steam production 
the decrease in agricultural products capital spending in reflects reduced expenditures for the startup of the finley  washington  ammonia manufacturing plant 
the planned increase in capital spending for carbon and minerals reflects anticipated projects at the mountain pass  chicago carbon and poco graphite facilities 
environmental matters unocal continues to make substantial capital and operating expenditures for environmental protection and to comply with federal  state and local laws and provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment 
in many cases  investigatory or remedial work is now required at various sites even though past operations followed practices and procedures that were considered acceptable under environmental laws and regulations  if any  existing at the time 
in  the company recorded approximately million in environment related capital expenditures  compared with an average of approximately million per year for the prior three years 
estimated capital expenditures for environment related costs are million 
the capital expenditures for and included significant amounts for refinery modifications to manufacture reformulated gasoline for the california market 
no significant capital expenditures related to reformulated gasoline are anticipated in the amount charged to earnings for remediation costs and for operating  maintenance and administrative costs to maintain environmental compliance was approximately million  and such costs averaged approximately million per year for the prior three years  including million in the amount charged to earnings included provisions of million for certain known future environmental remediation costs  of which million was recorded in the fourth quarter of the fourth quarter provision was primarily the result of an extensive and ongoing review by the company of its reserves for environmental assessment remediation costs and its procedures for monitoring such reserves 
in  the company s continuing review identified additional future remediation costs which resulted in provisions of million that were included in the amount charged to earnings 
at december   the company s reserves for environmental remediation obligations totaled million  of which million was included in other current liabilities 
the total reserve amount is grouped into five categories and discussed below 
superfund and similar sites 
at year end  unocal had received notification from the federal environmental protection agency that the company may be a potentially responsible party prp at sites and may share certain liabilities at these sites 
in addition  various state agencies and private parties had identified other similar prp sites that may require investigation and remediation 
of the total  the company has denied responsibility at sites and at another sites the company s liability  although unquantified  appears to be de minimis 
the total also includes sites which are under investigation or in litigation  for which the company s potential liability is not presently determinable 
of the remaining sites  where probable costs can be reasonably estimated  reserves of million had been established for future remediation and settlement costs 
these sites are exclusive of sites where the company s liability has been settled or where the company has no evidence of liability and there has been no further indication of liability by government agencies or third parties for at least a month period 
unocal does not consider the number of sites for which it has been named a prp as a relevant measure of liability 
although the liability of a prp is generally joint and several  the company is usually just one of several companies designated as a prp 
the company s ultimate share of the remediation costs at those sites often is not determinable due to many unknown factors as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the solvency of other responsible parties and disputes regarding responsibilities may also impact the company s ultimate costs 
former company operated sites 
reserves of million had been established for this category of sites 
of the total  million was for approximately service station sites on leased properties at which operations have ceased and which the company is obligated to remediate before returning them to the owners 
also included was million for approximately service station sites that the company previously owned or leased 
the current owners of such properties are holding the company responsible for environmental remediation costs 
company facilities sold with retained liabilities 
this category had reserves of million for accrued environmental liabilities related to major company assets that were sold in prior years 
included are the company s former auto truckstop facilities  a former mine site in wyoming  industrial chemical and polymer sites and agricultural chemical sites 
in each sale  the company retained a contractual remediation or indemnification obligation and is responsible only for certain environmental problems associated with its past operations 
the reserves represent presently estimated future costs for investigation feasibility studies and identified remediation work as a result of claims made by buyers of the properties 
also included are reserves for the remediation of certain facilities which were transferred to the uno ven company in in connection with its formation 
the facilities included the chicago refinery and related product terminals and service stations 
under the uno ven asset purchase and contribution agreement  the company retained certain environmental liabilities that would require unocal to either manage remediation work or reimburse uno ven for remediation costs resulting from valid environmental claims 
the agreement required all claims to be filed by november  the company has not completely evaluated the additional claims made by uno ven near or on the november  deadline  however  it does not anticipate that any additional material liabilities beyond the current reserves will be incurred for these claims 
inactive or closed company facilities 
reserves of million had been established for these types of facilities 
major sites included in this category are the former beaumont refinery in texas and the shale oil project and a chemical facility in colorado 
also included in this category is the questa molybdenum mine in new mexico 
in the second quarter of  an additional million was added to the reserve for the estimated costs of investigations and remedial activities for the questa site 
this category also includes the cleanup at the guadalupe oil field on the central california coast of underground releases of a diesel like additive formerly used to produce the field s heavy crude oil 
during  an additional reserve of million was provided for estimated costs to complete the beach cleanup and for assessing and investigating the inland portion of the field 
at year end  the reserve that had been established for the above activities had been fully utilized 
the company expects to incur additional  but indeterminate  costs for continuing assessment  investigation and remediation of the inland portion of the field 
also included in this category is the avila beach  california site 
in  petroleum hydrocarbon contamination under the front street section of the town was discovered 
it was determined that the source of the contamination had been leaking pipelines that ran between a tank farm and wharf operated by the company 
the company has installed interim systems as an initial remediation measure until a final remedial action plan is completed and implemented 
the company is currently developing a plan that will be submitted by mid to the regional water quality control board for approval 
the plan will outline the procedures that will be used to determine the desired alternatives for the site s final remediation 
the future costs related to the final remediation will not be determined until these alternatives are identified 
the year end reserve included the estimated remaining cost for the excavation of one section of the beach where contaminants were detected close to the surface of the sand during the company s third quarter testing and monitoring of the site 
the company completed the cleanup of this area in january as required by a state order 
active company facilities 
the company had provided million for estimated future costs of remedial orders  corrective actions and other investigation  remediation and monitoring obligations at certain operating facilities and producing oil and gas fields 
the operating facilities primarily consist of refineries  marketing terminals and bulk plants 
the total environmental remediation reserves recorded on the consolidated balance sheet represent the company s estimate of assessment and remediation costs based on currently available facts  existing technology  and presently enacted laws and regulations 
the remediation cost estimates  in many cases  are based on plans recommended to the regulatory agencies for approval and are subject to future revisions 
the ultimate costs to be incurred will likely exceed the total amounts reserved  since many of the sites are relatively early in the remedial investigation or feasibility study phase 
additional liabilities may be accrued as the assessment work is completed and formal remedial plans are formulated 
the company estimated  to the extent it was able to do so  that it could incur approximately million of additional costs in excess of the million accrued at december  the amount of such possible additional costs reflects  in most cases  the high end of the range of costs of feasible alternatives identified by the company for those sites with respect to which investigation or feasibility studies have advanced to the stage of analyzing such alternatives 
however  such estimated possible additional costs are not an estimate of the total remediation costs beyond the amounts reserved  since at a large number of sites the company is not yet in a position to estimate such possible additional costs 
both the amounts reserved and estimates of possible additional costs may change in the near term  in some cases  substantially  as additional information becomes available regarding the nature and extent of site contamination  required or agreed upon remediation methods  and other actions by governmental agencies and private parties 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
future accounting change the financial accounting standards board recently issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the new requirements under sfas no 
are generally effective for financial statements 
companies must either expense the value of stock based compensation or disclose in a footnote what the earnings and earnings per share would be had the value been expensed 
the company expects to adopt the disclosure method 
at adoption  the effect on earnings and earnings per share is not expected to be material 
outlook certain of the statements in this discussion  as well as other forward looking statements within this document  contain estimates and projections of amounts of or increases in future revenues  earnings  cash flows  capital expenditures  assets  liabilities and other financial items and of future levels of or increases in reserves  production  sales including related costs and prices  and other statistical items  plans and objectives of management regarding the company s future operations  products and services  and certain assumptions underlying such estimates  projection plans and objectives 
while these forward looking statements are made in good faith  future operating  market  competitive  legal  economic  political  environmental  and other conditions and events could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
crude oil prices are expected to be unstable in because of the uncertain effect of the united nations seeming willingness to allow a partial resumption of oil exports from iraq 
however  domestic natural gas prices are expected to remain strong in early  at least until the winter selling season is over and natural gas inventories within the industry are replenished 
the sale of the company s california oil and gas producing properties is expected to be completed in april the proceeds are expected to be used to reduce debt and fund capital projects overseas 
the sale includes unocal s interests in oil and gas fields  including producing platforms off the california coast in state and federal waters 
unocal s average net daily production from the properties in the proposed sale was  barrels of oil and million cubic feet mmcf of natural gas during  and proven reserves of million barrels of oil equivalent at year end for  unocal s california oil and gas producing properties generated pretax operating earnings and cash flow of approximately million and million  respectively 
unocal has approximately employees involved in its california oil and gas operations 
while many of those employees will be offered positions with the buyer or at other unocal operations  some layoffs are expected see note for additional information 
the sale of these producing properties is not expected to have a material effect on unocal s future operating results 
on a worldwide basis  daily natural gas production is expected to average nearly billion cubic feet  up slightly from crude oil and condensate production is expected to average  barrels per day  down from  last year 
the company anticipates an approximate percent increase in foreign natural gas production in this improvement is expected mainly from a significant increase in the company s gulf of thailand production beginning in the second quarter of  when the petroleum authority of thailand s new pipeline comes on stream 
also  oil and gas production should continue to improve in indonesia as a result of successful exploration and development programs that have revitalized operations 
for  the company expects domestic crude oil and natural gas production to be lower  reflecting the expected completion of the sale of its california producing oil and gas properties and continued natural production declines 
the company will continue to focus on domestic natural gas production in the louisiana gulf coast area 
the company is in the process of retaining an advisor to assist in the disposal of its oil and gas interests in the netherlands sector of the north sea as it continues to shift its strategic focus to southeast asia and other areas that offer greater opportunities for growth 
unocal s net daily production from its netherlands operations in was  barrels of crude oil and condensate and mmcf of natural gas 
in thailand  the company expects to spend approximately million on development projects that should allow the company to sustain gross production at mmcf of natural gas per day once a second pipeline becomes operational in the planned production for is expected to average mmcf per day gross 
natural gas demand in thailand is expected to continue its active growth over the next to years  providing a market for the increased production from the gulf of thailand 
unocal is currently pursuing growth opportunities in central and southeast asia 
the main areas of oil and gas exploration and development opportunities are in azerbaijan  myanmar  turkmenistan  pakistan  china and vietnam 
in azerbaijan  unocal is part of an international consortium participating in the development of three oil fields in the caspian sea offshore azerbaijan 
unocal has a percent interest in the project 
initial production is expected to begin in mid this is a major  long term commitment for unocal 
there are still difficult issues to resolve as to the route and construction of permanent export pipelines for the oil 
a major focus of capital spending will be the yadana project offshore myanmar 
this natural gas project  which is to include four offshore platforms  should be in operation by mid when fully developed  estimated gross production in is expected to reach mmcf of natural gas per day 
the majority of the production is to be sold under a year gas sales contract and a pipeline agreement calling for natural gas deliveries of mmcf per day to thailand beginning in mid a separate sales agreement calls for mmcf per day of natural gas to be supplied to myanmar for its domestic use 
unocal has a percent interest in the yadana project 
in march  unocal announced the discovery of a potentially significant new gas field located about six miles south of the yadana field in the andaman sea 
further studies are under way to prove the commerciality of this new offshore discovery 
the field could be produced through the yadana platform complex 
unocal has the same percentage ownership and partners in this discovery as it has in the yadana project 
the united states congress is currently considering legislation that could ban united states companies from all business activities associated with myanmar 
this action  if passed  would adversely effect the company s future prospects in that country 
the company will continue to expand its marketing operations at retail outlets with the addition of new businesses to certain existing locations  such as convenience stores  car washes  quick service restaurants and car maintenance services 
the company is also working to increase gasoline retail sales volumes by installing credit card readers at the dispensers and reconfiguring the service islands 
in february  unocal entered into a strategic alliance with fleetman  inc to market fuelman fleet cards 
also  unocal signed a memorandum of understanding with southern counties oil company cardlock fuels system which could lead to joint construction  development and operation of unattended commercial fueling facilities throughout california 
these agreements position the company as a leader in the west coast commercial fleet fuel business 
to improve the company s standing in markets outside california and hawaii  unocal is actively pursuing joint ventures and alliances 
in october  unocal and circle k corporation circle k  one of the nation s leading convenience store operators  signed a branding licensing agreement for more than circle k sites in the phoenix and tucson  arizona markets 
in addition  the company plans to brand and supply existing circle k sites in las vegas  nevada  and the two companies plan to co develop new service station convenience store sites in the las vegas area 
in february  tosco corporation  a petroleum refiner and marketer  announced that it had entered into a merger agreement with circle k 
the upgrades to the company s refineries are now complete and higher valued products are being produced along with the new reformulated gasolines that meet california standards 
on the retail marketing side  the company foresees improved margins on the california reformulated gasolines that must be sold at retail sites by june  in addition  the increased gasoline throughput and returns from its reformatted service stations are meeting or exceeding the company s forecasts 
however  the ultimate effect on product margins of the new gasolines cannot be accurately predicted 
in february  the company was granted a united states patent for reformulated gasolines that meet the california standards 
six refining companies filed suit against unocal in april to invalidate the patent or declare it unenforceable 
the company intends to aggressively defend its rights under this patent 
in indonesia  the geothermal and power operations segment expects to accelerate development of resource production facilities at the salak field on the island of java 
the company also expects to be a percent owner in a venture that expects to build and operate new power plants at this field 
unocal will supply steam for the power plants 
the company also plans to conduct additional exploration in the sarulla block on the island of sumatra  after a discovery well indicated a highly productive geothermal resource 
the company had previously negotiated a power sales agreement that allows it to develop up to  megawatts of generating capacity in the sarulla block 
the first of the unocal power plants is expected to begin operation in  assuming the commerciality of the field 
the company is also pursuing other geothermal development and power generation opportunities throughout indonesia 
the geothermal segment expects to benefit from improved earnings in from operations at the geysers in northern california 
the earnings were adversely affected by seven months of discretionary curtailments by the public utility that purchases the steam 
such curtailments are not expected in in  the company is scheduled to begin a project to inject waste water from municipal treatment plants to recharge the reservoir 
this injection project should increase the productivity of the field 
in  the agricultural products segment expects continued high sales volumes of ammonia and urea 
approximately  additional tons per year of ammonia is expected to be available for sale due to new production from the finley  washington plant and higher production from the kenai  alaska facility 
the segment plans to expand sales efforts in its existing markets in south korea  japan  china and vietnam 
the company also plans to develop new markets in india 
the carbon and minerals segment will continue to expand specialty graphite products and will begin production of higher margin minerals 
also  primarily due to increased molybdenum prices  the questa mine is expected to resume operations in late  after being idle for approximately ten years 
this mine is expected to produce about million pounds of molybdenum per year when it reaches full production 
carbon and minerals will continue to look for new products and expansion opportunities in order to provide earnings growth
