item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations compared to net sales decreased approximately in to million from million in due to decreases in insurance laboratory and kit revenue  partially offset by increases in healthcare clinical and substance abuse testing laboratory revenues 
insurance laboratory revenues declined due to decreases in the volume and price of tests performed 
the total number of insurance applicants tested by labone during decreased as compared to this decline was due to market competition  a reduction in the total number of life insurance applications written in the industry  and regulations restricting the use of laboratory testing for underwriting of medical insurance 
average revenue per applicant declined primarily due to a decrease in prices as a result of continued competitive pressures 
during the fourth quarter  labone initiated a price stabilization plan 
the purpose of the plan was to increase prices by promoting service 
the initial result of this action was a slight increase in the average revenue per applicant 
however  prices subsequently declined during healthcare revenues were million during  as compared to million in cost of sales increased million in as compared to the prior year 
this increase is due to increases in payroll and outside lab services related to clinical and substance abuse testing  and labone service center lsc expenses 
lsc expenses increased due to the lsc expansion as well as a write off for closing nonperforming locations 
these were partially offset by decreases in lab one canada expenses due to closing the laboratory in lab one canada continues to market testing services with laboratory testing performed in the united states 
healthcare costs of sales expenses were million during  as compared to million in in september  labone reduced staff by resulting in additional expenses of million 
the work force reduction was considered necessary to improve the cost structure of its insurance testing operations and meet clients requirements for lower cost laboratory services 
it is expected the annual savings from the reduction in staff and lsc locations will result in labor savings and reduced lsc operating expenses of million 
as a result of the above factors  gross profit decreased from million in to million in selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million in as compared to the prior year  primarily due to expenses related to the one time restructuring charge of million incurred in see compared to depreciation and maintenance expenses also declined in these declines were partially offset by increases in commission  bad debt and third party billing expenses 
healthcare overhead expenses were million during  as compared to million in operating income fell from million in to million in the million reduction is primarily attributable to a million decrease in the insurance segment operating income and a million increase in the healthcare segment operating loss 
nonoperating income increased million due to an increase in investment income  partially offset by an increase in other expenses 
the effective income tax rate increased from during to in due primarily to a tax adjustment related to the closure of the horl uk operations and a tax adjustment related to repatriation of foreign sourced income 
the combined effect of the above factors resulted in net earnings of million  or per share  in the year ended december   as compared to million  or per share  in the same period last year 
compared to healthcare clinical and substance abuse testing expenses disclosed in this section have been modified to conform with current year presentation based on segment reporting requirements for net sales decreased approximately in to million from million in  primarily due to a decrease in laboratory revenue 
laboratory testing revenue decreased as the result of an decrease in the number of applicants tested and a decrease in the average revenue per applicant 
average revenue per applicant decreased primarily due to a decrease in prices as a result of continued competitive pressures 
the total volume of applicants tested decreased primarily due to a decline in the number of life insurance applications written in the industry 
healthcare laboratory testing generated revenue of million during insurance kit revenue decreased million due to lower sales volumes 
cost of sales decreased  or million  in from the prior year 
this is primarily due to decreases in insurance kit expenses  depreciation and amortization expense  and net postage expense 
insurance kit expenses decreased due to the lower sales volumes 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in payroll and healthcare expansion expenses 
cost of sales expenses related to the healthcare expansion were million in as a result of the above factors  gross profit decreased from million in to million in selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in due primarily to expenses related to the third quarter restructuring charge of million  which includes charges for consolidating canadian laboratory operations into the kansas facility and for severance payments resulting from elimination of several insurance testing administrative positions 
these changes resulted in future annual cost savings of million due to elimination of canadian laboratory payroll and a reduction in depreciation and us administrative payroll expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses related to the healthcare expansion were million in operating income fell from million in to million in the million reduction is primarily attributable to a million decrease in the insurance segment operating income and a million operating loss in the healthcare segment 
other income expense  net increased million primarily due to recovery of a nonoperating expense from the prior year 
the effective income tax rate declined from during to in due primarily to tax adjustments related to the closure of the horl uk operations and certain us tax adjustments 
the combined effect of the above factors resulted in net earnings of million  or per share  in the year ended december   as compared to million  or per share  in trends the following is management s analysis of certain existing trends that have been identified as potentially affecting the future financial results of the company 
due to the potential for a rapid rate of change in any number of factors associated with the insurance and healthcare laboratory testing industries  it is difficult to quantify with any degree of certainty labone s future volumes  sales or net earnings 
in the last several years  there has been a decline in the number of life insurance applications written in the industry 
in addition  the insurance laboratory testing industry continues to be highly competitive 
the primary focus of the competition has been on pricing 
labone continues to maintain its market leadership by providing quality products and services at competitive prices 
management expects prices and volume may continue to decline during due to competitive pressures and a reduction in the number of life insurance applications written 
these trends may have a continuing material impact on earnings from operations 
during december  the fda gave premarket approval to epitope  inc with respect to its specimen collection kit for oral fluid hiv antibody testing 
in december  epitope announced that the fda had issued a letter stating that the oral fluid western blot test was approvable as a confirmation for the oral fluid hiv antibody test 
if approved  this may allow for the initial screen and the western blot confirmation test to be performed on the same specimen 
due to the lower collection expense associated with oral fluid collection devices  the potential exists for an expansion of the testing market 
currently  there are approximately million individual life insurance policies sold in the united states annually 
however  laboratory services are provided on only approximately million of these policy applicants 
the noninvasive nature of oral specimen collection allows for low cost agent collection  making testing much more affordable on smaller face value insurance policies 
conversely  the device also has the potential to cannibalize part of the existing blood and urine testing market 
the net impact of oral fluid testing cannot be determined at this time 
there are companies currently developing and seeking fda approval for home hiv test products 
if approved  these products would allow individuals to confidentially determine their hiv status prior to applying for insurance 
to avoid accepting these high risk policies  the insurance companies may elect to lower the threshold at which laboratory tests are requested to prevent writing policies on hiv positive applicants 
most insurance laboratory testing is performed on policies of  or greater  representing about one third of all policy applicants 
the  to  range represents approximately one quarter of current insurance policy applicants 
if the fda does approve any home testing kit for hiv  the potential exists for a significant expansion of laboratory testing for lower policy amounts 
labone entered the clinical and samhsa certified substance abuse testing markets during the company continues to add new customers in both fields 
the company s lab card program covered approximately  lives at december   including the guardian life insurance company of america the guardian and principal healthcare of kansas city principal 
the guardian has stated its intention to roll out the lab card program in states covering approximately  additional lives starting in the second or third quarter liquidity and capital resources labone s working capital position declined from million at december   to million at december  this decrease is the result of dividends paid and capital additions exceeding cash provided by operations and net maturities of long term investments 
net cash provided by operations increased by million  primarily a result of conversion of short term investments  partially offset by the decrease in net earnings 
during  labone paid quarterly dividends of per common share 
the board of directors reviews this policy on a periodic basis 
the total amount of dividends paid during was per share  or million 
although cash dividends paid currently exceed net cash provided by operations  there are no immediate restrictions that would limit the company s ability to make future dividend payments 
in  labone s board authorized the company to enter the market from time to time for the purpose of acquiring shares of the company s common stock in an amount not to exceed million 
as of december   the company had acquired  shares of labone as treasury stock at a total cost of million  leaving million for potential future stock purchases 
no shares have been purchased since during  the company invested million in additional property  plant and equipment  as compared to million in and million in of the amounts spent in and  approximately million and million  respectively  were for the diversification into the clinical and substance abuse testing markets 
additional investments in property  plant and equipment in are expected to be consistent with the amount spent in at december   the company had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
the company had no short term borrowings during the company has an unsecured line of credit of million that may be used for general corporate purposes  of which the full amount is currently available 
labone s line of credit has a stated rate equivalent to the prime rate which was at december  there are no debt restrictions related to this line of credit 
management expects to be able to fund operations  capital asset additions  treasury stock purchases  if any  and future dividend payments from a combination of cash flow  cash reserves and short term borrowings 
total cash and investments at december   were million  as compared to million at december  included in labone s investments at year end are million of short term investments classified as trading securities and recorded at market value

in february  labone was advised by seafield capital corporation seafield that seafield had retained alex 
brown sons incorporated as financial adviser to assist seafield in considering strategic alternatives to maximize seafield shareholder value 
seafield is a holding company that owns of labone  as well as a number of other investments and cash equivalents 
labone has been informed that one alternative seafield expects to pursue is a cash option merger of seafield into labone 
in such a merger  seafield shareholders would have the option of receiving cash as well as shares of labone 
the merger would most likely be preceded by seafield s distribution to its shareholders  or other disposition by seafield  of its other assets 
seafield s board of directors has also announced that it will consider other business combination proposals that are presented to it 
labone has appointed a special committee of independent directors to consider any merger or other proposal that may be presented to it by seafield 
labone has been advised by seafield that if a definitive merger agreement is reached  it is anticipated that such a merger would not occur until late because of the time required to complete anticipated seafield asset sales as well as shareholder and other approvals 
there can be no assurance that a merger with seafield will occur 
pending accounting pronouncements labone will be required to implement statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  in labone does not presently expect to adopt the optional accounting treatment based on the estimated fair value of employee stock options allowed by sfas no 
however  presentation of pro forma disclosures of net earnings and earnings per share as if the optional accounting method had been utilized will be required in
