in february  the company acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain specified liabilities of polyscan  a developer of laser direct imaging systems for large area pattern generation applications 
beginning in fiscal  etec s new management team focused on reducing overhead  achieving manufacturing efficiencies and improving the company s operating and capital structure  while continuing to develop and market its electron beam and laser beam systems 
through management s efforts  the company improved its margins and restructured its capitalization  thereby reducing debt and interest expense
