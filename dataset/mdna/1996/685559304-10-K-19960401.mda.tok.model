as at june   there were approximately  of unused loss carryforwards which expire in which can be used to offset future taxable income of the parent company only 
the effective tax rate of in fiscal was due principally to losses associated with the sale of the company s semiconductor segment during the prior fiscal year which were not available for utilization until the current fiscal year  and the utilization of the carry forward of certain losses incurred by that segment in prior fiscal years 
certain material trends despite continued profitability in  the company s electronic segment continues to face a difficult business by increasing pressure on the company s prices for its sole source sales and a general reduction in the level of funding for the defense sector 
the company s electronic segment is continuing to seek new contracts which require up front design  engineering  prototype and preproduction costs 
while the segment attempts to negotiate contract awards for reimbursement of product development  there is no assurance that sufficient monies will be set aside by the government for such effort 
in addition  even if the government agrees to reimburse development costs  there is still a significant risk of cost overrun which may not be reimbursable 
furthermore  once the company has completed the design and preproduction stage  there is no assurance that funding will be provided for future production 
the electronics segment is heavily dependent upon military spending as a source of revenues and income 
world events have led the government of the united states to reevaluate the level of military spending necessary for national security 
any significant reductions in the level of military spending by the federal government could have a negative impact on the electronics segment s future revenues and earnings 
in july  the company acquired the assets of panda  an importer and distributor of women s activewear and outer wear and in may  started up the east end subsidiary  an importer of women s outer wear and sportswear which operation was merged into the east west division in december and constitutes the company s united states apparel segment 
a majority of the business of both the united states and the canadian apparel segment is associated with the sale of outer wear 
the third and fourth quarters are generally the primary selling seasons for outer wear sales 
furthermore  where sale of outer wear constitutes a significant percentage of such segment s business  the first and second quarters are historically weak periods since its customers do not generally request shipment of merchandise during this time 
despite the continued market acceptance of its established lines  a weakened economy in the united states and canada could have an adverse impact on the apparel segments revenues and earnings 
the apparel segments large customers include many of the major department stores which may be vulnerable in a weakened economy 
in addition  the financial problems experienced by many retailers has impacted revenues due to credit concerns of the financial community 
these factors have contributed to a very weak and uncertain apparel and retail sector 
these present conditions  if they continue  could have a negative impact on the operations of the apparel segment in future quarters
