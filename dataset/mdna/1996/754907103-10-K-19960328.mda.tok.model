item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note segment information of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
timber and wood products rayonier s timber and wood products business segment is composed of three principal lines of business log trading and merchandising  timberlands management and stumpage and wood products 
sales for the last three years by principal line of business were as follows in millions of dollars sales timber and wood products log trading and merchandising timberlands management and stumpage wood products intrasegment eliminations total log trading and merchandising rayonier is a leading supplier and exporter of softwood logs 
the sale of logs accounted for approximately percent of the timber and wood products segment s sales in rayonier buys and harvests timber stumpage cutting rights to standing timber principally in northwest north america from third parties as well as from company sources on an arms length basis  competitively auctioned or negotiated 
the company also purchases  merchandises and sells purchased logs from new zealand  both domestically in new zealand as well as in export markets 
in  percent of new zealand s sales came from company managed timberlands 
in north america  percent of sales was directly sourced from rayonier s timberlands  however  additional logs were purchased from local dealers who had  in turn  purchased their cutting rights from the company s timberland stumpage sales 
the logs harvested and purchased are sold into export markets primarily japan  korea and china  as well as to pulp and lumber mills in domestic markets 
the company also trades canadian  chilean and russian timber 
during  approximately percent of the revenues rayonier derived from the sale of logs were from logs sold to export markets 
timberlands management and stumpage rayonier manages timberlands  scientifically growing and nurturing tree stands until their economic peak for specific markets 
the average rotation age for timber destined for export markets from the northwestern united states is years primarily hemlock and douglas fir species 
the average rotation age for timber from the southeastern united states is years for timber sold to sawmills and years for pulpwood destined for pulp and paper mills 
the company manages its timberlands on a sustainable yield basis in conformity with forest industry practices 
the company is organized to regularly sell timber stumpage in north america through auction processes predominately to third parties 
by requiring the company s other business sectors eg  specialty pulp products  wood products and log trading and merchandising to competitively bid on the stumpage  the company believes it can maximize the true economic return on its investment 
another key to the success of the company s management of timberlands has been the extensive application of rayonier s silvicultural expertise to species selection for plantations  soil preparation  thinning of timber stands  pruning of selected species and careful timing of harvest  all designed to maximize growth and forest yields while responding to environmental needs 
as of december   rayonier managed approximately million acres of timberlands  with approximately  acres or percent located in the southeastern united states  approximately  acres or percent located in the pacific northwest see rayonier timberlands  lp and approximately  acres or percent located in new zealand 
the  acres of southeastern timberlands are located primarily in georgia and florida 
their proximity to a large number of pulp  paper and lumber mills results in significant competition for the purchase of rayonier s timber 
approximately  acres are owned in fee and  acres are held under long term leases 
the southeastern timberlands include approximately  acres of pine plantations   acres of hardwood lands and  non forest acres representing main line and access roads and other acreage not suitable for forest development 
approximately percent of the timber harvest is pulpwood  which is destined for pulp mills  with the remaining percent representing higher value sawlogs  which are sold to sawmills 
over the last five years the company  through advanced silvicultural practices  has been able to increase the amount of timber volume per acre available for harvest from its southeastern timberlands by approximately percent per year and expects this trend to continue 
the  acres of the company s northwestern timberlands are located primarily on the olympic peninsula in washington state  are all owned in fee and consist almost entirely of second growth trees 
these timberlands include approximately  acres of softwood stands  approximately percent of which is hemlock and percent douglas fir  western red cedar and white fir 
the northwestern timberlands also include approximately  acres of hardwood timber stands  consisting principally of alder and maple 
the remaining  acres are classified as non forest lands 
rayonier  through its wholly owned new zealand subsidiary  holds forest assets consisting primarily of crown forest licenses providing the right to utilize approximately  acres of new zealand plantation forests for a minimum period of years 
most of these timberlands consist of radiata pine trees  with a planting to harvesting time of approximately years  well suited for the highest quality lumber and panel products 
these trees typically produce up to twice as much fiber per acre  per year as the most productive commercial tree species in the united states 
rayonier grows and harvests the new zealand timber for both domestic new zealand uses and for export primarily to pacific rim markets 
rayonier seeks to maximize timberland value through reforestation and intensive silvicultural research to improve tree growth and to systematically manage the timberlands investment cycle by optimizing the economic returns on a species  site and market driven basis 
management of the company s forest resources includes the annual planting of millions of genetically improved seedlings developed at rayonier or cooperative nurseries 
wood products rayonier s two georgia lumber mills located at baxley and swainsboro convert southern yellow pine timber into dimension and specialty lumber products for residential construction and industrial uses 
the baxley mill utilizes modern and technologically advanced equipment  including computer and laser technology 
the other lumber operations an integrated complex located at swainsboro and lumber city  georgia were acquired in october they have a combined annual capacity of approximately million board feet of lumber and  in an output of approximately  tons of wood chips for pulping 
the mills sell their lumber output primarily in southeastern markets 
substantially all of the wood chip production  however  is sold at market price to rayonier s jesup  georgia pulp facility and accounted for approximately percent of jesup s pine chip consumption 
rayonier s third lumber manufacturing facility  which was acquired in  is located in plummer  idaho 
the facility consists of a lumber mill and remanufacturing plant  with annual capacity of million board feet and million board feet  respectively 
the sale of lumber accounted for approximately percent of the timber and wood products segment s sales in in addition  the company is constructing a medium density fiberboard facility in new zealand with an annual capacity of  cubic meters 
the company expects the facility to begin operations in sales of logs and lumber in the timber and wood products segment are made directly by rayonier sales personnel to customers  although sales to certain export locations are made through agents 
specialty pulp products rayonier is a leading specialty manufacturer of chemical cellulose  often called dissolving pulp  from which customers produce a wide variety of products  principally textile  industrial and filtration fibers  plastics and other chemical intermediate industrial products 
rayonier believes that it is one of the world s largest manufacturers of high grade chemical cellulose 
rayonier also manufactures fluff pulps that customers use to produce diapers and other sanitary products  and specialty paper pulps used in the manufacture of products such as filters and decorative laminates 
sales for the last three years  by principal line of business are shown below in millions of dollars sales specialty pulp products chemical cellulose fluff and specialty paper pulps total rayonier manufactures more than different grades of pulp 
the company owns and operates three wood pulp mills in jesup  georgia  fernandina beach  florida  and port angeles  washington which have an aggregate annual capacity of approximately  metric tons 
rayonier s wood pulp production facilities are able to manufacture a broad mix of products to meet customers needs 
the jesup facility  a kraft mill that began operations in and was subsequently significantly expanded and modernized  today accounts for approximately  metric tons of annual wood pulp production capacity  or percent of rayonier s current total 
the fernandina beach facility began operations in and accounts for approximately  metric tons of annual wood pulp production capacity  or percent of rayonier s current total 
the port angeles facility began operations in and accounts for approximately  metric tons of annual wood pulp production capacity  or percent of rayonier s current total 
rayonier concentrates on the production of specialty market pulps to customers specifications that are sold to industrial companies producing a wide variety of products 
over half of rayonier s pulp sales are to export customers  primarily in western europe and asia pacific 
over percent of specialty pulp sales are made directly by rayonier sales personnel 
in certain of the company s export locations  sales are made with the aid of agents 
chemical cellulose rayonier is one of the world s leading producers of chemical cellulose  often called dissolving pulp  which is a highly purified form of pulp 
chemical cellulose is used in a wide variety of products such as textile fibers  rigid packaging  photographic film  impact resistant plastics  high tenacity rayon yarn for tires and industrial hoses  pharmaceuticals  cosmetics  detergents  sausage casings  food products  thickeners for oil well drilling muds  cigarette filters  lacquers  paints  printing inks and explosives 
chemical cellulose accounted for approximately percent of the company s specialty pulp products sales in within the chemical cellulose industry  rayonier concentrates on the most highly valued  technologically demanding end uses  such as cellulose acetate and high purity cellulose ethers 
in each of these markets  rayonier believes it is the leading supplier 
fluff and specialty paper pulps rayonier believes it is one of the top five suppliers to fluff pulp users 
fluff pulp is used as an absorbent medium in products such as disposable baby diapers  personal sanitary napkins  incontinent pads  convalescent bed pads  industrial towels and wipes and non woven fabrics 
fluff pulp accounted for approximately percent of the company s pulp sales in rayonier is a major producer of specialty paper pulps and produces a small volume of regular paper pulp 
customers use rayonier s specialty paper pulps to manufacture paper for decorative laminates for counter tops  shoe innersoles  battery separators  circuit boards  air and oil filters and filter media for the food industry 
specialty paper pulp sales were percent of rayonier s total pulp sales in a small volume of regular paper pulp  approximately percent of total company pulp sales  is used in the manufacture of bond  book and printing paper 
pulp pricing pulp industry prices are cyclical 
in  specialty pulp products began to emerge from a four year down turn characterized by weak worldwide demand and excess capacity for pulp products 
demand continued to strengthen in and rayonier realized significant price increases for all of its specialty pulp products 
the prices of rayonier s pulp products generally begin to rise midway through the business cycle and lag commodity pulp price increases by up to a year 
an industry wide near term inventory correction beginning in the fourth quarter of resulted in a reduction in fluff pulp prices from earlier high levels  as well as a reduction in southeast us stumpage prices 
that trend is expected to continue into however  price increases implemented in the first quarter of for chemical cellulose products are expected to offset some of those effects in the first half of the year 
because rayonier is a non integrated market pulp producer  its high value product mix pricing trends tend to lag on both the upturn and downturn pulp and paper industry trends which are dominated by paper  paperboard and newsprint products 
over the past ten to twelve years  compared to commodity paper pulp prices  the company s price trends for fluff grades have lagged by one to two quarters and for chemical cellulose by three to four quarters 
foreign sales and operations rayonier relies on foreign markets for its pulp and timber products with approximately percent of its sales going to foreign customers during the past five years 
in  asian markets accounted for percent of us sales and western europe percent 
exports  primarily to asian markets  also accounted for percent of rayonier s new zealand sales 
the company is therefore reasonably dependent upon strong economic growth in all international markets including that of the united states 
with alternate markets in latin america and the middle east  however  the company has been able to spread its geographical risk when specific markets have entered economic recessions 
overseas assets amounted to percent of total assets as of the end of  and rayonier s sales from non us sources in were percent of total sales 
see note segment information of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
dispositions dispositions includes units and site facilities no longer considered integral to rayonier s business strategy 
this includes rayonier s wholly owned subsidiary  southern wood piedmont company swp  its interest in the grays harbor  washington  pulp and paper complex and other miscellaneous operations held for disposition 
in  rayonier provided million  pretax  for the loss on disposal of assets along with the costs for severance  demolition  and other close down items associated with the disposition of the grays harbor complex 
the company has substantially completed all programs associated with this charge except for certain environmental remediation programs 
in addition  in  rayonier discontinued the swp treated wood business 
although operations have ceased  swp is involved in several environmental remediation programs and is in negotiations with various state and federal agencies regarding the scope and timing for remaining programs 
future cost is dependent on the outcome of such negotiations and may also be affected by new laws  regulations and administrative interpretations  and changes in environmental remediation technology 
accordingly  although considerable progress on cleanup has been made  there is still uncertainty as to the timing and amount of future expenditures for completing environmental programs at grays harbor  the swp sites and certain other non operating locations 
rayonier currently estimates that expenditures for environmental remediation during will total approximately million  pretax 
as of december   rayonier had reserves of million for environmental obligations 
the company believes that any future changes in estimates  if necessary  will not materially affect its financial condition or results of operations 
rayonier timberlands  lp in the united states  rayonier manages timberlands and sells timber stumpage directly through rayonier timberlands  lp rtlp  a publicly traded master limited partnership 
rayonier and rayonier forest resources company rfr  a wholly owned subsidiary  are the general partners of rtlp 
rayonier also owns percent of the class a limited partnership units  with the remaining percent being publicly held 
revenues  expenses and cash flow associated with rtlp s normal timber harvesting are allocated percent to all class a units percent to the publicly held class a units through december  and percent to all class a units percent to the publicly held class a units thereafter 
rtlp s sales of timber after that date as well as cash flow associated with land management activities before and after that date are principally allocable to the class b limited partnership units  all of which have been retained by rayonier 
rtlp  through rayonier timberlands operating company  lp  owns  leases and manages timberlands in the southeastern and northwestern united states previously owned or leased by rayonier  sells timber stumpage from such timberlands and from time to time purchases and sells timberlands 
rtlp s timberlands provide a source of wood used in rayonier s other businesses 
since rtlp is majority owned by the company  rtlp is included in the company s consolidated financial statements as a consolidated entity 
the company s investment in rtlp as of december  was million  on the basis of historical cost 
patents rayonier has a large number of patents which relate primarily to its products and processes 
it also has pending a number of patent applications 
although  overall  rayonier s patents are of importance in the operation of its business  rayonier does not consider any of its patents or group of patents relating to a particular product or process to be of material importance from the standpoint of rayonier s total business 
competition and customers rayonier has for many years targeted the pacific rim as a market for its timber and wood products 
rayonier has been involved in the marketing of pulp products in japan since the s and in korea and china for over years 
the company s domestic timberlands are located in two major timber growing regions of the united states the southeast and the northwest  where timber markets are fragmented and very competitive 
in the northwest us  stumpage sold by john hancock mutual life insurance co 
and from washington state owned public forests are the most significant competition 
in both the northwest us and southeast us  smaller forest products companies and private land owners compete with the company 
price is the principal method of competition in this market 
export markets for rayonier s logs are equally competitive  with logs available to customers from several countries and from several suppliers within each country 
within new zealand  major competitors include carter holt harvey limited  fletcher challenge limited and new zealand forestry corporation 
weyerhaeuser company  international paper company and cavenham forest industries  inc are the principal competitors to rayonier in the log trading business 
log customers may switch species of logs from those sold by rayonier to other lower cost species sourced elsewhere 
price is the principal method of competition with respect to the acquisition of logs or stumpage for resale  and price and customer relationships are important methods of competition in the sale of logs to final customers 
rayonier s wood products  in particular lumber  compete with the products of numerous companies  many of which are larger and have greater resources than rayonier 
such lumber also competes with alternative construction materials 
in most of rayonier s markets  competition is primarily through price  quality  customer relationships and technical service 
rayonier is a major producer of specialty pulp products  including chemical cellulose  fluff and specialty paper pulps for example  pulps for filtration papers and is only a minor producer of regular paper making pulp 
the company s products are marketed worldwide against strong competition from domestic and foreign producers 
some of rayonier s major competitors are georgia pacific corporation  international paper company  weyerhaeuser company  buckeye cellulose corporation and stora kopparbergs bergslags ab 
product performance  pricing and  to a lesser extent  technical service are the principal methods of competition 
rayonier sells its pulp products primarily to a diversified group of major domestic and foreign companies 
in  percent of pulp product sales were to the us  percent to asia pacific  percent to western europe  and percent to latin america 
environmental matters see environmental regulation in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note legal proceedings of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
raw materials regional timber availability continues to be restricted by legislation  litigation and pressure from various preservationist groups 
while rayonier s timber products business has benefited from a significant increase in log and timber stumpage prices  this increase has also adversely impacted fiber costs at rayonier s port angeles pulp manufacturing facility in the northwest and more recently  fiber costs to its mills in the southeast 
rayonier has pursued  and is continuing to pursue  reductions in costs of other raw materials  supplies and contract services at the company s pulp mills 
however  the recent strength in worldwide economies has caused the prices of some of the company s process chemicals to increase above normal inflation 
management foresees no constraints in pricing or availability of its key raw materials  other than the comments concerning wood fiber and process chemicals above 
research and development rayonier believes it has one of the preeminent research facilities and staffs in the forest products industry 
rayonier has been able to utilize this research resource to enhance the marketing of its products to various customers 
for its pulp business  research and development efforts are directed primarily at the development of new and improved pulp grades  improved manufacturing efficiency  reduction of energy needs  product quality and development of improved environmental controls 
research efforts are concentrated at the rayonier research center in shelton  washington 
the company will relocate the rayonier research center to jesup  georgia  in research activities related to rayonier s forest resources operations include genetic tree improvement programs as well as applied silviculture programs to identify management practices that improve returns from the company s timberland assets 
research and development expenditures were million in and million each in and employee relations rayonier currently employs approximately  people 
of this number  approximately  are employees in the united states  of which percent are covered by labor contracts 
most hourly employees are represented by one of ten labor unions 
generally  labor relations have been maintained in a normal and satisfactory manner 
labor union contracts with rayonier represent approximately  employees at the three pulp mills and at the rayonier research center 
bargaining activity in resulted in a seven year labor agreement with the four unions that represent the hourly employees at the jesup pulp mill 
a four year agreement with the two unions that represent the hourly employees at the port angeles pulp mill was completed in january labor contracts for the fernandina pulp mill will expire in rayonier has in effect various plans which extend to its employees and retirees certain group medical  dental and life insurance coverage  pension and other benefits 
the cost of such benefit plans is borne primarily by rayonier  with the exception of health care  for which employees are responsible for approximately percent of premium costs 
item properties rtlp owns  leases or controls approximately million acres of timberlands in the united states previously owned or leased by rayonier 
see note rayonier timberlands  lp of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
rayonier  through its wholly owned subsidiary  rfr  as managing general partner of rtlp  continues on behalf of rtlp to manage such properties and sell stumpage therefrom to rayonier as well as unaffiliated parties 
rayonier s new zealand subsidiary owns or manages the forest assets on approximately  acres of plantation forests in new zealand 
rayonier and its wholly owned subsidiaries own or lease various other properties used in their operations  including three pulp mills  three lumber manufacturing facilities  a research facility  various other timberlands and rayonier s executive offices

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations segment information the amounts and relative contributions to sales and operating income attributable to each of rayonier s business segments for each of the three years ended december  were as follows in millions of dollars year ended december sales timber and wood products log trading and merchandising timberlands management and stumpage wood products intrasegment eliminations total timber and wood products specialty pulp products chemical cellulose fluff and specialty paper pulps total specialty pulp products intersegment eliminations total sales   operating income timber and wood products specialty pulp products corporate and other intersegment eliminations total before dispositions dispositions total operating income change in ownership on february   itt industries inc itt  formerly known as itt corporation  distributed all outstanding common shares of rayonier to itt stockholders  resulting in rayonier becoming an independent  publicly held company 
business conditions rayonier s net income of million  or per common share  was more than double its net income of million  or per common share 
excluding a non recurring gain on a new zealand timberland sale  earnings were million  or per common share 
the favorable results were attributable to a strong market for specialty pulp products and favorable southeast us stumpage prices 
rayonier s operating results are primarily driven by international economic factors 
in  almost percent of rayonier sales were made to customers outside the united states 
in and  strengthening economies in north america and europe resulted in increased demand and significantly higher prices for the company s specialty pulp products 
stronger domestic pulp and paper markets in turn resulted in higher prices for the company s southeast us stumpage 
however  a stagnant japanese economy and a stronger us dollar led to soft markets for northwest us stumpage and new zealand logs 
the company s operating results are cyclical  particularly for specialty pulp products 
in  specialty pulp products began to emerge from a four year down turn characterized by weak worldwide demand and excess capacity for pulp products 
demand continued to strengthen in and rayonier realized significant price increases for all of its specialty pulp products 
the prices of rayonier s pulp products generally begin to rise midway through the business cycle and lag commodity pulp price increases by up to a year 
an industry wide near term inventory correction beginning in the fourth quarter of resulted in a reduction in fluff pulp prices from earlier high levels  as well as a reduction in southeast us stumpage prices 
that trend is expected to continue into however  price increases implemented in the first quarter of for chemical cellulose products are expected to offset some of those effects in the first half of the year 
rayonier plans to increase capital spending through expansion of its new zealand operations  acquisitions and growth in the timber and wood products businesses  and quality and productivity improvements in specialty pulp products 
these investments are expected to help moderate the cyclical effects of the pulp market cycle  improve bottom of the cycle earnings and add value to existing assets 
see liquidity and capital resources 
in  rayonier transferred substantially all of its us timberlands business to rayonier timberlands  lp rtlp  a master limited partnership 
under the terms of the rtlp partnership agreement  minority unitholders currently share approximately percent of the partnership s profits 
the minority interest in rtlp s earnings was million in  million in and million in  reducing rayonier s net income by cents per share in  cents per share in and cents per share in effective january   the minority participation in the earnings of rtlp will be reduced from approximately percent to approximately percent and rayonier s participation will increase from percent to percent 
in  rayonier permanently closed the operations at its grays harbor  washington  pulp and paper complex 
the company s two remaining sulfite pulp mills in port angeles  washington  and fernandina beach  florida  face margin pressure 
the port angeles mill  in particular  incurs significantly higher wood costs than facilities in other parts of the world 
the viability of these facilities will be dependent upon the strength of pulp markets  favorable resolution of environmental issues and  for the port angeles mill  the return of northwest us wood costs to a more competitive level 
if the recent softening in pulp markets continues  if pending environmental issues are not resolved favorably or  in the case of port angeles  if wood costs do not become more competitive  rayonier may consider alternatives to operating the mills  including restructuring or closure 
at december   the net plant and equipment invested at port angeles and fernandina beach totaled million and million  respectively 
results of operations  vs 
sales and operating income sales rose percent to billion in  reflecting stronger pulp selling prices and log sales volumes 
operating income for the year was million  up percent from timber and wood products sales of timber and wood products rose percent to million  while operating income declined percent to million 
the sales improvement came in log trading and merchandising volume sold to pacific rim markets 
operating income declined primarily due to lower margins on wood products as a result of lower lumber prices and higher log costs 
the favorable effects of increased income from log trading volume and higher southeast us stumpage prices were offset by lower volume and margins from northwest us stumpage sales 
log trading and merchandising sales  which include the company s new zealand log sales  increased in due to higher volumes in both the us and new zealand 
in the us  slightly lower export prices were more than offset by increased export volume 
in new zealand strong domestic demand resulted in improved operating results despite higher operating costs caused by appreciation of the new zealand dollar 
timberlands management and stumpage sales and margins were down in  as higher southeast us prices were more than offset by lower northwest us prices and volume 
in the southeast us  increased demand from the pulp and paper industry resulted in improved stumpage prices 
overall harvest volume was relatively flat  in line with the company s harvest planning targets 
in the northwest us  weak export log markets resulted in a decline in contract prices and lower customer harvest activity 
in  lumber prices declined due to reduced domestic construction activity and higher imports of lumber from canada 
also in  wood costs increased significantly  driven by competitive demand from the pulp and paper industry 
as a result  wood products sales and operating margins declined from specialty pulp products sales of specialty pulp products rose million to million  up percent  and operating income rose million to million 
the gains resulted from higher sales prices for both fluff and chemical cellulose pulp products 
in addition  operating rates for the company s three pulp mills improved over these gains were partially offset by higher wood and chemical costs 
in  the company took several steps to enhance the competitiveness of the specialty pulp products segment 
in the third quarter  the company announced the relocation of its pulp research facility from shelton  washington  to a new million research facility at jesup  georgia  and its pulp marketing group from stamford  connecticut  to jesup  georgia 
in the fourth quarter  the company recorded a charge of million related to closing its woodyard operations at the jesup  georgia  pulp mill as part of an ongoing program to reduce costs 
other items in september  the company completed the sale of a majority interest in approximately percent of its new zealand timber holdings to a timber investment fund  which entered into a joint venture with the company 
proceeds were used to reduce debt 
the transaction resulted in a non recurring pretax gain of million  million after tax  or per common share 
rayonier will manage the joint venture  which involves  acres of timber on new zealand s north island 
the timber in the joint venture is located apart from most of the company s forests and the company believes that it can be better managed as a separate unit 
interest expense for increased million to million as a result of higher average short term interest rates  which more than offset the benefits of a lower average debt level 
minority interest in the earnings of rtlp decreased million to million in due to lower partnership earnings resulting primarily from lower northwest us volume and prices partly offset by higher selling prices for southeast us stumpage 
the minority participation in the earnings of rtlp will change from approximately percent to approximately percent effective january  income taxes the effective tax rate of percent was favorable to the rate of percent 
the improvement reflected benefits from reorganizations made following the spin off from itt as well as tax benefits on increased pulp export sales

sales and operating income sales rose percent to billion in  reflecting stronger sales volumes in each of the business segments 
operating income for the year was million  up percent from timber and wood products sales of timber and wood products increased percent to million and operating income rose percent to million 
sales and income rose primarily due to increased stumpage volume and improved prices in the northwest us  as customers carried over higher priced timber sales contracts into the first quarter of log trading and merchandising sales  which include the company s new zealand operations  increased due to higher volumes in the us and new zealand 
strong domestic markets in both countries partially offset a decline in log exports 
overall  margins were reduced by lower export prices and higher purchased log costs 
timberlands management and stumpage sales and income were stronger due to the high priced carryover volume in the northwest us and increased volume and prices in the southeast us wood products sales and operating margins increased as a result of higher prices and a full year s contribution from the swainsboro lumber city  georgia  facility acquired late in operating margins also were affected by increased wood costs in the southeast us specialty pulp products sales of specialty pulp products increased to million  up percent  and operating income rose million to million 
the gains resulted from higher sales volume and stronger fluff pulp prices in the second half of the year 
other items interest expense increased as a result of the additional debt used to finance a million special dividend to itt in late and to settle intercompany accounts with itt prior to the spin off 
minority interest in the earnings of rtlp increased million to million in due to significantly higher partnership earnings resulting from increased stumpage volume and prices

the agreements commence in january and mature in and the most restrictive long term debt covenant in effect at december  provided that the ratio of total debt to ebitda cannot exceed four to one 
as of december   the ratio was less than two to one 
in addition  million of retained earnings was unrestricted as to the payment of dividends 
capital spending for the year of million represented a new high for the company  but was lower than originally planned because of a permitting delay for the company s planned new zealand medium density fiberboard mdf facility 
rayonier expects to invest approximately million in capital projects during the two year period  including million for the new zealand mdf facility  which is scheduled for completion in other capital projects include cost improvement and productivity programs at the jesup  georgia  pulp mill 
as new environmental regulations are promulgated  additional capital spending may be required to ensure continued compliance with environmental standards 
see environmental regulation 
the company has unsecured credit facilities totaling million  which are used for direct borrowings and as support for million of outstanding commercial paper 
as of december   rayonier had million of available borrowings under its revolving credit facilities 
in addition  the company has on file with the securities and exchange commission shelf registration statements to offer an additional million of new public debt securities 
the company believes that internally generated funds  combined with available external financing  will enable it to fund capital expenditures  working capital and other liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
dispositions in  rayonier provided million  pretax  for the loss on disposal of assets along with the costs for severance  demolition and other close down items associated with the disposition of its interest in the grays harbor  washington  pulp and paper complex 
the company has substantially completed all programs associated with this charge except for certain environmental remediation programs 
in addition  in  rayonier discontinued the southern wood piedmont company swp treated wood business 
although operations have ceased  swp is involved in several environmental remediation programs and is in negotiations with various state and federal agencies regarding the scope and timing for remaining programs 
future environmental cost is dependent on the outcome of such negotiations and may also be affected by new laws  regulations and administrative interpretations  and changes in environmental remediation technology 
accordingly  although considerable progress on cleanup has been made  there is still uncertainty as to the timing and amount of future expenditures for completing environmental programs at grays harbor  the swp sites and certain other non operating locations 
rayonier currently estimates that expenditures for environmental remediation during will total approximately million  pretax 
as of december   rayonier had reserves of million for environmental obligations 
the company believes that any future changes in estimates  if necessary  will not materially affect its financial condition or results of operations 
environmental regulation rayonier is subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations concerning air emissions  water discharges and waste disposal that  in the opinion of management  will require substantial expenditures over the next ten years 
during  and  rayonier spent approximately million  million and million  respectively  for capital projects related to environmental compliance for continuing operations 
rayonier expects to spend approximately million on such projects during the two year period however  federal environmental regulations governing air and water discharges that were proposed in may require further expenditures and  if finally enacted in their proposed form  would prevent the company from meeting certain product quality specifications for substantially all of its chemical cellulose products and will increase the cost of making its remaining pulp products 
sales of chemical cellulose products accounted for approximately percent of sales 
while these regulations would have a material adverse effect on operations if not changed  it will not be possible for rayonier to determine the nature or costs of such effect until the regulations are issued in final form 
rayonier has developed order of magnitude estimates of the costs of complying with these regulations if they are modified to remove the technological requirements that would prevent the company from manufacturing some of its products 
these estimates indicate that with incremental capital expenditures of approximately million at jesup  million at fernandina beach and million at port angeles  it could continue to manufacture the current product line 
such expenditures would most likely be incurred over several years and would not commence before rayonier will  however  continue to argue  both individually and through an industry trade association  for modifying the proposed operating guidelines further to eliminate errors it believes the agency has made  and the company will continue to explore new and revised operating and technical process alternatives in lieu of spending such funds 
rayonier cannot predict whether these efforts will be successful 
over the past five years  the harvest of timber from private lands in the state of washington has been restricted as a result of the listing of the northern spotted owl as a threatened species under the endangered species act esa 
these restrictions have caused rtlp to restructure and reschedule some of its harvest plans 
the us fish and wildlife service has developed a proposed rule under the esa to redefine protective measures for the northern spotted owl on private lands 
this rule  as currently drafted  would reduce the harvest restrictions on private lands except within specified special emphasis areas  where restrictions would be increased 
one proposed special emphasis area is on the olympic peninsula  where a significant portion of rtlp s washington timberlands is located 
separately  the state of washington forest practices board is in the process of adopting new harvest regulations to protect the northern spotted owl and the marbled murrelet also recently listed as a threatened species 
the state department of natural resources draft of this rule also provides for a special emphasis area to protect the northern spotted owl on the olympic peninsula  which would increase harvest restrictions on the company s lands 
rayonier is unable at this time to predict the form in which the federal or state rules will eventually be adopted 
however  if either rule is adopted in the form proposed by the respective agencies  the result will be some reduction in the volume of timber available for harvest
