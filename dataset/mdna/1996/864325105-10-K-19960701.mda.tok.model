item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations effect of merger us drug testing  inc 
during may  usat filed the us drug registration statement to register shares of the usat common stock to be issued to the minority stockholders of us drug upon consummation of a proposed merger of us drug with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of usat 
the effects of the proposed merger the us drug merger are discussed below 
although consummation of the us drug merger will result in the cancellation of the indebtedness from usat to us drug  outstanding as of march  and due june   usat will still have to invest at least  to  in the drug testing operations during the next two years in order to complete the development of the drug testing products 
the foregoing estimate does not reflect an additional  to  required for manufacturing line start up expenses 
because no revenues from sales are currently expected from the drug testing operations for at least to months  assuming us drug acquisition corp  as the successor to us drug by merger  meets the current product development schedule  as to which there can be no assurance  the drug testing operations will operate at a loss for at least the next two fiscal years  requiring the company to seek to generate revenues from the combined rsa proactive business and from its alcohol testing operation  assuming that the sale of good ideas is effected 
although usat management is optimistic about the company achieving a significant amount of revenues from the alcohol testing and the combined rsa proactive operations  there can be no assurance that management s expectations will be achieved and in the time frame that management contemplates 
management believes that the combined rsa proactive operations can also increase the revenues from the alcohol testing products and  when its products are developed and marketable  those of the drug testing subsidiary 
although the sale of the rubber recycling operation and the desired sale of the toy operation  as to which there can be no assurance that the latter sale will be consummated or  if sold  as to when and for what purchase price the sale will be effected  will eliminate a substantial portion of the company s operating losses  such sales will also substantially reduce the company s revenues the toy and rubber recycling operations constituted of the company s revenues in fiscal and in fiscal 
accordingly  in order to meet the company s cash requirements  particularly those relating to its drug testing operation  the company must develop new sources of revenues as to which the combined rsa proactive operation is the most likely source  seek additional financing and or secure additional exercises of outstanding usat common stock purchase warrants and stock options 
there can be no assurance that any of these sources of cash will produce sufficient amounts required for the company s operations  including us drug s  although usat management believes  as discussed below under liquidity and capital resources  that  as the result of the recently completed private placement  the recent exercises of common stock purchase warrants and other potential sources of funds  the company expects to meet its cash requirements for at least the next months 
there is  of course  no assurance that management s expectations will be realized 
if the us drug merger is not effected  an infusion of equity will be necessary for us drug to maintain its listing of the us drug common stock on the pacific stock exchange because us drug  based on its balance sheet as of march   did not meet such exchange s assets and stockholders equity maintenance requirements 
similarly  us drug would not meet the entry requirements of the american stock exchange or the national association of securities dealers automated quotation nasdaq system 
even if the current maintenance problem is resolved by an infusion of equity  because of the anticipated continuing losses  us drug will probably have the same compliance problem for at least to months ie  the necessity to infuse capital to offset operational losses 
any delisting from the pacific stock exchange and inability to list on another exchange or the nasdaq system will adversely affect us drug s ability to raise additional equity financing 
in such event  the burden to seek financing for the drug testing operation would fall solely on usat  which owns of us drug and holds the license to the usn technology 
effect of merger good ideas during april  usat filed the good ideas registration statement to register shares of the usat common stock to be issued to the minority stockholders of good ideas upon consummation of a proposed merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of usat with and into good ideas 
the effects of the proposed merger the good ideas merger are discussed below 
management believes that  during the past three years  manufacturers in the toy industry have faced the problem that distributors or retailers have been requesting that the manufacturers maintain the inventory  thereby increasing manufacturers expenses  and have been minimizing the number of vendors which sell to them  which has the effect of squeezing out the smaller companies like good ideas with their limited product lines 
because of these problems which management believe are characteristic of the toy industry generally and good ideas declining sales and increasing losses  the usat board of directors concluded on february  that good ideas was not likely to reverse the trend of increasing losses during the next months 
the board believed that  whether or not the good ideas merger was consummated  the only way to improve operational results was to secure new toy products  whether through licensing arrangements or otherwise  however  this type of program  even if successful  as to which there can be no assurance  would require substantial cash investments  which is contrary to the board s conclusion that the company s best opportunity at maximizing revenues and securing profitability was by concentrating on its alcohol and drug testing and human resource provider operations as its core businesses 
accordingly  on february   the usat board authorized seeking a purchaser for good ideas 
in addition  the usat board suspended management fees to usat retroactive to january  the board  believes that  pending receipt of an acceptable offer  as to which there can be no assurance  good ideas cash resources and expected cash flow from operations  coupled with its cost reduction actions such as not renewing the lease for office and warehouse facilities  will be sufficient to meet good ideas cash requirements for the next months if such time is required to sell or liquidate 
however  there can be no assurance that additional funds may not be required 
the usat board believes that liquidation of good ideas by no later than december  would be preferable than investing at that time substantial additional funds in good ideas  other than repaying usat s indebtedness to good ideas due june  the good ideas merger would terminate usat s obligation to make such repayment 
if the good ideas merger is not consummated  the good ideas board could consider whether the expenditure of funds to secure new products was preferable to a sale or liquidation 
however  for the reasons set forth in the preceding paragraph  the answer will probably be in the negative 
liquidity and capital resources although the company has a history of operating losses through march   management believes that the company will have the cash resources available to meet all of its operating requirements for the ensuing months 
management bases its belief on the following discontinued businesses 
good ideas and usrr have produced significant operating losses over the last several years 
both operations were treated as discontinued operations in the financial statements for fiscal usrr was sold april  good ideas operations have been substantially suspended and the company is seeking a buyer for its assets 
if no satisfactory offers are received  the operation will be liquidated prior to december  nonrecurring losses 
fiscal included  in losses from the settlement of litigation 
management is not aware of any litigation or claims which would cause this type of loss to recur in the fiscal year ending march  fiscal  although there can be no assurance that such claims will not arise 
operational sources 
management believes that cash flow from operations will be increased in fiscal through the addition of the rsa revenues and by developing the proactive human resource business  neither of which were significant contributors in fiscal management also believes that increased emphasis can be made on selling its mobile alcohol collection system macs and alco breath tubes abt for use in industrial companies and thereby increase the revenues in the alcohol testing operation 
by unifying its sales force to on sell both the rsa proactive product and these alcohol testing products and changing the marketing emphasis  management believes that increased revenues can be developed in fiscal management will also continue to emphasize the cost reduction programs previously instituted 
if the feasibility study as to saliva based testing product currently being conducted by us drug indicates further development is desirable  the company can seek to have a major company help in the development program  which would reduce current expenditures  but would also reduce future revenues to the extent marketing rights are demanded by such development partner 
to the extent that the feasibility study indicates insurmountable problems with respect to further development  then the anticipated further research and development expenses can be avoided 
there can be no assurance that the company s operational programs will produce an increased cash flow from operations or  if it does  when such result will be achieved 
equity sources 
from december to february  usat completed a private placement of usat common stock pursuant to regulation d under the securities act in which it realized gross proceeds of  because of usat s past history of successfully raising funds privately  management believes that this source can be tapped in the future if required  however  management would prefer not to use this method of financing because of the substantial dilution to current stockholders which it causes and because  absent a stockholder authorization of additional shares  the number of unreserved shares of the usat common stock is currently limited 
there can be  of course  no assurance that usat will be able to consummate any future financings on a timely and favorable basis in the amount necessary to meet the company s cash requirements should any such financing be necessary 
between april  and june   warrants and options were exercised to purchase  shares of the usat common stock generating  in cash 
outstanding unexercised usat common stock purchase warrants as of june  could generate approximately  of new capital to the company 
outstanding stock options could generate proceeds of approximately  if exercised 
usat will have to update or file registration statements under the securities act to make these exercises more attractive to the holders 
there can be  of course  no assurance that any of the remaining warrants or options will be exercised 
in the event that the company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or from sources other than those described above which event  in management s opinion  is not likely to occur based upon past experience  however  there is no assurance that management will be successful in any future financing efforts  then the company may have to provide for additional reductions in operating costs  thereby not only resulting in less cash from operations currently  but also delaying future revenue growth 
in such event the market price of the usat common stock is likely to drop  not only discouraging the future exercises of the usat common stock purchase warrants and the stock options and possibly discouraging potential new investors  but also increasing the risk that a current investor in usat may lose the value of his  her or its investment 
because usat offers its alcohol testing products  and us drug will offer  when the research and development program is successfully consummated  as to which there can be no assurance  its drug testing products  in the substance abuse industry which is noted for its scientific developments and rapidly changing technology  each faces the risk that new or modified products of competitors may make usat s or us drug s products not competitive  either from an obsolescence or a pricing point of view 
in addition  these developments may require usat and us drug to expend substantial funds on research and development to remain competitive  possibly at times when such funds may not be available 
changes in financial condition during fiscal  the company s investments in trading securities were sold and the company realized proceeds of  the remic bonds were sold for  and a brokerage loan payable in the amount of  was repaid 
in addition  the company sold its  share investment in the common stock of marquest medical products  inc marquest  realizing proceeds of  the sales of these investments resulted in a net gain of  over their carrying value on the march  balance sheet 
the company realized a loss on sale of marketable securities in fiscal of  management will make no further investments in any high risk trading securities 
the company s investment policy on a prospective basis  assuming the availability of funds not required for immediate use in the operations of the business  will require such funds to be invested in certificates of deposit  money market accounts  government securities and high quality commercial paper where the principal will be substantially protected from market fluctuations 
operating cash flows cash used for operations was  for fiscal the net loss for the period was  and the difference between the net loss and the net cash used by operating activities was  components of this difference included increases decreases accounts receivable  inventory  minority share  accounts payable  unrealized gain  depreciation amortization  accrued expenses  loss on disposal of discontinued operations  other components  net  total   net decrease  investing cash flows cash provided from investing activities was  for fiscal  was generated from the sales of trading securities as described above and  was used for the purchase of property and equipment 
other net sources of funds amounted to  financing cash flows cash provided from financing activities was  during the fiscal the company provided cash from the sale of securities in two private placements in the aggregate gross amount of  from the exercise of warrants in the amount of  and from demand loans  secured by us drug s remic bonds  in the amount of  cash from the sale of the remic bonds included as an investing activity was used to pay off brokerage loans in the amount of  expenses of raising the  from the placements and warrants were  net payments of long term debt and payment of dividends on the preferred a stock used cash of  cash resources will be more than adequate  in management s opinion  to meet the company s commitments which include lease obligations  royalty obligations and development of products for at least the next months 
there are currently no unfunded commitments for capital expenditures 
results of operations fiscal vs 
fiscal revenues from continuing operations for fiscal were  a decrease of  or from revenues of  reported for fiscal revenues from the sale of alcohol breath analyzing equipment decreased by  which decrease was attributable to an unusually high volume of alcohol breath analyzing machines sold in the third quarter of the prior year and a reduction in sales effort as the sales force was reassigned to the proactive startup 
sales of the biotox division decreased  reflecting the end of a contract performing methadone tests 
these decreases were offset by an increase in cost per test revenue from the alcohol breath analyzing equipment of  miscellaneous sales of supplies of  and revenues of  from alconet  which was acquired march   and the human resource provider business which  while still in a start up mode  produced revenues of  cost of sales for the fiscal on a continuing operations was of revenues as compared to of revenues for fiscal as a result of lower sales volumes  increased labor and supply costs relating to the cost per test business and an inventory write off of  during fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were  for fiscal  representing an increase of  or from the  of such expenses incurred for the comparable period of the prior year

additionally  a non recurring settlement of  was paid to two former owners of alconet  inc relating to a dispute over the terms of their employment contracts 
depreciation and amortization was  for fiscal  representing an increase of  or over depreciation and amortization in fiscal  which increase was attributable primarily to depreciation on usat s alcohol testing machines placed in testing sites in connection with the cost per test agreements with major laboratories 
the majority of these machines were placed in service in the fourth quarter of fiscal these machines represented an increase in depreciation expense of  for fiscal as compared to the expense in the prior year based on a full year s depreciation in fiscal the company s operating loss of  for fiscal increased by  over its operating loss of  for the prior year 
the increased operating loss can be attributed to the lower level of revenues generated from the alcohol testing business attributable to an unusually high volume of alcohol breath analyzing machines sold in the third quarter of the prior year  negative gross margins for fiscal resulting from higher labor and supply costs necessary to support the start up of the cost per test business  increased selling  general and administrative expenses and nonrecurring losses from settlement of litigation in the amount of  operating losses of  incurred by alconet  a newly acquired subsidiary not included in the prior year numbers  and increased depreciation cost relating to the cost per test business 
other income  net of other expenses  for fiscal was  as compared to an expense of  reported for fiscal the trading securities sold by the company in fiscal generated a profit of  over their carrying value in the march balance sheet 
during fiscal  these securities generated a loss of  and an unrealized loss of  interest income decreased by  for fiscal as compared to the interest income in the prior year 
management is of the opinion that it is too speculative to project at this time when the company will turn profitable because of the company s history of operational losses  the delay in completing and then marketing its urine sample drug testing product in order to wait until a saliva sample drug testing product is available  the fact that its human resource provider program is in its early marketing stages and the discontinued operations of the toy subsidiary

as of march   us drug did not anticipate generating revenues from product sales during fiscal and  accordingly  anticipated that operating losses would continue for at least a to month period 
usat will need to provide the funding necessary to complete the development of the us drug products and bring them to market 
discontinued operations good ideas enterprises  inc 
toy net sales for fiscal were  a decrease of  or from the net sales in the prior year 
of this decrease   or was attributable to toys r us  the major customer of good ideas  not placing orders for good ideas toy products 
the customer attributed its reduction in orders to its large inventories and declining sales and customer traffic 
management believes that other manufacturers in the toy industry are currently facing these same problems their distributors or retailers to which they sell have large inventories of products and declining sales and customer traffic 
in addition  management believes that many retailers are minimizing their number of vendors and reducing the number of items carried in inventory which has the result of squeezing out the smaller companies with their limited product lines 
gross profit for fiscal was  or of net sales as compared with  or of net sales for the prior year

the net loss for the current year was also increased by the writedown of assets in the amount of  and the projected costs through sale or liquidation in the amount of  unless good ideas were to add new products to its line  as to which there can be no assurance  and there were a stronger demand for toy products in the industry generally  management does not believe that a turnaround in good ideas operations would occur during the next months  if not at a later date 
although management of good ideas had in the past considered plans to expand the product line  it was reluctant to implement these plans absent a change in the industry conditions described above 
on february   the usat board determined to sell or liquidate good ideas  a conclusion concurred with by the good ideas board 
as a result of the above decision  the assets of good ideas are included in the consolidated balance sheet at management s estimate of liquidation value and the results of operations of good ideas are presented on a discontinued basis 
us rubber recycling  inc 
recycled rubber products net sales of usrr for fiscal were  a decrease of  or as compared with sales of  in the prior year
