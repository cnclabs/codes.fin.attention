item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company including the notes thereto 
general the company was formed in january the company s initial activities consisted of selling microwave components and power supplies  and conducting funded and nonfunded research and development activities 
this research led to the company s development of proprietary plasma deposition systems used in commercial applications 
although the company has supplied products to end users  scems  and researchers since inception  it did not commence the marketing of deposition systems for cvd diamond until fiscal in february  the company  through its wholly owned subsidiary  astex gerling laboratories  inc agl  acquired substantially all of the assets of jova enterprises  inc  which conducted business under the trade name of gerling laboratories gerling labs 
in november the company acquired all the outstanding shares of newton engineering service  inc nes  a manufacturer of high performance transformers used across the company s product lines 
in january the company acquired all the shares of ehrhorn technological operations  inc a manufacturer of radio frequency rf generators used in semiconductor  medical diagnostic imaging  and medical sterilization applications 
at the acquisition date the name was changed to eto  inc as set forth in the company s consolidated financial statements  total revenue consists of product sales  research contract revenue and other revenue 
other revenue includes service  repair  spare parts and consulting services 
applied science and technology  gmbh  a german wholly owned subsidiary of the company  has been inactive since its inception 
the company may use this subsidiary for future activities in europe 
results of operations fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended july  the following table compares the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal and applied science and technology  inc

ozone product revenue increased by from fiscal to  from  and accounted for of total fiscal revenue 
microwave generators  components and plasma products revenue increased by to of total revenue 
the acquisition of eto at the beginning of january added  in total revenue of which rf generators sold to scems was of eto total revenue  with medical applications accounting for of total revenue and communications amateur ham radio accounting for the rest 
revenue from end users for other applications of astex standard products increased by to of total revenue 
cvd diamond product revenues were flat in fiscal compared to fiscal the company experienced a precipitous loss of business at eto and a general slowdown in the semiconductor industry which will negatively impact the company s revenues and earnings in fiscal as a result  the company may not achieve historical levels of year to year revenue growth 
in addition  the general slowdown in the semiconductor industry may lead to an unpredictability of quarter to quarter operating results  which could cause increased volatility in the price of the company s stock and redeemable warrants 
although the current semiconductor equipment market environment remains difficult  there is continued demand for new product development in the marketplace 
it is anticipated that the semiconductor manufacturers will embrace new capital equipment technologies to enhance the efficiency and productivity of the manufacturing processes for producing semiconductor wafers 
astex is prepared to meet the needs of its customers through the introduction of new products  which are expected to add to revenues going forward and continue to strengthen our position as a leading manufacturer of systems and components for the semiconductor  medical and cvd diamond markets 
research contract revenue decreased in fiscal by or  compared to fiscal primarily due to decreased government funded cvd diamond research 
funded research performed for semiconductor customers has increased by from  in fiscal to  in fiscal in fiscal funded customer research considered to be joint development was accounted for as a reduction in research and development expenses  whereas in fiscal funded customer research was accounted for as revenue in the amount of  and research expense reduction in the amount of  other revenue of service  spare parts and repair business has increased by in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the acquisition of eto which obtains a larger fraction of its total revenue from this category 
without eto the revenue growth would have been  which is consistent with growth of total revenues 
gross profits increased by  or compared to fiscal gross margin as a percent of total revenue decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal primarily due to the acquisition of eto 
eto s gross margin historically has been lower than astex primarily due to lower prices in a more competitive market 
eto s gross margin was also impacted by an inventory write off due to a precipitous decline in sales to one of eto s major customers 
without acquisitions the overall gross margin would have increased to 
the company s gross margin improved in the semiconductor segment due to improved manufacturing efficiencies  design improvements  controlling of fixed manufacturing overhead and increased volume 
the company completed construction of a  square foot advanced state of the art clean room manufacturing facility which enabled the company to successfully ramp up production of ozone generators and systems  and improve the manufacturing efficiencies on these products 
the semiconductor segment is a highly competitive market that will require continued cost improvement in order to maintain existing margins 
the company anticipates that downward price pressure due to an anticipated downturn in the scem market could impact future gross margins 
the gross margin of cvd diamond products declined in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to product and customer mix 
research contract gross margin declined in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily in the government funded cvd diamond contracts due to increased overhead cost sharing 
selling expenses decreased to of sales in fiscal from in fiscal gross spending increased by due to the acquisition of eto  increased personnel in the direct sales and sales support functions  increased costs of consulting and travel and increased promotional expenses 
the company anticipates comparable expense spending as a percent of sales in fiscal general and administrative expenses decreased to of sales in fiscal compared to of sales in fiscal gross spending increased by due to the acquisition of eto  six months of goodwill amortization due to the acquisition of eto  additional personnel in financial and human resource functions  increased cost of consulting and travel associated with potential acquisitions  increased cost of investor relations  higher cost of audit and tax fees due to the increased size and complexity of the company and increased cost of legal expenses associated with patent and intellectual property issues 
the company anticipates comparable expense spending as a percent of sales in fiscal net research and development expenses declined to of sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal gross spending total research and development spending including funded joint development and the direct cost of research contracts was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal for a increase 
the increased gross spending is primarily due to a technology development agreement with applied materials  new product development including process and hardware development of the company s new generation of plasma sources  ozone systems  diamond deposition systems  microwave generators and components  medical sterilization and magnetic resonance imaging mri components  and the next generation of radio frequency power supplies 
the company operates in highly competitive and technical markets where continued investments in research and development are necessary to maintain market and technological leadership 
in fiscal  in order to establish the fair values of the eto assets acquired and liabilities assumed  a valuation process was performed 
as part of this  the company incurred  of in process research and development expense and acquisition related costs 
there were no comparable expenses for fiscal these costs will not recur in future periods  unless associated with another acquisition 
in connection with its acquisition of eto  the company recorded as goodwill  which represented the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of eto s net assets acquired and in process research and development 
the goodwill was to be amortized over years 
since the time of the acquisition there has been a precipitous decline in sales to one of eto s major customers 
in management s judgment  this decline in revenues is a permanent impairment of eto s prospects 
based on this significant change  which occurred during the company s fourth quarter  management made a reassessment of its remaining goodwill and recorded an impairment of goodwill in the amount of  which represented the goodwill balance at the reassessment date 
in determining the impairment  management estimated eto s cash flows over years which represented the remaining business life cycle of eto s existing technology 
the cash flow analysis included an estimate of eto s terminal value at the end of this period 
the operating cash flow projections were based on eto s estimated after tax operating results less estimated capital expenditures 
the undiscounted cash flows were assumed to be realized in installments over the years 
because the undiscounted cash flow was less than the company s carrying value of eto  a charge for impairment of goodwill was recorded to the extent unamortized book value exceeded the related discounted cash flow 
the cash flow was discounted using a weighted average borrowing cost of which is comparable to rates available as of the reassessment date 
the company incurred an operating loss of  in fiscal compared to an operating profit of  in fiscal excluding one time charges associated with the eto acquisition acquisition related costs and non recurring goodwill write off operating income would have been a record profit of  of sales or an increase of compared to fiscal the company anticipates that a slow down in the semiconductor market will have a negative impact on fiscal operating profits as a percent of sales 
interest expense was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the increase in interest expense is due to two bank notes incurred as part of the financing of the eto acquisition 
interest income was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the decrease of  in interest income is primarily due to less cash investments than in the prior fiscal year due to cash used for the eto acquisition 
income tax expense was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal in fiscal the expected tax computed by applying the us federal corporate income tax rate of to loss before income taxes was increased by  due to charges related to the write off of goodwill  goodwill amortization and acquisition related expenses  all of which are not tax deductible 
there were no comparable costs in fiscal results of operations fiscal year ended july  compared to the fiscal year ended july  the following table compares the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal and applied science and technology  inc 
and subsidiaries comparative consolidated statements of operations july  july  change change product sales  net    research contract revenue   other revenue total revenue    cost of sales and revenue product sales and other revenues    research contracts total cost of sales and revenue    gross profit    operating expenses selling expenses   general and administrative expenses   research and development expenses  net   total operating expenses    earnings from operations other expense income interest expense interest income other expense total other income earnings before income taxes  income tax expense net earnings  total revenue increased for fiscal by to  compared to fiscal product sales increased by to  primarily due to increased shipments of plasma sources  microwave generators  components  ozone generators and ozone subsystems to scems 
ozone generators and subsystems  introduced in fiscal  accounted for of total fiscal revenues 
diamond system sales declined slightly for fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a near term slowdown as the end user market transitions from being driven by government funding to being driven by anticipated commercial product needs 
analytical instruments  which the company distributes for a foreign manufacturer  decreased by in fiscal compared to fiscal subsequent to the end of fiscal  the company canceled the distribution agreement for analytical instruments to more fully concentrate sales and marketing efforts on its own products 
research contract revenue increased by to  in fiscal this increase resulted from significantly increased industry funded research 
government funded research decreased slightly 
other revenue consisting of service  repair  spare parts and consulting was relatively flat in fiscal compared to fiscal gross profit increased by  compared to fiscal gross margin  as a percent of total revenue  decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal primarily due to new product introductions  increased sales to scems  which have a lower margin on long term supplier agreements  manufacturing support costs increasing faster than sales due to increased customer support required for sales to scems  and lower margins at agl as a result of an inventory write down associated with an obsolete product line and increasing sales to scems with lower gross margin 
selling expenses decreased to of sales from in fiscal gross spending increased by primarily due to increased direct sales personnel to manage scems and research institute accounts  commissions paid to european sales representatives  and expanded marketing efforts in north america  europe and asia 
general and administrative expenses were flat at of sales in fiscal compared to fiscal gross spending increased by primarily due to additional personal in financial functions and the addition of a corporate information systems manager  increased consulting and travel expenses associated with evaluation of potential acquisitions  legal expenses associated with patent work  increased cost of investor relations  and expenses associated with a new information system at agl 
net research and development spending declined to of sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal gross spending total research and development spending including funded joint development and the direct cost of research contracts increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal for a increase 
research and development spending was for the development of ozone systems  process and hardware development of a new generation of diamond deposition systems  and new plasma sources and components for the semiconductor industry 
total operating expenses decreased as a percent of total revenue to for fiscal compared to for fiscal earnings from operations increased by for fiscal compared to fiscal and increased as a percent of total revenue to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in operating income is primarily due to increased revenue and reduction of operating expenses as a percent of total revenue 
total other income increased by in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase is primarily due to increased interest income on the company s cash and investments and interest income earned on a note receivable from a customer 
the company incurred income tax expense of  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the effective tax rate increased from in fiscal to in fiscal primarily due to increased state taxes 
liquidity and capital resources at fiscal year end the company had cash and short term investments of  with working capital of  compared to fiscal when the company had cash  short term and long term investments of  and working capital of  in january the company purchased all of the outstanding shares of eto for cash and stock 
the company borrowed  from state street bank and trust company to complete the acquisition  under two unsecured notes 
no security pledges of assets can be granted nor dividends paid without the approval of the bank 
certain financial covenants must be tested quarterly in connection with these notes 
the company is in compliance with all covenants at june   and expects to remain in compliance over the next months 
see footnotes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in november the company purchased all of the outstanding shares of newton engineering service  inc nes for  shares of the company s common stock 
nes is a strong technical designer and manufacturer of specialty transformers and inductors which are essential to the advanced technology used in astex s power supplies and ozone generators 
in october the company purchased  of series a convertible preferred stock of low entropy systems  inc les 
the preferred stock is convertible into common stock commencing january  for a minimum of of the outstanding fully diluted shares of les at the time of conversion 
les is a manufacturer of imaging interferometers used in measuring thin film etching or deposition rate and rate uniformity in the semiconductor wafer manufacturing process 
in november of  the company completed an ipo and received net proceeds of  through the sale of  shares of common stock and  redeemable warrants at prices of per share and per warrant 
the common stock and redeemable warrants are traded on nasdaq nms under the symbols astx and astxw  respectively 
two redeemable warrants entitle the holder to purchase one share of common stock at a price of per share until november   subject to adjustment in accordance with anti dilution provisions 
the redeemable warrants are subject to redemption at per warrant on days prior written notice  provided that the average closing price of the company s common stock equals or exceeds for consecutive trading days 
if all the redeemable warrants are exercised  this would provide additional equity financing of approximately million net for the company 
the company also issued to the underwriter of the ipo  for nominal consideration  warrants to purchase  shares of common stock and  redeemable warrants the representative s warrants 
the representative s warrants are initially exercisable at per share of common stock and per redeemable warrant through november  in august and september  the company conducted a private placement and received net proceeds of  in exchange for the issuance of  shares of series c preferred stock and investor warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
the investor warrants are exercisable at a price of per share through november  the investor warrants are redeemable by the company at any time after november  provided the average closing price of the common stock exceeds per share for consecutive days 
as of june    warrants have been exercised for  during fiscal  the company generated  in net cash flows from operating activities 
in fiscal the company used a net  for investing activities 
cash used for investing activities consisted of  for acquisition of eto less cash acquired with the acquisitions of eto and nes   for additions to property  equipment  and patents   for an equity investment in low entropy systems  inc  and  for purchase of investments  offset by sales of  in investments 
investments are primarily commercial paper and government treasury bills 
the company s cash flows from financing activities consisted primarily of proceeds of two notes payable for  used in the acquisition of eto offset by  of note repayments  and  from issuance of common stock which was primarily due to exercise of investor warrants and exercise of employee stock options 
during fiscal the company generated  in net cash flows from operating activities 
the company used  for investing activities  primarily for purchase of  in investments and  in additions to property  equipment and patents  offset by sales of  in investments 
the company used  for financing activities  primarily for a stock repurchase program under which  shares were repurchased for  at an average price of per share 
the stock repurchase program objective was to support the stock price in the open market 
all treasury stock held was retired on july  the board of directors has not terminated the stock repurchase program  but no shares have been purchased since march  during fiscal  the company used  in net cash for operating activities  and used  for investing activities primarily for additions to property and equipment and investments in government treasury bills and commercial paper 
the company generated  through the sale of common stock  offset by debt repayment of  the company has a credit facility with state street bank and trust company which consists of a million unsecured demand line of credit for working capital purposes 
there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility at june  the credit facility expires november  the company has two unsecured promissory note agreements with state street bank and trust company  as described in footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company continues to use its cash resources for development of new products  expanding sales and marketing  performing collaborative product development projects  and for general working capital 
the company continues to seek joint ventures and or acquisitions that will enhance the company s position in the market while increasing revenue growth and profitability 
however  the company has made no material commitments to acquire other businesses at this time and no assurance can be given that the company will make any such acquisitions in the future 
management believes that existing cash resources  investments  anticipated cash flows from operations and its credit facility will be sufficient to meet planned operating expenses and working capital requirements for a period of at least the next months 
management may seek to raise additional capital to complete an acquisition or for other corporate purposes  although no specific acquisition is planned at this time 
effects of recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation statement in october under statement  the company is required to choose either the new fair value method or the current intrinsic value method of accounting for its stock based compensation arrangements 
using the fair value method  the company would measure the compensation cost recognized in the financial statements based upon the estimated fair value of the stock based compensation arrangements as of the date they are granted 
the intrinsic value method  under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  requires the recognition of compensation cost only if the exercise price of the stock based compensation arrangement does not exceed the market value of the underlying stock on the measurement date 
the company will continue to account for all employee stock based compensation plans under opinion no 
and adopt the provisions of statement  as required  for all stock based arrangements issued to non employees 
the accounting requirements of statement are effective for transactions entered into in fiscal years beginning after december  and the disclosure  including pro forma  requirements are effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  even though the company has opted not to change its method of accounting  statement requires pro forma disclosure of net income and earnings per share computed as if the fair value method has been applied 
statement will be implemented in fiscal in march  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
statement no 
 which must be adopted by fiscal years beginning after december   establishes accounting standards for the impairment of long lived assets  certain identifiable intangibles  and goodwill related to those assets to be held and used in the business  and for assets to be disposed of 
the company does not anticipate a material effect on the financial statements from this new accounting standard 
effects of inflation the company believes that  over the past three years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s revenues or operating results
