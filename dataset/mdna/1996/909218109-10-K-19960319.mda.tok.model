item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition and liquidity the company currently has a loan agreement loan agreement  which provides for a total commitment of million  consisting of a revolving credit facility through august  and a term loan thereafter  maturing on august  borrowings under the revolving credit facility are limited to a borrowing base which is subject to a semi annual redetermination 
the latest borrowing base determination indicated million of the commitment is available to the company 
the loan agreement contains certain covenants which require the company to maintain consolidated net worth of at least million  a modified current ratio of not less than to  a ratio of long term debt  as defined in the loan agreement  to consolidated tangible net worth not greater than to and a ratio of total liabilities  as defined in the loan agreement  to consolidated tangible net worth not greater than to in addition  working capital provided by operations  as defined in the loan agreement  cannot be less than million in any year 
at december   borrowings under the loan agreement totaled million 
at february   borrowings under the loan agreement totaled million with million available for future borrowings 
the average interest rate on the bank debt was and percent at december  and february   respectively 
at the company s election  any portion of the debt outstanding may be fixed at the london interbank offered rate libor rate for   or days with the remainder of the outstanding debt subject to the chase manhattan bank  n 
a 
prime rate prime rate 
during any libor rate funding period the company may not pay in part or in whole the outstanding principal balance of the note to which such libor rate option applies 
at both december  and february   million of borrowings were subject to the libor rate 
a commitment fee of of percent is charged for any unused portion of the borrowing base 
shareholders equity at december  was million  making the company s ratio of long term debt to equity 
to the company s primary source of liquidity and capital resources in the near and long term will consist of cash flow from operating activities and available borrowings under the company s loan agreement 
net cash provided by continuing operating activities in was million as compared to million in the company s capital expenditures during were million 
the majority of the capital expenditures  million  were made in the company s oil and natural gas operations with million and million used for exploration and development drilling and producing property acquisitions  respectively 
capital expenditures made by the company s contract drilling operations were approximately million in and principally consisted of drill pipe and drill collar expenditures along with improvements to large rig components which benefit current and future years 
the company s rigs are composed of large components some of which  on a rotational basis  are required to be overhauled to assure proper performance 
such capital expenditures will continue in future years 
additional expenditures of approximately million will be required in for drill pipe as certain grades of the company s drill pipe are reaching the end of their useful life 
during  the company s oil and natural gas segment plans to focus on its developmental drilling program as early natural gas prices have improved lessening the availability of economical producing property acquisitions 
the company s capital expenditures are discretionary and directed toward increasing reserves and future growth 
current operations should not be adversely affected by any inability to obtain funds outside of the company s loan agreement 
the decision to acquire or drill on oil and natural gas properties at any given time depends on market conditions  potential return on investment  future drilling potential and the availability of opportunities to obtain financing given the circumstances involved  thus providing the company with a large degree of flexibility in incurring such costs 
depending  in part  on commodity pricing  the company plans to spend approximately million on its capital expenditure program in the company has million warrants outstanding 
the warrants entitle the holders to purchase one share of common stock at a price of per share 
the warrants  subject to certain restrictions  are callable by the company  in whole or in part  at 
per warrant 
a second amendment to the warrant agreement between the company and the warrant agent  dated may   extended the term of the warrants to august  the company continued to receive monthly payments on behalf of itself and other parties collectively the committed interest from a natural gas purchaser pursuant to a settlement agreement the settlement agreement 
as a result of the settlement agreement  the december  prepayment balance of million paid by the purchaser for natural gas not taken the prepayment balance is subject to recoupment in volumes of natural gas through a period ending on the earlier of recoupment or december  the recoupment period 
additionally  the purchaser is obligated to make monthly payments on behalf of the committed interest based on their share of the natural gas deliverability of the wells subject to the settlement agreement  up to a maximum of  or a minimum of  per month for the year both the maximum and minimum monthly payments decline annually through the recoupment period 
if natural gas is taken during a month  the value of such natural gas is credited toward the monthly amount the purchaser is required to pay 
in the event the purchaser takes volumes of natural gas valued in excess of its monthly payment obligations  the value taken in excess is applied to reduce any then outstanding prepayment balance 
the company currently believes that sufficient natural gas deliverability is available to enable the committed interest to receive substantially all of the maximum monthly payments during at the end of the recoupment period  the settlement agreement and the natural gas purchase contracts which are subject to the settlement agreement will terminate 
if the prepayment balance is not fully recouped in natural gas by december   then the unrecouped portion is subject to cash repayment  limited to a maximum of million  payable in equal annual payments over a five year period with the first payment due june  the company anticipates the maximum balance of million will be unrecouped at december  under the settlement agreement  the purchaser is entitled to make a monthly determination of the volumes to be purchased from the wells subject to the settlement agreement 
during and the first nine months of natural gas delivered was approximately percent of the deliverability of the wells subject to the settlement agreement 
pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement  the purchaser notified the company that effective october   the purchaser plans to make seasonal takes of natural gas by requesting the maximum deliverability subject to the settlement agreement in certain months and no deliverability in other months 
for the majority of the fourth quarter of and continuing into the first quarter of the purchaser has requested the maximum deliverability subject to the settlement agreement 
because these month to month determinations  up to certain maximum levels  are made by the purchaser  the company is unable to predict with certainty future natural gas sales from these wells 
in addition  future revenues to be received by the company would be impacted by the failure of the purchaser to meet its obligations  financially or otherwise  under the terms of the settlement agreement or by the ability of the wells to maintain certain projected deliverability requirements 
in the event the wells are unable to maintain such deliverability  the monthly payments to be received by the company under the settlement agreement would be decreased 
the price per mcf under the settlement agreement is substantially higher than current spot market prices 
the impact of the higher price received under the settlement agreement increased pre tax income approximately  and million in  and  respectively 
oil prices received by the company in ranged from an average of in july to in december 
the company s average price for oil received in was 
natural gas prices received by the company in ranged from an average of in march to in december 
average natural gas prices received by the company remained volatile throughout and averaged f or the year as a whole 
oil prices within the industry remain largely dependent upon world market developments for crude oil 
prices for natural gas are influenced by weather conditions and supply imbalances  particularly in the domestic market  an d by world wide oil price levels 
any large drop in spot market natural gas prices will have a significant adverse effect on the value of the company s reserves and could cause the company to reduce the carrying value of its oil and natural gas properties 
likewise  declines in natural gas or oil prices could adversely effect the semi annual borrowing base determination under the company s loan agreement since this determination is calculated on the value of the company s oil and natural gas reserves 
the company s ability to utilize its full complement of drilling rigs  should economic conditions improve in the future  will be limited due to the lack of qualified labor and certain supporting equipment not only within the company but in the industry as a whole 
the company s ability to utilize its drilling rigs at any given time is dependent on a number of factors  including but not limited to  the price of both oil and natural gas  the availability of labor and the company s ability to supply the type of equipment required 
the company s management expects that these factors will continue to influence the company s rig utilization during in the third quarter of  the company s board of directors authorized the company to purchase up to  shares of the company s outstanding common stock on the open market 
since that time   shares have been repurchased at prices ranging from to per share 
during the first quarter of   of the purchased shares were reissued as the company s matching contribution to its k employee thrift plan 
at december    treasury shares were held by the company 
the company s wholly owned natural gas marketing subsidiary  mountain front pipeline company  achieved substantial growth in revenues during previous years  but did not achieve the size necessary to reach desired levels of profitability 
consequently  on april  the company completed a business combination between the company s natural gas marketing operations and a third party also involved in natural gas marketing activities forming a new company called ged gas services  llc ged 
the company owns a percent interest in ged 
effective november  ged sold its natural gas marketing operations to a third party 
t his sale removed the company from the third party natural gas marketing business 
the creation of ged and its subsequent sale of its marketing operations did not adversely affect the company s drilling and oil and natural gas exploration operations or the profitability of the company as a whole 
the discontinuation of the company s natural gas marketing segment has been accounted for as a discontinued operation and accordingly  the and prior year financial information has been restated to reflect this treatment 
effects of inflation the effects of inflation on the company s current operations have been minimal due to low inflation rates 
however  the impact of inflation on the company in the future will depend on the relative increase  if any  the company may realize in its rig rates and the selling price of its oil and natural gas 
if industry activity increases substantially  shortages in support equipment such as drill pipe  third party services and qualified labor would occur resulting in corresponding increases in material and labor costs 
these market conditions may limit the company s ability to realize improvements in operating profits 
results of operations versus net income for was  compared with  in while the company continued to increase natural gas production through producing property acquisitions and developmental drilling  lower natural gas prices limited corresponding increases in net income 
net income in the fourth quarter of w as also further reduced by a  write down of certain rig components as the company elected to take of its drilling rigs out of service since current economic conditions do not warrant the capital investment necessary to keep them in service 
the impact of lower natural gas prices on net income was partially offset by a  gain from the sale of natural gas compressors and certain related support equipment which were sold for million in the first quarter and by the receipt of  in the third quarter from a settlement reached by two of the company s subsidiaries in certain litigation brought against the federal deposit insurance corporation and other parties 
in the fourth quarter  the company also recognized a  net gain from the company s interest in the sale of ged s gas marketing operations and a  net income tax benefit 
the disposition of the company s involvement in third party natural gas marketing does not adversely affect the operation of the company s drilling and oil and natural gas exploration operations or the profitability of the company as a whole 
total revenues from continuing operations increased to  in as compared to  in the company s net income included a net gain of  recognized in conjunction with the sale of one of the company s natural gas gathering systems 
oil and natural gas revenues increased percent due to a percent increase in natural gas production and a percent increase in oil production between and average oil prices received by the company increased percent while average natural gas prices received by the company decreased percent 
the average natural gas price declined due to a percent reduction in average spot market prices received by the company coupled with a percent reduction in volumes produced from certain wells included under the settlement agreement which contains provisions for prices which are higher than current spot market prices 
the impact of higher prices received under the settlement agreement increased pre tax income by approximately and million in and  respectively 
in  revenues from contract drilling operations increased by percent as average rig utilization increased from rigs operating in to rigs operating in daywork revenues represented percent of total drilling revenues in and percent in turnkey and footage contracts typically provide for higher revenues since a greater portion of the expense of drilling the well is born by the drilling contractor 
in  the company moved two of its rigs under multi well contracts to the south texas basin creating a new operating region for the company s drilling services and helping to further improve its rig utilization 
in the fourth quarter of  the contract drilling operations opened an office in houston  texas with plans to further develop this new market area 
at december   four of the company s rigs were located in the south texas basin 
operating margins revenues less operating costs for the company s oil and natural gas operations were percent in compared to percent in the reduction was primarily due to the decrease in prices received for the company s natural gas production which offset increases in production between the two years 
margins were also reduced by the shutting in of production on certain natural gas properties in the months of february and march due to low spot market natural gas prices 
total operating costs increased percent due to the additional costs associated with oil and natural gas production from new wells acquired and drilled in and operating margins for contract drilling decreased from percent in to percent in margins in were limited by initial start up costs incurred in the first quarter of to establish rigs in the south texas basin and by unusually wet weather conditions during the second quarter of which delay ed rig moves and depressed rig utilization 
total operating costs for contract drilling were up percent in versus due to increased rig utilization and start up costs 
contract drilling depreciation increased percent in response to increased rig utilization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a of oil and natural gas properties increased percent as the company increased its equivalent barrels of production by percent 
the company s average dd a rate per equivalent barrel declined from in to in general and administrative expense increased percent as certain employee costs  contract services and rental costs increased between the comparative years due to the continued growth of the company s operations 
this increase is expected to continue in as the company expands its operations 
interest expense increased percent as the average interest rate on the company s outstanding bank debt increased from percent in to percent in average bank debt outstanding in was million higher than average bank debt outstanding in primarily due to the financing of producing property acquisition and developmental drilling as previously discussed 
the company s effective income tax rate in recent years has been significantly impacted by its net operating loss carryforwards 
as of december   the company s net operating loss and statutory depletion carryforwards have been fully recognized for financial reporting purposes  resulting in a net deferred tax asset of  realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of net operating loss carryforwards 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will be realized 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
versus net income for was  compared with  in the increase in net income was achieved through improved operating results in the company s contract drilling segment and also from a net gain of  recognized in conjunction with the sale of one of the company s gas gathering systems 
total revenues from continuing operations were  in and  in oil and natural gas revenues increased percent due to a percent increase in natural gas production and a percent increase in oil production between and average natural gas and oil prices received by the company both decreased percent partially offsetting the increases in production 
average natural gas prices received by the company declined due to a percent reduction in average spot market prices coupled with a percent reduction in volumes produced from certain wells included under the settlement agreement which contains provisions for prices which are higher than current spot market prices 
the impact of the higher price received under the settlement agreement increased pre tax income by approximately and million in and  respectively 
in  revenues from contract drilling operations increased by percent as average rig utilization increased from rigs in to rigs in daywork revenues represented percent of total drilling revenues in as opposed to percent in turnkey and footage contracts typically provide for higher revenues since a greater portion of the expense of drilling the well is born by the drilling contractor 
operating margins revenues less operating costs were either slightly improved or unchanged for all segments on the company s operations when comparing with operating margins for the company s oil and natural gas operations were unchanged due primarily to increased production offset by the decrease in average prices received for oil and natural gas 
total operating costs from oil and natural gas operations increased percent as the company increased production from reserves added primarily through development drilling i n and operating margins for contract drilling improved from percent in to percent in increased rig utilization helped provide greater revenue in relation to fixed costs 
total operating costs for contract drilling were up percent in versus due to the increased utilization 
contract drilling depreciation increased percent in response to increased rig utilization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a of oil and natural gas properties increased percent as the company increased its equivalent barrels of production by percent 
the company s average dd a rate per equivalent barrel declined from in to in general and administrative expense increased percent as certain employee and reporting costs increased between the comparative years 
interest expense increased percent as the average interest rate on the company s outstanding bank debt increased from percent in to percent in outstanding bank debt was million higher at december  when compared with december  due to the financing of the december  patrick acquisition 
impact of financial accounting pronouncements in march  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of was issued 
the statement establishes accounting standards for the impairment of long lived assets  such as the company s drilling  transportation and other equipment and will be effective for the company beginning with the year ending december  the company does not believe the new standard will have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in october  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation was issued 
the statement requires the computation of compensation for grants of stock  stock options and other equity instrument s issued to employees based on fair value 
the compensation calculated is to be either recorded as an expense in the financial statements or  alternatively  disclosed 
the company anticipates it will elect the disclosure method of complying with the new standard 
under existing accounting rules  the company s stock option grants have not resulted in compensation expense 
accordingly  under the provisions of the new statement  pro forma net income to be disclosed will be lower than net income reported in the financial statements
