gross margin also declined in the company s outlet stores due to more in store promotions  and in the special markets division  which primarily sells to other businesses 
the company s cost of order fulfillment rose in fiscal principally because of increases in the costs of packaging materials  postal and ups rates  as well as additional costs caused by physical constraints of the company s distribution center 
a backlog of unshipped orders resulted in additional costs for expedited delivery before christmas  and for related customer service inquiries

us postal rates are not expected to rise in fiscal  and in fact  the company expects to experience a small reduction in postage costs in the second half of fiscal due to a recently enacted postal reclassification regulation 
the company will also continue to manage its circulation strategy  catalog page count  and merchandise mix with a goal of achieving maximum revenue per catalog  thereby improving the ratio of selling costs to revenues

historically  a substantial portion of the company s revenue and net income has been realized during the third and fourth fiscal quarters  which encompass the period september through february 
revenue and net income have been lower during the first and second fiscal quarters  comprising the period march through august 
the company believes this is the general pattern associated with the mail order and retail industries 
because of slower demand for its products in the first half of its fiscal year  the company incurred a cumulative net loss during the first six months of fiscal   and due to these seasonal factors  as well as to the effect of higher paper costs that were discussed earlier  management expects to incur a loss for the first half of fiscal as well

the company believes that its cash flow from operations  current investment balance  and credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its operating needs
