target has the option beginning on january   to acquire in perpetuity the exclusive rights to manufacture  import and sell the exclusive products for a purchase price equal to a times the royalty it paid cherokee with respect to the exclusive products in the year prior to exercise of its option but not less than  less b the lesser of i one half of the royalties it has paid during the term of the agreement with respect to exclusive products or ii one half of a above  provided that the maximum price shall be  the agreement prohibits the company from granting other exclusive cherokee retail licenses and from granting any licenses to certain other major discount retailers in the territory 
target commenced the initial sales of exclusive and non exclusive products in july as of june   the company had entered into eight retail direct non exclusive license agreements and is negotiating with several other retailers for additional non exclusive retail direct agreements

wholesale licensed products presently include women s intimate apparel  maternity  socks  sunglasses  watches and men s activewear

international licensing the cherokee brand is broadly licensed in the far east 
suzuya co 
ltd 
suzuya  the far east licensee  operates cherokee retail stores in japan  and has eight sub licensees that manufacture and sell cherokee brand apparel and accessories to the cherokee stores and to other unaffiliated retailers

the company intends to renew these registrations prior to expiration

marketing historically  the company had spent between and of its sales on advertising 
advertising  product  labeling and presentation are integrated to deliver one clear and consistent message 
the advertising is intended to project a positive image to the consumer and the retailer 
the company and its licensees intend to promote a positive image in marketing the cherokee brand through advertising  public relations programs  and editorial coverage 
during the fiscal year ended june   the company s advertising costs were minimal 
as the company s licensing revenues increase  the company  in coordination with its licensees  will increase its advertising costs 
competition the manufacture and distribution of apparel and footwear are highly competitive businesses characterized by their ease of entry 
the company competed with numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers  many of which were larger or are associated with companies with substantially greater financial resources than the company 
traditional competitors of the company included levi strauss co  liz claiborne  guess  esprit de corp  vf corp  bernard chaus and private labels developed for retailers 
factors which shape the competitive environment include quality of garment construction and design  brand name  style and color selection  price and the manufacturer s ability to respond quickly to the retailer on a national basis 
cherokee brand footwear  apparel  and accessories  manufactured by wholesale licensees and sold to retailers and retail licensees  will be subject to almost all of the same competitive pressures that the company s products were subject 
in recognition of the increasing trend towards consolidation of retailers and greater emphasis by retailers on the manufacture of private label merchandise  the company s business plan principally focuses on creating strategic alliances with major retailers for their sale of cherokee products through the licensing of the cherokee trademark directly to retailers 
other companies owning established trademarks could also enter into similar arrangements with retailers 
employees as of july   with the nature of its business having changed from that of prior periods  the company employed approximately persons all of whom are involved in the company s sole remaining line of business  licensing 
none of the company s employees are represented by labor unions and the company believes that its employee relations are satisfactory
