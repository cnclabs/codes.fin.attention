the company s actual results could differ from the results anticipated herein as a result of the factors set forth in this report 
general the company has incurred substantial operating losses over the last several years and had an accumulated deficit of approximately million at december the company s future profitability  to a large extent  will depend upon the company s ability to successfully commercialize additional generic pharmaceutical products 
products must be developed and tested  meet strict regulatory standards  receive requisite regulatory approvals and be manufactured on a cost effective basis before successful commercialization can be achieved 
the development and commercialization process is time consuming and costly 
delays in any part of the process or the inability of the company to obtain regulatory approvals for its products could materially adversely affect the company s future results of operations 
the company believes that it takes between and months from the time an anda is filed to the time it is approved  although such time period has been longer in the past and may be longer in the future 
the company is dependant on the fda approval process to introduce new products to the market 
there can be no assurance as to when the company will have new products to market  or that if products are approved  they can be successfully commercialized 
the company s revenues  gross profit margins and net profitability may vary significantly from quarter to quarter  as well as in comparison to the corresponding quarter of the preceding year 
revenue variations may result from  among other factors  the timing of fda approvals  the timing of initial shipments of newly approved drugs and the purchasing practices of the company s customers 
additionally  gross profit margins may vary due to  among other factors  when new products are approved for manufacture and marketing  as well as competition relating to such products 
net profits or losses may also vary due to the foregoing  plus the timing and amounts of research and development r d spending 
the company s r d costs are expensed as incurred  resulting in charges to earnings prior to the realization of any revenues from a product 
results of operations vs 
net sales for were million  representing an increase of million or over net sales of million for approximately of the increase in net sales was attributable to sales of products which were introduced by the company during new products  while the remaining of the increase in net sales was attributable to sales of products in the company s product line during existing products 
approximately of the increase in new products was attributable to the december launch of hydroxychloroquine sulfate 
the majority of the increase in sales of existing products was attributable to a full year s inclusion of two products introduced during and increased sales of quinine sulfate  a prescription drug for the treatment of malaria 
see business government regulation for a description of the fda drug review on quinine sulfate 
with the occurrence of the fda drug review on quinine sulfate  the competition in the marketplace for this drug has been reduced and as a result  the company s market share for this product has increased 
while the company expects that demand for this product will be strong for  it is likely that unit sales of this drug will decline in the long term 
the gross profit for was million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales for gross profit  as well as the gross profit margin  increased due to the introduction of new products and sales increases of existing products  both of which caused an improvement in the operating leverage on the company s fixed costs of manufacturing 
the company increased its r d expenses to million or of net sales in versus million or of net sales in in actual dollars  r d expense increased 
the increase in r d spending  both in dollars and percentage of sales  reflects the company s commitment to increasing its r d expenditures as it believes such efforts are vital to the future growth of the company 
selling  general administrative sg a expenses increased to million or of net sales in  versus million or of net sales in approximately of the increase in sg a expenses was attributable to legal fees associated with the company s litigation over captopril see note iv of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the company s reserve for bad debts was increased by  as a result of a substantial increase in trade receivables from levels 
the remaining increase in sg a expenses was attributable  in part  to increases in certain variable expenses which increased in relation to sales  such as royalties 
general and administrative expenses were also impacted by increases in payroll and related expenses due to pay increases and personnel additions  as well as higher rent and depreciation associated with the company s new facility 
as a result of the above factors  the company s operating loss for was million  compared to million for after accounting for other income and interest expense  the net loss was million for compared to a net loss of million for vs 
net sales for were million  representing an increase of million or over net sales of million for the increase in net sales was attributable to unit sales increases of all of the company s products  as well as the introduction of two new products during the company s gross profit for was million  or of net sales  compared to a gross profit of  or of net sales for the increase in the gross profit margin was primarily the result of increased sales volumes  as well as the introduction of two new products during r d expenses for were  which represented of net sales  compared to  or of net sales for sg a expenses were million for  which represented an increase of  over sg a expenses of million in sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales were for  compared to for the dollar increase in sg a was attributable  in large part  to higher selling expenses including freight expenses resulting from increased sales  as well as higher advertising expenses 
increased general and administrative expenses from year to year resulted primarily from increased payroll expense as a result of personnel additions required to support increased sales and operations 
this increase was offset during by significantly lower legal expenses than in sg a  as a percentage of net sales  decreased due to economies of scale resulting from increased sales during additionally  during  the company recognized charges primarily non cash of million relating to the settlement of two lawsuits  plus a write off of piroxicam inventory and related matters in the amount of  after accounting for other income and interest expense  as well as the factors described above  the net loss for was million  compared to a net loss of million for financial condition  liquidity and capital resources the company has historically financed its capital asset and working capital requirements and a significant portion of its product development efforts through sales of its equity securities 
in july  the company raised net proceeds of million in a private placement see note ii a of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
year end cash and cash equivalents decreased million from year end this decrease represents the million received from financing activities primarily from the july private placement less million used in operating activities and million used for property and equipment purchases 
subsequent to year end  the company received net proceeds of million upon the exercise of certain warrants issued in the july private placement see note ii a of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
year end net accounts receivable increased by million over year end net accounts receivable  due to an increase of million in net sales in the quarter ending december  over the corresponding quarter 
fourth quarter sales increased as a result of the december launch of hydroxychloroquine sulfate 
inventory at year end increased by million over year end inventory due to a higher level of finished goods and work in process to support higher sales  and increased raw materials associated with the company s validation of its manufacturing process for two products for which andas were pending at december  approvals were subsequently received in 
the company expects inventory to increase further during as it introduces several new products and as it builds up inventory to better meet customers requirements 
year end accounts payable increased by million over year end accounts payable due primarily to higher purchases of raw materials and supplies to support higher levels of production and the anticipation of the launches of two new products during the first quarter of both launches of which occurred 
property and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  increased  between december  and december  to meet growing production needs 
a large portion of this increase related to equipment purchases for manufacturing and r d purposes  and to leasehold improvements and furniture in the company s new facility 
the company took occupancy of its new facility in may  thereby freeing up space in its former location to be used for expansion of manufacturing operations 
as the company grows  its capital requirements will continue to increase 
the company must be able to finance its inventory requirements and carry accounts receivable arising from sales of existing and new products 
growth also requires the company to expend funds to make improvements to its facilities and to acquire additional equipment 
new product introductions can be particularly capital intensive 
the launch of a generic version of a brand product upon expiration of the brand s patent  particularly in a large market product  requires the company to purchase raw materials to validate its manufacturing process prior to the expiration of the patent 
subsequent to the launch of such a new product  the company may need to purchase significant quantities of raw materials to allow it to manufacture sufficient inventory to meet customer demand 
also  the company may consider it necessary to purchase raw materials ahead of an approval in order to be one of the earliest entrants to the market with such generic product when and if such approval is finally received 
such commitment of funds will not result in sales of such product unless and until final approval of the company s anda is received for such product and such product is launched 
additionally  the company must be able to carry accounts receivable relating to sales of such new product 
depending on the circumstances surrounding new product launches  it can take between four and twelve months from the time the company pays for the raw materials to the time it collects proceeds from sales of new products 
in the event anda approval is not received for such new products  the company may lose funds expended or committed for raw materials relating to such products 
the company also requires capital to fund research and development efforts 
since the beginning of  the company has accelerated its research and development efforts and has committed increasing amounts of funds to these efforts 
resources permitting  the company anticipates that it will continue to increase its research and development efforts during future periods 
the company will continue to monitor its capital requirements and seek additional capital if and when it becomes necessary 
the company regularly reviews its capital needs and believes that capital will be available when required 
there can be no assurance  however  that necessary funding will be available in the future and  if available  that the amounts available will satisfy all of the company s capital requirements 
if the company were to be unable to obtain sufficient capital  it would likely be forced to reduce the level of its research and development efforts and to make other necessary changes to its present business plans until such funding could be secured
