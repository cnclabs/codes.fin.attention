there are various proceedings pending against or involving the company which are ordinary or routine given the nature of the company s existing and prior businesses 
the company has recorded a liability related to litigation where it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and that the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
while the outcome of the company s legal proceedings cannot at this time be predicted with certainty  management does not expect that these matters will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated balance sheet or statement of operations of the company 
the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party by various federal and state authorities for clean up at various waste disposal sites 
while it is often extremely difficult to reasonably quantify future environmental related expenditures  the company has engaged various third parties to perform feasibility studies and assist in estimating the cost of investigation and remediation 
the company s policy is to accrue environmental and clean up related costs of a non capital nature when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and that the amount can be reasonably estimated 
based upon currently available information  including the reports of third parties  management does not believe that the reasonably possible loss in excess of the amounts accrued would be material to the consolidated financial statements

in addition  during the year ended december   the company spent approximately million on capital expenditures  most of which were directed toward implementing new design and information systems and upgrading and improving manufacturing equipment 
cash proceeds from sales of property  plant and equipment  and assets held for sale were 
million and

on march  the company sold the business and assets of its concrete division 
upon the closing of the sale  the company received approximately million of cash  after adjustments 
the decision to sell the concrete construction group was based upon the company s current liquidity and the projected liquidity needs required to fund the concrete business bonding needs 
as a result  primarily of the above  unrestricted cash and cash equivalents increased by million during the company s primary sources of liquidity include available cash and cash equivalents and credit which is provided under the company s existing credit facility with foothill capital corporation the credit facility 
availability under the credit facility is based on a percentage of eligible as defined in the credit facility and subject to certain restrictions accounts receivable and inventory  plus a base amount which base amount is reduced by  per month and is subject to reduction in the case of sales of certain property  plant and equipment  plus the amount provided by the company as cash collateral  if any each together the borrowing base 
at december   the borrowing base was estimated to be million including million related to the canadian building products operation which in connection with the company s plan to exit the building products business is pending disposition 
at december   the borrowing base was used to support a million term loan note which is required to be outstanding pursuant to the terms of the credit facility  and million of outstanding letters of credit which are used primarily to support insurance programs  bonding programs  and certain foreign credit facilities 
the company had unused availability under the facility of million at december  the letters of credit which are supporting foreign credit facilities include a million letter of credit supporting the company s asia pacific building product s banking facility and a million letter of credit supporting the company s former uk building products subsidiary 
the letter of credit supporting the uk subsidiary was drawn on february  by the bank  resulting in the company having to fund the face amount of the letter of credit 
the company is currently evaluating its alternatives with respect to recovering the letter of credit amount from the former uk subsidiary  however  there is no assurance that the company s attempts at recovery will be successful 
outlook 
during  the management of the company and the board of directors determined that the best strategy for the company was to operate solely as a metal buildings business 
this decision was based in part on the operating success which the company has achieved with its existing metal building businesses  along with the long term view of the value of the metal building business and the cash and liquidity demands which would be required to fund the ongoing operations of the non metal buildings businesses 
the company anticipates that demands on its liquidity and credit resources will continue to be significant during and the next several years primarily as a result of funding requirements associated with the trailing liabilities of sold and discontinued businesses and financing costs 
the company expects to meet these requirements through a number of sources  including operating cash generated by the company s metal buildings group  available cash which was million at december   and availability under credit facilities 
during the first quarter of  the company reduced its letters of credit which were outstanding at december  by million  including the reduction from the uk subsidiary letter of credit  which was drawn in the first quarter with the remainder reflecting primarily reductions in the collateral required to support insurance programs and bonding programs 
the company s liquidity projections are predicated on estimates as to the amount and timing of the payment of the company s trailing liabilities and expectations regarding the operating performance of the company s operations 
in the event the company experiences significant differences as to the amount and timing of the payment of the company s trailing liabilities and or the actual operating results of the company s operations  the company may be required to seek additional capital through new credit facilities  modification of existing credit facilities  or through a possible debt or equity offering  or a combination of the above 
there can be no assurance  however  that such additional capital would be available to the company
