liquidity and capital resources cash requirements historically have been satisfied through cash flow from operations  borrowings  or sales of transportation equipment 
liquidity beyond will depend  in part  on cash flow provided by continued remarketing of the equipment portfolio at similar lease rates  effectiveness of cost control programs  additional equipment sales  and originating and placing equipment leases with institutional investors 
uses of cash in the short term will be funding the costs of offering of fund i and originating equipment leases for the company s account that will be financed through a securitization facility 
management believes the company can accomplish the preceding and will have sufficient liquidity and capital resources for the future 
specifically  future liquidity is influenced by the following a debt financing senior debt on june   the company closed a million senior loan facility with a syndicate of insurance companies and repaid the prior bank facility 
the company has pledged substantially all of its equipment as collateral to the loan facility 
the facility provides that equipment sale proceeds from pledged equipment or cash deposits will be placed into collateral accounts or used to purchase additional equipment 
the facility requires quarterly interest only payments through march   with quarterly principal payments of million plus interest charges beginning june   through termination of the loan in june in december  the company repaid million of its senior debt through the use of cash collateral from the sale of pledged equipment 
subordinated debt in december  the company used existing cash to prepay million of its subordinated debt and incurred prepayment penalties of approximately million 
although the company s liquidity has been negatively impacted in the short term  subsequent cash flow increases will result due to reduced interest costs of approximately million from now until the end of the subordinated debt term in february in july and october  the company repaid million and million of its subordinated debt  respectively  at a discount of million in the aggregate 
bridge financing assets acquired and held on an interim basis for placement with affiliated partnerships or sale to third parties have  from time to time  been partially funded by a million short term equipment acquisition loan facility 
the company amended this facility on september  the amendment extended the facility until september   and provides for a million letter of credit as part of the million facility 
this facility  which is shared with egfs ii  iii  iv  v  vi  vii  and fund i  allows the company to purchase equipment prior to the designated program or partnership being identified  or prior to having raised sufficient capital to purchase the equipment 
this facility provides financing if the company is the borrower and working capital is used for the nonfinanced costs of these acquisitions 
the company retains the difference between the net lease revenue earned and the interest expense during the interim holding period since its capital is at risk 
as of march   the company had million of outstanding borrowings while the egfs and fund i had no borrowings outstanding under this facility 
securitization facility the company entered into a securitization facility on july   which makes available for one year up to million on a non recourse basis to be secured primarily by finance type leases with terms of generally four to five years 
repayment of the facility matches the terms of the underlying leases 
the securitized debt is expected to bear interest equivalent to average us treasuries plus 
as of december   there were no borrowings on this facility 
b employee stock ownership plan the company terminated its esop effective december   and the esop debt was repaid in full by offsetting the debt with the restricted cash equivalents and restricted marketable securities that served as collateral for the loan million 
the company has eliminated annual interest expense of approximately million and preferred dividends of million 
c equipment leasing activities over the last two years  the company has downsized its owned equipment portfolio  through the sale or disposal of underperforming and nonperforming assets  in an effort to strengthen the future performance of the portfolio 
the company will continue to identify underperforming and nonperforming assets for sale or disposal as necessary 
during  the company generated proceeds of million from the sale of equipment for lease 
these net proceeds were placed in a collateral account as required by the senior secured term loan agreement 
in march  the lender consented to the company s request to release from the cash collateral account million in funds relating primarily to asset sales 
the request to release funds and the subsequent approval were based on the appraised fair market value of the equipment portfolio and the related collateral coverage ratio 
the company  through its afg subsidiary  originates leases it will either sell to institutional investors and earn certain fees or retain using financing from the securitization facility 
the retained leases will require cash to complete the purchase of the leased equipment placed in the securitization facility 
this will negatively impact liquidity over the next several years 
d syndication activities the company earned fees from syndication activities related to egf vii through april of total equity raised for this partnership was million from inception through april  when the program closed 
there will be no additional equity raised for this partnership 
the overall limited partnership syndication market has been contracting 
the company s management is concerned with the continued contraction of the equipment leasing syndication market and its effect on the volume of partnership equity that can be raised 
the company s newly registered and currently marketed no front end fee syndication product fund i was developed to capture a larger share of the syndication market 
the no front end fee structure of fund i requires the company to pay offering and organizational costs  including broker dealer commissions  as syndicated equity is raised 
in previous investor programs sponsored by the company  most offering and organizational expenses were reimbursed to the company 
since may through december   fund i raised million in equity investment from the public 
this is higher than the equity raised for egf vii during the same period of though the company receives a higher share of fund i distributions versus its share of equipment growth fund program distributions  the front end investments required by the company in the form of expense payments on behalf of fund i will negatively impact the company s liquidity during the investment phase of the program 
management believes that through debt and equity financing  possible sales of transportation equipment  and cash flows from operations  the company will have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet its projected future operating needs 
inflation there was no significant impact on the company s operations as a result of inflation during   or new accounting pronouncements for discussion of the impact of new accounting pronouncements refer to note to the financial statements 
trends the company continues to seek opportunities for new businesses  markets  and acquisitions 
during  the company entered into an agreement with american finance group  lp afg lp to form a new subsidiary of the company  american finance group afg  to assume the lease origination and servicing operations  the rights to manage a significant offshore investment program  and certain furniture  computers  and software of afg  lp in the future  the company intends for afg to originate and manage primarily finance type lease transactions on new equipment under a securitization facility for the company s own account or sold to unaffiliated investment program investors 
as part of the company s strategic decision to reduce the size of its owned equipment portfolio  the company sold million of which million was included in assets held for sale as of december   based on original cost  of its owned equipment in  and the company expects to continue to sell equipment in and beyond 
as a result of the reduction in owned equipment  the company s operating lease revenues are expected to continue to decrease as well as the associated depreciation  operating  and repair and maintenance costs 
however  the company has used the proceeds from equipment sales and cash from operations to significantly reduce senior and subordinated outstanding indebtedness by million over the last two years  resulting in reduced interest costs 
the impact of the million reduction in subordinated debt levels that occurred in the fourth quarter of  is expected to result in reduced interest costs of million from now until the end of the subordinated debt term in march additionally  the company has conducted a review of existing operations to identify areas for productivity improvements  process streamlining  and other cost savings currently being implemented with the intent of reducing operations support and general and administrative expenses in the future
