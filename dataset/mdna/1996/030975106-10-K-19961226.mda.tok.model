item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations analysis of results of operations the partnership s accounting periods end on the th of the month 
the predecessors accounting periods ended on the rd of the month 
the following analysis compares amerigas partners results of operations for the weeks ended september  fiscal with pro forma results of operations for the weeks ended september  pro forma fiscal which includes an additional week of results ie the period september to september  due to the difference in the partnership s and the predecessors year ends 
the following analysis also compares the partnership s results for the period april  to september  five month period with pro forma results for the period april  to september  pro forma five month period  and each of amerigas propane s and petrolane s results of operations for the period september  to april  each the seven month period with amerigas propane s and petrolane s results of operations for the period september  to april  each the seven month period 
due to the seasonality of amerigas partners  amerigas propane s and petrolane s businesses  the results of operations for periods of less than twelve months are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full year 
the pro forma consolidated statements of operations data of the partnership  which include periods prior to the partnership formation  were derived from the historical statements of operations of the predecessors for the period september  to april  the pro forma statements of operations were prepared to reflect the effects of the partnership formation as if the formation had been completed in its entirety as of the beginning of the periods presented 
the pro forma consolidated statements of operations data do not purport to present the results of operations of the partnership had the partnership formation actually been completed as of the beginning of the periods presented 
in addition  the pro forma consolidated statements of operations data are not necessarily indicative of the results of future operations of the partnership and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the partnership  the consolidated financial statements of petrolane  and the combined financial statements of amerigas propane  and the related notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
significant pro forma adjustments reflected in the data include a the elimination of income taxes as a result of operating in a partnership structure  b an adjustment to interest expense resulting from the retirement of approximately million of petrolane term loans  the restructuring of petrolane and amerigas propane senior debt  and the issuance of an aggregate million face value of notes of amerigas partners and the operating partnership  c the elimination of management fees previously charged to petrolane by ugi  d a net reduction in amortization expense resulting from the longer term year amortization of the excess purchase price over fair value of of the net identifiable assets of petrolane  compared with the amortization of of petrolane s excess reorganization value over years  and e the elimination of intercompany revenues and expenses

partnership results of operations fiscal compared with pro forma fiscal retail volumes of propane sold increased million gallons in fiscal reflecting the effects of colder weather  acquisitions and volume growth 
regional temperature differences in fiscal were significant with the western us experiencing substantially warmer than normal temperatures and lower retail sales  and the eastern and midwestern us experiencing colder than normal temperatures and higher retail sales 
wholesale volumes of propane sold were significantly higher reflecting an increase in sales of low margin excess storage inventories 
total revenues increased during fiscal reflecting the increase in propane sales as well as higher average retail propane selling prices 
total cost of sales increased million as a result of the higher volumes of propane sold and higher average propane product costs 
the partnership s propane product cost averaged approximately five cents a gallon higher in fiscal than in pro forma fiscal the spot price of propane at mont belvieu  texas  a major storage and distribution hub  increased dramatically in august and september  rising to cents per gallon on september  compared to cents per gallon a year earlier 
the general trend of propane product cost increases has continued through november total propane margin was higher in fiscal as a result of the greater volumes of propane sold 
average retail unit margins in fiscal were slightly lower than in pro forma fiscal  notwithstanding an increase in average retail selling price  reflecting the impact of higher average propane product costs which were not completely passed through to customers 
the increases in fiscal operating income and earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda reflect principally the increase in total propane margin partially offset by higher operating and administrative expenses 
operating expenses in fiscal are net of million from a refund of insurance premium deposits made in prior years and million from reductions to reserves for environmental matters recorded in the quarter ended march operating expenses in pro forma fiscal include million in accruals for management reorganization activities 
operating expenses  exclusive of these items  increased million reflecting higher payroll and employee compensation expenses associated with the partnership s new management structure  higher vehicle and distribution expenses due in part to the higher retail volumes and severe eastern us winter weather  higher expenses associated with sales and marketing programs  increased customer equipment repairs and maintenance expenses  and incremental costs associated with acquisitions and new district locations 
the partnership instituted cost reduction programs in mid  which are continuing  in order to reduce the level of operating and administrative costs 
five month period compared with pro forma five month period retail volumes of propane sold increased million gallons in the five month period 
approximately million retail gallons are attributable to five additional workdays included in the five month period resulting from the partnership having a different fiscal year end than the predecessor companies 
the remainder of the increase in retail gallons is principally attributable to aggressive sales and marketing programs implemented by the partnership to improve customer retention and to attract new customers  and an increase in gallons due to acquisitions 
the sales and marketing programs were in many cases accompanied by lower prices in market segments in which strong competitive conditions exist 
this was especially the case in the partnership s northern and pacific regions where average residential prices declined significantly 
principally as a result of the increase in retail gallons sold and notwithstanding a decrease in average retail selling prices  revenues from sales of propane increased million 
total propane margin increased 
million reflecting the impact of the increase in retail gallons sold 
absent the effect of additional workdays in the five month period  total propane margin decreased million as the impact of slightly higher retail sales was more than offset by the effect of lower retail unit margins principally caused by lower average retail prices 
ebitda was million in the five month period compared with pro forma ebitda of million in the pro forma five month period 
the decrease in ebitda  despite the higher total margin  reflects the impact of higher operating expenses resulting from the additional workdays included in the five month period and higher expenses including higher employee compensation expenses resulting in part from newly implemented marketing and sales programs 
in september  the general partner announced management organizational changes in response to competitive conditions in markets served by the partnership 
during the five month period  the partnership accrued million of costs related to these organizational changes 
interest expense was million in the five month period compared with million in the pro forma five month period 
the higher interest expense principally reflects the additional week in the five month period resulting from the different fiscal year end of the partnership 
predecessor companies results of operations seven month period compared with seven month period amerigas propane the average temperature across amerigas propane s nationwide service territory during the seven month period was warmer than normal and warmer than the prior year period 
retail volumes of propane sold declined due in large part to the warmer weather s effect on sales of propane used for heating 
the lower sales volume was the primary reason for a million decrease in propane revenues 
the lower seven month period retail volumes sold  along with lower average unit margins resulting from lower average retail prices and slightly higher unit product costs  resulted in a million decrease in total propane margin 
the effects of the lower heating sales were most evident in amerigas propane s residential market segment which typically has higher average unit margins than in the commercial industrial heating markets 
this was particularly the case in amerigas propane s northern and southern regions where significantly warmer than normal winter weather reduced propane demand 
the lower demand heightened competitive pressures to reduce prices which  together with the slightly higher product costs  resulted in lower seven month period average unit margins 
these competitive pressures also resulted in a modest loss of customers 
average unit margins in amerigas propane s commercial industrial and agricultural markets were also slightly lower than during the seven month period due in large part to price reductions resulting from competitive pressures and the introduction of aggressive marketing programs late in the seven month period 
operating expenses  net of fee income from the customer services agreement with petrolane  were virtually unchanged in the seven month period 
interest expense decreased 
million in the seven month period reflecting lower average levels of debt outstanding 
income tax expense in the seven month period includes the write off of million of deferred tax benefits no longer realizable as a result of the merger of amerigas propane into the operating partnership 
petrolane temperatures across petrolane s service territory during the seven month period averaged warmer than normal and warmer than during the seven month period 
the combination of warmer than normal weather and to a much lesser extent  modest customer losses  resulted in a million gallon decrease in retail volumes of propane sold 
total revenues decreased million to million during the seven month period 
decreases in sales to residential customers accounted for approximately two thirds of the overall decrease in retail volumes sold 
the warmer weather also contributed to lower commercial and industrial sales 
agricultural gallons sold decreased due in part to a poor grain drying season in the midwest and reduced usage for poultry brooding 
wholesale sales  on which unit margins are significantly lower than on retail sales  decreased million gallons 
these sales were also affected by the warmer than normal weather 
average unit margins were slightly lower in the seven month period compared with the seven month period primarily as a result of higher average propane product costs in the seven month period and the introduction of aggressive sales and marketing programs late in the period to retain customers and to increase market share 
as a result of the lower average unit margins and the decreased sales volumes  total propane margin decreased million in the seven month period 
partially offsetting the decrease in total margin was a million decrease in net operating expenses 
the lower operating expenses reflect  in part  lower payroll expense because of lower overtime pay  lower fees for professional services and lower computer expense 
interest expense increased million to million reflecting higher seven month period interest rates on petrolane s variable rate debt 
the effective income tax rate was for the seven month period compared with a rate of in the prior year 
both rates reflect the impact of nondeductible amortization of excess reorganization value 
financial condition and liquidity capitalization and liquidity amerigas partners debt outstanding at september  totaled million compared to million at september  the increase is principally a result of million in combined borrowings under the operating partnership s bank credit facilities 
the bank credit facilities consist of a revolving credit facility  an acquisition facility and a special purpose facility  each governed by the bank credit agreement 
the operating partnership s obligations under these facilities are collateralized by substantially all of its assets 
the operating partnership s revolving credit facilities which include the revolving credit facility  the general partner credit facility  and a portion of the special purpose facility as described below  provide for borrowings of up to million to fund working capital  capital expenditures  and interest and distribution payments 
the revolving credit facility provides for borrowings of up to million including a million sublimit for letters of credit 
borrowings under this facility totaled million at september  the revolving credit facility expires april   but may be extended  upon timely notice  for additional one year periods with the consent of the participating banks representing at least of the commitments thereunder 
the general partner credit facility  which became effective october   provides for borrowings of up to million 
this agreement is coterminous with the operating partnership s revolving credit facility 
borrowings under the general partner credit facility will be unsecured and subordinated in right of payment to all of the partnership s existing senior debt 
ugi has agreed to contribute on an as needed basis through its subsidiaries up to million to the general partner to fund such borrowings 
the special purpose facility is a million nonrevolving line of credit which can be used for the payment of certain liabilities of petrolane assumed by the operating partnership that relate to potential liabilities for tax  insurance and environmental matters 
the special purpose facility expires april  at which time all amounts then outstanding will become immediately due and payable 
effective october   the bank credit agreement was amended to include a revolving million sublimit under the special purpose facility which can be used to fund working capital  capital expenditures  and interest and distribution payments 
this sublimit is scheduled to expire april  as of september   there were million in special purpose borrowings outstanding under the special purpose facility 
the acquisition facility provides the operating partnership with the ability to borrow up to million to finance propane business acquisitions 
the acquisition facility operates as a revolving facility through october  at which time any amounts then outstanding will convert to a quarterly amortizing year term loan 
the partnership expects to refinance such loans on a long term basis 
as of september   there were million in loans outstanding under the acquisition facility 
the ability of the partnership to issue debt under the above facilities is subject to provisions in the partnership s loan agreements which require  among other things  minimum debt to capital and interest coverage ratios 
based upon such ratios calculated as of september   the operating partnership could borrow the maximum amount available under its revolving credit  special purpose and general partner revolving credit facilities 
the partnership has succeeded to certain lease guarantees and scheduled claim obligations relating to certain of petrolane s former businesses and has also succeeded to petrolane s agreements with third parties for payment indemnification relating to such obligations 
at september   the lease guarantee obligations totaled approximately million and scheduled claims of at least million were pending 
to date  the partnership has not paid any amounts under these lease guarantee and scheduled claim obligations see note to consolidated financial statements 
distributions the partnership makes distributions to its partners approximately days after the end of each fiscal quarter in an aggregate amount equal to its available cash for such quarter  subject to limitations under its loan agreements see note to consolidated financial statements 
available cash generally means  with respect to any fiscal quarter of the partnership  all cash on hand at the end of such quarter plus all additional cash on hand as of the date of determination resulting from borrowings subsequent to the end of such quarter less the amount of cash reserves established by the general partner in its reasonable discretion for future cash requirements 
these reserves are retained to provide for the proper conduct of the partnership s business  the payment of debt principal and interest and to provide funds for distribution during the next four quarters 
distributions by the partnership in an amount equal to of its available cash will generally be made to the common and subordinated unitholders and to the general partner  subject to the payment of incentive distributions in the event available cash exceeds the mqd of 
on all units 
to the extent there is sufficient available cash  the holders of common units have the right to receive the mqd  plus any arrearages  prior to the distribution of available cash to holders of subordinated units 
common units will not accrue arrearages for any quarter after the subordination period as defined below and subordinated units will not accrue any arrearage with respect to distributions for any quarter 
the subordination period will generally extend until the first day of any quarter beginning on or after april  by which a distributions of available cash from operating surplus generally defined as million plus million of cash on hand as of april  plus all operating cash receipts less all operating cash expenditures and cash reserves equal or exceed the mqd on each of the outstanding common and subordinated units for each of the four consecutive four quarter periods immediately preceding such date  b the adjusted operating surplus generally defined as operating surplus adjusted to exclude working capital borrowings  reductions in cash reserves and million plus million of cash on hand as of april  and to include increases in reserves to provide for distributions resulting from operating surplus generated during such period generated during both i each of the two immediately preceding four quarter periods and ii the immediately preceding sixteen quarter period  equals or exceeds the mqd on each of the common and subordinated units outstanding during those periods  and c there are no arrearages on the common units 
prior to the end of the subordination period but not prior to march    subordinated units will convert into common units for any quarter ending on or after march   and an additional  subordinated units will convert into common units for any quarter ending on or after march   if a distributions of available cash from operating surplus on each of the outstanding common and subordinated units equal or exceed the mqd for each of the three consecutive four quarter periods immediately preceding such date  b the adjusted operating surplus generated during the immediately preceding twelve quarter period equals or exceeds the mqd on all of the common and subordinated units outstanding during that period  c the general partner makes a good faith determination that the partnership will  with respect to the four quarter period commencing with such date  generate adjusted operating surplus in an amount equal to or exceeding the mqd on all of the outstanding common and subordinated units  and d there are no arrearages on the common units 
during fiscal  the partnership paid the full mqd on all limited partner units outstanding 
the amount of available cash needed to distribute the mqd on all such units as well as the general partner interest during was approximately million million for the common units  million for the subordinated units  and million for the general partner interests 
a reasonable proxy for the amount of distributable cash actually generated by the partnership during  determined by subtracting maintenance capital expenditures of million from the partnership s earnings before depreciation and amortization  was approximately million 
although distributions in were in excess of cash generated by the partnership  the partnership had cash and short term investment balances of million at the beginning of the year 
due to the seasonality of its operating cash flows and working capital needs  during fiscal the partnership was required on a short term basis to use the revolving credit facility to fund a portion of such distribution payments 
although the level of distributable cash generated in fiscal is more than sufficient to pay the full mqd on all common units  the ability of the partnership to continue to pay the full mqd on its subordinated units will depend upon a number of factors including a significant improvement in the level of partnership earnings  the cash needs of the partnership s operations including cash needed for maintenance and growth capital  and the partnership s ability to finance externally such cash needs 
the partnership s management expects the partnership s earnings to improve as a result of a number of factors including a continued focus on reducing operating expenses  volume increases through acquisitions and internal growth  increased monitoring of pricing  improved propane product cost management  and improved customer retention as a result of an emphasis on customer service 
such earnings improvement  however  is subject to a number of factors beyond the control of the partnership including weather  competitive conditions in the markets served by the partnership  and the cost of propane  among others 
cash flows operating activities 
cash flow from operating activities was million in fiscal cash flow from operating activities before changes in operating working capital was million 
changes in operating working capital used million of operating cash flow in fiscal due principally to increases in accounts receivable due to the higher heating season sales and an increase in propane inventories due to higher late fiscal propane product costs and greater propane inventory volumes partially offset by the impact of an increase in accounts payable 
investing activities 
expenditures for property  plant and equipment totaled million in fiscal the partnership expects capital expenditures of approximately million in fiscal and expects to fund these capital expenditures through internally generated cash as well as through external financing sources 
during fiscal  the partnership made several business acquisitions for million in cash 
financing activities 
during fiscal the partnership paid the mqd on all limited partner and general partner interests totaling million 
the partnership had borrowings of million under its revolving credit facility and  during the year  borrowed million under its acquisition facility and million under the partnership s special purpose facility 
the partnership also made long term debt repayments of million in fiscal including million of debt repayments associated with ugi s contribution of the net assets of oahu gas service  inc partnership formation transactions 
cash paid for partnership formation transactions during fiscal represents the reimbursement by the partnership of fees and expenses previously paid by amerigas relating to the formation of the partnership 
propane procurement the partnership  from time to time  holds propane option contracts to manage propane price risk associated with a portion of its anticipated propane procurement during the heating season 
the unrealized gain on such contracts at september  and was not material 
in addition to these option contracts  the partnership fixes costs on a portion of its propane supply requirements by entering into firm commitments with suppliers to provide propane at future dates at fixed prices 
impact of inflation inflation affects the prices the partnership pays for operating and administrative services and  to some extent  propane gas 
competitive pressures in recent years have limited the partnership s and the predecessor companies ability to recover fully propane product cost increases 
the partnership attempts to limit the effects of inflation on its results of operations through cost control efforts and productivity improvements
