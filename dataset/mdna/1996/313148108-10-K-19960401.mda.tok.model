item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial information at and for the twelve months ended december  and is consolidated to include the accounts of farmer mac and its two wholly owned subsidiaries  farmer mac mortgage securities corporation fmmsc and farmer mac acceptance corporation fmac 
all material intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
overview was an important year for farmer mac 
farmer mac undertook a major legislative initiative that culminated in the passage by congress in early of significant revisions to its statutory charter 
consequently  was the last year that farmer mac would be required to do business under  and that its financial performance would be evaluated on the basis of  the provisions of a charter that farmer mac s board and management had concluded was seriously constraining the development of the secondary market for agricultural real estate and rural housing loans 
the new legislation authorizes farmer mac to perform the functions of a pooler in the secondary market  eliminates the requirement to create a minimum subordinated interest or reserve requirement in connection with farmer mac guarantee transactions  and extends from december to december the statutory deadline for the full imposition of certain regulatory capital requirements applicable to farmer mac 
the legislation requires farmer mac to increase its level of core capital to at least million by february or sooner if business volume increases substantially or face suspension of its authority to conduct any new business 
the legislation also made various statutory changes intended to further streamline program operations and clarify other ambiguous statutory provisions 
for a detailed discussion of the changes to farmer mac s charter as a result of the act  see recent legislative revisions to farmer mac s statutory charter 
in addition to the passage of the legislation  there were other significant occurrences in in may  c 
eugene branstool  president clinton s nominee to be chairman of the farmer mac board  was officially appointed to that position 
he replaced john r 
dahl  who served in that post from until mid other developments during the year included the guarantee of two loan pools under the farmer mac i program  the development of two active farmer mac i pooling programs for newly originated qualified loans  one for agricultural real estate loans under the strategic alliance agreement with wfcb and one for rural housing loans operated by agfirst farm credit bank  and the significant expansion of business volume through the farmer mac ii program 
in addition  farmer mac consolidated its existing operations by decertifying poolers that failed to comply with minimum business volume guidelines established by the board for the fiscal year  and focused its limited resources on supporting pooling programs operated by the remaining poolers and the farmer mac ii program 
financially  farmer mac reported a loss from operations during of thousand  down significantly from the million for farmer mac is in a transition period as a result of the favorable outcome of its legislative initiative 
in particular  farmer mac is no longer subject to former charter provisions that had precluded it from dealing directly with originators  and now has the authority  similar to that possessed by fannie mae and freddie mac  to function as an active pooler 
farmer mac is currently evaluating the manner in which it intends to exercise its new authorities under the act by conducting analyses of the risks associated with such enhanced powers 
one principal focus is upon its new status as a first loss guarantor  since the legislation eliminated the former mandatory subordinated interest or reserve requirement that was intended to absorb losses before the guarantee could be invoked 
another principal focus is upon the development of appropriate operating policies and procedures intended to assure the safe and sound operation of the program under the new authorities 
the board determined that implementation of those authorities should occur by following a two phased approach 
phase i of the implementation process involves the development of a guarantee fee model 
the work on this project began in late february and is scheduled to be completed by early april 
the guarantee fee model developed by farmer mac will be evaluated and tested by an independent consultant before it is accepted for purposes of establishing guarantee fee levels for the program 
upon completion of phase i  it is anticipated that farmer mac will proceed with the securitization of pools presented by either of its existing poolers and consider swap and securitization transactions involving seasoned loan portfolios that meet existing program requirements for loan performance and diversification 
these efforts are also intended to support the efforts of the existing poolers  agfunding for agricultural real estate loans and agfirst for rural housing loans  to build loan volume through their pooling programs 
under phase ii of the implementation process  farmer mac plans to evaluate all aspects of its current program and develop new policies and procedures considered necessary for the full implementation of its newly authorized direct pooling program 
this work presently is scheduled to be completed prior to the beginning of the fall mortgage lending season for agricultural real estate loans 
the major elements of this evaluation will include review and refinement of credit scoring and underwriting and appraisal standards  analysis of diversification requirements and development of appropriate guidelines  and evaluation of outsourcing versus internalizing the performance of certain functions under the new structure  such as due diligence reviews  pipeline management and warehousing of loans during pool development  loan servicing  quality control  securitization  and marketing 
having achieved the legislative initiative undertaken in early  farmer mac now faces the difficult challenge of implementing its new legislative authorities in the very competitive market for agricultural and rural home mortgages 
although those authorities give farmer mac the statutory flexibility to devise programs that operate under similar guidelines to those of fannie mae and freddie mac  this flexibility by no means ensures success of farmer mac s programs 
a number of factors have constrained participation in farmer mac s programs to date  and caused its core business activities to be unprofitable 
those factors have included the excess liquidity of many agricultural lenders  the attractiveness of loans otherwise qualified under the farmer mac programs as investments for their originators  the disinclination of many lenders to offer intermediate term adjustable rate and long term fixed rate agricultural real estate loans  as a result of the higher profitability associated with short term lending  the lack of borrower demand for intermediate and long term loans due to the lower interest rates generally associated with shorter term loans  various restrictive provisions in farmer mac s charter  and the unfavorable regulatory capital treatment afforded banks and system institutions holding subordinated securities created in farmer mac transactions 
even though the act has removed those charter provisions that farmer mac had concluded were constraining the operation of the secondary market  most of the other enumerated factors  over which farmer mac has little  if any  control  may continue to exist as farmer mac seeks to implement its new authorities 
if those factors persist  they will affect farmer mac s ability to implement programs that generate the volume of loans necessary to achieve profitability and ultimately comply with the requirement to raise capital to higher levels by february several positive developments have come from the legislation  including lower interest rates on loans offered in the pooling program operated by wfcb as a result of the elimination of the subordination requirement and corresponding increases in that program s loan volume  as well as an offer to purchase a substantial portion of farmer mac s voting common stock 
despite these positive developments  and farmer mac s ongoing efforts as described above to prepare for the implementation of its new authorities under the act  farmer mac s ability to operate profitably in the future remains uncertain 
turning to financial results for  farmer mac reported a net loss of thousand  which is a significant reduction from the net loss reported for the same period in this reduction in loss was primarily the result of increased net interest income and guarantee fee income and reduced administrative expenses 
farmer mac s administrative expenses will increase as it begins to implement the new authorities in the act 
financial review balance sheet general 
during  farmer mac s assets grew by million  from million at december  to million at december  the growth in assets primarily resulted from a growth in farmer mac i and ii securities and in investment securities

investment securities 
the million growth in investment securities from december  to december  resulted from management s decision to hold a portfolio of available for sale investment securities  comprised of agency mortgage backed securities with floating rates 
this portfolio is primarily funded with debt of comparable maturities

farmer mac reported a net loss in of thousand  a decrease of thousand or from the loss reported in the decrease in loss is attributable to increased net interest income  a result of the shift from lower yielding to higher yielding interest earning assets  increased guarantee fee income from an increase in the level of outstanding farmer mac i and ii securities  and reduced expenses  a result of less pooler activity 
the million net loss reported in represents a thousand increase in loss from the increase in loss from to primarily results from the reduction of yield maintenance income relative to the increased level of premium amortization  both of which occurred as a result of prepayments on the mortgage loans underlying farmer mac i securities held by farmer mac and the higher interest rate environment in as compared to farmer mac recognized million of interest income from yield maintenance payments in  as compared to million in  and increased the level of premium amortization by million in  as compared to million in farmer mac s future profitability will be affected not only by guarantee volume but also by any payments farmer mac must make on its guarantees  payments it must make on its notes  the income it earns on its investment securities  its mortgage portfolio and other funds it is holding  and its administrative expenses 
losses  if any  on guarantees will be affected by many general circumstances  including agricultural growing conditions  agricultural market conditions and the agricultural economy  and particular circumstances  including the quality of farmer mac credit underwriting  appraisals and loan servicing 
the primary sources of funding for the payment of claims made under guarantees are the fees farmer mac charges for providing its guarantees  together with farmer mac s loss allowance  invested capital and the proceeds of any other debt issuance 
even with the new legislative authorities  improvements in farmer mac s operating results ultimately will depend upon the volume of new guarantee transactions  which in turn  is dependent upon continued and significantly increased utilization of its programs by its class a and class b stockholders 
net interest income 
net interest income increased thousand from to  and decreased thousand from to the increase in is largely attributable to an basis point increase in the net interest spread  resulting from a shift in the composition of interest earning assets from lower yielding farmer mac i securities to higher yielding farmer mac i and ii securities 
the effective yield on the farmer mac i securities has also increased from to as certain loans underlying the farmer mac i securities have extended beyond their scheduled maturity date  thus providing interest to farmer mac until the payoff date  and increasing the effective yield 
the thousand decrease from to is largely the result of the million or decline in the average balances of the farmer mac i and ii securities 
although the average balance of investments and the average rate of investments increased million and basis points  respectively  from to  these increases were not enough to offset the effects of the decline in the average balances of the farmer mac i and ii securities 
in the absence of increased volume  farmer mac s interest expense  over time  may exceed its interest income as the composition of its debt portfolio shifts from shorter term  lower costing debt to longer term  higher costing debt while the earnings from its mortgage portfolio continue to be recognized on a level yield basis 
the purchase of the mortgage portfolio was funded with a series of callable and non callable debt issues  at an initial weighted average interest rate below the level yield of the interest earning assets 
however  as the shorter term  lower costing debt matures  the longer term  higher costing debt will remain  thus increasing the weighted average interest rate of farmer mac s debt portfolio and decreasing net interest income 
interest income 
interest income totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million increase from to in interest income is attributable to a million increase in the average amount of interest earning assets outstanding during as compared to  a result of million in net growth in the farmer mac ii program  and a basis point increase in the average rate of interest earning assets from to the increase in the average rate of interest earning assets was due to an increase in market interest rates  a shift from lower coupon  more seasoned farmer mac i and ii securities to higher coupon  newly originated farmer mac i and ii securities  and an increase in the effective yield of farmer mac i securities as a result of the extension of certain loans with balloon maturities underlying the farmer mac i securities 
in certain pools  loans with balloon maturities are permitted to remain in the pool up to two years after the scheduled maturity date 
farmer mac and or the holder of the farmer mac i securities receives interest during that two year period 
with respect to other interest earning investments  farmer mac has changed the composition of the portfolio from lower yielding investments such as commercial paper to higher yielding investments such as floating rate mortgage backed securities 
the thousand decrease in interest income from to is attributable to the million decrease in the average balance of farmer mac i and ii securities  a result of principal repayments on the securities  and the million reduction in interest income from the excess of the increased level of premium amortization over yield maintenance 
interest expense 
interest expense for the years ended december   and totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
the million increase from to in interest expense resulted from increases in the average amount and average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
during  farmer mac issued billion net of discount of discount notes and million of medium term notes and redeemed billion of discount notes and million of medium term notes 
the thousand decrease in interest expense from to is attributable to the decline in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities and the basis point decline in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
the greater concentration of shorter term  lower costing debt during lowered the overall cost of the total debt portfolio 
other income 
other income totaled million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  an increase of thousand from to and a decrease of thousand from to guarantee fee income  the principal component of other income  increased thousand from to and decreased thousand from to the changes in guarantee fee income for the comparable periods were attributable to the volume of guarantee transactions outstanding in each of the comparable periods 
miscellaneous income  the other component of other income  consisted primarily of transaction fees generated from the farmer mac ii program 
miscellaneous income decreased thousand from to and increased thousand from to the decrease in miscellaneous income from to resulted from a newly implemented policy of reducing transaction fees in the farmer mac ii program for large transactions 
the increase from to was primarily the result of the level of issuances of farmer mac ii securities and purchases of guaranteed portions under the farmer mac ii program for the comparable periods 
total volume under the farmer mac ii program totaled million in  as compared to million in and million in other expenses 
other expenses totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  a decrease of thousand from to  and a decrease of thousand from to the thousand decrease from to is largely attributable to reductions in compensation and employee benefits  professional fees and administrative expenses  which was partially offset by an increase in insurance expense 
compensation and employee benefits totaled million for  a decrease of thousand from the million reported for the decrease resulted from a reduction in the amount of bonuses paid to management and the use of lower costing temporary employees during professional fees  consisting primarily of legal  accounting and consulting fees  totaled thousand for  a decline of thousand from the thousand reported for the decrease resulted from non recurring consulting and professional fees  including a marketing and an asset liability management study  the transfer of trustees for the farmer mac ii program and the installation of a local area network  incurred in administrative expenses totaled thousand for  a decrease of thousand from the thousand reported for the decrease in administrative expenses is attributable to a reduction in travel related expenses and advertising costs  both of which resulted from less pooler activity 
insurance expense totaled thousand for  an increase of thousand from the thousand reported for the increase is attributable to an increase in directors and officers liability insurance coverage 
farmer mac s other expenses will increase as it proceeds to implement the new authorities under the act 
as previously noted  the implementation process consists of a two phased approach  and will likely involve the use of outside service providers and the hiring of additional employees 
from to  other expenses declined thousand  primarily the result of a decrease in professional fees and an increase in compensation and employee benefits 
professional fees decreased thousand from to  primarily as a result of the elimination of outside legal services related to the farmer mac ii program 
from through january  farmer mac utilized the services of outside counsel to assist with the issuance of securities under the farmer mac ii program  however  beginning february   all of these services were performed by internal legal personnel 
compensation and employee benefits increased thousand from to  a result of increases in staffing  attributable mainly to greater internal staffing of the farmer mac ii program 
during the latter half of  farmer mac added two employees and  in the first quarter of  added one employee 
extraordinary gain 
in  the corporation recognized an extraordinary gain of thousand or per share from the early extinguishment of million of debt 
dividends 
farmer mac has not paid and does not expect to pay dividends on its common stock in the near future 
dividends on the common stock are subject to determination and declaration by the board 
in february  the board adopted a policy stating that no dividends would be paid on farmer mac voting or non voting common stock until such time as farmer mac s stockholders equity is at least equal to million the amount of gross proceeds raised by farmer mac in its initial common stock offering 
thereafter  up to of accumulated net earnings may be paid out as dividends  provided that stockholders equity remains at least equal to million 
no preference between holders of the voting common stock and class c non voting common stock has been established relating to dividends 
the ratio of dividends paid on each share of class c non voting common stock to each share of voting common stock  however  will be three to one 
dividends paid to holders of class a and class b voting common stock will be equal 
risk management interest rate risk management 
interest rate risk is the risk that interest rate changes could materially affect equity and earnings 
farmer mac is subject to interest rate risk primarily as a result of the ability of borrowers to prepay their mortgages before the scheduled maturities 
mortgage prepayments can cause fluctuations in net interest income to the extent that they change the match of cashflows of farmer mac s assets and liabilities  as well as the amortization of certain deferred items 
this risk is mitigated by yield maintenance provisions  when present  which require borrower and or pooler payments to be made to farmer mac when the mortgage loans prepay 
these payments are calculated such that  when reinvested with the prepaid principal  they should generate substantially the same cash flows that would have been generated by the mortgage backed securities had the underlying mortgage loans not prepaid 
the existence of these provisions reduces but does not eliminate farmer mac s exposure to reinvestment risk 
management has established policies and implemented interest rate risk management procedures to monitor its exposure to interest rate volatility from prepayments and reinvestment risk 
management performs sensitivity analyses of farmer mac s market value of equity and net interest income and calculates the duration gap of its assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis 
these risk measures are reviewed regularly to determine the optimal asset and liability mix to limit farmer mac s exposure to interest rate risk 
farmer mac s primary strategy to manage prepayment and reinvestment risk is to fund the farmer mac i and ii securities with a mix of short term discount notes and callable and non callable medium term notes 
this funding mix is designed to match the expected cash flows of the mortgages underlying the farmer mac i and ii securities  while allowing farmer mac the ability to adjust debt maturities in response to prepayments 
credit risk management 
prior to enactment of the act  the board established a loss reserve policy for farmer mac  stipulating that ten percent of the guarantee fees earned from transactions in which farmer mac s guarantee is provided in the farmer mac i program be set aside as a loss allowance 
no loss allowance has been made specifically for the farmer mac ii program because the guaranteed portions are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states and are not materially exposed to credit losses 
as of december   farmer mac s total loss allowance was thousand  an increase of thousand from december  this increase in the allowance for losses is attributable to the volume of guarantee fees received in  as compared to see note to the financial statements 
future additions to this allowance will be charged to earnings and the amounts in the allowance account will be used to cover payments of any claims made under farmer mac guarantees 
farmer mac considers the amounts in the allowance account to be adequate to cover its exposure to guarantee payments on existing farmer mac i securities 
before farmer mac is required to make a guarantee payment on its existing farmer mac i securities  full recourse must be taken against a reserve or subordinated interest initially established in an amount equal to at least ten percent of the initial pool balance 
the main risk farmer mac bears is that this unguaranteed reserve or subordinated interest will be insufficient ultimately to cover timely payment of principal and interest to holders of farmer mac i securities 
to mitigate this risk  farmer mac has required all loans in a pool to meet standards with respect to loan to value ratios  other financial ratios  and diversification among crops and geographic locations represented 
farmer mac subjects each pool submitted for guarantee under the farmer mac i program to a stress test designed to analyze the pool s diversification and the sufficiency of the reserve or subordinated interest under simulated conditions of greatly increased foreclosures and losses 
farmer mac only provides its guarantee on securities backed by pools that pass its stress test 
as of december   the subordinated interests represented of the outstanding balance of all farmer mac i securities and subordinated interests  any losses incurred as a result of foreclosures may reduce the outstanding balance of the subordinated interests 
as part of the overall review of its policies in light of the changes from the act  farmer mac is currently evaluating the appropriateness of its loan loss reserve policy  particularly as a result of its new status as a first loss guarantor  and its underwriting standards 
at december   a total of two loans aggregating thousand were days or more past due  three loans totaling thousand were in foreclosure and title to two loans with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of thousand had been acquired by the trust in the farmer mac i program 
the seven loans combined represent of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding farmer mac i securities at december  management believes that no losses will be incurred by farmer mac as a result of the loans in foreclosure or the real estate owned by the trust 
liquidity farmer mac s primary sources of liquidity are issuances of debt obligations  and principal and interest payments on mortgages underlying securities purchased by farmer mac under the farmer mac i and farmer mac ii programs 
although farmer mac s debt is not guaranteed by the us government  the capital markets have treated its obligations as federal agency debt  allowing farmer mac to have ready access to funds at favorable rates 
funds from the issuance of discount notes and medium term notes may be used in the farmer mac i and farmer mac ii programs to cover transaction costs  guarantee payments and the costs of purchasing guaranteed portions  qualified loans and securities including farmer mac guaranteed securities backed by guaranteed portions and or qualified loans 
farmer mac may also issue notes to fund business operations  including liquidity 
farmer mac also maintains a portfolio of cash equivalents  comprised of commercial paper  federal funds  and other short term investments  to draw upon as necessary 
at december  and  farmer mac s cash and cash equivalents totaled million and million  respectively 
capital resources the act established capital requirements for farmer mac  which were modified by the act 
certain types of assets and guarantees are required to be supported by specific amounts of core capital 
the act further defines capital levels as minimum or critical  the act phases in higher minimum capital requirements over a three year transition period 
certain levels of enforcement are given to the fca depending upon farmer mac s compliance with these capital levels 
see recent legislative revisions to farmer mac s statutory charter summary of statutory changes capital and government regulation of farmer mac regulation capital standards 
as of december   farmer mac s minimum capital requirement was million and its actual capital level was million 
at december   farmer mac s minimum capital requirement was million  and its actual capital level was million 
see government regulation of farmer mac and note to the financial statements 
in the opinion of management  farmer mac has sufficient liquidity and capital for the next twelve months 
accounting standards in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which prescribes the accounting and reporting for all stock based compensation plans  including employee stock options  restricted stock  and stock appreciation rights 
this statement does not require companies to change their existing accounting for employee stock options under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
instead  the new rules encourage companies to recognize expense for stock based awards based on their estimated fair value on the date of grant 
companies electing to continue following present accounting rules under apb no 
will be required to provide pro forma disclosures of what net income and earnings per share would have been had the new fair value method been used 
this statement is effective as of january  management does not believe that this statement will have a material impact on farmer mac s financial results
