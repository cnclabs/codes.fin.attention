operating profits  however  improved substantially on these lower sales  returning this segment to a positive contributor to the company s profits 
during the revenues also decreased by  such decrease was  in the canadian operations and  in the us operations 
operating profits decreased by  the net effect of an increase in the us operating profits of  and a decrease of  in the canadian operations after restatement of the inventories of  the canadian operations were affected by price competition  increases in the cost of raw materials and the continuing slow canadian economy

gross profit margins regained part of what was lost during  ie margins after decreasing by recovered by in fiscal and another in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses have increased as a percentage of sales due to lower sales from sold operations and carrying cost associated with the physical plant building which was not sold with the meter socket business 
this property is currently listed for sale 
defense electronics sales increased by  to  during fiscal after declining by  due to cutbacks in defense spending and the older defense programs completing production 
the current years increase is due to new customers and the f tactical fighter program increasing greater than decreases in older programs slowly terminating 
sales increased by  during  however  included only eight months of sales since the inception of this segment on december  annualized sales would have amounted to approximately  based on the eight month results during with this real decline in sales levels  operating profits were significantly affected resulting in a loss of  when compared to profits of  or a  in negative swing 
the operating losses between  and increased by  and  to  primarily the result of obsolescence reserves against certain inventory which was acquired in the original acquisition from texas instruments

revenues increased by  during a year of transition from representing another company s product to the development during and marketing and selling efforts during of this segment s proprietary product recor  a gas electronic volume corrector  replacing the older and less versatile imported in line product 
odorization remained stable in but as previously mentioned declined in and operating income loss was   and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
the loss resulted from inventory obsolescence of approximately  and declining revenues with staffing levels anticipating higher demand for the company s recor product which did not materialize 
the consolidations and mergers currently taking place in the utility industry and the warmer than average winters have also contributed to the lower product demand 
metal fabrication revenues were   and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
in spite of the revenue increase of  operating profits declined by  to just  overhead and operational problems at the painting facility contributed significantly to the reduced operating profits

operating profits after having improved to  in  declined to a loss of  in both the increase and decline in operating profits were directly related to manufacturing problems occurring during fiscal which required replacement and additional maintenance on key injection molding equipment
