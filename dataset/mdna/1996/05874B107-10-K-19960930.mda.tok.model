during march  bally wulff obtained two bank revolving lines of credit that currently provide for borrowings up to dm  approximately  at june  of which approximately  had been borrowed at june  in may  bally wulff obtained a working capital line of credit that provides for borrowings up to dm  approximately  at june  of which approximately  had been borrowed at june  bally gaming  inc  bgii s domestic subsidiary  obtained a bank revolving line of credit in march which  as amended  provides for borrowings tied to a percentage of bally gaming  inc s eligible as defined in the credit agreement inventory and accounts receivable with a maximum borrowing capacity of  with the expiration date of march  at june  bally gaming  inc s eligible borrowing capacity under this agreement was approximately  of which  was outstanding 
through bank credit agreements at bally wulff and bally gaming  inc  the company has unused lines of credit of approximately  at june  the company is currently evaluating new financing alternatives  including a replacement of bally gaming  inc s revolving line of credit facility  in order to free up certain non working capital based collateral and to obtain a lower interest rate 
the indenture for the company s senior secured notes limits the company s maximum borrowings under working capital or revolving credit facilities to  the indenture for the company s senior secured notes contains various limitations on incurrence of additional indebtedness  on restricted payments and on dividends and payment restrictions on subsidiaries 
the company does not have any material capital expenditure commitments at june  the company anticipates that its existing cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from future operations and borrowings available under existing lines of credit will be sufficient to fund its cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
management believes that customer financing terms have become an increasingly important competitive factor in certain emerging markets for the bally gaming and systems business unit 
competitive conditions sometimes require bally gaming and systems to grant extended payment terms on gaming machines and other gaming equipment 
while these financings are normally collateralized by such equipment  the resale value of the collateral in the event of a default may be less than the amount financed 
in conjunction with sales by bally gaming and systems  with recourse to the company  of certain trade receivables to third parties  the company had guaranteed amounts due from various customers of approximately  at june  it is possible that one or more customers whose obligation has been guaranteed by bally gaming and systems may be unable to make payments as such amounts become due 
in such event  bally gaming and systems may become responsible for repayment of at least a portion of such amounts over the term of the receivables 
in general  under the terms of these contracts  the company may be responsible for monthly payments of the outstanding obligations 
accordingly  the company will have greater exposure to the financial condition of its customers in emerging markets than has historically been the case in established markets like nevada and atlantic city 
in august  the company received demand notices from the holder of notes related to one customer s trade receivables for which payments were in arrears from december the demand notice is for  and although the company is negotiating a restructuring with the holder of these notes and the customer  there can be no assurance that a successful restructuring will take place 
bally wulff provides customer financing for approximately of its sales  and management expects this practice temporarily to increase during the latter half of calendar in order to be competitive in meeting customer demand for financing of gaming equipment in emerging markets  the company plans to continue to evaluate the need to involve third party finance companies or secure additional financing  although there is no assurance that such additional financing will be obtained
