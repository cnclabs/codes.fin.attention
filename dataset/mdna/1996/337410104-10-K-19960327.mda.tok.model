provision and allowance for loan losses the net provision for loan losses was  in compared to  in  a  or increase 
this increase is attributable to increases in the provisions made by spartanburg national bank and quick credit corporation in when compared to the increase made by spartanburg national bank was a result of the significant loan growth experienced by this subsidiary during spartanburg national bank made provisions of  in compared to  in quick credit corporation made provisions of  in compared to  in  an increase of  or

anderson national bank recorded a negative provision for loan losses in of  as a result of continued improvement in the overall quality of its loan portfolio 
anderson national bank made no provisions in at december   the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of outstanding loans was compared to at december  the purpose of the company s allowance for loan losses is to absorb loan losses that occur in the loan portfolios of its subsidiaries 
management determines the adequacy of the allowance quarterly and considers a variety of factors in establishing the level of the allowance for losses and the related provision  which is charged to expense 
factors considered in determining the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses include previously classified loans deemed less than collectible  loans reflecting a recurring delinquent status  past due loans on which interest is not being collected in accordance with the terms of the loan  and loans the terms of which have been modified by reducing the interest rates or deferring interest  excessive loan renewals or payment extensions  general and local economic conditions  risk in consumer credit products  subjective considerations as a result of internal discussions with the company s loan officers  known loan deteriorations and or concentrations of credit  historical loss experience based on volume and types of loans  trends in portfolio volume  maturity and composition  projected collateral values  off balance sheet risk  and depth and experience of the company s existing lending staff 
by considering the above factors  management attempts to determine the amount of reserves necessary to provide for potential losses in the loan portfolios of its subsidiaries  however the amount of reserves may change in response to changes in the financial condition of larger borrowers  changes in the company s local economies and expected industry trends 
in addition  the allowance for loan losses is subject to periodic examination by various regulatory authorities and may be subject to adjustments based upon information available to them at the time of their examination 
at december  the company had  in non accrual loans  which are considered impaired loans   in loans past due days or more and still accruing interest and  in oreo  compared to   and  respectively  at december  loans on non accrual amounted to of total loans at december   compared to at december  at december  and the company did not have a material amount of restructured loans 
in the cases of all non performing loans  management of the company has reviewed the carrying value of any underlying collateral 
in those cases where the collateral value may be less than the carrying value of the loan  the company has taken specific write downs to the loans  even though such loans may still be performing 
management of the company does not believe it has any non accrual loan which  individually  could materially impact the reserve for loan losses or long term future operating results of the company 
the company records real estate acquired through foreclosure at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less estimated selling costs 
estimated fair value is based upon the assumption of a sale in the normal course of business and not on a quick liquidation or distress basis

the company recorded a  reduction in income tax liability in which resulted in an extraordinary item on the company s income statement for the year ended december  net interest income net interest income  the difference between the interest earned on earning assets and the interest paid for funds acquired to support those assets  is the principal source of the company s operating income 
net interest income was   and  for  and  respectively 
the company s average interest rate spread  the difference between the average interest rate earned on interest earning assets and the average interest rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  has increased in recent years because of the company s balance sheet structure and the trend towards lower rates 
changes in prior regulations have allowed commercial banks new accounts such as now accounts  super now accounts and money market deposit accounts 
these accounts  which are not subject to interest rate ceilings  have enabled banks to attract deposits which were previously in money market accounts of non bank financial institutions 
the result of these new accounts is a continuation of the trend toward higher costs of deposits 
the company believes it has emphasized proper management of interest rate spreads to offset the higher costs of deposits 
the company manages interest rate spreads by monitoring the maturity of assets and related liabilities  interest rates  risk exposure  liquidity  funding sources and capital resources 
the objective of such monitoring is to maximize net interest income over an extended period of time while maintaining associated risk within prescribed policy limits 
the average interest rate spread was in  in and in the following table presents the average balance sheets  the average yield and the interest earned on interest earning assets  and the average rate and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities of the company for the last three fiscal years

the interest rate spread is the interest earning assets rate minus the interest bearing liabilities rate 
net yield on total earning assets is computed by dividing net interest income by total average interest earning assets

interest rate sensitivity and asset liability management an important aspect of achieving satisfactory levels of net income is the management of the composition and maturities of rate sensitive assets and liabilities in order to optimize net interest income as interest rates earned on assets and paid on liabilities fluctuate from time to time 
the interest sensitivity gap is the difference between total interest sensitive assets and liabilities in a given time period 
the objective of interest sensitivity management is to maintain reasonably stable growth in net interest income despite changes in market interest rates by maintaining the proper mix of interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
management seeks to maintain a general equilibrium between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to insulate net interest income from significant adverse changes in market rates 
the following table sets forth the company s interest sensitivity position as of december  interest sensitivity analysis dollars in thousands total sensitive over within months or one year non sensitive total interest earning assets federal funds sold   securities    loans receivable    interest earning assets    interest bearing liabilities deposits    securities sold under repurchase agreements   other borrowed funds    interest bearing liabilities    interest sensitivity gap    interest sensitivity ratio 
amortized cost non accrual loans have been included 
at december   approximately of the company s interest earning assets repriced or matured within one year compared to approximately of interest bearing liabilities 
asset liability management is the process by which the company monitors and controls the mix and maturities of its assets and liabilities 
the essential purposes of asset liability management are to ensure adequate liquidity and to maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
both of the company s banking subsidiaries have established an asset liability management committee 
these committees use a variety of tools to analyze interest rate sensitivity  including a static gap presentation and a simulation model 
a static gap presentation reflects the difference between total interest sensitive assets and liabilities within certain time periods 
while the static gap is a widely used measure of interest sensitivity  it is not  in management s opinion  a true indicator of a company s sensitivity position 
it presents a static view of the timing of maturities and repricing opportunities  without taking into consideration that changes in interest rates do not affect all assets and liabilities equally 
for example  rates paid on a substantial portion of savings and core time deposits may contractually change within a relatively short time frame  but those rates are significantly less interest sensitive than market based rates such as those paid on non core deposits 
accordingly  a liability sensitive gap position is not as indicative of a company s true interest sensitivity as would be the case for an organization which depends to a greater extent on purchased funds to support earning assets 
net interest income would also be impacted by other significant factors in a given interest rate environment  including the spread between the prime rate and the incremental borrowing cost and the volume and mix of earning asset growth 
accordingly  both of the company s banking subsidiaries use an asset liability simulation model which quantifies balance sheet and earnings variations under different interest rate environments to measure and manage interest rate risk 
quick credit considers liquidity and interest rate risk in pricing its loans which are funded through retained earnings and borrowings under an existing line of credit with an unaffiliated bank

the weighted average yields shown previously are calculated on the basis of cost and effective yields for the scheduled maturity of each security

certain securities contain call provisions which could decrease their anticipated maturity 
certain securities also contain rate adjustment provisions which could either increase or decrease their yields 
decisions involving securities are based upon management s expectations for interest rate movements  overall market conditions  the composition and structure of the balance sheet  and computer based simulations of the financial impacts of alternative rate maturity scenarios 
the company does not purchase or hold securities for trading purposes 
however  certain securities may be sold prior to their maturity 
such securities available for sale  at amortized cost  amounted to  at december  and are classified as available for sale and recorded on the company s balance sheet at market value of  loan portfolio the company s management believes the loan portfolio is adequately diversified 
the amount of loans outstanding at the indicated dates are shown in the following table according to the type of loan 
loan portfolio composition dollars in thousands december  commercial  financial and agricultural   real estate construction and land development   real estate mortgage   installment loans to individuals and other loans   total   includes loans secured by real estate and mortgage loans presently held for sale 
historically  the company has maintained a large portfolio of installment loans to consumers 
the company has no foreign loans and few agricultural loans 
anderson national bank s and spartanburg national bank s mortgage loan departments package mortgage loans for sale to others  but do not generally service such loans 
at december   the company had  in mortgage loans held for resale to others which are carried at lower of cost or market value 
the company s real estate loans are primarily construction loans and loans secured by real estate  both commercial and residential  located within the company s trade areas 
the company does not actively pursue long term  fixed rate mortgage loans for retention in its loan portfolio 
commercial loans are spread throughout a variety of industries  with no industry or group of related industries accounting for a significant portion of the commercial loan portfolio 
these loans may be made on either a secured or unsecured basis 
when taken  collateral consists of liens on inventories  receivables  equipment  and furniture and fixtures 
unsecured commercial loans are generally short term with emphasis on repayment strengths and low debt to worth ratios 
as of december   approximately  or of commercial  financial and agricultural loans were unsecured 
a significant portion of the installment loans to individuals are secured by automobiles and other personal effects 
also included in net installment loans to individuals are million and million at december  and  respectively  of high rate consumer finance loans which have been originated by the company s subsidiary  quick credit corporation 
these loans generally carry higher risk of nonpayment than the other categories of loans  but the increased risk is substantially offset by the smaller amounts of such loans and higher rates charged thereon as well as a higher allocation of the allowance for loan losses 
the following table sets forth the maturity distribution of the company s gross loans by type  as of december   as well as the type of interest rate requirement on such loans

management considers a variety of factors in establishing a level of allowance for losses and the related provision  which is charged to expense see results of operations provision and allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of an amount adequate in relation to the risk of future losses inherent in the loan portfolio and also reflects the consideration of the amount of high rate higher risk loans held by the company s consumer finance subsidiary  quick credit corporation 
while it is the company s policy to charge off in the current period loans in which a loss is considered probable  there are additional risks of future losses which cannot be quantified precisely or attributed to particular loans or classes of loans 
because these risks include the state of the economy  industry trends and conditions affecting individual borrowers  management s judgment of the allowance is necessarily approximate and imprecise 
the company is also subject to regulatory examinations and determinations as to adequacy  which may take into account such factors as the methodology used to calculate the allowance for loan losses and the size of the allowance for loan losses in comparison to a group of peer companies identified by the regulatory agencies 
in assessing the adequacy of the allowance  management relies predominantly on its ongoing review of the loan portfolio  which is undertaken both to ascertain whether there are probable losses which must be charged off and to assess the risk characteristics of the portfolio in the aggregate 
the review considers the judgments of management and also those of bank regulatory agencies that review the loan portfolio as part of their regular examination process 
the comptroller of the currency comptroller  as part of its routine examination process of various national banks  including anderson national bank and spartanburg national bank  may require additions to the allowance for loan losses based upon information available to them at the time of their examination 
on december   the allowance for loan losses was  or   higher than one year earlier 
the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to net loans outstanding was at december  compared to at december  see results of operations

in fiscal  and  anderson national bank recorded net recoveries of   and  respectively 
in fiscal  and  spartanburg national bank recorded a provision for loan losses of   and  respectively 
the significant increase for is a result of the loan growth experienced by spartanburg national bank in in fiscal  and  spartanburg national bank experienced net charge offs of   and  respectively 
in fiscal  and  quick credit corporation recorded provisions for loan losses of   and  respectively 
in fiscal  and  quick credit corporation experienced net charge offs of   and  respectively 
the significant increase in net charge offs and related increase in this subsidiary s provision is believed by management to be an industry wide trend 
quick credit corporation s customers are generally in the low to moderate income group of borrowers 
over the past several years there has been a proliferation of small consumer loan companies and other consumer debt providers competing for pieces of this segment of the consumer debt market 
it is not unusual for customers of quick credit corporation simultaneously to have loans outstanding at several other small loan companies which results in some customers incurring more debt than they can service 
as a result of the increased charge offs experienced in and because management expects this subsidiary s loan loss reserve and resulting provisions to track more closely losses  quick credit corporation has increased its loan loss reserve as a percentage of outstanding loans  net of unearned income  from at december  to at december  in addition  the company has reviewed its loan criteria and has tightened slightly its underwriting standards 
management expects this subsidiary to experience similar levels of defaults in first united has a full time internal loan review officer to perform periodic evaluations of the company s loan portfolios including all materially classified loans 
the company s management believes they have in place the personnel to adequately monitor its loan portfolios 
management continues to monitor closely the levels of non performing and potential problem loans and will address the weaknesses in these credits to enhance the amount of ultimate collection or recovery on these assets 
should increases in the overall level of non performing and potential problem loans accelerate from the current trend  management will adjust the methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses and will increase the provision and allowance for loan losses 
this would likely decrease net income

allowance for loan losses to average loans allowance for loan losses to loans at end of year net charge offs recoveries to allowance for loan losses net charge offs recoveries to provision for loan losses management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover possible losses on the loans outstanding at december  in the opinion of management  there are no material risks or significant loan concentrations  and the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb anticipated loan losses in the present loan portfolios 
it must be emphasized  however  that the determination of the allowance for loan losses using the company s procedures and methods rests upon various judgments and assumptions about future economic conditions and other factors affecting loans 
no assurance can be given that the company will not in any particular period sustain loan losses which would be sizable in relationship to the amount reserved or that subsequent evaluation of the loan portfolio  in light of conditions and factors then prevailing  will not require significant changes in the allowance for loan losses or future charges to earnings 
the allowance for loan losses is also subject to review and approval by various regulatory agencies through their periodic examinations of the company s subsidiaries 
such examinations could result in required changes to the allowance for loan losses 
non accrual and potential problem loans the company had approximately  and  in non accrual loans  which are considered impaired loans  at december  and  respectively 
assuming the non accrual loans performed in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding for the entire year  interest income on these loans would have amounted to approximately  and  for and  respectively 
the amount of income recognized on these loans during and was not material 
as of december  and  past due loans over days amounted to  and  respectively  and constituted approximately of total loans at december  and approximately of total loans at december  at december  and  the company did not have a material amount of restructured loans 
a loan is placed on non accrual status when  in management s judgment  the collection of interest receivable on such loan appears doubtful  generally when the loan is past due days or more 
interest receivable that had been accrued in the prior year and is subsequently determined to have doubtful collectibility is charged to the allowance for loan losses 
payments of interest on loans which are classified as non accrual are recognized as received 
in some cases  when borrowers are experiencing financial difficulties  loans may be restructured to provide terms significantly below the original contractual terms 
management of each banking subsidiary maintains a list of potential problem loans 
the problem loan list also includes all loans on non accrual status and all loans that are past due days or more and still accruing interest 
a loan is added to the list when management becomes aware of information about possible credit problems of borrowers that causes doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the current loan repayment terms 
the total amount of loans outstanding at december  determined to be problem loans was   at spartanburg national bank and  at anderson national bank 
this compares with million of loans determined to be problem loans at december  this amount does not represent management s estimate of potential losses since the majority of such loans are secured by real estate or other collateral 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses as of december   was adequate to absorb any losses with respect to the non performing loans and problem loans as of such date 
at december  and  the company had approximately  of real estate acquired through foreclosure 
the company has recorded real estate acquired through foreclosure at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less estimated selling costs

estimated fair value is established by independent appraisal at the time acquisition is completed

as of december   the company held approximately  in certificates of deposit of  or more with approximately  maturing within three months  approximately  maturing in three months through twelve months  and approximately  maturing in over twelve months 
acquisitions of time deposits of  and over are in large part a function of the rates a financial institution is willing to negotiate and  as such  these deposits have many of the characteristics of shorter term purchased funds

capital adequacy and resources the capital needs of the company have been met through the retention of earnings and from the proceeds of a prior public stock offering in for bank holding companies with total assets of more than million  such as the company  capital adequacy is generally evaluated based upon the capital of its banking subsidiaries 
generally  the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve board expects bank holding companies to operate above minimum capital levels 
the comptroller regulations establish the minimum leverage capital ratio requirement for national banks at in the case of a national bank that has the highest regulatory examination rating and is not contemplating significant growth or expansion 
all other national banks are expected to maintain a ratio of at least to above the stated minimum 
furthermore  the comptroller reserves the right to require higher capital ratios in individual banks on a case by case basis when  in its judgment  additional capital is warranted by a deterioration of financial condition or when high levels of risk otherwise exist 
neither of the company s subsidiary banks have been notified that they must maintain capital levels above regulatory minimums 
the company s leverage capital ratio was at december   compared to at december  the leverage capital ratios for anderson national bank and spartanburg national bank were and  respectively at december   compared to and  respectively  at december  the decrease in the leverage capital ratio for anderson national bank during the period ending december  resulted largely from the payment of  in dividends to the parent company in the decrease in the leverage capital ratios for spartanburg national bank and the consolidated company is attributable to growth experienced since december  the federal reserve board has adopted a risk based capital rule which requires bank holding companies to have qualifying capital to risk weighted assets of at least  with at least being tier capital 
tier capital consists principally of common stockholders equity  noncumulative preferred stock  qualifying perpetual preferred stock  and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less goodwill and certain other intangible assets 
tier or supplementary capital consists of general loan loss reserves subject to certain limitations  certain types of preferred stock and subordinated debt  and certain hybrid capital instruments and other debt securities such as equity commitment notes 
a bank holding company s qualifying capital base for purposes of its risk based capital ratio consists of the sum of its tier and tier capital components  provided that the maximum amount of tier capital that may be treated as qualifying capital is limited to of tier capital 
the comptroller imposes a similar standard on national banks 
the regulatory agencies expect national banks and bank holding companies to operate above minimum risk based capital levels 
the company s risk based capital ratio was and its tier capital to risk weighted assets ratio was at december   compared to and  respectively  at december  the risk based capital ratios for anderson national bank and spartanburg national bank were and  respectively  at december  compared to and  respectively  at december  their tier capital to risk weighted assets ratios were and  respectively  at december  compared to and  respectively  at december  the decline in anderson national bank s risk based and tier capital to risk weighted assets ratios from year end levels resulted largely from the payment of  in dividends to the parent company during the period ending december  the decrease in spartanburg national bank s and the consolidated company s risk based and tier capital to risk weighted assets ratios from year end levels is a result of growth experienced during the company has plans to open a new subsidiary bank in the city of greenville  south carolina during the second quarter of to be named the community bank of greenville 
the new bank has received the required approval of the comptroller of the currency  the fdic  the federal reserve board and the south carolina board of financial institutions

effect of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and results of operations in terms of historical dollars  without consideration of changes in the relative purchasing power over time due to inflation 
unlike most other industries  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant effect on a financial institution s performance than does the effect of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily change in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
while the effect of inflation on banks is normally not as significant as is its influence on those businesses which have large investments in plant and inventories  it does have an effect 
during periods of high inflation  there are normally corresponding increases in the money supply  and banks will normally experience above average growth in assets  loans and deposits 
also  general increases in the prices of goods and services will result in increased operating expenses
