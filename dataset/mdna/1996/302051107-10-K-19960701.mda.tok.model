item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the mild winters of and had a substantial adverse effect on the company s results of operations for fiscal and see seasonality and weather 
the company through its european acquisitions is exposed to foreign currency risk in most western european countries  principally france  spain  germany  italy and the uk the company does not have material operations in countries whose economies can be classified as hyper inflationary 
movements of exchange rates vis a vis the us dollar can result in both unrealized and realized exchange gains or losses 
in some instances gains in one currency may be offset by losses in another as all currencies may not move in unison vis a vis the us dollar 
because it is not possible to forecast future movements in foreign exchange rates it is the policy of the company to reduce foreign currency risk by balancing net foreign currency positions where possible

seasonality and weather the automotive aftermarket is seasonal as retail sales of replacement batteries are generally higher in the fall and winter the company s second and third fiscal quarters 
accordingly  demand for the company s automatic batteries is generally highest in the fall and early winter as retailers build inventories in anticipation of the winter season 
european sales are concentrated in the fourth calendar quarter the company s third quarter  due to the shipment of batteries for the winter season and the practice of many industrial battery customers particularly governmental and quassi governmental entities of deferring purchasing decisions until the end of the calendar year 
demand for automotive batteries is significantly affected by weather conditions 
unusually cold winters or hot summers accelerate battery failure and increase demand for automotive replacement batteries 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity requirements arise primarily from the funding of its seasonal working capital needs  obligations on its indebtedness and capital expenditures 
in addition  the company has paid cash dividends of 
per share on the common stock in each completed quarter following its initial public offering 
historically  the company has met these liquidity requirements through cash flows generated from operating activities and with borrowed funds and the proceeds of sales of accounts receivable 
the company is party to a receivables purchase agreement under which the other party has committed subject to certain exceptions to purchase selected accounts receivable of the company  up to a maximum commitment of million 
due to the seasonal demands of the battery industry  the company builds inventory in advance of the typically stronger selling periods during the fall and winter 
the company s greatest cash demands from operations occur during the months of june through october 
during fiscal and beyond the company also expects to meet its liquidity requirements in the same manner 
funds generated used from operations were million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
because of the seasonality of the company s business  more funds are typically generated in its third and fourth fiscal quarters 
during fiscal  the company s inventories were reduced before considering the overall increase from the fiscal acquisitions which helped to minimize the effects of the company s growth in working capital 
offsetting this were the significant cash uses for the company s european restructuring activities  which require large amounts of cash for severance associated with plant closures 
during fiscal  the company closed plants in europe and plants in the us all of this is part of the company s long term strategy of reducing its manufacturing and distribution cost structure  especially in europe 
in the next several years  the company will continue to complete the closure of various european plants which will necessitate cash payments for severance  etc 
while the company believes that a large portion of its cash requirements for its european plant consolidation activities will be generated from operations  it has substantial liquidity and capital resources through its european facilities agreement and also has substantial borrowing availability under its us credit agreement 
the company s capital expenditures were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal capital expenditures increased in fiscal and principally due to the acquisition of tudor in fiscal and ceac and schuylkill metals in fiscal the us credit agreement and the european facilities agreement restrict the amount of capital expenditures which may be made by the company and its subsidiaries 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
however  the company believes that it has sufficient resources for its capital expenditure programs from operating cash flows and borrowing availability under its existing credit agreements 
during fiscal and  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company completed several major acquisitions  mostly in europe 
the financing for these acquisitions resulted from a combination of equity and debt sources  both in the us and europe 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements

the facility contains a tranche a term loan in the amount of million french francs us million  a tranche b term loan in the amount of million french francs us million  and a revolving facility of  million french francs us million 
the tranche a term loan matures on november   and the tranche b term loan matures on november  both term loans require semiannual principal payments throughout their terms 
the revolving facility expires on september  substantially all of the company s european bank debt  including indebtedness under the former european facilities agreement that was utilized to finance a portion of the ceac acquisition  was refinanced with this european facilities agreement 
as of march   the company had utilized million of its us credit agreement for letters of credit  and million was outstanding under the european facilities agreement  including letters of credit 
obligations under the us credit agreement and the european facilities agreement bear interest at fluctuating rates 
increases in interest rates on such obligations could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company has two interest rate collar agreements and an interest rate swap agreement which reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on a portion of the company s floating rate debt 
the collar agreements effectively limit the libor base interest rate on million of borrowings under the us credit and european facilities agreements to no more than through december  if interest rates fall below certain levels  exide is required to make payments to the counterparties under the agreements

see note to the company s consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
effect of inflation inflation has not had a material impact on the operations of the company during the past three years 
the company generally has been able to offset the effects of inflation with price increases  cost reduction programs and operating efficiencies 
future environmental developments the company is subject to extensive federal  state  local and foreign environmental  health and safety laws and regulations 
in the future environmental  health and safety standards may be more stringent 
the company anticipates that such standards could cause an increase in the company s capital expenditures and operating costs 
until the standards are adopted it is not possible to estimate these costs with any certainty or to predict whether they will have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations
