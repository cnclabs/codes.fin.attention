suppliers jackpot purchases a variety of models and styles of gaming machines primarily from one manufacturer 
jackpot is not dependent upon this manufacturer  although it did purchase approximately of its gaming machines from such manufacturer in fiscal each gaming machine accepts only one denomination of coin and  with minor exceptions  each location will have a variety of machines requiring different denominations of coins 
gaming machines operated by jackpot are multiple coin play

competition gaming machines and gaming of all types are available in nevada in casinos and hotel casinos  as well as in locations similar to those of jackpot  all of which compete directly or indirectly with jackpot 
jackpot has been and is subject to substantial direct competition for the operation of gaming machines in approved locations from numerous small gaming machine route operators and some large operators  located principally in las vegas  reno and their surrounding areas 
management believes at least one of these competitors has more gaming machines or locations than jackpot 
in addition  a limited number of these competitors manufacture gaming machines 
the principal methods of competition for gaming machine locations are the lease  sublease  license or revenue sharing terms  the service provided by the route operator and the experience  reputation and financial strength of the route operator

management believes working capital and cash provided by operations will be sufficient to enable jackpot to pursue expansion opportunities  however  jackpot may seek additional debt or equity financing to facilitate expansion opportunities and potential acquisitions 
results of operations since fiscal  gaming machine route operations revenues have decreased approximately million from million in to million in due primarily to i the loss of a major retail chain store customer on june   ii the loss of a retail chain store customer due to the permanent closing of its three locations in nevada in connection with such customer s bankruptcy reorganization plan  iii the loss  based on management s commitment to maintain pricing discipline  of certain non chain locations  and iv a decrease in revenues at certain existing locations in due  in management s opinion  to growth in the number of casinos and other locations with gaming machines in residential areas of nevada 
jackpot has a significant amount of its gaming machine route operations at retail stores which are part of a group of affiliated store chains  subject to various leases 
gaming machine route operations from two groups of affiliated store chains in  and each accounted for more than of jackpot s total revenues in such years 
the largest six store chains accounted for approximately of jackpot s total revenues in leases covering the six store chains have a wide range of terms and maturities  with expiration dates extending from to the loss or nonrenewal of any of these leases could have a material adverse effect on the company s future results of operations 
license  lease and sublease agreements representing approximately of gaming machine route operations revenues have terms expiring in fiscal included in the are three agreements  which expire on june   with three of jackpot s largest six retail chain store customers representing of gaming machine route operations revenues 
jackpot anticipates the renewal of these agreements will be offered on a competitive basis 
while the company intends to actively seek to renew these agreements  there is no assurance that the company will be able to renew or extend such agreements or that these agreements will be renewed upon terms that jackpot will find acceptable 
the renewal or extension of agreements at existing locations have generally resulted in increased monthly fees 
these contracts often require fixed periodic increases in monthly fees during the term of the contract 
with respect to the accounting treatment of fixed periodic increases in monthly fees associated with these contracts  the company is required to average annual lease costs over the term of the contract 
as a result of such accounting treatment  annual lease costs generally increase significantly in the first year of an extended contract for the respective locations covered by the contract and  thereafter  remain constant for existing locations during the term of the contract 
through  the company has historically been able to renew or substantially replace revenues from expiring gaming machine route agreements with revenues generated by renewal or replacement agreements 
however  increased competitive pressures in connection with the renewal or replacement of agreements has  and continues to result in higher lease payments as a percentage of gaming machine route operations revenues  thereby decreasing the company s operating margin 
in order to optimize its operating performance  the company is engaged in a continual evaluation of leases 
as a result of such evaluation  strict adherence to management s pricing guidelines and competitive pressure  certain agreements for non chain locations were not renewed in in a potential effort to counter this trend and to possibly leverage off jackpot s existing infrastructure  the company s growth strategy may include the acquisition of other gaming machine route operators

this decision was reached after considering that these casino operations generated unacceptably low returns on capital  possessed limited growth prospects and commanded a disproportionately high amount of management time 
prior to the board s approval to dispose of jackpot s two remaining casinos  jackpot sold its interest in jackpot city  inc the nugget  a casino operation located in reno  nevada  effective june  as a result of jackpot s decision to dispose of its remaining casinos and the sale of the nugget  a charge of approximately million was recorded in the fourth quarter of the charge consisted primarily of the write down of the carrying amount of certain long lived assets of the owl club to fair value 
principally  as a result of this charge  net income in decreased  from million in to million in revenues total revenues in decreased approximately million  from million in to million in the decrease in total revenues of million was the net result of a decrease of million from million in to million in in gaming machine route operations revenues and a decrease of million from million in to million in in casino operations revenues 
the decrease in gaming machine route operations revenues of million was due primarily to the closing or loss  based on management s commitment to maintain pricing discipline  of certain non chain locations and to the loss of the company s right to operate at all three phar mor locations in nevada due to the permanent closing by phar mor of such locations in connection with phar mor s bankruptcy reorganization plan 
the decrease in gaming machine route operations revenues resulted from a combination of additional revenues generated from new locations  net of lost revenues from terminated locations and a decrease in revenues at existing locations 
in  new locations generated revenues of approximately million 
terminated locations had generated revenues of million in  while revenues at existing locations decreased million in as described previously  a significant amount of jackpot s gaming machine route operations revenues is derived from six retail chain store customers pursuant to license  lease or sublease agreements 
as of june   such agreements involved the operation of  machines in locations 
the decrease in casino operations revenues in of approximately million was due principally to the decline in revenues generated at the debbie reynolds hotel and casino 
such decline was due to the ceasing of jackpot s casino operations at the location  effective march  and to a decrease in revenues in the nine months ended march  the company  through its operating subsidiary debbie s casino  inc debbie s  had operated approximately gaming machines at this location 
costs and expenses route operations expenses in decreased approximately million from million in to million in and  as a percentage of route operations revenues  route operations expenses increased to in from in the decrease of million in over was attributable to decreases of 
million in location rent expense  
million in payroll costs  
million in workers compensation costs and 
million in other route operations expenses
