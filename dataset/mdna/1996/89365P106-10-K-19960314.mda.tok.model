item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
results of operations with the acquisition of apr on may   anuhco now operates in two distinct industries  transportation  through its subsidiary  crouse cartage  and insurance premium finance  through its subsidiary  apr 
transportation operating revenue the changes in transportation operating revenue are summarized in the following table in thousands vs

  change in truckload revenues  net increase decrease  less than truckload ltl operating revenues fell by in as compared to this decline for the current year is in comparison to the strong year achieved by crouse cartage in following the teamsters union strike against certain competitors and the closing of a regional competitor 
during  crouse cartage s freight volumes  as measured by tonnage and number of shipments  rose over  compared to  with minimal rate discounting due to the shortage of capacity within the industry 
ltl revenue per hundredweight rose in over crouse cartage has maintained a substantial portion of the additional freight volumes in  ltl tonnage rose in over  although the number of ltl shipments declined 
the trucking industry  including crouse cartage  was adversely impacted in by the softening of the economy which resulted in industry over capacity and competitive market pressures on freight rates 
ltl revenue per hundredweight decreased in from the economic operating environment in the transportation industry may improve later in  however  we expect the economy and the pressure on freight rates in the first half of to continue 
truckload operating revenue fell in from as the net result of a decline in the number of shipments hauled and a increase in revenue per shipment 
truckload revenues were up for over primarily due to a increase in the number of truckload shipments

operating supplies and expenses operating taxes and licenses insurance and claims depreciation and amortization purchased transportation and rents total operating expenses crouse cartage s operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue  or operating ratio  rose from to for and  respectively 
this increase was the result of higher salaries  wages and employee benefits costs caused by  a contractual increase in wages effective april   and contractual increases as a percentage of union scale for those additional employees hired to handle the increased freight volumes during and after the april  teamsters strike and reduced revenue yield due to competitive market pressures 
purchased transportation also increased as a percentage of operating revenue for as compared to  primarily due to a contractual increase in costs of approximately effective july  crouse s operating ratio in fell to from in as increased utilization of both personnel and equipment enabled crouse to handle substantially higher freight volumes at higher revenue yields without proportionately higher operating expenses 
the operating ratio of represents an exceptional result caused by the unusual circumstances occurring in the teamsters union strike  the closing of a regional competitor and the generally stronger economy allowed crouse cartage to handle higher freight volumes at better revenue yields without proportionately increasing its fixed costs
