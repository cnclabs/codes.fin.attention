the following table sets forth for the years indicated certain financial data as a percentage of net sales year ended september  net sales gross margin engineering  research and development selling and marketing administrative and general income from operations income before income taxes net income net sales 
the company derives net sales from the sale of its assembly products and peripherals  reflow ovens  screen printers  the resale of products manufactured by third parties and from services 
product sales are recorded upon shipment of products configured to meet customer application requirements 
net sales increased  or in and  or in over net sales in the respective preceding fiscal years 
the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased total unit volumes and sales of newer products with higher average selling prices 
the q series of products qsp and qsx have higher average selling prices than the c series of products quad ivcmk  quad ivc  quad iiic and quad iic 
net sales for included sales for a full year of the qsp and sales of the qsx  for which no sales were recognized during the same period of the prior year 
sales of the q series of products represented approximately and of net sales in and  respectively 
the increase of the q series to of net sales reflects increased market penetration and market acceptance of the qsp and commencement of shipment of the qsx product 
sales of the c series of products represented approximately and of net sales in and  respectively 
the company believes that the decrease in sales of the c series is due to sales of the qsp product and increased competition 
the company began shipments of another new product  the qsv  during fiscal and expects further decreases to sales of the c series of products upon such introduction 
net sales also included increased sales of screen printers and reflow ovens as the sales under quadline have continued to expand 
quadline is the company s marketing program offering the major elements of smt production lines on a turnkey basis  including screen printers  assemblers and reflow ovens 
during fiscal  sales of such systems accounted for approximately of net sales 
the company continues to experience significant international growth 
the company derives its international sales from two wholly owned foreign subsidiaries in the united kingdom that both manufacture and sell product and from its us operations 
international sales increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
international sales accounted for  and of the company s net sales for the years  and  respectively 
the company believes that international sales will continue to be a significant percentage of net sales 
in  net sales increased  or over the growth in net sales during was due to sales of the qsp  for which no sales were recognized during the same period of the prior year 
sales of the q series of products represented approximately of net sales in sales of the c series of products represented approximately of net sales in and of net sales in the decrease in sales of the c series  the company believes  is due to the introduction of the q series and increased competition 
net sales also included increased sales of screen printers resulting from the acquisition of smtech limited smtech in early in addition  sales of screen printers and reflow ovens also increased as sales under quadline expanded 
sales results for any particular year may not be indicative of results for future years 
the rate of technological change in the smt industry  including advances in component packaging  device design technologies and required software development  together with intense competition  represent continuous pressures on the company 
failure by the company to respond in a timely fashion to such changes and competition  with enhanced products and marketing  would have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company believes  based on press releases from the company s competitors and information current in the marketplace  that the smt industry is recently experiencing a softening in order bookings 
with respect to the company s near term expectations  order quote activity to date in the first quarter of fiscal has been satisfactory  but consistent with the results announced by other competitors in the marketplace  the company has experienced a softening in the rate of order bookings since the beginning of fiscal this recent softening in the rate of order bookings could adversely affect net sales and gross margins in the short term as competition increases for those orders 
gross margin 
gross margin gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in gross margin improved as a result of higher margins from sales of the c series  screen printers and the absence of a provision for product returns and allowances relating to the q series  partially offset by lower margins on the q series 
the company believes the improvements on c series gross margins are due to fewer sales of higher discounted multiple headed c series products 
gross margins on screen printer sales have improved  since the company is no longer a reseller of screen printers after the acquisition of smtech 
q series gross margins decreased as a result of expanded sales to contract manufacturers  which in turn has resulted in lower average configured selling prices and due to low margins on the recently introduced qsx the company has historically experienced low margins on new product introductions pending establishment of initial market penetration and attainment of production levels to achieve economies of scale 
the company expects that increased shipments of new products  coupled with a softening of market conditions  will result in a decrease in gross margins during the first half of fiscal from the fourth quarter of in  gross margin decreased to from in gross margin was principally affected by additional warranty and retrofit costs and increased reserve provisions for product returns and allowances associated with the q series 
engineering  research and development expenses 
engineering  research and development expenses increased  or in over the comparable year as a result of increased spending to support product development activities related to an expanded q series product line  the avx screen printer and the new profile series of reflow ovens 
during  engineering  research and development expenses increased  or over the preceding year due to the inclusion of r d expenses incurred by smtech  which was acquired in january however  expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to in selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased  or in as compared to last year 
this increase was primarily due to expenses associated with higher sales volume  higher advertising and trade show costs  a change in the company s sales and service management structure  increased hiring of personnel in support of international sales and higher spending in support of customer demonstrations 
during  selling and marketing expenses increased  or over the preceding year due principally to increased customer service costs related to increased sales volume  continued field support for the q series and from expenses incurred by smtech subsequent to its acquisition 
however  expenses as a percentage of sales remained constant at 
administrative and general expenses 
administrative and general expenses increased  or in over the preceding year reflecting increased employee compensation  a full year of expenses after the acquisition of smtech  costs incurred in connection with the company s planned relocation and consolidation to a new operating and manufacturing facility located near its current headquarters  increased operating costs associated with the expansion of smtech into larger facilities  and legal costs associated with the patent litigation discussed below 
in  administrative and general expenses increased  or over the preceding year 
increased administrative and general expenses are primarily attributable to costs incurred by smtech and overall increases associated with higher sales levels 
income tax expense 
the company s effective income tax rate was  amounting to  in   amounting to  in and  amounting to  in income tax expense differs from the amount that would result from applying the federal statutory tax rate to pretax income primarily due to permanent differences in taxable income versus book income  partially offset by benefits realized from the company s foreign sales corporation 
the income tax expense in and was reduced due to the effect of a reversal of the valuation allowance associated with net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the company expects an effective tax rate of approximately for liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations and capital purchases through cash flows from operations 
during  the company generated approximately million of cash flows from operations  despite the payment of approximately million to settle the securities litigation lawsuit as described in item the primary factors contributing to the cash generated from operations were net income and a decrease in accounts receivable offset somewhat by an increase in inventory 
days sales outstanding decreased  despite increased sales  as the company was able to collect certain receivables for which customers withheld payments pending satisfactory resolution of issues regarding the q series product software in the year of introduction 
the company s working capital increased to million as of september   including cash balances of million 
at the end of fiscal year  the company had working capital of million  including cash balances of million 
the company has an unsecured revolving line of credit agreement which permits borrowing up to a maximum of  and bears interest at the bank s base rate of interest as of september  or  at the company s option  libor plus when the outstanding balance is greater than  the company pays a fee on the unused portion of the line of credit 
this credit agreement expires in february this line of credit agreement also contains various operating and reporting covenants and requires maintenance of certain financial ratios 
there were no amounts outstanding on the line as of september  and the company invested  in equipment and leasehold improvements in as compared to  in significant expenditures included costs associated with a new operating facility at its smtech subsidiary in england and upgraded computer hardware and software at its horsham facility 
in august  the company entered into a ten year lease for an office and manufacturing facility located near its horsham facility 
the move  which is expected to be completed in january  will provide the company additional capacity to allow for continued growth and the opportunity for increased efficiencies in its manufacturing operations 
the company therefore expects that capital additions will be somewhat higher than the level 
the company believes that funds generated from operations  existing cash balances and borrowing capacity will be sufficient for the company to meet its working capital needs through fiscal to finance the smtech acquisition in  the company obtained a  term loan under a term loan agreement the loan agreement with corestates bank  na corestates and summit bank summit formerly known as united jersey bank 
the loan agreement provides for a five year term  with principal payments of  to be made quarterly 
the loan covenants under the loan agreement conform to the terms of the covenants applicable to the  line of credit agreement described above 
the term loan is unsecured and bears interest at varying rates selected by the company  either corestates prime rate  cd rate or an applicable margin above libor 
backlog as of september   the company s backlog of orders  based on purchase orders received and accepted  was million  as compared to million as of september  backlog includes million and million of q series and c series orders  respectively  as of september  and million and million of q series and c series orders  respectively  as of september  the remainder of backlog consists of other products 
the company expects to ship all backlog orders outstanding at september  during fiscal it has been the company s experience that purchasers of capital equipment have not issued purchase orders calling for delivery of products over an extended period and since  the company has experienced a decrease in the lead times requested by customers 
therefore  backlog may not necessarily be indicative of future sales

samsung 
under the terms of this agreement  the company granted an exclusive license subject to certain exceptions as to the company to samsung for samsung to become the company s sole supplier of component tape feeders  which are currently used on all of the company s placement systems 
the contract covers a six year period and requires quad to purchase a minimum of  component tape feeders with a value of at least million during the first two years of the contract

as such  actual results may vary materially from such expectations 
among the meaningful factors that may affect the realization of such expectations are variations in the level of order bookings  which can be affected by general economic conditions and growth rates in the smt manufacturing industry  difficulties or delays in software functionality and performance  the timing of future software releases  product development delays or performance problems  failure to respond adequately either to changes in technology or to customer preferences  risks of nonpayment of accounts receivable  changes in budgeted costs  failures in sources of supply for tape feeders or failure to successfully defend itself against the patent infringement litigation
