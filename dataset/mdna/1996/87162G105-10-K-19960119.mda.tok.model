item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company has two business segments which market products on a worldwide basis 
its primary business is the surgical business  which develops  manufactures and markets proprietary specialty medical products for use in thoracic  cardiac  neuro and vascular surgery 
the company  through its wholly owned subsidiary  vital images  also develops  markets and supports certain software products for interactive visualization and analysis of three dimensional image data for medical applications 
net revenue generated by vital images is derived primarily from software licensing and maintenance fees 
the company has been in a period of significant growth  driven primarily by the revenue contribution of its peri strips product part of the tissue guard product line 
peri strips  which enables lvr surgery for late stage emphysema patients  received marketing clearance from the fda in may but was not released fully to the market until late october net revenue resulting from sales of peri strips increased from  for fiscal to  for fiscal and comprised approximately of the company s net revenues or excluding the one time license fee for voxelgeo 
the company anticipated that sales of peri strips would continue to constitute an increasing share of the company s revenue 
recent developments concerning reimbursement of lvr surgery are likely to have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
generally  medicare had been reimbursing hospitals and surgeons for lvr surgery since the procedure was re introduced in lvr surgery uses peri strips  the product which has been primarily responsible for the company s growth in net revenue and net income in recent periods see surgical business markets and medical need  lung volume reduction surgery on page of this report 
recently  hcfa decided that it did not have enough patient follow up data to substantiate the safety and efficacy of lvr surgery 
on that basis  hcfa decided to cease reimbursement of lvr surgery until its technical assessment committee tac could complete an evaluation of the safety and efficacy of the procedure 
tac has set february  as the final date for surgeons to submit patient data 
it is reasonably expected that once the data is received by tac any decision regarding reimbursement will take  at a minimum  two months and possibly a year or more 
hcfa s decision to deny reimbursement for lvr surgery is expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s net revenue and net income at a minimum in the first and second quarters of fiscal  and may continue to have such an effect in future periods 
while the company believes  based on reported outcomes  that hcfa will eventually approve reimbursement for lvr surgery  the company cannot say with any certainty when  or if  the reimbursement of lvr will be approved 
the company believes that lvr procedures reimbursed by medicare constitute over of total lvr procedures 
while the company understands that private insurance companies and managed care organizations which the company believes have been the third party payors responsible for a significant percentage of reimbursed lvr procedures are currently reimbursing lvr surgery based on their own evaluation of the procedure and its outcomes  it is unknown whether these private payors will change their reimbursement practices in light of hcfa s decision 
to accommodate growth in its peri strips business  the company  beginning in april  made significant additional investments in personnel  plant and infrastructure  including moving to a new and larger manufacturing facility for the surgical business in july further increases in all areas  especially marketing and support personnel additions  were planned to support anticipated peri strips sales growth 
due to the recent re introduction of the modified procedure  the number of patients who have undergone the procedure and for whom a clinically acceptable post operative period of evaluation has elapsed is still relatively small 
similarly  the number of physicians performing the procedure and from whom data is available to the company is small 
accordingly  there presently does not exist a statistically meaningful body of clinical data from which to draw conclusions concerning the efficacy and long term outcomes associated with the lvr procedure 
the company believes that patients who have undergone the lvr procedure may require and additional year or more of follow up examination before the procedure can be properly evaluated by the medical community 
in addition  the recent hcfa decision has delayed any expected growth from peri strips 
if lvr surgery reimbursement is not approved in the future  growth of the proportions anticipated will not be forthcoming 
accordingly  the rate and pattern of growth  if any  of the peri strips business  and its related personnel  plant and infrastructure support requirements  are especially difficult to predict 
the company acquired vital images on may  the acquisition was a pooling of interests  and financial results for all reporting periods have been restated as if vital images had been merged into the company from inception 
historically  vital images was engaged in developing and marketing d volume rendered  imaging software for various disciplines and industries  but principally for confocal microscopy  other medical research  and gas and oil exploration the imaging business 
after the acquisition  the company decided to exit the microscopy business due to the limited market opportunity in microscopy and its relatively low margins 
although the company continues to provide support to existing microscopy customers  it does not actively pursue new microscopy customers 
at the time of the acquisition  the largest near term market opportunity for the imaging business was the voxelgeo product for gas and oil exploration applications 
the company funded the research and development of the second generation of this product  voxelgeo  in order to generate revenue to fund future development of clinical medical applications of the imaging software 
in the process of developing voxelgeo  the company rewrote the entire code of its core d volume rendering technology 
a significant portion of all of the company s d volume rendered imaging software results from certain core technology  and therefore improvements or changes to this core technology advance all applications of the software 
in order to conserve resources and receive the benefit of industry expertise  the company entered into a global marketing alliance in august with cogniseis development  inc cogniseis  a company with complementary software technologies for gas and oil exploration and an established presence in the industry 
under the agreement  cogniseis assumed exclusive marketing and customer support responsibilities for voxelgeo in exchange for of software license and maintenance fee revenue 
subsequently  in order to concentrate the imaging business on medical applications  the company entered into a source code license agreement in august with cogniseis  granting it a worldwide  perpetual  exclusive license for use in gas and oil exploration applications 
under this agreement  cogniseis became both the exclusive developer and exclusive marketer of voxelgeo 
pursuant to this agreement  the company received a license fee payment of million in september  which was recorded as revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal the agreement further provides for the payment to the company on a quarterly basis of royalties based upon the receipt of revenues generated by voxelgeo  which payments  if any  the company anticipates will begin in calendar royalties will terminate upon the earlier of march  or the aggregate payment of million in royalties 
the company s imaging business is now dedicated to the development of medical applications of its imaging technology 
excluding the one time source code license fee discussed above  the company anticipates that its imaging business revenue will continue to decrease in the near term due to declining microscopy revenue and no additional voxelgeo revenue until  when royalties on voxelgeo are anticipated to begin 
microscopy and gas and oil exploration revenue accounted for more than of the imaging business revenue during and and  including the license fee payment of million  approximately of such revenue in fiscal in addition  the company does not anticipate that expenses of the imaging business will decrease  as the company intends to continue to invest in voxelview 
the company recently received fda k clearance to market its voxelview product as a medical product 
the company is currently finalizing the marketing plan for this product  and does not anticipate significant revenues from its medical imaging products in the near term

comparison of the year ended october  with the year ended october  net revenue net revenue increased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal net revenue of the surgical business increased to  in fiscal from  for fiscal  substantially due to increases in sales of peri strips  which increased to  in fiscal from  for fiscal and accounted for and of the surgical business net revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
hcfa s recent decision to deny medicare reimbursement for lvr surgery  which uses peri strips to prevent air leaks  is expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s net revenue and net income at a minimum in the first and second quarters of fiscal  and may continue to have such an effect in future periods 
while the company believes  based on reported outcomes  that hcfa will eventually approve reimbursement for lvr surgery  the company cannot say with any certainty when  or if  the reimbursement of lvr will be approved

net revenue from sales of other products of the tissue guard product line  dura guard  vascu guard  supple peri guard and peri guard  increased by to  for fiscal from  for fiscal dura guard  which was cleared to market by the fda in june  accounted for of this increase 
the company believes that heightened visibility in the surgical community was the other significant factor in the increase in revenues from sales of the other products in the tissue guard product line 
net revenues from sales of biograft decreased by to  for fiscal from  for fiscal biograft revenue has been decreasing since late fiscal the company believes that the revenue decrease is a result of a trend towards non surgical intervention for peripheral vascular obstruction and the higher price of biograft when compared to synthetic grafts 
the company has implemented a biograft training program for surgeons in an effort to improve sales of this product 
net revenue from sales of surgical productivity tools flo rester and the bio vascular probe increased for fiscal when compared to fiscal the company believes that sales of these products will not increase materially from current levels in the foreseeable future 
net revenue of the imaging business increased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal  due almost entirely to the one time  voxelgeo source code license fee received in the fourth quarter of fiscal it is expected that revenues from the medical imaging software business will decrease in the near term as a result of the company s decision not to actively pursue new customers in the microscopy market and the loss of revenue from voxelgeo until  when payment of royalties is anticipated to begin 
gross margin the gross margin percentage increased to of net revenue for fiscal from of net revenue for fiscal gross margin percentages of the surgical business were and for fiscal and  respectively 
the vast majority of gross margin improvement in the surgical business was due to changes in product mix as a result of the large volume of peri strips sales and the spreading of overhead costs over a larger volume of production 
improvement in productivity related to the manufacture of peri strips also contributed to the improvement 
gross margin percentages of the imaging business were and for fiscal and  respectively 
the gross margin percentage of the imaging business was positively impacted by the voxelgeo source code license transaction  which contributed  to the gross margin 
the company believes that future gross margin percentages for the medical imaging software business will be a function of the developing business model for the medical imaging software business  but are currently expected to remain above 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expense increased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal  but decreased as a percent of net revenue between comparable periods to from 
the increase in expense was attributable entirely to the surgical business and the increases in personnel and related overhead required to support the revenue growth 
the surgical business and the imaging business accounted for and  respectively  of these expenditures for fiscal  as compared to and  respectively  of these expenditures for fiscal research and development research and development expense increased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal the surgical business and the imaging business accounted for and  respectively  of these expenditures for fiscal  as compared to and  respectively  of these expenditures for fiscal the majority of the research and development expense for the imaging business was attributable to advancing the core technology associated with the development of voxelgeo and voxelview 
developing and manufacturing software is expensive and the investment in product development often involves a long pay back cycle 
the company s plans include continued investment in software development for medical applications for which significant revenue is not anticipated in the near term 
the company expects that expenditures for research and development in the surgical business will grow substantially  while those for the imaging business will grow modestly for the foreseeable future 
operating income loss operating income was  for fiscal  compared to an operating loss of  for fiscal the surgical business accounted for  of the operating profit  principally due to the increased revenue from sales of peri strips 
the imaging business accounted for  to operating income  which was entirely due to revenue from the voxelgeo source code license which contributed  to operating income in fiscal 
the operating loss incurred in fiscal includes one time acquisition costs of approximately  related to the vital images transaction 
other income and expense the company had net other income of  in fiscal in fiscal  the company had net other expense of  due to capital losses on an investment in mutual fund shares of the piper jaffray institutional government income portfolio in which the company invested in the fund 
the fund invested in various bonds and other obligations issued or guaranteed as to payment of principal and interest by the united states government 
included in the investments of the fund were mortgage related securities and their derivatives  such as interest only and principal only securities and inverse floating rate securities 
during the first quarter of calendar  the fund s value declined 
the company closely monitored its investment in the fund and held discussions with the fund s management concerning their recovery strategy 
the company decided to sell its shares in the fund when it believed that any meaningful recovery was no longer possible in a reasonable time frame  and as concern about the fund continued to aggravate the immediate downside potential 
the company liquidated these mutual fund shares late in fiscal affiliates of the fund have entered into a settlement agreement with plaintiffs in certain litigation relating to the fund 
the settlement agreement has received approval from the united states district court where the litigation is venued and from the affected fund shareholders 
the company is entitled to participate in the settlement and its loss  for purposes of determining payment under the settlement  has been fixed at  but only a portion of this will actually be received by the company 
the amount and timing of any such settlement payment to the company is not yet determinable 
income taxes as of october   the company had used all of its remaining unrestricted net operating loss nol carryforwards available to offset income from operations 
the effective tax rate varies from the statutory tax rate primarily due to the utilization of these carryforwards 
the company has research and experimentation r e tax credit carryforwards available to offset income from operations  although the company has not finalized its estimation of such carryforwards 
it also has carryforwards of  available to offset future capital gains and approximately million of carryforwards arising from pre merger losses of vital images available to offset post merger income of vital images during years in which it is profitable 
a portion of the pre merger loss carryforwards that may be used in any year is restricted due to limitations resulting from the significant change of ownership 
the deferred tax assets associated with the carryforwards have been totally offset by a valuation allowance because of uncertainty that sufficient taxable income of the appropriate type will be generated prior to the expiration of the carryforwards 
the tax provisions for fiscal and represent alternative minimum taxes 
effect of one time source code license a one time license fee for the voxelgeo source code recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal contributed  to net revenue and  to operating income in both the quarter and the year 
after resulting income taxes  the licensing transaction contributed cents to fourth quarter net income and cents to the net income for the year 
comparison of the year ended october  with the year ended october  net revenue net revenue increased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal the increase was due entirely to a increase in revenue of the surgical business when comparing these periods 
tissue guard net revenue increased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal peri strips accounted for of the increase in tissue guard product line net revenue 
biograft net revenue decreased for fiscal when compared to fiscal the company believes that this decline was strongly influenced by the changing health care environment  specifically cost containment  which prompted surgeons to choose drug therapy more frequently than surgical intervention in the treatment of peripheral vascular disease 
net revenue of the surgical productivity tools increased between fiscal and fiscal net revenue of the imaging business decreased between fiscal and fiscal the company believes that the decrease  which was primarily in software license revenues  arose from the market s anticipation of voxelgeo and customers decisions to delay software purchases until the delivery of this version of the voxelgeo software  offset by maintenance revenue increases 
gross margin the gross margin percentage increased to of net revenue for fiscal from of net revenue for fiscal gross margin percentages of the surgical business were and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
this improvement in the surgical business gross margin was primarily due to the lower average cost of labor associated with the addition of significant numbers of entry level production personnel in response to anticipated sales increases of peri strips 
gross margin percentages of the imaging business were and in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in the imaging business gross margin percentage was due to product and service mix 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expense increased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal and increased slightly as a percentage of sales to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in expense was primarily attributable to retention of a chief operating officer in april and the increased level of business activity of the surgical business 
research and development research and development expense increased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal and increased as a percentage of net revenue to for fiscal from in fiscal the majority of the increase was attributable to advancing the core technology of the imaging business concurrent with the development of voxelgeo in both fiscal and fiscal  of research and development expenditures were for the surgical business and were for the imaging business 
acquisition costs the costs of the acquisition of vital images  which were all incurred in fiscal  were  these one time costs  which accounted for of the operating loss incurred by the company in fiscal  were for legal  accounting  and other professional fees 
operating income loss the company had operating losses of  and  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the surgical business had operating income of  and  and the imaging business had operating losses of  and  for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in the company s operating loss arose primarily from the increase in research and development expenditures and the cost of the acquisition of vital images 
other income and expense during fiscal  the company invested some of its excess cash in the fund 
the company sold its investment in the fund during september and october of and realized a capital loss of  which resulted in net other expense of  in that fiscal year 
liquidity and capital resources the company s capital resources increased significantly during fiscal as the result of the completion of a public offering of  shares of common stock during september  which provided approximately  to the company  net of offering costs 
primarily as a result of this offering  the company s cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances increased by  from  at october  to  at october  nine million dollars of the increase is invested long term two years or less from date of investment in obligations of the us government 
working capital at october  was  increasing  from  at october  historically  the cash needs of the company have been met by cash generated from operations and investments 
cash flow from operating activities was  during fiscal of the  approximately  after income tax can be attributed to the one time license fee for voxelgeo 
primary cash usage resulted from increased levels of inventories and accounts receivable associated with the growth in surgical business revenue  which used  of cash  while increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities generated  in cash 
the company used approximately  in operating activities during  largely due to surgical business growth 
the company made capital expenditures during fiscal totaling   for the surgical business  which included  for manufacturing equipment   for computer hardware and software  and  for leasehold improvements to its new facility  and   for the imaging business  primarily for computer hardware and software 
additionally  the exercise of stock options provided  on december   the company used  to acquire the peri guard patent 
the company currently has no other commitments for material capital expenditures in fiscal  but continually reviews external growth opportunities that may result in material commitments 
the company believes its present level of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy the company s cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
inflation management believes inflation has not had a material effect on the company s operations or on its financial condition 
foreign currency transactions substantially all of the company s foreign transactions are negotiated  invoiced and paid in us dollars 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates in other countries may therefore reduce the demand for the company s products by increasing the price of the company s products in the currency of the countries in which the products are sold 
new accounting standard the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the company plans to adopt this statement in fiscal year although it has not made a definitive determination of its impact  the company does not expect the adoption of statement no 
to have a materially adverse effect on its financial position
