item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary statement the statements in this management s discussion and analysis that are forward looking involve numerous risks and uncertainties and are based on current expectations 
actual results may differ materially 
such risks and uncertainties are detailed in the company s sec reports and filings 
certain of these risks and uncertainties are discussed under factors affecting future results 
nature of operations xilinx  inc xilinx or the company designs  develops and markets cmos complementary metal oxide silicon programmable logic devices and related development system software 
the company s programmable logic product lines include field programmable gate arrays fpgas and complex programmable logic devices cplds 
these components are standard integrated circuits ics programmed by xilinx s customers to perform desired logic operations 
xilinx introduced the first fpga device in  holds patents on fpga architecture and technology  and continues to be the leading supplier to this market 
xilinx also markets hardwire devices which are mask programmed ics functionally equivalent to programmed fpgas 
the company s products provide high integration and quick time to market for electronic equipment manufacturers in the data processing  telecommunications  networking  industrial control  instrumentation and military markets 
the company markets its products throughout the world through a direct sales organization  direct sales to manufacturers by independent sales representative firms  sales through licensed domestic distributors and sales through foreign distributors 
xilinx s products have provided effective solutions to a wide range of customer logic requirements  thereby permitting the company to increase revenues and market share and to realize excellent profitability during fiscal results of operations the following table sets forth certain operational data both as percentages of annual revenues and as percentage changes from the prior year s results 
years ended march  increase from prior year revenues cost of revenues gross margin research and development marketing  general and administrative operating income before non recurring charges non recurring charges nm nm operating income interest income net income before taxes provision for income taxes net income revenue xilinx reported record revenues for of million  representing an increase of from million for and from million reported for the growth in revenues was a function of increased unit sales of programmable logic devices and  more specifically  was primarily attributable to the revenue growth of the xc family as well as the growth of the company s new product  the xc family 
other contributors included the company s xc  xc and cpld families 
xilinx s development system software is used by the company s customers to implement designs in the company s programmable logic devices 
software revenues increased by in to approximately million as compared to million in and million in although software revenues have increased in dollar amounts  sales have declined as a percentage of total revenues  accounting for  and of revenues for  and  respectively 
cumulative licenses for proprietary development system software distributed to customers through the end of approximated  units  as compared to  and  at the end of and  respectively 
revenue contribution by product line reflected increased customer demand for the functionality and performance provided by the company s higher density and higher speed programmable logic devices 
of the million growth in revenues between and  was provided by revenues from the proprietary products within the xc family as well as the xc  xc  xc and cpld families  all of which are proprietary products 
revenues from proprietary products increased from of the aggregate revenues in to in in the fourth quarter of  proprietary products accounted for of total revenues as compared to for the comparable quarter 
revenues from the xc family increased between and to million 
deriving revenues from proprietary products has been emphasized by the company as an effective implementation of a corporate pricing strategy whose aim is to expand the market for its products by reducing sales prices coincident with and commensurate with reductions in the cost of manufacturing these products 
the company is actively pursuing a strategy of broadening the markets it serves through the enhancement of software development tools  the introduction of architectures offering new functionality  and the reduction of ic prices through continuous advancements in the silicon manufacturing process 
during  all product families except the non proprietary members of the xc family  where there is a second source competitor  experienced increases in unit volume 
during this period  the average selling price of an ic product family fell between and 
individual products within the xc  xc and xc families experienced price decreases as much as during the past year  as prices were reduced in the higher complexity and higher speed families in order to be more competitive in high volume applications 
price erosion of this magnitude has been common in the semiconductor industry  as advances in both architecture and manufacturing process technology have permitted continual reductions in cost 
the approximately increase in unit volume for the xc family and the more than doubling in unit volume for the xc family outweighed the impact of price erosion on individual product lines  as the weighted average selling price for all ics increased approximately in relative to the previous year 
the xc products provide the widest range of densities of any family  currently ranging from  to  gates 
the company s hardwire products offer a low cost migration path for high volume applications 
during  the company began volume production of the xc family  which represents the first fpga specifically developed as a cost effective  high volume production alternative to gate arrays 
the xc family is expected to allow the company to enter new market segments  for which most new designs are expected to require higher quantities 
however  there can be no assurances that the xc family will be successful in entering new market segments 
revenues for the xc family were million for in the second half of the company introduced the xc cpld family  which provides complete in system programming and test capabilities for users who need maximum design flexibility throughout their product life cycle 
no single end customer accounted for more than of revenues in or and of revenues in international revenues constituted  and of total revenues for  and  respectively 
international revenues continue to be primarily to customers in europe and japan 
revenue growth over the past year in these two international markets was and  respectively 
in  the company completed construction of a million manufacturing facility in dublin  ireland 
the ireland facility has increased production levels throughout and has enhanced the company s ability to meet the needs of its international customers 
the company believes that international revenues will continue to grow at a faster rate over the intermediate future than domestic sales and projects that such revenues will eventually comprise of the worldwide total 
however  there can be no assurances that international revenues will eventually reach this level in the future 
sales to pacific rim  middle east and other regions outside north america  europe and japan represented approximately of revenues in each year presented 
recently  several independent semiconductor industry analysts have indicated their belief that the overall semiconductor industry will grow at lower rates than actual growth rates over the last few years 
see other factors affecting operating results for discussion relating to potential impact of semiconductor industry conditions on the company s business 
the company expects its growth rate in revenue for fiscal to decrease from the levels experienced in fiscal the company believes that the conditions that led to slow growth in the last two quarters of fiscal are still present  although probably to a lesser degree 
the company also realizes that a prolonged slowdown in the overall semiconductor industry would detrimentally impact xilinx 
while the company currently projects revenue growth rates for the first two quarters of fiscal to be comparable to or above the two to four percent quarterly growth experienced in the final two quarters of the prior fiscal year  no assurance can be given that this will be the case 
the preceding three paragraphs contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors including those set forth in factors affecting future results and elsewhere in this section 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of revenues was for as compared to for and for recent gross margin improvements are largely due to the strengthening of the dollar versus the yen  recurring pricing negotiations  improved product yields associated with recent manufacturing technology enhancements  and realization of the benefits of expanded levels of production 
over the past three years  xilinx has also been able to offset much of the erosion in gross margin percentages on the more mature integrated circuits with increased volumes of newer  proprietary  higher margin products 
the company recognizes that ongoing price reductions for its integrated circuits are a significant element in expanding the market for its products 
company management believes that the fiscal gross margins of are neither sustainable nor desirable in the future 
gross margins closer to the company s historical range of to of revenues are considered more appropriate for expanding market share while realizing acceptable returns  although there can be no assurance that future gross margins will be in this range 
because the company s wafer purchases supplied by japanese foundries are denominated in yen  a strengthened us dollar exchange rate against the yen has had a positive impact on manufacturing costs 
manufacturing costs would be adversely impacted if the dollar weakens against the yen 
see factors affecting future results 
research and development the company has increased the dollars spent on research and development each year in its twelve year history 
these expenses in exceeded those of the prior year by and those of by 
the increase in research and development expenses is primarily attributable to increased staffing  higher engineering wafer purchases  and increased facility and support costs associated with an expanded scope of operations 
increased staffing in fiscal was attributable in part to the acquisition and integration of neocad 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company remains committed to a significant level of research and development effort in order to continue to compete aggressively in the programmable logic marketplace 
through march   the company had us patents issued and has filed for an additional us patents in the areas of software  ic architecture and design 
as of march   research and development personnel were split for software development and for integrated circuit design and process development 
xilinx has not capitalized any of the costs associated with its software development 
marketing  general and administrative marketing  general and administrative costs have increased in each of the past three years but declined as a percentage of revenues  reflecting both the greater growth rate in revenues and the company s commitment to control administrative expenses 
sales expenses have increased each year due to increasing personnel  increases in advertising  the costs of new sales offices  and greater commission expenses associated with higher revenues 
the company has nineteen sales offices located throughout the united states  including the metropolitan areas of san jose  los angeles  denver  dallas  chicago  minneapolis  atlanta  raleigh  philadelphia and boston as well as eight international sales offices located in the metropolitan areas of london  munich  paris  stockholm  tokyo  taipei  seoul and hong kong 
the increase in general and administrative expenses since is primarily attributable to an expanded number of employees and to continuing legal expenses associated with litigation intended to protect the company s intellectual property rights 
the timing and extent of future legal costs associated with the ongoing enforcement of the company s intellectual property rights are not readily predictable and may increase the level of future general and administrative expenses 
non recurring charges during the first quarter of fiscal  the company incurred a million non recurring write off of in process technology relating to the company s acquisition of neocad 
during  the company has incurred research and development expenses relating to its efforts to combine the xilinx and neocad technologies into an integrated software product 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
during  the company incurred a million write off of a minority investment in star semiconductor corporation 
operating income operating income grew from million in to million in and to million in operating income in was million before consideration of the non recurring write off of in process technology 
over the past three years  operating income as a percentage of revenues before consideration of non recurring charges has increased from in to in and to in operating income as a percentage of revenues could be adversely impacted in future years by the factors noted above  and as the company expands its efforts in research and development and continues to assert its intellectual property rights 
interest  net the company incurs interest expense on the million of convertible subordinated notes issued in november the company earns interest income on its cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted investments 
the amount of interest earned is a function of the balance of cash invested as well as the prevailing interest rates 
net interest income for increased by million over in  the increased interest expense incurred relating to the notes was partially offset by the interest income earned from investing the net proceeds of such notes 
the company s investment portfolio contains tax advantaged municipal bonds which have pretax yields which are less than the interest rate on the notes 
for financial reporting purposes  the company effectively records the difference between the pretax and tax equivalent yields as a reduction in provision for taxes on income 
as a result of the difference in yields and future uses of the investment portfolio  levels of net interest income are likely to decrease in the future 
provision for income taxes xilinx s effective tax rate was for as compared to and for and  respectively 
the higher tax rate for fiscal resulted from the non recurring write off of in process technology relating to the acquisition of neocad  which is not tax deductible 
excluding the non recurring write off of in process technology  the company s effective tax rate for fiscal was 
the reduced rate from the previous fiscal year is primarily due to the company s expanded operations in certain foreign jurisdictions that offer statutory tax rates beneath the us effective tax rate 
the company believes that net deferred tax assets approximately million at march  are realizable due to the taxable income existing in potential carryback years 
inflation the effects of inflation upon the company s financial results have not been significant 
factors affecting future results dependence upon independent manufacturers the company does not manufacture the wafers used for its products 
to date  most of the company s fpga wafers have been manufactured by seiko epson corporation seiko and yamaha corporation 
the company has depended upon these suppliers and others to produce wafers with competitive performance and cost attributes  to produce wafers at acceptable yields and to deliver them to the company in a timely manner 
while the quality  yield and timeliness of wafer deliveries to date from its suppliers have been acceptable  there can be no assurance that manufacturing problems will not occur in the future 
any prolonged inability to obtain wafers with competitive performance and cost attributes  adequate yields or timely deliveries from these manufacturers  or any other circumstance that would require the company to seek alternative sources of supply  could delay shipments 
any significant delays could have an adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company s long term growth will depend in large part on the company s ability to obtain increased wafer fabrication capacity from suppliers 
a significant increase in general industry demand or any interruption of supply could reduce the company s supply of wafers or increase the company s cost of such wafers  thereby materially adversely affecting the company s business 
in order to secure additional wafer capacity  the company from time to time considers a number of alternatives  including  without limitation  equity investments in  or loans  deposits  or other financial commitments to  independent wafer manufacturers in exchange for production capacity  or the use of contracts which commit the company to purchase specified quantities of wafers over extended periods 
the company has at times been unable  and may in the future be unable  to fully satisfy customer demand because of production constraints  including the ability of suppliers and subcontractors to provide materials and services in a timely manner  as well as the ability of the company to process products for shipment 
the company s future growth will depend in part on its ability to locate and qualify additional suppliers and subcontractors and to increase its own capacity to ship products  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so 
any increase in these constraints on the company s production could materially adversely affect the company s business 
in this regard  the company has entered into a joint venture  united silicon inc usi  to construct a new wafer fabrication facility 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements and the commitments discussion within financial condition  liquidity and capital resources 
however  there are many risks associated with the construction of a new facility  and there can be no assurance that such facility will become operational in a timely manner 
in addition  the company has recently entered into an agreement for additional capacity with another foundry 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and the commitments discussion within financial condition  liquidity and capital resources 
if the company requires additional capacity and such capacity is unavailable  or unavailable on reasonable terms  the company s business could be materially adversely affected 
impact of currency the company has historically purchased most of the processed silicon wafers used in its integrated circuits from japanese foundries  which have been denominated in yen 
the company has often limited its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates through the purchase of forward exchange and option contracts and by denominating billings to japanese customers in yen 
the company has entered into currency option contracts to cover approximately of yen requirements for wafer purchases after consideration of foreign sales denominated in yen 
weakness in the purchasing power of the us dollar could increase the effective cost of processed silicon and adversely affect the company s future results of operations 
foreign sales are billed in us dollars except for sales in japan denominated in yen 
the company has also entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to eliminate the impact of future exchange fluctuations on the us dollar cost of investing in the usi joint venture 
litigation the company is currently involved in patent litigation with altera corporation see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and item  legal proceedings 
due to the uncertain nature of the litigation with altera and because the lawsuits are still in the pre trial stage  the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time 
management believes that it has meritorious defenses to such claims and is defending them vigorously 
the foregoing is a forward looking statement and the future outcome could differ 
other factors affecting operating results the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change  intense competitive pressure and cyclical market patterns 
the company s results of operations are affected by a wide variety of factors  including general economic conditions and conditions specific to the semiconductor industry  decreases in average selling price over the life of any particular product  the timing of new product introductions both by the company and its competitors  the timely implementation of new manufacturing technologies  the ability to safeguard patents and intellectual property in a rapidly evolving market  and rapid escalation of demand for some products in the face of equally steep decline in demand for others 
market demand for the company s products  particularly for those most recently introduced  can be difficult to predict  especially in light of customers demands to shorten product lead time 
this could lead to revenue volatility if the company were unable to provide sufficient quantities of specified products in a given quarter 
in addition  any difficulty in achieving targeted yields could adversely impact the company s results of operations 
the company attempts to identify these changes in market conditions as soon as possible  however  the rapidity of their onset makes prediction of and reaction to such events difficult 
due to the foregoing and other factors  past results are a much less reliable predictor of the future than is the case in many older  more stable and less dynamic industries 
the company s future success depends on its ability to develop and introduce on a timely basis new products which compete effectively on the basis of price and performance and which address customer requirements 
the success of new product introductions is dependent upon several factors  including timely completion of new product designs  achievement of acceptable yields and market acceptance 
no assurance can be given that the company s product development efforts will be successful or that its new products will achieve market acceptance 
in addition  the average selling price for any particular product tends to decrease rapidly over the product s life 
to offset such decreases  the company relies primarily on obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacture of existing products and on introducing new products which incorporate advanced features and other price performance factors such that higher average selling prices and higher margins are achievable relative to mature product lines 
to the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions with higher margins do not occur in a timely manner or the company s products do not achieve market acceptance  the company s operating results could be adversely affected 
the company s fpga and cpld products compete in the programmable logic marketplace  with a substantial majority of the company s revenues derived from its fpga product families 
the industries in which the company competes are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change  rapid product obsolescence and price erosion 
the company expects significantly increased competition both from existing competitors and from a number of companies that may enter its market 
xilinx believes that important competitive factors in the programmable logic market include price  product performance and reliability  adaptability of products to specific applications  ease of use and functionality of development system software  and technical service and support 
the company s strategy for expansion in the programmable logic market includes continued price reductions commensurate with the ability to lower the cost of manufacture and continued introduction of new product architectures which target high volume  low cost applications 
the company s major sources of competition are comprised of three elements the manufacturers of custom cmos gate arrays  providers of high density programmable logic products characterized by fpga type architectures and other providers of programmable logic products 
the company competes with custom gate array manufacturers on the basis of lower design costs  shorter development schedules and reduced inventory risks 
the primary attributes of custom gate arrays are high density  high speed and low production costs in high volumes 
however  the company believes that the design specifications for many customers can be met by the density and speed capabilities of xilinx s programmable logic products which are cost effective in the required production volumes 
in addition  the company s efforts to introduce lower cost architectures are intended to narrow the gap between current custom gate array production costs in high volumes and fpga production costs 
to the extent that such efforts are not successful  the company s business could be materially adversely affected 
the company relies upon patent  trademark  trade secret and copyright law to protect its intellectual property 
there can be no assurance that such intellectual property rights can be successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
from time to time  third parties  including competitors of the company  may assert exclusive patent  copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to the company 
litigation  regardless of its outcome  could result in substantial cost and diversion of resources of the company 
any infringement claim or other litigation against or by the company could materially  adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company s future success depends in large part on the continued service of its key technical  marketing and management personnel and on its ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees  particularly those highly skilled design  process and test engineers involved in the manufacture of existing products and the development of new products and processes 
the competition for such personnel is intense  and the loss of key employees could have a material  adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
sales outside of the united states carry a number of inherent risks  including risks of currency exchange fluctuations  the need for export licenses  tariffs and other potential trade barriers  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  the impact of recessionary environments in economies outside the united states and generally longer receivable collection periods 
the company s business is also subject to the risks associated with the imposition of legislation and regulations relating to the import or export of semiconductor products 
the company cannot predict whether quotas  duties  taxes or other charges or restrictions will be imposed by the united states or other countries upon the importation or exportation of the company s products in the future or what  if any  effect such actions would have on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in order to expand international sales and service  the company will need to maintain and expand existing foreign operations or establish new foreign operations 
this entails hiring additional personnel and maintaining or expanding existing relationships with international distributors and sales representatives 
this will require significant management attention and financial resources and could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its maintenance or expansion of existing foreign operations  in its establishment of new foreign operations or in its efforts to maintain or expand its relationships with international distributors or sales representatives 
the semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical and subject to  at various times  significant economic downturns characterized by diminished product demand  accelerated erosion of average selling prices and overcapacity 
the company may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in future operating results due to general semiconductor industry conditions  overall economic conditions or other factors 
currently  most of the company s operations are centered in an area that has been seismically active 
should there be a major earthquake in this area  the company s operations may be disrupted resulting in the inability of the company to ship products in a timely manner  thereby materially adversely affecting the company s business 
in addition  the securities of many high technology companies have historically been subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations which may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources the company s financial condition at march  remained strong 
total current assets exceeded total current liabilities by times  compared to times at march  since its inception  the company has used a combination of equity and debt financing and internal cash flow to support operations  make acquisitions and investments in complementary technologies  obtain capital equipment and finance inventory and accounts receivable 
total assets have grown from million in to million in this increase reflects the net proceeds of million received from the sale of convertible subordinated notes during the year as well as the year s favorable operating results 
the percentage changes of selected balance sheet items from march to march are shown below change from description to cash  cash equivalents and short term investments receivables inventories total current assets total assets total current liabilities stockholder s equity cash  cash equivalents and short term investments xilinx s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased by million in to million 
the company generated cash flow of approximately million from operating activities in  offset by million of cash used for investing activities  including the acquisition of neocad  the usi joint venture  net purchases of investments and investments in property  plant and equipment 
in addition  the company generated million of cash from financing activities  reflecting the proceeds derived from the convertible debt offering  which netted million  and million of common stock proceeds under employee option and stock purchase plans  offset by million of principal payments on capital lease obligations 
at march   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments represented of total assets 
receivables receivables grew from million at the end of to million at the end of the increase in receivables year to year is primarily due to the greater volume of shipments which occurred in the last month of fiscal inventories inventories increased from million at march to million at march inventory levels at march  represent days of inventory  which is consistent with company objectives  and compares to days at march  the company confronts dual  contradictory objectives with regard to inventory management 
on the one hand  the company believes that its standard  off the shelf products should be available for prompt shipment to customers 
accordingly  it attempts to maintain sufficient levels of inventory in various product  range and speed configurations to meet unpredictable customer demand 
at the same time  the company also wishes to minimize the handling costs associated with higher inventory levels and to realize fully the opportunities for cost reduction associated with future manufacturing process advancements 
the company continually strives to balance these two objectives so as to provide excellent customer response at a competitive cost 
year end inventories as a percentage of the fourth quarter s cost of revenues increased from in to in property  plant and equipment xilinx s investment in property and equipment was million in compared to million in the company continues to invest in software design tools and semiconductor design  test and manufacturing equipment 
the company completed construction of a million manufacturing facility in dublin  ireland in to establish capacity to meet increased product demand 
although the company anticipates significantly lower capital expenditures in fiscal as a result of the completion of the ireland facility  significant investments with wafer suppliers are planned for see commitments discussion 
current liabilities current liabilities grew by to million at the end of this growth is primarily attributable to increased deferred income for shipments made to domestic distributors  increased trade payables associated with an expanded scale of operations and interest payable relating to the convertible subordinated notes 
line of credit the company has obtained credit line facilities for up to million see note of notes to consolidated financial statements of which million is intended to meet occasional working capital requirements for the company s wholly owned irish subsidiary 
at march   no borrowings were outstanding under the lines of credit 
long term debt in november  the company issued million in convertible subordinated notes 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
there was no significant long term debt in stockholders equity stockholders equity grew by in to million 
the increase of million was primarily attributable to million in net income and million related to the issuance of common stock in accordance with the company s stock plans and the tax benefit from stock options 
stockholders equity as a percentage of total assets was for and for commitments the company entered into a series of agreements with united microelectronics corporation umc pursuant to which the company has agreed to join umc and other parties to form a joint venture for the purpose of building and managing an advanced semiconductor manufacturing facility in taiwan 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
under the terms of the agreement  the company invested million in fiscal and will invest an additional million and million in december and july  respectively  for a equity interest in the venture 
as a result of its equity ownership  the company will receive rights to purchase at market prices a percentage of the facility s wafer production 
the proposed facility is expected to commence limited production of eight inch sub micron wafers during fiscal the company is currently receiving eight inch  sub micron wafers in limited volume from a recently constructed foundry in which umc is the major shareholder 
xilinx believes it will continue to receive such products in moderate volumes until the proposed facility is operational 
on may   the company signed an agreement with seiko epson corporation seiko  a primary wafer supplier 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the agreement provides for an advance to seiko of million to be used in the construction of a wafer fabrication facility in japan which will provide access to eight inch sub micron wafers 
in conjunction with the agreement  million was paid in may and further installments are scheduled starting in november repayment of this advance will be in the form of wafer deliveries expected to begin in the first half of in addition to the advance payments  the company will provide further funding to seiko in the amount of million 
this additional funding will be paid after the final installment of the million advance and the form of the additional funding will be negotiated at that time 
employees the number of company employees grew by during the past year 
xilinx had  employees at the end of as compared to at the end of the prior year 
the company anticipates that existing sources of liquidity and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to satisfy the company s cash needs for the foreseeable future 
the company will continue to evaluate opportunities for investments to obtain additional wafer supply capacity  procurement of additional capital equipment and facilities  development of new products  and potential acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies that would complement the company s businesses and may use available cash or other sources of funding for such purposes
