item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition legg mason  inc and its subsidiaries the company are principally engaged in providing securities brokerage  investment advisory  investment banking and commercial mortgage banking services to individuals  institutions  corporations and municipalities 
the company s profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors including the volume of trading in securities  the volatility and general level of market prices  and the demand for investment banking and mortgage banking services 
during the fiscal year ended march   the company benefited from favorable conditions in the us securities markets 
us equity markets achieved record trading volumes and price levels  principally because of rising corporate profits  declining interest rates and low inflation 
as a result of the favorable environment and healthy revenue gains in each of the company s business areas securities brokerage  investment advisory services and investment and mortgage banking the company achieved record earnings in fiscal it is uncertain if the favorable conditions experienced in fiscal will continue in fiscal  or longer 
the company s investment advisory activities and their contribution to operating results have grown significantly  through both internal growth and acquisition  over the past ten years 
during fiscal  the company acquired bartlett co 
bartlett and lehman brothers global asset management limited  since renamed western asset global management limited western asset global  as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
bartlett  acquired in january  manages approximately billion for high net worth individuals  family groups and institutions 
western asset global  acquired in february  manages assets of approximately billion  invested principally in international fixed income securities and currencies 
with these two additions  assets under management for institutions  company sponsored mutual funds and private accounts managed by the company s subsidiaries were billion at march   up from billion a year earlier and from billion ten years ago 
earnings from investment advisory services tend to be more stable than those from securities brokerage and investment banking activities because they are less affected by changes in securities market conditions 
the company s financial statements for all periods presented have been restated to include the results of bartlett  acquired on a pooling of interests basis in january results of any individual period should not be considered representative of future profitability 
many of the company s activities have fixed operating costs which do not decline with reduced levels of volume 
while the company attempts to reduce costs  particularly during periods of low volume  it does not  as a general rule  attempt to do so through personnel reductions 
accordingly  sustained periods of unfavorable market conditions may adversely affect profitability
