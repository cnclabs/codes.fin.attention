net interest income as reflected in the preceding table  the company s primary source of revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income received on interest earning assets and the interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income before provision for loan losses for the year ended december  was  an increase of  over the amount recorded in the company s net interest margin decreased to for the year ended december  from in the decrease in the net interest margin was primarily due to the increase in the higher cost of time certificates of deposits as well as the increased balances in that category 
the rate on interest bearing liabilities averaged in  higher by from the average rate during most of this cost shift was offset by the increase in the average rate on earning assets which rose as most market interest rates were higher on average in than in the increase in net interest was limited by two interest rate swaps with a total notional principal amount of  initiated in january as a hedge on a portion of the company s variable rate loan portfolio 
under the terms of the swaps  the company receives a fixed rate of for three years ending in january  while the company pays the prime rate over the same period of time see note to consolidated financial statements 
net interest income before provision for loan losses was  in  a increase over the company s net interest margin increased to in compared to in the net interest margin improved primarily due to the growth in deposits which were then placed in higher yielding assets 
the increases in net interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities during were due to growth of the company 
the company s net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  referred to as volume change 
it is also affected by changes in yields earned on interest earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing deposits and other borrowed funds  referred to as a rate change 
the following table sets forth changes in interest income and interest expense for each major category of interest earning asset and interest bearing liability  and the amount of change attributable to volume and rate changes for the years indicated 
the changes due to rate and volume have been allocated to rate and volume in proportion to the relationship between their absolute dollar amounts

management monitors the company s net interest margin and makes adjustments by repricing its loans and deposit products after giving effect to such factors as competition  the economic environment and expected maturities in the loan  investment securities and deposit portfolios 
provision for loan losses the company maintains an allowance for loan losses to cover the inherent risks of loss associated with its loan portfolio 
see balance sheet analysis credit risk management and asset quality 
the provision for loan losses is charged against income and is applied to the allowance for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses for was  compared to  in and  in reflecting  increased charge offs with two loans totaling  net charge offs to average loans increased to in compared to in and in other income the increase in other income of  in compared to the previous year was primarily attributable to an increase in securities transactions which totaled  in compared to a loss of  in excluding securities transactions  other income decreased by  in compared to as an increase in service charges on deposits was offset by a decline in mortgage banking fees 
mortgage banking operations were initiated in and consist solely of a broker function 
the company  as broker  provides all loan documentation required by the applicable underwriting criteria and sends the material to a funding institution 
the funding institution then approves or declines the loan and  if approved  subsequently funds the loan directly 
the company earns the points and any documentation fees charged on the loan but is otherwise not involved in the loan 
the decrease in other income of  in compared to the previous year was primarily attributable to a decrease in securities transactions which totaled a loss of  in compared to a gain of  in excluding securities transactions  other income increased by  in compared to resulting from the company s growth in service charges on deposits which offset a decline in mortgage banking fees

other areas with significant variances included salaries and employee benefits which increased  and fdic assessment which decreased  the increase in salaries and employee benefits of  in was primarily related to an increase in staff as the number of full time equivalent employees totaled at december  compared to at december  the increase in salaries and employee benefits of  in was also primarily related to an increase in staff which offset a reduction in worker s compensation insurance 
occupancy expenses decreased  in as rent was reduced at two of the company s locations  one in february and one in july the decrease of  in occurred due to the rent reductions mentioned above 
legal fees increased  in after increasing  in due to increased costs of loan collection on several large credits

the fdic assessment was reduced to the legal minimum of dollars per quarter in see supervision and regulation premiums for deposit insurance and assessments for examinations 
fdic assessments increased by  in due to an increase in deposits 
office supplies increased  in primarily due to increased costs of data processing 
the cost of office supplies was virtually unchanged in decreasing  from other assessments  primarily check processing charges by the federal reserve bank and correspondent banking charges increased  after increasing  in the increases in both years primarily reflected the growth in volume and the increased utilization of correspondent bank processing of deposits received outside of the company s immediate area

audits  accounting and examinations decreased  after increasing  in there were fewer projects in but overall  there continues to be more in depth auditing as the company has grown in both size and function 
postage increased  in as an increase in postal rates was offset by greater utilization of in house couriers for monthly statements

balance sheet analysis average deposits increased  in to  from  in and increased  in from  in  while average loans decreased  in to  from  in and decreased  in from  in average securities increased  in from  in and increased  in from  in the growth in deposits resulted principally from the consolidation of the health care industry 
whether company s clients were purchased or did the purchasing  the result generated deposits through additional business 
the deposits were primarily placed in securities 
loans decreased as loan demand diminished among the company s clients 
as deposits have shifted into more volatile time certificates of deposit  the company has shifted balance sheet assets into cash from securities 
the company s securities held to maturity and available for sale less valuation decreased to  at december  from  at december  similarly federal funds sold increased to  at december  from  at december  loan portfolio the company concentrates its lending activities in three principal areas commercial loans  equity lines of credit and installment loans 
commercial loans include real estate secured commercial loans and other commercial loans 
lines of credit include equity lines  overdraft protection lines and other secured and unsecured lines of credit 
installment loans include auto and boat loans and other loans for personal use 
the interest rates charged for the loans made by the company vary with the degree of risk  the size and maturity of the loan  whether the loan has a fixed or variable rate  the borrowers depository relationships with the company  and prevailing market rates 
although the risk of non payment exists with respect to all loans  certain other specific risks are associated with each type of loan 
the primary risks associated with commercial loans  including real estate secured commercial loans  are the quality of the borrower s management and a number of economic and other factors  including competition  insufficient capital  changes in laws and regulations and general changes in the marketplace  which induce business failures and cause the value of business assets pledged to secure the loan to depreciate 
the company s portfolio concentration in the health care industry exposes the company to the risk that adverse developments in this sector  including any such developments resulting from proposed health care reform  could negatively affect the abilities of these borrowers to repay their loans 
equity lines of credit  installment loans and other lines of credit are affected primarily by domestic instability and a variety of factors that may lead to the borrower s unemployment  including deteriorating economic conditions in one or more segments of a local or broader economy 
the following table sets forth the amounts of loans outstanding by type of credit extension as of the dates indicated 
december  in thousands loan categories commercial      real estate secured commercial      subtotal      equity lines of credit      other lines of credit      installment      lease financing total loans      less allowance for loan losses   less deferred loan fees  net net loans      fixed rate      variable rate      total loans      there were no categories of loans exceeding of total loans which were not otherwise disclosed as a category of loans in the above table 
there were no construction loans outstanding at december  and the company generally underwrites loans on the basis of adequate current cash flow and does not look to collateral as a primary source of repayment 
the company s loan policies are believed by management to conform with applicable regulatory lending standards 
commercial loans and real estate secured commercial loans 
the company s commercial and real estate secured commercial loans totaled  or of total loans and  or of total loans at december  and  respectively 
real estate secured commercial loans totaled  at december  and  at december  commercial and real estate secured commercial loans consist primarily of short to medium term financing for small to medium sized health care related companies located in southern california 
the commercial and real estate secured commercial loans are primarily concentrated in the same sectors of the medical community as the company s deposit base is drawn from solo medical practitioners  small groups  large single specialty groups  multispecialty medical groups and other outpatient health care companies  and medical billing companies 
commercial and real estate secured commercial loan clients have annual sales of up to million 
approximately of total loans at december  were commercial loans which were unsecured or secured by various personal property assets  including equipment  receivables and capitation payments 
as a matter of policy  the company s commercial loan borrowers are required to submit financial statements and other financial data for example  accounts receivables and enrollment summaries on a periodic basis  at least annually  to loan officers for their review in monitoring the financial position and cash flows of these borrowers 
under this policy  management generally places a higher level of scrutiny on borrowers who fail to submit the required financial information 
additionally  senior lending officers review delinquency reports and borrowers payment histories to monitor potential problem loans 
on those commercial loans secured by real estate  loan to value ratios at the loan origination date generally range from approximately to 
approximately of total loans at december  were commercial loans secured by real estate  but because the company s commercial loans are repaid typically through cash flows from the borrowers business with shorter term amortization three to five years  the commercial loans are not classified by the company as real estate mortgage loans 
equity lines of credit 
at december  and  equity lines of credit aggregated approximately  or of total loans  and  or of total loans  respectively 
loan to appraised value ratios at the loan origination date range up to and all such loans have variable rate structures 
most of these lines of credit are secured by junior trust deeds on residential real estate 
other lines of credit 
at december  and  other lines of credit aggregated approximately  or of total loans  and  or of total loans  respectively 
other lines of credit are generally unsecured and include overdraft protection lines and revolving lines of credit 
installment loans 
at december  and  installment aggregated approximately  or of total loans  and  or of total loans  respectively 
this loan category primarily includes automobile loans 
loan to appraised value ratios at the loan origination date range up to for automobile installment loans 
the following table shows the maturity distribution of the company s loans outstanding at december   which based on remaining scheduled repayments of principal  were due within the periods indicated

these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized on the consolidated balance sheet 
the company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual notional principal amount of those instruments 
at december  and  the company had commitments to extend credit of approximately  and  respectively and obligations under standby letters of credit of approximately  and  respectively 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the company to support the performance of a client to a third party 
those standby letters of credit are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements  including commercial paper  bond financing and similar transactions 
all such standby letters of credit are extended for a period of months or less 
in making commitments and issuing letters of credit  the company uses credit policies similar to those used in connection with extending loan facilities to customers 
the company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by the company upon extension of credit  is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer 
collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  capitation payments and income producing commercial real estate 
credit risk management and asset quality 
management believes that the objective of a sound credit policy is to extend loans to qualified customers while controlling risk affecting shareholders and depositors 
the loan committee  made up of members of the board of directors of the bank  approves credit policy and reviews asset quality and compliance with credit policy 
management performs reviews of loan quality and monitors the progress of watch list loans  some of which may require an action plan for rehabilitation or refinancing 
in addition  credit underwriting guidelines are periodically reviewed and adjusted to reflect current economic conditions and industry practices 
in accordance with management s credit administration policy  loans are placed on nonaccrual status when the full collection of principal or interest is doubtful 
generally  this means that loans are put on nonaccrual status when interest is days or more past due  unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
interest income which would have been earned on such nonaccrual loans for the year ended december   had such loans complied with their original terms  totaled approximately  the table below sets for information about nonperforming assets which included nonaccrual loans and oreo  accruing loans days or more past due and certain ratios december  in thousands nonperforming assets nonperforming loans     other real estate owned oreo total nonperforming assets     accruing loans days or more past due nonperforming loans to total loans nonperforming assets to total loans to total loans and oreo to total assets nonperforming loans and nonperfoming assets do not include accruing loans days or more past due 
nonperforming assets increased at december  compared to december  by approximately  to  nonperforming assets included a nonaccrual commercial loan to a single borrower in the amount of  the company is finalizing several agreements which will result in the acquisition of assets in satisfaction of this loan 
the underlying assets include two partnership interests and a promissory note 
this loan has been written down to the fair value of the underlying collateral 
the remaining nonperforming assets primarily consist of commercial loans with several in various stages of litigation 
allowance for loan losses management s determination of the allowance for loan losses requires the use of estimates and assumptions related to the risks inherent in the loan portfolio which management believes are reasonable 
actual results could  however  differ significantly from those estimates 
in connection with the determination of the allowance for loan losses and the valuation of real estate loans  management generally obtains independent appraisals for all properties 
management believes its current appraisal policies generally conform to federal regulatory guidelines 
an evaluation of the overall quality of the portfolio is performed to determine the necessary level of the allowance for loan losses 
this evaluation takes into consideration the classification of loans and the application of loss estimates to these classifications 
the company classifies loans as pass  watch  special mention  substandard  doubtful  or loss based on classification criteria believed by management to be consistent with the criteria applied by the company s banking examiners 
these classifications and loss estimates take into consideration all sources of repayment  underlying collateral  the value of such collateral  current and anticipated economic conditions  trends  and uncertainties and the historical accuracy of specific reserves attached to loans with serious perceived weakness 
the company utilizes migration analysis as another means to assist management to determine the necessary level of the allowance for loan losses 
migration analysis involves examining historic net charge offs to estimate probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the above processes provide management with data that help to identify and estimate the credit risk inherent in the portfolio so that management may identify potential problem loans on a timely basis 
the allowance for loan losses reflects the result of these estimates 
based on information available at december   management believed the  allowance for loan losses  which constituted of total loans  was adequate as an allowance against probable and estimable losses and management s assessment of risk in the portfolio 
the company has experienced some fluctuation in the provisions for loan losses due primarily to varying levels of net charge offs and a steady decline in loans 
net charge offs were moderate in and increased in primarily due to two loans which combined represented charge offs of  management believes the allowance and related provision for loan losses will increase or decrease in future periods commensurate with loan growth 
while the company s policy is to charge off in the current period those loans in which a loss is considered probable  there also exists the risk of future losses which cannot be precisely quantified or attributed to particular loans or classes of loans 
as this risk is continually changing in response to factors beyond the control of the company  such as the state of the economy  management s judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses in future periods is necessarily an approximate one 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the bank to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination 
the following table provides a summary of the company s allowance for loan losses and charge off and recovery activity

sfas accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures which amended certain provisions of sfas on january  the company considers a loan to be impaired when  based upon current information and events  it believes it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement on a timely basis 
impairment of a loan is measured by the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  or the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
if the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  the company recognizes an impairment by creating a valuation allowance with a corresponding charge to provision for loan losses securities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  the company classifies its investment in debt and equity securities as held to maturity  available for sale or trading securities as applicable

haas and curtis swindal to purchase  shares of common stock  each at a purchase price of per share exercisable in full on or after december  and before december  the company agreed to grant the holder of the shares issued upon exercise of the warrant warrant shares the right  on two occasions during the five year period beginning december   to require the company to register the demand registration the warrant shares under the act 
the company will pay the expenses of one demand registration 
in addition  the holder of the warrant shares will have the right during the period december  to december  to have the warrant shares included in registrations of the common stock under the act at the expense of the company 
assuming the demand registration could be filed under a form  such expense would be minimal 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
under the terms of the leshner warrant  if dr 
kovner dies before december   then the company will purchase  at the option of mr 
leshner  some or all of the warrants and or warrant shares then owned by mr 
leshner  provided that i the maximum aggregate purchase price paid by the company shall be not more than  and ii the funds to purchase such warrants and or warrant shares shall come solely from the proceeds of the key person insurance policy on dr 
kovner 
since such life insurance is in excess of the cash value recognized on the company s balance sheet  there would be no net reduction in capital nor any impact on liquidity 
furthermore  if at any time prior to december  mr 
leshner wishes to sell some or all of the warrants and or warrant shares to a third party  mr 
leshner must offer to sell such warrants and or warrant shares to the company on the same terms and conditions being offered to such third party

interest rate sensitivity an interest rate sensitive asset or liability is one that  within a defined time period  either matures or experiences an interest rate change in line with general market rates 
interest rate sensitivity is the volatility of a bank s earnings resulting from a movement in market interest rates 
the following table sets forth the distribution of the repricing of the company s assets and liabilities as of december   the interest rate sensitivity gap ie interest rate sensitive assets less interest rate sensitive liabilities  the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap  the interest rate sensitivity gap ratio ie  interest rate sensitive assets divided by interest rate sensitive liabilities and the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio 
the table also sets forth the time period in which assets and liabilities will mature or may reprice in accordance with their contractual terms 
generally  an excess of maturing or repricing assets over maturing or repricing liabilities during a given period will serve to enhance earnings in a rising rate environment and inhibit earnings when rates decline 
conversely  when maturing or repricing liabilities exceed maturing or repricing assets during a given period  a rising rate environment generally will inhibit earnings and declining rates generally will serve to enhance earnings 
however  the table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the net interest margin since the repricing of various categories of assets and liabilities is subject to competitive pressures and the needs of the company s clients 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to reprice  they may react differently to changes in market interest rates 
additionally  various assets and liabilities indicated as repricing within the same period may in fact reprice at different times within such period and at different rates

at december   the company s rate sensitive balance sheet was shown to be in a negative gap position 
the gap among immediately repriceable assets and liabilities was negative by  or of assets 
the cumulative negative gap narrows to  or of total assets in the next day through three months column and continues to narrow thereafter 
the table above implies that the company s earnings will be reduced in the short term if interest rates rise 
in practice  management believes the impact of rising interest rates will be reduced because the interest rates on the company s repriceable assets are expected to increase to a greater degree than will the interest rates on the company s repriceable liabilities in a rising rate environment 
additionally  the company s short term negative gap was somewhat less pronounced due to the cash flows produced by the company s portfolio of mortgage backed securities 
while the company had a large amount of longer term interest earning assets  those assets were funded primarily from noninterest bearing liabilities such as demand deposits which minimized the company s risk of carrying those assets 
in january  in order to lock in a higher rate of return  the company entered into two interest rate exchange agreements swaps 
these interest rate exchange agreements have a total aggregate notional principal amount of  as protection on a portion of the company s variable rate loan portfolio 
under the terms of these swaps  the company receives a fixed rate of for a three year period while the company pays the prime rate over the same term 
these swaps are not marked to market 
due in part to these swaps  the company s net interest margin for increased to 
during  as interest rates rose  the company began paying more on these swaps than it received and while the company s net interest margin continued to rise 
although these swaps are now negatively impacting the company s net interest margin  these swaps terminate in january the company desired to maintain the existing spread between a portion of its repricing liabilities and its repriceable assets and subsequently  in anticipation of rising interest rates  entered into an interest rate exchange agreement which started in may with a notional principal amount of  this swap is intended to protect against the rise of deposit costs relative to the prime rate 
under the terms of the basic swap  for a period of five years the company pays a rate of prime less basis points while receiving the three month libor 
because the company s repricing liabilities typically move to a lesser degree than does the three month libor  the terms of the original swap included limits on the rate to be received by the company 
this feature of the swap required mark to market accounting and the company terminated this feature of the swap and recorded a pre tax expense of  in although this swap reduces current earnings  the management of the company believes this reduction in earnings is justified by the protection against a narrowing spread 
as additional protection against lower interest rates  in december and january  the company entered into three interest rate floor contracts with a notional principal amount of  the agreements entitled the company to receive from counterparties on a monthly basis the amounts  if any by which the one month libor rate falls below 
the floor agreements were for a period of three years 
the average premium paid for the floor agreements was approximately basis points  and was being amortized over three years 
in may  the company sold the floor contracts for total consideration of  this amount is being amortized over the original three year term 
in order to protect the fair value of a portion of the company s gnma variable rate securities  in december  the company purchased two interest rate caps with a notional principal amount  each 
the agreements entitled the company to receive from counterparties on a quarterly basis the amounts  if any by which the one year cmt rate rises above for one of the agreements and on the other 
the cap agreements are for a period of three years 
the average premium paid for the cap agreements was basis points  which is being amortized over the three year period 
liquidity adequate liquidity and maintenance of an appropriate balance between interest rate sensitive earning assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities is the principal function of asset liability management of a financial institution 
liquidity management involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of clients who may be depositors desiring to withdraw funds or borrowers requiring assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs 
aside from asset liability management  the company maintains short term sources of funds to meet periodic planned and unplanned increases in loan demand and deposit withdrawals and maturities 
the initial source of liquidity is the excess funds sold daily to other banks in the form of federal funds 
besides cash and cash equivalents  the company maintains a large percentage of its assets in investment securities 
these securities include both securities available for sale and securities held to maturity 
securities available for sale can be sold in response to liquidity needs or used as collateral under reverse repurchase agreements 
securities held to maturity are available for liquidity needs solely as collateral for reverse repurchase agreements 
the company had no reverse repurchase agreements as of december   however the company averaged  in net funding from reverse repurchase agreements during as evidence of the company s high level of liquidity  at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled  while securities available for reverse repurchase agreements totaled approximately  the combined amount of  represents almost of the company s total assets 
this level of liquidity allows the company to reduce its utilization of low yielding short term assets while maintaining flexibility during periods of deposit outflow without being forced to maintain high levels of cash equivalents
