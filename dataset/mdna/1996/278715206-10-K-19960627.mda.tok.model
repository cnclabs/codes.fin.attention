item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the insurance industry has experienced major consolidation and restructuring driven by slower premium growth and tighter margins 
industry participants historically have been fragmented and poorly integrated  leading to the inefficient delivery of high cost  high price products and services 
the company s management believes that the insurance industry will experience significant changes during the next two to three years in order to remedy these deficiencies 
these changes may create opportunities for innovation in products  services and process automation 
the role of the independent agency distribution system has changed little until recently 
historically  buyers of insurance purchased insurance protection from an independent agent who secured policies directly from an insurer 
while the method of distribution and the details of the policy have  over time  increased in complexity  certain fundamental activities of a traditional insurance transaction have remained constant 
the agent served primarily as the sales arm in the process  and insurer as the risk bearer  who typically performed risk analysis and pricing functions 
the agent was also primarily responsible for servicing the customer and providing risk management and consulting services 
company management believes that the insurance industry in the future is likely to be characterized by industry automation efforts as opposed to separate insurance company automation and independent agency automation 
this industry automation solution may well connect many insurance industry participants electronically and integrate the workflow across different enterprises through computer networks 
industry wide team computing would allow both improved efficiency and marketing innovation 
the company believes that major efficiencies will be gained in the property and casualty distribution network 
replacing paper based transactions with electronic integration solutions should enable all participants carriers  wholesalers  independent agencies  information providers  and the insured to decrease the cost of entering information for new policies  renewals  endorsements and inquiries 
electronic integration also reduces errors and improves response time 
the company believes that computer software information services are likely to replace transfer of information between independent agencies and insurance carriers by mail  facsimile  by telephone  or by dedicated terminals supplied by carriers 
the company s strategy is to expand its market from that of the agency automation vendor to industry automation solution provider 
delphi also intends to attempt to shift its revenue base from annual license fees to transaction based revenue and fee based services 
the focus will include  in addition to the company s historical base  adding efficiency to independent agencies and adding quality and value to the entire insurance distribution system 
delphi intends to develop and provide products and services aimed at providing automation through the entire property and casualty insurance distribution network 
the company s success and profitablity will be dependent on its ability to develop a new application system product which is compatible with its existing products as well as its ability to strategically shift its business from selling computer hardware and application software to becoming a provider of outsourced processing services 
in addition  the company continually must develop product enhancements and new products that keep pace with continuing changes in computer hardware and software technology and satisfy the needs of its customers 
the company is developing a new application system  common delphi  which is currently in beta testing 
to a significant extent  the company s future operating results will be dependent upon the success of this product 
while the company has identified several of the outsourcing services that it intends to provide  none of these service offerings has been developed or is ready for marketing 
there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in adequately addressing changing technologies  that it can introduce services and products to the marketplace on a timely basis  or that its new services and new or enhanced products will be successful in the marketplace on timely basis  or that its new services and new or enhanced products will be successful in the marketplace 
any failure to successfully introduce such services and products will materially impact the company s existing business and its future profitability 
the company has experienced losses in each of its last two years and in each quarter of the current fiscal year 
the company attributes these losses primarily to a soft market  or possibly a changed market  for insurance agency automation equipment by reason of the relatively lower profitablity of independent agencies during the last three years as compared with earlier periods  industry wide consolidation and customer dissatisfaction with certain products and their concern regarding the company s financial statements 
the company has taken steps to reduce costs  strengthen its management and improve its product offering so as to be in a position to achieve profitability as market conditions improve  but no assurances can be given that those steps will be successful and help the company achieve profitability 
the company cannot survive continued operating losses indefinitely  and consequently  may be forced to raise additional funds or further restructure it business

revenues the company s revenues are derived from two sources  systems agreements and service fees 
systems agreements with the company s customers include the delivery of the company s proprietary software with the computer hardware and software of third parties 
service fees include fees for maintenance  training and consulting services related to the company s proprietary software  as well as sales of the company s proprietary software which is not bundled with hardware or software of third parties 
the company recongizes revenue consistent with the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position no 
revenues decreased in fiscal  and decreased in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to decreased sales of system upgrades to existing customers 
the decrease in system sales was the result of several factors  including increased competitive pressures  an overall decline in both the cost and resale price of hardware which the company resold to customers  a decline in sales force productivity due to reorganization of the sales force  and a temporary  unforseen complexity in the installation process of certain advanced features of the company s latest product releases 
costs of systems revenues costs of systems revenues include costs of computer hardware and third party software  along with costs associated with the purchase and installation of hardware and software products  and the amortization of capitalized software development costs 
costs of systems revenues  as a percentage of systems revenues  were  and in fiscal   and  respectively 
changes in the percentage of costs of systems expressed as a percentage of revenues are primarily a result of a changing mix of products sold by the company and a decline in margin on the resale of third party hardware 
costs of service revenues costs of service revenues include costs associated with maintenance  consulting and training services  and payments made to third party hardware maintenance vendors 
costs of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues were  and in fiscal   and  respectively 
in fiscal the increase was primarily due to short term non variability of the largest component of costs of services revenues  namely direct labor  during a period when service revenues were declining 
in fiscal  an increase in sales of the company s proprietary software which was not bundled with third party hardware increased service revenues and decreased costs of service revenues expressed as a percentage of service revenues 
product development expenses product development expenses  net of capitalized software costs  were   and  in fiscal   and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal is primarily the result of increased capitalization of software due to increased outside consulting expenditures for new product development 
the increase in fiscal is primarily a result of a decrease in the amount of development spending capitalized due to a greater relative proportion of spending in product research  combined with an increase in spending levels 
product development expenditures  including those which were capitalized  were   and  respectively  in fiscal years   and sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses decreased in fiscal  compared to a decrease of in fiscal the decrease in fiscal is primarily due to a reduction in the sales force headcount 
the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to a one time charge in associated with the elimination and consolidation of certain expenses 
the company capitalizes software development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 and amortizes these costs through cost of systems revenues over a maximum of five years 
the amount capitalized varies each period depending on how many software development projects have reached technological feasibility and whether they are in general release 
the company strongly believes in the importance of maintaining its technological strengths and will continue to invest substantial amounts in software development 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal  and increased in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to a reduction in headcount and overall spending reductions  partially offset by severance and relocation costs for certain company personnel 
the increase in fiscal was primarily due to increased general and administrative expenses as a result of the december   acquisitions of mountain states and insurnet  as well as severance costs for certain company officers in fiscal amortization of goodwill  customer lists and noncompete agreements goodwill and noncompete agreements are costs from the acquisitions of insurnet and mountain states in december  and other acquisitions since fiscal amortization expense decreased in fiscal  compared to an increase of in fiscal the decrease in fiscal is the result of some assets becoming fully amortized in the current year 
the increase in the prior fiscal year is attributable to the insurnet and mountain states acquisitions in december the company follows a policy of periodic evaluation of the carrying value of its intangible assets 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements of the company 
interest expense the company had interest expense of  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was due to decreased average borrowings compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase in fiscal was due to higher interest rates 
income tax provision the effective tax rates under sfas no 
for fiscal years   and  were  and  respectively 
lower than statutory effective tax rates and tax benefits are due to the operating losses 
due to the company s recurring losses  net operating loss carryforwards have been generated for income tax purposes 
the company continues to provide a valuation allowance against this and all other net deferred tax assets  thus no income tax benefit has been recorded 
the tax provision relates to certain state and foreign income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources working capital was a negative  at march   compared to a negative  at march  the working capital deficit increased during fiscal as the result of a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets due to the amortization and write off of the short term portion of noncompete agreements and an increase in deferred revenue due to a change in the customer support billing cycle from monthly to quarterly 
the company s negative net working capital position is primarily a result of deferred revenues of  at march   representing prepaid maintenance fees from its customers which are recognized as revenue ratably over the maintenance agreement terms 
this liability is satisfied through normal ongoing operations of the company s service organization and does not require a payment to a third party 
net cash provided by operating activities was   and  for fiscal years ended in   and  respectively 
although the company reported a net loss in fiscal years and  cash provided by operating activities was positive because a substantial portion of the loss was related to non cash items  including the amortization of goodwill and capitalized software and the consolidation  repositioning and restructuring charge 
cash used in investing activities was   and  for the fiscal years ended   and  respectively

it also restricted certain activities of the company without the approval of the bank  including the incurrence of senior debt  mergers and acquisitions  and the payment of dividends 
the interest rate on the line of credit was prime plus 
at march    remained available for borrowing under the line of credit 
the company is currently in active negotiations to replace the expired line of credit
