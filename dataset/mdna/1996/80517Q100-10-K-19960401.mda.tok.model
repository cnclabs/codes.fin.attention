btg manages its israeli operations with the objective of protecting against any material net financial loss in us dollars from the impact of israeli inflation and currency devaluations on its non us dollar assets and liabilities 
the bank of israel s monetary policy is to manage the exchange rate while allowing the consumer price index to rise by approximately in  in and in for those expenses linked to the israeli shekel  such as salaries and rent  this resulted in corresponding increases in these costs in us dollars 
in  and  the shekel was devalued by approximately  and  respectively  against the us dollar 
as a result of the devaluations of the shekel and modest increases in cost of living adjustments in shekel salaries in  btg s costs of local goods and services in israel measured in us dollars remained relatively constant in despite the rise in the consumer price index 
however  because of the insignificant devaluation of the shekel against the us dollar despite the and annual rate of increase in the consumer price index during and  respectively  btg s costs of local goods and services  to the extent linked in whole or in part to the consumer price index  increased in us dollar terms in and to the extent that expenses in shekels exceed btg s revenues in shekels which to date have consisted primarily of research funding from the chief scientist and sales of bio tropin and biolon in israel  the devaluations of israeli currency have been and will continue to be a benefit to btg s financial condition 
however  should btg s revenues in shekels exceed its expenses in shekels in any material respect  the devaluation of the shekel will adversely affect btg s financial condition

there can be no assurance that the government of israel will continue to devalue the shekel from time to time to offset the effects of inflation in israel

the company conducted research  development and clinical testing of these products on behalf of bio cardia  had the exclusive option  during the period the stock purchase option was outstanding with respect to each product  to commercialize  directly or through others  such product  and was obligated to supply bio cardia with all its requirements for such products 
bio cardia and the company had originally budgeted approximately million of the net proceeds of the offering less if the stock purchase option was exercised prior to january  to fund development and commercialization of the products licensed to bio cardia over a period of four years and to reimburse btg for previously incurred research and development expenses 
however  holders of units failed to make the required july  payment of  per unit  which resulted in bio cardia being unable to pay approximately  of the  in reimbursement of previously incurred research and development expenses and approximately  of the  of development costs due btg during the three months ended september  under the research and development agreement 
in october  bio cardia reached settlements with certain of the defaulting stockholders  holding an aggregate of units  who surrendered to bio cardia their bio cardia stock and warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of btg common stock in exchange for a release from their future funding obligations to bio cardia

at december   bio cardia owed btg approximately  for research and development performed by btg on behalf of bio cardia during and the company did not recognize as revenues the amounts due from bio cardia during the second half of or during the company funded a revised research and development budget for in addition  in may  bio cardia  with the company s consent  completed an exchange offer with all those bio cardia stockholders who were not in default under their investor note  who held an aggregate of units  including holders of three units against which bio cardia commenced litigation the exchange offer

the company reacquired from bio cardia all rights to the products licensed to bio cardia in december see results of operations and item business contract research and development bio cardia corporation 
a number of the company s products are in the process of gaining approval from various governmental agencies 
while costs associated with this process are generally borne by the company s collaborative partners  the approval processes have been considerably longer than the company expected  thereby resulting in delays in revenues until such product approvals have been obtained 
as a result  the company has had to continue to finance its operations through debt and equity offerings and collaborative research arrangements that provided research funding 
the company believes that these delays have negatively impacted the company s ability to attract funding and that  as a result  the terms of such financings were less favorable to the company than they might otherwise have been had the company s product revenues provided sufficient funds to finance the large costs of taking a product from discovery through commercialization 
as a result  the company has had to license the commercialization of many of its products to third parties in exchange for research funding and royalties on product sales  this will result in lower revenues than if the company had commercialized the product on its own 
the company believes that its remaining cash resources as of december   together with anticipated product sales  scheduled payments to be made to btg under its current agreements with pharmaceutical partners and third parties  the proceeds from sales of equity and continued funding from the chief scientist at current levels  will be sufficient to fund the company s ongoing operations at least until the end of there can  however  be no assurance that product sales will occur as anticipated  that scheduled payments will be made by third parties  that current agreements will not be canceled  that the chief scientist will continue to provide funding at current levels  or that unanticipated events requiring the expenditure of funds will not occur 
the satisfaction of the company s future cash requirements will depend in large part on the status of commercialization of the company s products  the company s ability to enter into additional research and development and licensing arrangements  and the company s ability to obtain additional equity investments  if necessary 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain additional funds or  if such funds are available  that such funding will be on favorable terms 
in addition  the indentures under which the company s debt securities were issued limit the ability of the company to satisfy its cash requirements through borrowings or the issuance of debt securities  and prohibit the sale of equity securities at a price per share of less than as adjusted under certain circumstances 
the company continues to seek additional collaborative research and development and licensing arrangements  in order to provide revenue from sales of certain products and funding for a portion of the research and development expenses relating to the products covered  although there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such agreements
