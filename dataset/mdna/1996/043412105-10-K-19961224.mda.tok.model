item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the distribution of products such as those offered by the company has been characterized by rapid change  including consolidations and financial difficulties of distributors and the emergence of alternative distribution channels 
in addition  there are an increasing number of product suppliers competing for access to these channels 
distributors may  at their option and at any time  cease marketing the company s products without prior notice to the company 
a reduction in the sales effort by any of the company s major distributors or the loss of any one of these distributors would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that future sales by the company s distributors will remain at current levels or that the company will be able to retain its current distributors on terms that are commercially reasonable to the company 
although the company believes that its major distributors are currently adequately capitalized  there can be no assurance that in the future one or more of these distributors will not experience financial difficulties 
such difficulties could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in fiscal  the company changed its limited warranty policy to cover all products for the life of the product 
the company has not encountered material warranty claims  although there can be no assurance that claims will not increase substantially over time as a result of the change to a lifetime warranty 
future warranty claims exceeding the company s reserves for warranty expense could have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
rights under company warranties is limited to the company s rights to repair or replace the defective product 
the company attempts to further limit its liability to end users through disclaimers of special  consequential and indirect damages and similar provisions in its end user warranty 
however  no assurance can be given that such limitations of liability will be legally enforceable 
backlog the company generally ships products shortly after orders are received and consequently maintains very little backlog 
accordingly  the company does not believe that its backlog as of any particular date is indicative of future sales 
engineering and product development the markets for the company s client access and network system products continue to be characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
asante believes that maintaining its position in the macintosh connectivity market and expanding its presence in the ibm pc compatible market requires continuing investment to develop new products  enhance existing products and reduce manufacturing costs 
as of september   the company had employees engaged in engineering and product development 
during the fiscal years ended september   september   and september   the company s engineering and product development expenses were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the company s believes its future success will depend upon its ability to enhance and expand its existing product offerings and to develop in a timely manner new products that achieve rapid market acceptance 
substantially all of the company s products are designed to provide connectivity to ethernet lans 
if the company is unable for technological or other reasons to modify its products or develop new products to support fast ethernet or switched ethernet technology  or if ethernet s importance declines as a result of alternative technologies  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing enhanced or new products in a timely manner  that those products will gain market acceptance  or that the company will be able to respond effectively to technological changes or new industry standards 
manufacturing and suppliers the company s manufacturing operations consist primarily of managing its materials and inventories  purchasing certain components  performing limited final assembly of some products and testing and performing quality control of certain materials  components  subassemblies and systems 
the company does not manufacture any of the materials or components used in its products  and performs only limited assembly of some products 
the company subcontracts substantially all of the assembly of its products through a related party  orient semiconductor electronics  ltd 
ose  a semiconductor and printed circuit board assembler based in taiwan  and through several other subcontractors and manufacturers based in california and taiwan 
the company believes that its quality control procedures and the quality standards of its manufacturing partners have been instrumental in the high performance and reliability of the company s products 
to date  customer returns of the company s products due to poor workmanship have not been material 
see note of notes to financial statements 
ose and the company s other subcontract manufacturers purchase or manufacture most components  assemble printed circuit boards  and test and package products for asante on a purchase order  turnkey basis 
in fiscal  the company purchased million of goods from ose 
the company does not have a long term supply agreement with any of its subcontractors 
if any one of these subcontractors experience financial or operational difficulties that result in a reduction or interruption in the supply of products to the company  or otherwise fail to deliver products to the company on a timely basis  the company would be required to procure sufficient manufacturing supply through alternative sources 
the company believes that alternative manufacturers are available  however  the qualification of such alternative sources and the commencement of volume manufacturing of the company s products could take a significant period of time 
accordingly  any reduction or interruption of supply from its existing subcontractors would materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the use of ose and other offshore subcontractors subjects the company to certain risks of conducting business internationally  including changes in trade policy and regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers and restrictions  and changes in the political or economic environment in taiwan 
although the company generally uses standard parts and components for its products  certain key components used in the company s products are available from only one source and others are available from only a limited number of sources 
components currently available from only one source include  among others  custom integrated circuits used in the company s intelligent hubs 
the company does not have a long term supply agreement with any of its suppliers 
the company believes that certain key components remain in short supply  and from time to time receives only limited allocations of these products which in prior years has caused shipping delays of one or more of the company s products 
if the company or any of its suppliers experience component shortages in the future or any of its competitors have long term supply agreements under which it is possible for them to obtain greater supplies of such components than the company  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
the company also relies on ose and subcontractors to procure many of the components used in the company s products 
procurement and stocking of components and subassemblies is done by these subcontractors based on the company s purchase orders 
if the company  ose or other subcontractors are unable to obtain sufficient supplies of components or develop alternative sources  delays or reductions in product shipments could result  which would materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations and damage the company s relationships with its customers 
competition the markets for the company s products are highly competitive  and the company believes that such competition will intensify 
competitive factors in the company s markets are continuing declines in average selling prices  coupled with improvements in product features and performance 
the company expects such trends will continue 
in the mainstream market  the company competes with cisco systems  bay networks  com  and many smaller companies 
competition from these and other companies  including new entrants  is expected to intensify  particularly in the departmental users market 
many of the company s competitors in this market are more established  enjoy significant name recognition and possess far greater financial  technological and marketing resources than the company 
the company believes the principal competitive factors in the departmental connectivity market are brand name recognition  value for price  breadth of product line  technical features  ease of product use  reliability  customer support and the ability to develop and introduce new or enhanced products rapidly 
the company believes that it currently competes favorably with respect to these factors 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future against current or future competitors  or that it will be able to adapt successfully to changes in the market for its products 
the company s inability to compete successfully in any respect or to timely respond to market demands or changes would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the macintosh client access market  apple develops and markets products that compete directly with certain of the company s client access products 
the company also competes with a number of other companies in this market 
apple provides ethernet connectivity in its computers which has adversely affected sales of the company s client access products 
the company also relies on an informal working relationship with apple in connection with the company s product development efforts 
apple is likely to continue to introduce competitive products  and has significantly greater financial  marketing and technical resources than the company 
furthermore  no assurance can be given that apple will not pursue a more aggressive strategy with respect to competitive products  increase the availability of ethernet on the motherboard of its computers or in other ways attempt to make the sale of add on products by third party developers and vendors such as the company more difficult 
if apple takes any of such actions  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company expects that a growing portion of the company s sales will represent products sold to oems 
while the company s oem sales were previously made to smaller oems  the company has recently pursued  and will continue to pursue  additional oem agreements with larger companies 
there can be no assurance that existing oem agreements will continue or that new agreements will be attained 
in addition  since the company intends to seek additional large product volume arrangements  the loss of a single large oem customer or several smaller oem customers would have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues 
a significant percentage of the company s sales in fiscal were derived from products designed for use with macintosh computers 
sales of these products as a percentage of total company revenue have steadily declined over the last several years due to apple s competition in the company s adapter card market and apple s decline in market share 
however the company expects that sales of such products will continue to represent a substantial portion of its net sales for the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance that unit sales of these products will continue at their present levels or increase in the future 
any material adverse developments in apple s business could have a material adverse effect on sales of the company s client access products  which would materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
proprietary rights the company has received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties asserting intellectual property claims against the company 
for example  a claim made against the company by bay networks formerly synoptics communications in fiscal required the company to devote significant resources to defend against the claim 
claims made in the future could include assertions that the company s products infringe  or may infringe  the proprietary rights of third parties or requests for indemnification against such infringement 
there can be no assurance that any claim will not result in litigation  which could involve significant expense to the company 
if the company is required or deems it appropriate to obtain a license relating to one or more products or future technologies  there can be no assurance that the company would be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
the company relies on a combination of trade secret  copyright and trademark law  nondisclosure agreements and technical measures to establish and protect its proprietary rights in its products 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of the company s products or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of the company s technology is difficult  and there can be no assurance that the measures being taken by the company will be successful 
moreover  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s proprietary rights in its products to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
see item legal proceedings 
employees as of september   the company had employees  including in engineering and product development  in manufacturing operations  in marketing  sales and support services  and in corporate administration 
during fiscal  the company appointed a new chief financial officer and a new vice president of sales 
the company s future success will depend on the effectiveness of its executive officers in their new roles 
in november  the company appointed a new vice president of engineering 
the company s success also depends to a significant extent upon the contributions of other key sales  marketing  engineering and manufacturing employees  and on the company s ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel  who are in great demand 
none of the company s key employees is subject to a non competition agreement with the company 
unless vacancies are promptly filled  the loss of current key employees or the company s inability to attract and retain other qualified employees in the future could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
none of the company s employees is represented by a labor organization  and the company is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement 
the company has never had any employee strike or work stoppage and considers its relations with its employees to be good 
item properties the company s headquarters  including its executive offices and corporate administration  manufacturing  marketing  sales and technical support facilities  are located in san jose  california 
the company occupies this facility under a lease that expires in september and provides for two options to extend the lease for up to an additional two and five years  respectively  during fiscal  the company exercised its option to extend the lease for an additional two years 
the company leases sales offices in southern california  colorado  north carolina  utah  washington  taiwan  england and japan 
the company believes that its existing facilities are adequate to meet its requirements for the foreseeable future and that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed

item legal proceedings in november  the company reached an agreement with synoptics communications  inc now bay networks  inc 
to settle the complaint brought by synoptics against the company for patent and copyright infringement  and misappropriation of trade secrets 
the terms of the settlement did not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in july and august of  several complaints were filed against the company and certain of its current and former officers and directors in the united states district court  northern district of california  alleging violations of federal securities laws 
the lawsuits  which purport to be class actions brought on behalf of all purchasers of the company s stock during the period from december  through july   were consolidated and plaintiffs filed a consolidated  amended class action complaint on october  in september  the company entered into an agreement in principle to settle the suit with the establishment of a settlement fund of million 
the company contributed  with the remainder funded by the company s insurance 
on november   the court entered an order finally approving the settlement and dismissing the action against all defendants with prejudice 
see note of notes to financial statements

factors such as announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company  its competitors and other third parties as well as quarterly variations in the company s anticipated or actual results of operations and market conditions in high technology industries generally  may cause the market price of the company s common stock to fluctuate significantly 
in addition  the stock market has on occasion experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices of many high technology companies and have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock

results of operations the following table sets forth certain selected financial information expressed as a percentage of net sales for the fiscal years ended september   and september  and  respectively net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total operating expenses income loss from operations interest and other income expense  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss the company recorded a net loss for fiscal of million  or per share compared to a net loss of million  or per share  in fiscal net sales net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in net sales were million in the increase in sales from to was due primarily to increased shipments of the company s fast ethernet and new switched products as well as its stackable and unmanaged hubs 
this increase was partially offset by competitive pricing pressures and reduced shipments of the company s t mbps adapter cards due in part to apple s incorporation of ethernet connectivity into the motherboard of certain of its macintosh and powerbook computers 
sales of network systems products increased from approximately million in to million in due primarily to shipments of fast ethernet shared systems and the introduction of switching products into asante s product line 
client access product sales declined from approximately million in to million in  or 
client access products are expected to constitute a smaller portion of the company s total sales in the future 
during fiscal  the company expanded its line of fast ethernet base t  or mbps products and introduced new software technology to complement the fast ethernet product line 
the company increased its sales force and devoted additional resources to its research and development projects 
the company continued to focus its efforts on certain vertical market segments where fast ethernet systems excel over standard ethernet systems and concentrated on expanding its non macintosh market incrementally 
pricing continued to be under heavy competitive pressure and  in response  the company continued a number of programs including discount programs  value added reseller programs  selling incentives  educational specific discounts  and announced several product price reductions during the year 
the decrease in sales from to was primarily due to a continuation of the competitive pressures including apple computer s incorporation of ethernet connectivity into the motherboard of certain of its macintosh and powerbook computers 
in addition to this and to competitive pressures leading to a continuing reduction in the average selling price of certain of the company s products  the company experienced a decrease in sales 
international sales  primarily to customers in europe  canada and asia pacific  accounted for   and of net sales in fiscal   and  respectively 
in the third quarter of  the company established a sales office in japan  complementing its other international sales offices in the united kingdom  taiwan  and canada 
despite this increased presence internationally  the company experienced reductions in sales into europe caused primarily by certain new product certification regulations that delayed the company s ability to ship certain of its products into europe in the second quarter of the year 
as standards continue to evolve in europe  the company will be required to meet new specifications to allow for prompt delivery of products 
the company will continue to focus its efforts on increasing sales internationally over the next several quarters  but cannot be sure that its efforts will be successful 
the company believes that the competition in the markets in which it competes has intensified and will continue to intensify as existing and potential competitors introduce competing products 
as such  the company anticipates that the selling prices of its products will continue to decline 
the company makes significant ongoing efforts to decrease its manufacturing costs faster than related declines in selling prices 
if the company is unable to offset anticipated price declines in its products by reducing its manufacturing costs and by introducing new products that gain market acceptance  its business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected 
gross profit the company s gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal from in  and in this increase during fiscal was due primarily to improved management of production cycles and distribution channel inventory balances 
the company s gross profit percentage increase was partially offset during the year by charges against sales due to various pricing and marketing programs 
the company s gross profit percentage in the future will continue to be affected by competitive pricing pressures  the company s ability to further reduce the cost of its products  and the company s pursuit of certain oem sales opportunities at lower margins 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales from to was attributable to several factors including declines in the demand for certain of the company s products 
as a result  additional reserves for inventory obsolescence were made  resulting in a charge to cost of sales of approximately million in additional factors affecting the gross profit was a charge of million related to previously purchased technology  charges related to price protection activity  and sales during the first half of of million of slow moving products at cost 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in the expenses decreased by from million in as a percentage of net sales  sales and marketing expenses were   and in fiscal years   and  respectively 
in the fourth quarter of  the company increased its direct field staff organization in order to focus its sales strategy on penetrating the ibm compatible market in order to gain market share 
as a result of the additional sales personnel and additional vertical market and pc related marketing programs  the sales and marketing related spending level in was higher in absolute dollars 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses from to was primarily attributable to lower advertising costs  lower salary expense due to reduced headcount  and lower commissions due to lower net sales 
the company expects that its sales and marketing expenses will increase slightly in research and development research and development expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal research and development expenses were million in as a percentage of net sales  research and development expenses were  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the million increase in expenses from to resulted from the company s decision to increase its research and development effort in order to bring more fast ethernet base t  or mbps  switching  and software products to market 
as a result  salaries and wages increased by million due to an increase in engineering personnel  non recurring engineering expense charges increased by million  and other expenses  including spending for prototype materials  equipment purchases  and outside engineering consulting services  increased by approximately million 
research and development expenses decreased by million from to due primarily to the company s efforts to consolidate engineering projects and reduce operating expenses 
the company expects that spending on research and development will increase in the future in order to support the development of new products incorporating the fast ethernet standard  switching technology  and cost reduction efforts pertaining to current products 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal general and administrative expenses were million in as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses were   and in fiscal years   and  respectively 
the decrease in administrative expenses in was primarily due to the settlement and reduction in related defense litigation costs associated with the stockholders class action suit see note of notes to financial statements and lower salary and other wage related expenses due to company s effort to control expenses 
the increase in general and administrative expenses from to was related primarily to litigation costs in connection with the aforementioned stockholders class action suit  a one time charge related to state sales tax audits  and increased consulting for services previously performed by former employees 
the company expects that general and administrative expenses will increase slightly in income taxes the company has accounted for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  for all periods 
under this method  deferred assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
in  the company incurred a loss before income taxes of approximately  resulting in an income tax benefit tax loss carryback of  the company has not recorded a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets because management believes that it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will be realized 
realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income 
the amount of deferred tax assets expected to be realized could be reduced in the near term  resulting in a charge to net income  if estimates of future taxable income in the carryforward period are reduced 
factors affecting future operating results the company generally attempts to maintain very little backlog and to ship products shortly after orders are received 
most of the company s net sales in any quarter therefore result from orders booked during that quarter 
the company commits to spending levels  including investing in advertising and promotional programs  based in part on expectations as to future net sales 
if future net sales levels in a particular quarter do not meet the company s expectations or the company does not bring new products timely to market  the company s operating results will be adversely affected 
furthermore  although the company was profitable in the fourth quarter of  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
in  a coalition of more than one hundred companies including asante supplying adapters  hubs  and other networking equipment developed a new standard for increasing the data transmission speed over ethernet networks by ten fold 
this new standard base t  or fast ethernet is expected to be adopted widely by end user customers because of its ability to increase the efficiency of lans and because of its ease of integration into existing base t networks 
because of the importance of this new standard  the company recently focused its research and development activities on introducing future products incorporating base t technology 
the company realizes the importance of bringing more base t mbps switching and base t switching to market in order to complement its existing base t shared products 
in that regard  the company s future operating results may be dependent on the market acceptance and the rate of adoption of this new technology 
the company s net sales and operating results in any particular quarter may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including competition in the markets for the company s products  delays in new product introductions by the company  market acceptance of new products incorporating base t by the company or its competitors  changes in product pricing  material costs or customer discounts  the size and timing of customer orders  distributor and end user purchasing cycles  variations in the mix of product sales  manufacturing delays or disruptions in sources of supply  general economic conditions  and economic conditions and seasonal purchasing patterns specific to the computer and networking industries 
liquidity and capital resources during  the company s operating activities provided cash of million compared to net cash provided of million in in  operating activities used cash of million which was provided by proceeds from the company s initial public offering 
during  the increase in cash resulted from the increase in accounts payable and decrease in income tax receivable resulting from a loss carryback and was partially offset by the increase in accounts receivable  inventory  and the reduction in accounts payable to a major stockholder 
the increase in cash provided from operations in was due to a decrease in accounts receivable  net of allowances for receivable accounts of approximately million 
days of sales outstanding decreased to at the end of fiscal compared to at the end of net cash provided by investing activities was million in fiscal which consisted primarily of net maturities of marketable securities of million  offset by other investment activities including purchases of property and equipment totaling approximately million 
the company s purchasing activities consisted primarily of investments in computers and related equipment used in the company s operations 
during fiscal   and  the company s purchases of property and equipment totaled million  
million  and million  respectively 
net cash generated from financing activities for fiscal was million including proceeds of approximately million from the exercise of employee stock options  and offset by other financing activities 
in  the company generated cash from financing activities of million including proceeds of approximately million from the exercise of employee stock options 
in fiscal the company generated net cash from financing activities of million including proceeds from the company s initial public offering  proceeds from stock option exercises of million  and was offset by net repayments under the company s line of credit amounting to approximately million dollars 
at september   the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million as compared to million at september  working capital was million at september   compared to million at september  the company has a bank line of credit that provides for maximum borrowings of million  limited to a certain percentage of eligible accounts receivable  and bears interest at the bank s base rate plus 
the company s ability to borrow under this line is subject to compliance with covenants related to financial performance and condition 
the line of credit expires on february  as of september  there were no borrowings under the line of credit  and the company was not in compliance with a certain financial covenant 
the company has received a waiver from its bank for the noncompliance with this covenant for fiscal the company believes that its current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with cash expected to be generated by operations and existing credit facilities  will be sufficient to fund its operations and meet capital requirements through fiscal however  if additional funds are required there can be no assurance that such funds will be available at all or on terms favorable to the company and its stockholders
