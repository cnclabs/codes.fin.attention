however  total sales increased by over fiscal an analysis of sales for the two years is shown under business sales and marketing 
the increase in cost of sales was due primarily to the increase of the inventory reserve

in connection with this decision  the company recorded an inventory reserve of million in the second quarter 
at the end of the third quarter  the inventory reserve was increased by a further  lastly  at year end  after further prudent examination of both raw material and finished goods inventories  the reserve was increased by an additional million 
apart from the decision to discontinue the women s and kid s lines  the conversion to the new mis software resulted in significant problems in the area of forecasting and production scheduling 
this resulted in an excess of finished goods being produced for the spring and summer seasons 
management believes such excess inventory can be disposed of through the company s outlet stores 
the mis conversion is now completed  and the company is better equipped to monitor inventory levels through better forecasting and production scheduling 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to of net sales compared to in fiscal the dollar amount increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal much of this increase can be attributed to cost increases associated with increased sales volume

liquidity and capital resources the company s need for working capital is seasonal with the greatest requirements from approximately october through the end of april each year 
the inventory buildup during this period is to provide product for shipment for the primary spring summer selling season 
working capital requirements increase with sales growth  primarily because of the approximate two to four month gap between the time the company must pay its suppliers and production costs and the time the company receives payment from its customers 
however  management believes that cash from operations together with the bank line of credit will be sufficient to meet the company s working capital requirements through fiscal operating activities in produced a negative cash flow of  compared to a negative cash flow of  in the major portion of the increase in negative cash flow is attributed to the increase in inventory in fiscal as discussed above under results of operations  the inventory increase was primarily caused by an inability to accurately forecast sales and production needs during the conversion of the company s management information system 
management believes that the company can sell a substantial portion of the inventory surplus in its outlet stores in fiscal  converting such surplus to cash 
with the mis conversion now completed  management believes that  through control over the inventory  cash flows from operations will be improved 
in october  the company s working capital financing arrangement with its bank was extended through february   with a borrowing limit of  for eight months of the year and  for the period when inventory build up is at its peak 
this financing arrangement provides a revolving line of credit with interest at the bank s reference prime rate and is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the company 
the line of credit agreement contains certain financial covenants  the most restrictive of which require the company to maintain  as defined  a minimum tangible net worth  a maximum debt to equity ratio and a maximum ratio of cash and accounts receivable to current liabilities 
the company did not achieve the required minimum net income for its fourth quarter in  nor did it achieve the required quick ratio or tangible net worth amount for the year 
the bank has granted a waiver for these violations  and the company has agreed to pay a minimal fee and enter into an amended agreement 
the line of credit may also be used to finance up to million in commercial letters of credit and standby letters of credit 
at october   no standby letters or commercial letters of credit were outstanding on this line of credit 
as of october  and january   the company s outstanding balances under the line of credit were  and  respectively 
during fiscal the company invested  in personal property and equipment  primarily embroidery machines  outlet store fixtures and fittings  and computer equipment 
for fiscal the company has budgeted  for capital equipment acquisitions 
the expected additional equipment includes primarily embroidery machines  warehouse racks  and computer equipment 
management currently intends to use leases or other financing arrangements for the acquisition of much of its capital equipment 
if cash from operations and debt financing are either insufficient or not available  or if working capital requirements are greater than estimated  the company may be required to raise additional capital 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to successfully raise sufficient working capital to meet its requirements 
lack of sufficient working capital could have a material adverse effect upon the company  its business  and its ability to grow 
currency fluctuations ashworth uk  ltd  a wholly owned subsidiary in england  maintains its books of account in british pounds 
for consolidation purposes  the assets and liabilities of ashworth uk  ltd  are converted to uk dollars at the month end exchange rate 
a translation difference arises for share capital and retained earnings  which are converted at rates other than the month end rate  and this amount is transferred to current year earnings 
the difference was not material in fiscal all export sales by ashworth  inc are us dollar denominated  and ordinarily  there is no currency exchange rate problem for the company 
however  with respect to export sales to ashworth uk  ltd  that subsidiary may be at risk 
the subsidiary maintains its account with ashworth  inc  in british pounds  but owes ashworth  inc  in us dollars 
at the end of every accounting period  the debt is adjusted to pounds by multiplying the indebtedness by the closing dollar pound exchange rate to ensure that the account has sufficient pounds to meet its dollar obligation 
this adjustment is a loss or gain on currency transactions and is either income or an expense in the subsidiary s financial statement 
the company s management determined  therefore  to accept  additional shares of ashworth uk in satisfaction of   pounds of that subsidiary s indebtedness to the company 
this additional capitalization of ashworth uk in the form of cancellation of indebtedness reduced the exposure by at least half in months when indebtedness is high due to large shipments of product 
the company s purchases of some garments and shoes from off shore manufacturers are also us dollar denominated  consequently  there is no currency exchange rate problem for the company in connection with these purchases 
the company has not used derivative instruments or other arrangements to hedge against currency fluctuations
