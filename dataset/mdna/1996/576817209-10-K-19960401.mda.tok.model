item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of tokos 
general 
on march   tokos medical corporation tokos and healthdyne  inc healthdyne merged with and into matria healthcare  inc  a delaware corporation matria created solely for the purpose of the merger 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement and plan of merger  dated october   as amended  among tokos  healthdyne and matria  each share of common stock outstanding on march  of tokos and healthdyne was exchanged for one share of matria common stock 
matria issued approximately  shares of common stock to the former healthdyne shareholders and approximately  shares to tokos shareholders 
the merger will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and tokos will be deemed to be the acquiror since its shareholders received approximately of the newly issued shares of matria common stock 
matria s present operations and future prospects may be influenced by several factors  including developments in the healthcare industry  third party reimbursement policies and practices  and changes in regulatory requirements or the manner in which such requirements are enforced 
as a result of the increasing cost of health care in the united states and overall efforts to reduce or control government and corporate spending  government and third party payors are becoming increasingly focused on promoting cost effective healthcare services  and payors  in particular  have become more involved in decisions regarding diagnosis and treatment to ensure that care is delivered in a cost effective manner 
substantially all of matria s current revenues are derived directly from third party payors for services rendered to patients by matria 
the financial performance of all healthcare companies  including matria  could be adversely affected by the financial condition of certain governmental and private payors and by their continuing efforts to reduce healthcare costs by lowering reimbursement rates  increasing medical reviews of invoices for services and negotiating for reduced contract rates 
matria and its predecessor companies have responded to these developments by attempting to emphasize cost effective therapies and procedures  pre qualifying insurance coverage prior to the delivery of services and educating third party payors on the benefits of matria s home therapies 
although reduction in the reimbursement rates that matria receives for services rendered could have an adverse impact on matria  matria is hopeful that the overall cost effective nature of treatment in the home as compared to hospitalization  coupled with the potential benefits to be derived from prenatal care  will be recognized and encouraged by any new healthcare initiatives 
the trend within the healthcare industry to deliver quality healthcare services in a more cost effective manner has had an impact on matria s predecessor companies and is expected to continue to have an impact on matria 
driven by employers and third party payors  as well as by legislation and regulation  prices for services provided to patients  in general  are being reduced  cost effective preventative health care is being stressed and vertically integrated networks of care providers some of whom are accepting the insurance risk of providing care through capitation contracts with third party payors are being established 
matria anticipates that this trend will continue and is attempting to focus its efforts on services  some of which are offered in conjunction with third party payors  which it believes can benefit from this new environment 
there can be no assurance  however  that either additional changes or presently unforeseen consequences from this trend may not develop 
the following discussion of the results of operations and financial condition of tokos  as the acquiror in the merger  should be read in conjunction with consolidated financial statements and related notes of tokos and healthdyne incorporated into this annual report on form k for the year ended december  as filed with the securities and exchange commission the commission 
since neither the results of healthdyne are reflected in the following discussion  nor the synergies expected to be achieved from the merger  the historical results of operations and financial condition of tokos are not necessarily indicative of the results that will be achieved by matria during future periods 
results of operations 
for the year ended december  for the year ended december   tokos had net revenues of million and a net loss of million 
per share  compared with net revenues of million and a net loss of million 
per share for the preceding year 
of the million loss for  million 
per share resulted from a settlement with the plaintiffs in the class action securities suit entitled in re tokos medical corporation securities litigation 
the charge to income of million during the quarter ended june  is in addition to an aggregate amount of million which had been charged to general and administrative expenses in tokos agreed to settle the securities class action lawsuit to avoid further dilution of corporate resources  including management time and focus  as well as to avoid further legal costs and uncertainties associated with taking the case to trial 
the million decrease in net revenues  or  for from primarily resulted from a decrease in preterm labor management patient service days 
the decrease in preterm labor management patient service days resulted from reduced physician referrals and shorter average days on service per patient 
due to the increasing role of managed care entities in clinical decision making  tokos redirected its sales efforts in order to assist in a transition from a specialty homecare provider to a broader maternal newborn managed care organization 
the redirected sales efforts included more resources being focused on third party payor customers and initiatives and less on the physician driven business 
for example  as positions were vacated they were filled by individuals with more managed care experience 
other individuals were recruited to focus chiefly on leads for risk products  shared risk arrangements and multi product sales 
other employees were cross trained and moved from a physician focus to managed care 
with the merger  matria believes that it is important to continue efforts to develop new managed care initiatives  but also to continue the type of physician sales force efforts that have been successful for healthdyne 
revenues at matria will increase in as a result of the addition of healthdyne s revenues to the revenues of tokos healthdyne s revenues were million 
additional revenues are expected in from the marketing of a new product  the fetal fibronectin immunoassay  an in vitro diagnostic device used as an aid in assessing the risk of preterm delivery within to days from the time of sample collection in women with symptoms of preterm labor 
through a marketing agreement entered into by tokos in matria has exclusive rights to market this product in the united states and canada 
in september  the fda approved a pre market approval application for this product 
matria expects to begin marketing the product during the second quarter of cost of patient services at tokos increased to of net revenues for compared with of net revenues for although a decrease in absolute dollars was achieved through further consolidation of service sites and other cost reduction activities  revenue levels continued to decline at a faster rate than expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased million to million of net revenues for compared with million of net revenues for the decrease in absolute dollars primarily relates to expense reductions implemented by tokos due to the decline in its net revenues  in addition to a reduction in legal fees related to the settlement of the shareholder lawsuit 
excluding the amortization of the additional goodwill and other intangibles associated with the merger approximately million per year for five years  matria expects to achieve annualized cost savings from the combined costs of tokos and healthdyne of approximately million by primarily as a result of reductions of patient services center expenses in overlapping geographic locations  elimination of duplicate facilities including corporate headquarters  and synergies in staff and functional areas 
however  no assurance can be given that difficulties will not be encountered in integrating the operations of tokos and healthdyne or that the full benefits and attendant cost savings expected from such the integration will be realized or achieved in the expected time frame 
as a result of the merger  a large percentage of the assets reflected on matria s balance sheet will be intangible assets or goodwill as opposed to tangible assets such as cash  accounts receivable  inventory and equipment 
at december   on a pro forma basis reflecting consummation of the merger on that date  matria s total assets would have been approximately million  on which approximately million  or of total assets  would have been goodwill 
in addition  the amortization or any future write down of such goodwill by matria could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of matria 
tokos provided and matria will provide for estimated uncollectable accounts as revenues are recognized 
the provision for doubtful account as a percentage of net revenues was for compared with for the provision is adjusted periodically based upon the company s quarterly evaluation of historical collection experience  recoveries of amounts previously provided  industry reimbursement trends and other relevant factors 
therefore  the provision rate could vary on a quarterly basis 
research and development expenses at tokos were  for compared to million for this decrease primarily resulted from decisions to eliminate equipment development activities  and to significantly reduce its clinical research and systems development activities 
during  as tokos revenues continued to decline  specific decisions were made and communicated by management related to cost reduction efforts 
the cost reduction plan consisted of reductions in the workforce of approximately employees  comprised of personnel within information systems  reimbursement  administrative support and to a lesser extent clinical service  and termination of several facility leases 
in connection with these cost reduction activities  tokos incurred in  million in expenses 
million related to involuntary severance costs of affected employees   related to the consolidation of facilities and  in other related costs 
tokos recorded income tax expenses of  related to state franchise taxes in tokos recorded no federal and state income tax benefits in and the operating loss will be available to offset future taxable income  if any 
for the year ended december  net revenues at tokos decreased to million in compared with million in the decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from a decline in preterm labor management patient service days and a shift in patient service mix 
the decline in patient service days was primarily the result of reduced physician referrals and shorter average days on service per patient 
a shift in service mix to patients receiving less intensive preterm labor management services and other homecare services  which generate less revenue per patient day than higher intensive infusion therapies  also contributed to the revenue decline 
cost of patient services at tokos remained relatively constant as a percentage of net revenues at in compared with in the cost of patient services decreased million during in response to lower revenue levels 
general and administrative expenses at tokos increased as a percentage of net revenue to in compared with in general and administrative expenses decreased million during in response to expense reductions due to the decline in net revenues  however  since net revenues declined at a faster rate than expenses during and became a higher percentage of net revenues 
certain costs such as corporate facilities and essential administrative personnel  insurance and depreciation are relatively fixed by their nature and could not be reduced as quickly as revenue decreased 
tokos provided  and matria will provide  for estimated uncollectable accounts as revenues are recognized 
the provisions for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenues was reduced to in compared with in the percentage provision decreased in compared to primarily as a result of improved collections on revenues generated under contractual agreements and as a result of improved insurance clearance and billing processes 
the percentages of net revenue generated under contractual arrangements were in and in the provision rate was adjusted periodically based upon tokos quarterly evaluation of historical collection experience  recoveries of amounts previously provided  industry reimbursement trends and other relevant factors 
therefore  the provision rate could vary on a quarterly basis 
research and development expenses were million in compared with million in this decrease primarily resulted from tokos decision to eliminate all equipment development activities and reduce ongoing clinical research and systems development activities 
during the second and fourth quarters of  tokos board of directors approved plans to restructure operations in response to significant declines in revenue and the uncertainties surrounding the changing healthcare environments affecting the business 
tokos recorded restructuring charges totaling million in related to those decisions to restructure its operations by  among other things  reducing the number of its monitoring centers  centralizing patient intake and claims administration  reducing in house manufacturing and product development activities  and changing its strategy regarding support of certain patient service equipment and patient monitoring devices 
the restructuring charges included million in cash expenses  of which million related to involuntary severance costs of more than full and part time employees  million related to costs associated with the consolidation of certain administrative functions and monitoring sites  as well as reduction of manufacturing activities  and million related to other restructuring costs 
actual cash expenditures during totaled million  with the remaining million paid in during  million in restructuring charges were expended with a remaining accrual at december  of  the amounts expended include million related to involuntary severance costs and million related to costs associated with the consolidation of certain administrative functions and monitoring sites 
certain reclassifications of those amounts have been made within the restructuring categories from those previously reported  none of which are significant 
the impact of restructuring activities implemented during resulted in reductions of operating costs of approximately million in compared with tokos incurred  of income tax expense in compared with million in income tax expense recorded in resulted from provisions for state franchise taxes and for potential settlement of the examination by the internal revenue service irs for the   and tax years 
during  tokos recorded no federal and state income tax benefits 
liquidity and capital resources as of december  tokos had cash and short term investments of million and healthdyne had cash and short term investments of million 
net cash provided by operating activities at tokos was million for  compared with million for operating cash flow at tokos decreased in compared with primarily due to the increase in the net loss for the year 
net cash used by tokos in investing activities declined to million in from million in during  tokos purchased approximately of the physician owned companies for which it originally provided services for an aggregate purchase price of million consisting of cash of million and notes payable of million 
during late and tokos completed the purchase of approximately of those entities 
the notes issued in connection with these acquisitions aggregate million and have a balance outstanding of million at december  the remaining balances are to be paid at various times over the next one to four years 
in july  tokos reached a million settlement with the plaintiffs in a class action securities suit 
tokos has accrued an aggregate liability  net of insurance proceeds  of million for its portion of the settlement 
tokos has paid  cash with the remaining million payable by matria in cash or by the issuance of matria common stock in tokos made capital expenditures of approximately million during primarily for the purchases of computer and general office equipment used in its corporate offices and clinical sites of service 
such capital expenditures consisted of agreements to purchase equipment under capital lease obligations of  and cash purchases of million 
at december  tokos had no material commitments for capital expenditures and with the merger with healthdyne in  matria does not expect to have significant additions of capital expenditures in future periods 
payments of long term debt of million in were primarily payment of debt related to the acquisition of the physician owned companies  payment of amounts due to adeza biomedical corporation adeza  and payments of capital leases 
in  tokos acquired from adeza the exclusive rights to market adeza s fetal fibronectin immunoassay in the united states and canada pursuant to a marketing agreement 
in january  adeza received notification from the fda that its pre market approval pma application for fetal fibronectin immunoassay was accepted for filing and tokos paid adeza million of the remaining million outstanding obligation 
in october  adeza received final approval of its pma application and the remaining million was paid 
matria and adeza are currently engaged in discussions to effect modification to their marketing agreement 
adeza and matria have discussed a number of proposals that would resolve the outstanding contractual disagreements  but to date  the parties have not reached agreement on any of these proposals 
further  there can be no assurance that the negotiations currently underway will result in an agreement that satisfactorily resolves the outstanding issues between the matria and adeza 
moreover  failure to reach an agreement with adeza could have an adverse effect on the timing of the introduction by matria of fetal fibronectin into the market and matria s ability to derive revenues from sales of this product 
matria will incur substantial costs in connection with the merger 
these costs include i restructuring costs to be incurred by tokos of approximately million  consisting of million relating to severance costs of terminated employees  million of lease termination costs for duplicate facilities million for the write off of computer equipment and million for other merger related expenses  ii additional liabilities to be incurred by healthdyne as a result of the merger of approximately million  consisting of million relating to severance costs of terminated employees and  for patient service centers specifically identified to be closed  and iii transaction costs of approximately million  consisting of million for investment banking fees  million for legal and accounting fees and  for other costs such as document printing and mailing and filing fees 
additionally  matria may be required to make additional severance payments of approximately million in accordance with employment agreements with certain officers of tokos and healthdyne  and may be required to place in trust approximately million under a retirement benefit awards program for such officers 
matria believes that its current cash balances  including those acquired from healthdyne  and expected cash flows from operations and investing activities  along with amounts available under the million line of credit assumed from tokos will be sufficient to finance its current operations for at least the next twelve months 
this management s discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements including statements concerning expected increases in revenues arising from the merger  expected increased revenues arising from the marketing of fetal fibronectin immunoassay  expected synergies arising from the merger  the effect of goodwill on the company s results of operations  capital expenditures to be made in the future and the adequacy of matria s sources of cash to finance its current and future operations 
these forward looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
in addition to the factors discussed above  among other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following business conditions and growth in the home healthcare industry and the general economy  competitive factors  such as the possible entry of large diversified healthcare companies into the obstetrical home healthcare business  new technologies and pricing pressures  changes in third party reimbursement policies and practices and regulatory requirements applicable to the company s business  management decisions to pursue new product lines or lines of business which involve additional costs  risks or capital expenditures  and the risk factors listed from time to time in the company s sec reports  including but not limited to  this annual report on form k
