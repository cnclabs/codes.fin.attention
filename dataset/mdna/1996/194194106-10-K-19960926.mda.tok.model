sales of collagraft implant and collagraft strip to zimmer  inc totaled million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
fiscal represented the first full fiscal year of sales of collagraft bone graft products 
a number of uncertainties exist surrounding the marketing and distribution of contigen implant and collagraft bone graft products 
the company s primary means of distribution for these products is through third party firms  bard  in the case of contigen implant  and zimmer  in the case of collagraft bone graft products 
the company s business and financial results could be adversely affected in the event that either or both of these parties are unable to market the products effectively  anticipate customer demand accurately  or effectively manage industry wide pricing and cost containment pressures in health care 
other revenue

the final milestone payment of million was paid to the company on september  cost of sales 
cost of sales as a percentage of product sales averaged  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal over in cost of sales as a page percentage of product sales was primarily due to the inclusion of start up manufacturing costs of trilucent implant  which continues to be launched in additional countries 
unit cost of manufacturing for collagen based products was considerably higher in fiscal than in fiscal due to decreased production volumes  primarily of contigen implant 
the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of product sales in fiscal over was primarily due to increased product revenues resulting from income received from bard s direct sales of contigen implant to physician customers as well as the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates on international product sales in fiscal additionally  cost of sales reflected slightly lower unit costs due to increased production volumes in fiscal and  primarily from contigen implant 
due to the high fixed costs of the company s manufacturing facility  unit cost of manufacturing is expected to remain highly dependent on the level of output at the company s manufacturing facility  which is heavily dependent on production of contigen implant 
the company anticipates that overall unit costs will be lower in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of the expected resumption of contigen implant shipments to bard beginning in the third or fourth quarter of fiscal and the increased production volumes of trilucent implant 
in addition cost of sales as a percentage of sales is also contingent on the product mix of future sales for which demand and pricing characteristics may vary 
sg a 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing   and of product sales  respectively 
sg a expenses increased by million  or in fiscal over fiscal  primarily due to the operating results of lipomatrix and amortization resulting from the acquisition of lipomatrix 
additionally  higher united states advertising and public relation campaign expenses  costs of launching trilucent implant in europe  higher international spending related to an overall increase in sales and increased international infrastructure  contributed to this increase 
the million  or increase in fiscal over fiscal was primarily due to higher international sales and marketing spending  including the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 
the company expects sg a expenses in fiscal  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of product sales  to be at levels higher than those of fiscal  primarily due to the continued costs of launching trilucent implant in additional countries 
r d 
r d expenses  which include expenditures for regulatory compliance  were million of product sales in fiscal  million of product sales in fiscal  and million of product sales in fiscal the increase in r d spending in fiscal over was primarily attributable to r d spending incurred by lipomatrix  partially offset by completion of soft tissue programs and lower expenses related to iso certification

the decrease in fiscal over fiscal was due to lower average investment balances  partially offset by higher interest rates 
interest expense of  in fiscal was related primarily to borrowings under the million revolving credit facility and the million credit facility million swiss francs established by lipomatrix prior to its acquisition by the company 
see note of the consolidated financial statements 
interest expense of  in fiscal was related primarily to the revolving credit facility 
page income taxes 
the company s effective income tax rate was approximately for fiscal excluding the impact of the purchased in process research and development charges for which no tax benefit is available compared to for fiscal and for fiscal the effective tax rate in fiscal was higher than the statutory rate due primarily to state taxes  consolidated losses in foreign subsidiaries and increased write downs of certain equity investments for which no tax benefit is available currently 
the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal is due primarily to increased non deductible equity in losses of affiliates and investment reserves 
liquidity and capital resources at june   the company s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million compared to million at june  net cash used in operating activities was million for fiscal  compared with million of net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal for fiscal  the million of net cash used in operating activities was mainly attributable to million of estimated tax payments made during the year  of which a significant portion was related to estimated taxes due on the sales of target stock 
net cash provided by investing and financing activities of approximately million was primarily due to a pre tax gain of approximately million million proceeds less cost basis of million from the sale of  shares of common stock of target by the company during fiscal  million received from credit facilities  and million from the issuance of approximately  shares of the company s common stock  partially offset by the net payments of approximately million for the acquisition of lipomatrix  payments of approximately million for additional investments in and loans to affiliates  payments of approximately million to repurchase  shares of the company s common stock at an average acquisition price of approximately per share  payment of million made to biomatrix for the distribution rights to market hylaform viscoelastic gel  capital expenditures of approximately million  net payments of million made to increase the company s ownership in cohesion corporation from to approximately  and the payments of aggregate cash dividends of approximately million to the company s stockholders in july and january for fiscal year  the million of cash provided by operating activities was offset by million used to repurchase  shares of the company s common stock at an average acquisition price of approximately per share  million of additional investments in and loans to affiliate companies and the payments of aggregate cash dividends of approximately million to the company s stockholders in july and january the company anticipates capital expenditures  equity investments in  and loans to affiliate companies to be approximately million in fiscal in june  the board of directors authorized the company to repurchase an additional  shares of the company s common stock in the open market and declared a dividend of ten cents per share for stockholders of record as of june  the company s principal sources of liquidity include cash generated from operations  sales of target stock  and its cash  cash equivalents and short term investments

the company anticipates that stock sales pursuant to the authorization will be made from time to time  under sec rule  with the objective of generating cash  for  among other things  further investments in both current and new affiliate companies 
in addition  the company established a million revolving credit facility with a bank in november  which was subsequently increased to million in december as of june   million of this credit facility remained unused 
additionally  the company has a million million swiss francs credit facility that was established by lipomatrix prior to the company s acquisition of page lipomatrix  of which million million swiss francs remained unused as of june  the company believes that these sources should be adequate to fund its anticipated cash needs through at least the next twelve months 
factors that may affect future results of operations reliance on key products 
sales of the company s collagen based injectable products  zyderm i collagen implant and zyderm ii collagen implant collectively  zyderm implant and zyplast implant  as well as trilucent implant accounted for approximately of consolidated product sales for the fiscal year ended june  the company s product sales may continue to consist primarily of sales of these principal products 
factors such as adverse publicity  adverse rulings by regulatory authorities  product liability lawsuits  introduction of competitive products by third parties or other loss of market acceptance for these principal products may significantly and adversely affect the company s sales of these products  and as a result  also adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on marketing partners and third party distributors  effect of inventory fluctuations 
the company has entered into certain exclusive arrangements with bard for the marketing and distribution of the company s contigen implant product and with zimmer for the marketing and distribution of the collagraft bone graft products 
as a result  the company s revenues and earnings for these products depend substantially upon the continuing efforts of these marketing partners 
the company s business and financial condition could be adversely affected in the event that either or both of these parties do not effectively market the company s products  accurately anticipate customer demand or effectively manage industry wide pricing and cost containment pressures in health care 
the company s revenues and earnings fluctuate based upon the levels of orders placed by these parties  which are in turn affected by the levels of sales by these distributors and the levels of their inventories 
at june   bard had a significant inventory of contigen implant and as a result  took minimal shipments of such product during fiscal while future shipments to bard are expected to resume during fiscal  there can be no assurances that such actions will occur 
the failure to resume shipments of contigen implant to bard during fiscal and any significant decrease in purchases of collagraft bone graft products by zimmer could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
in addition  the company depends upon third party distributors to market its other products in a number of international markets 
difficulties in the company s relationship with these distributors and changes in distribution arrangements may adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
governmental regulation and adverse publicity 
the company s manufacturing activities and products sold in the united states are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the fda and by comparable agencies in certain foreign countries where these products are manufactured or distributed 
the fda regulates the manufacture  clinical research and sale of medical devices  including labeling  advertising and recordkeeping 
the company s primary products are classified as class iii medical devices  which require pre market approval from the fda 
while the company s other primary products have been approved for sale in the united states  trilucent implant is currently in clinical trials in the united states and  accordingly  has not been approved for domestic commercial sale 
medical products whose market applications have not yet been approved by the fda may only be exported with the specific approval of the fda 
there can be no assurance that the fda will choose to characterize future products as medical devices rather than drugs or biologics 
any such change in fda characterization would potentially lengthen and increase the cost of the approval process 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can  among other things  result in fines  suspensions of regulatory approvals  product recalls  seizure of products  operating restrictions  injunctions and criminal prosecution 
in addition  government regulations may be established that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of the company s products 
furthermore  compliance with current good manufacturing practices regulations is necessary to receive fda approval to market new products and to continue to market current products 
page the continuing trend of more stringent fda oversight in product clearance and enforcement activities has caused medical device manufacturers to experience longer approval cycles  more uncertainty  greater risk and higher expenses 
failure to obtain  or delays in obtaining  the required regulatory approvals for new products  particularly with respect to trilucent implant  could adversely affect the company as could product recalls 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the fda will give approval to the company to market its current products for broader or different applications  or that it will grant approval with respect to separate product applications which represent extensions of the company s basic technology  or that existing approvals will not be withdrawn 
further  changes in governmental reimbursement systems  pursuant to which hospitals and physicians are reimbursed for medical procedures at a fixed rate according to diagnosis related groups or other reimbursements  could have an economic impact on the purchase and use of medical devices 
a material decrease in current reimbursement levels for contigen implant and its application in the treatment of intrinsic sphincter deficiency isd could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the collagen used in the company s products is derived from cow hides 
bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse is a disease  initially reported in cattle in the united kingdom  characterized by degenerative lesions of the central nervous system 
the source of infections in animals derives from eating infected sheep derived feed 
the disease has been reported in european countries with less than one percent of cattle being affected 
the company is not aware of any reports of bse in united states cattle to date 
furthermore  united states cattle are not fed sheep derived protein and the united states prohibits all importation of british cattle 
all of the company s injectable collagen products are currently derived from the hides of united states cattle 
in response to the heightened awareness of bse in europe  the company currently uses closed herds that are controlled as to lineage  feed  and separation from other animals 
there can be no assurance that the various foreign or domestic regulatory authorities will not raise issues regarding bse or other matters which may adversely affect the company s ability to manufacture  market or sell its products 
in past years  the company has been the subject of legislative and regulatory investigations relating to  among other things  the safety and efficacy of its injectable collagen products 
there can be no assurance that legislative and regulatory investigations or negative publicity from such investigations or future investigations or from the news media will not result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  significant negative publicity could result in an increased number of product liability claims 
risk of investments in affiliates 
the company has made significant equity and debt investments in affiliated companies that are involved in the development of complementary or related technologies or products  and the company currently intends to continue to make significant additional investments from time to time in the future 
these affiliated companies typically are in an early stage of development and may be expected to incur substantial losses 
as a result  the company has recorded and expects to continue to record a share of the losses in such affiliates attributable to the company s ownership  which losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on the company s operating results 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that any investments in affiliates will result in any return nor as to the timing of such return  or that the company will not lose its entire investment 
effect of ownership interest in target 
as of june   the company owned approximately million shares of target common stock  representing approximately of the outstanding shares of target common stock valued at over million based on a market price of per share on such date 
the company s earnings have been significantly favorably affected in recent periods by revenues resulting from the sale of portions of the company s holdings in target 
the company has engaged in regular open market sales of its target common stock and expects to continue such sales 
the company s ownership of target may also be further reduced through additional equity offerings by target that dilute the company s ownership interest 
the market price of target s common stock is highly volatile and  as a medical device manufacture  target is subject to a number of the same factors affecting its operations as the company  as well as additional factors not applicable to the company 
readers are encouraged to review target s public filings for a page detailed understanding of the nature of target s business and the risk and uncertainties associated with it 
any significant downward fluctuation in the market price for target common stock could adversely impact the company s earnings due to lower returns per share on sales of such stock as well as the value of the company s total assets as stated on its balance sheet based on a lower carrying value for the target investment  which as of june   represented approximately of the value of the company s total assets 
competition 
the medical device industry is characterized by rapidly evolving technology and increasing competition 
at the present time there is a commercial product in the united states that is directly competitive with zyderm and zyplast implants  the company s collagen based products for cosmetic and reconstructive surgery 
this product is a gelatin based denatured collagen product for soft tissue augmentation presently being marketed in the united states and canada 
the company is also aware of one foreign company which is marketing internationally a the collagen based material for soft tissue augmentation 
in addition  several companies are engaged in research and development activities relating to the use of collagen and other biomaterials for the correction of soft tissue defects 
the company s injectable collagen products also compete in the dermatology and plastic surgery markets with substantially different alternative treatments  such as surgery and topical applications 
in addition  several companies and institutions are engaged in the development of collagen based and other materials  techniques  procedures and products for use in medical applications anticipated to be addressed by the company s contigen implant and collagraft bone graft products 
furthermore  several companies market mammary implants that do or will compete with the trilucent implant 
some of these companies and institutions may  and with respect to certain of the companies marketing products competitively trilucent implant certainly do  have substantially greater capital resources  research and development staffs and facilities  and experience in conducting clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approvals  and manufacturing and marketing products similar to those of the company 
these companies and institutions may represent significant long term competition for the company 
there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective than any which have been or may be developed by the company or that would render the company s technology and products obsolete or non competitive 
there can be no assurance that such potential competition will not have an adverse effect on the future business  financial condition or results of operations of the company 
certain of the company s collagen based products  including the zyderm implants  were manufactured and sold pursuant to an exclusive license from stanford university under a united states patent  which expired in april  covering the use of native  solubilized collagen for soft tissue augmentation 
the expiration of this patent may result in increased competition in the market for injectable collagen implants if and as other companies enter that market 
undeveloped and uncertain markets 
certain of the company s products  including those marketed by its marketing partners  are intended for use in new markets the size of which are difficult to independently verify 
in particular  the potential market for the company s contigen product is difficult to estimate because contigen implant represents a relatively new method of treatment  and the company believes that most sufferers of stress urinary incontinence do not seek medical treatment 
furthermore  contigen implant is marketed to urologists  whom the company believes generally are not the primary care physician for individuals seeking treatment for this disorder 
should the markets for such products be more limited than the company or its marketing partners currently estimate  or should the company  its distributors and or its marketing partners fail to penetrate such markets to the extent anticipated  the company may experience lower than anticipated revenues and a resulting adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
patents and proprietary technology 
the company depends substantially upon its proprietary technological expertise in the extraction  purification  and formulation of collagen based materials and other biomaterials into biomedical products 
the company seeks patents on inventions concerning novel manufacturing processes  compositions of matter  and applications for its proprietary biomaterials 
page patent related litigation is an increasing risk in the medical device industry 
there can be no assurance the company will be successful in the future in obtaining patents or license rights  that patents will be issued for the company s current patent applications  that the company will develop additional proprietary technology that is patentable  that any issued patents will provide the company with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties  or that patents of others will not have an adverse effect on the company 
there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar products  duplicate any of the company s products  or design around any patents used by the company 
no assurance can be given that the company s processes or products will not infringe patents or proprietary rights of others or that any licenses required under any such patents or proprietary rights would be made available on terms acceptable to the company 
if the company does not obtain such licenses  it could encounter delays in product introductions while it attempts to design around such patents  or it could find that the manufacture  sale or use of products requiring such licenses could be enjoined 
in addition  the company could incur substantial costs in defending itself in suits brought against the company on such patents or in bringing suits to protect the company s patents against infringement 
product liability  insurance 
the company is involved in various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business  the majority of which involve product liability claims 
while the outcome of such matters currently is not determinable it is management s opinion that these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s future consolidated financial position and results of operations 
the company faces an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims alleging that the use of the company s technology or products has resulted in adverse effects  particularly with respect to claims regarding trilucent implant  which is sold in a medical field breast reconstruction and augmentation in which there have been sizable product liability claims 
such risks will exist even with respect to those products that have received or in the future may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale 
there can be no assurance that the company will avoid significant product liability claims and attendant negative publicity 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that present insurance coverage will be adequate or that adequate insurance coverage will remain available at acceptable costs  if at all  or that a product liability claim or recall would not adversely affect the future business or financial condition of the company 
a successful claim brought against the company for which coverage is denied or in excess of its insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  adverse product liability actions could negatively affect the company s ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for its products 
in light of regulatory investigations surrounding product safety  the company announced in september that it would indemnify physicians against damages and legal fees arising from lawsuits brought to a jury trial alleging a link between the company injections and polymyositis and dermatomyositis 
to date  there has not been any impact of this indemnification on the company s results of operations 
there can be no assurance  however  that any future such claims would not have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
because the indemnification program has never been utilized  the company may discontinue the program in the future 
impact of currency fluctuations  importance of foreign sales 
approximately of the company s revenues in fiscal year came from its international operations 
because international sales of the company s products typically are denominated in local currencies  the company s results of operations have been and are expected to continue to be affected by changes in exchange rates between certain foreign currencies and the united states dollar 
although the effect of currency fluctuations on the company s operating results were positive during fiscal  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience unfavorable currency fluctuation effects in future periods  which could have an adverse effect on the company s operating results 
company s operations and financial results also may be significantly affected by other international factors  including changes in governmental regulations or import and export restrictions  and foreign economic and political conditions generally 
page limited diversity of facilities 
all of the company s manufacturing capacity for collagen products  the majority of its research and development activities  its corporate headquarters  and other critical business functions are located near major earthquake faults 
in addition  all of the company s manufacturing capacity for collagen based products and trilucent implant are located in two primary facilities one for collagen based products and one for trilucent implant  with the company currently maintaining only limited amounts of finished product inventory 
while the company has some limited protection in the form of disaster recovery programs and basic insurance coverage  the company s operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake  fire or other similar calamity  affecting its manufacturing facilities 
dependence on key personnel 
the company is dependent upon a limited number of key management and technical personnel  the loss of any one of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company s future success will depend in part upon its ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel 
the company competes for such personnel with other companies  academic institutions  government entities and other organizations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in hiring or retaining qualified personnel 
third party reimbursement 
certain of the company s products  including contigen implant  the collagraft bone graft products  and  in certain circumstances  trilucent implant are purchased by hospitals or physicians  which  in the united states  then bill various third party payors including medicare  medicaid and private insurers for the healthcare services provided to patients 
third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
there can be no assurance that the reimbursement of treatments using the company s products will not be subject to such challenges in the future 
the foregoing factors are not meant to represent an exhaustive list of the risks and uncertainties attendant to the company s business 
due to the factors noted above  as well as other factors that may affect the company s operating results  the company s future earnings and stock price may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
any shortfall in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock in any given period
