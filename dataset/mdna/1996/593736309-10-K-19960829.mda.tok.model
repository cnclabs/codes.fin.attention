provision for under performing restaurants in  the company recorded a non cash charge of  which principally related to six under performing restaurants operated by the company 
the charge included the write down of the investment in certain of the restaurants  estimated losses to be incurred upon the disposition of certain restaurants  and a loss incurred relating to the reacquisition of a restaurant from a franchisee 
the company anticipates that the disposition of the identified restaurants would have a modest impact on its overall future profitability  restaurant margins and liquidity 
no such charge was made in liquidity and capital resources during  the company s principal sources of cash were from operations totaling  principal payments received on notes receivable of  proceeds from the sale of restaurants of  and new borrowings  including borrowings under a bank line of credit for development of new restaurants  totalling  in addition  in connection with the company s acquisition of five restaurants from a franchisee  the company assumed existing indebtedness on the restaurants acquired of  the company s principal uses of cash in were for development of new restaurants and property renovations and additions totaling  and scheduled debt repayments and maturities of  cash and cash equivalents at may   amounted to  which includes unexpended marketing fund contributions of  as compared to  including  in unexpended marketing fund contributions at may  at may   the company s working capital deficiency was  as compared to  at the end of the company is able to operate with a working capital deficiency because restaurant operations are conducted primarily on a cash basis  rapid turnover and frequent deliveries allow a limited investment in inventories  and accounts payable for food  beverages and supplies usually become due after the receipt of cash from the related sales 
current assets at may  include a non recourse note receivable in the amount of approximately  resulting from the acquisition of five restaurants in march the note  which is secured by  shares of common stock of the company  was originally due on july  the company has extended the maturity date to september  although the company continues to search out and access possible sites for the development of new free standing company restaurants  due to the current high cost of suitable real estate and sites and the intense competition in the industry  the company does not currently plan to develop traditional  free standing company restaurants in fiscal year however  in connection with the development by the company of non traditional units for operation in airports and on tollroads  in fiscal the company developed and opened a smaller  lower cost proto type unit which the company believes is competitively positioned and suitable for development of in line locations by franchisees 
during fiscal year  the company  subject to availability of suitable locations  may develop one to two of these lower cost units for the purpose of expanding franchising efforts in this area 
the company has available through december  a bank line of credit of approximately  for the development of new restaurants 
in addition to scheduled debt maturities repayments in of  the company s capital requirements for relate primarily to necessary capital improvements to existing restaurants and further enhancements to corporate and restaurant management information systems 
such expenditures in will be made as required  and will take into consideration the company s current liquidity and working capital positions and anticipated future cash flows from operations and other sources 
the company regularly reviews its restaurant facilities and operations and identifies certain restaurants for sale to franchisees 
during  three restaurants were sold transferred to franchisees 
the company usually provides financing for these sales  and it is expected that future sales of identified restaurants will also be financed by the company 
accordingly  the sale of such restaurants  if consummated  may not have a significant impact on the company s liquidity position 
the company does expect however that its restaurant operating margins may improve  and that royalty income  interest income  and cash flow will increase as a result of the consummation of such sales 
there can be no assurances however that any future sales will be consummated 
the company s revenues increased from approximately million in to million in  principally as a result of acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees and  in  from development of new company restaurants 
the company currently does not have plans for additional acquisitions or for the development of new company restaurants in  but may continue to sell certain existing company restaurants to franchisees and focus future expansion on franchise development of both traditional and non traditional restaurants 
as a result  the company s total future revenues may decline 
the company expects that competition in the quick service restaurant industry will continue to be intense and will remain so in the foreseeable future  resulting in continued pressure on sales and slower development of new traditional restaurants by franchisees 
accordingly  continued emphasis will be placed on franchising certain existing restaurants  improving operations in the remaining restaurants  developing new products  enhancing the effectiveness of marketing programs  and overall improvement and possible refinements to the entire system 
the company s ability to significantly expand and develop additional company restaurants will ultimately depend on a number of factors  including unit level profitability and the company s overall profitability and cash flow  the availability and cost of suitable locations  and the availability of adequate equity or debt financing 
inflation the company does not believe that inflationary factors have had a significant effect on company operations in the past three years 
any significant increase in inflation could affect company operations as a result of increased costs for food and labor  as well as increased occupancy and equipment costs 
congress has recently passed the small business job protection act which  amoung other provisions  provides for an increase in the minimum wage from the current per hour to on october   and to on september  the company is reviewing the potential impact of the minimum wage increase on its operations  and is considering whether the wage increase or any part thereof will be passed on through price increases 
during fiscal year  the company did not make any significant menu price adjustments in order to increase or maintain profit margins 
the company expects that greater volume purchase discounts on food and supplies may be available in the future as the restaurant chain grows  which could partially offset the impact of any cost increases 
seasonality the company does not expect seasonality to affect its operations in a materially adverse manner 
however  the company s restaurant sales during its first and fourth fiscal quarters are generally higher than its second and third quarters due to the location of the majority of its restaurants in florida 
recently issued accounting standards the company is required to adopt statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

in october  sfas no

the company is required to adopt statement no
