the company s initial nationwide narrowband pcs license was granted by the fcc pursuant to a pioneer s preference and such grant was conditioned by the fcc upon the payment by mtel of a license fee in the amount of approximately million 
mtel filed an appeal challenging the condition requiring payment for this license  and in march the united states court of appeals for the dc circuit issued a decision upholding the fcc s authority under the communications act to impose such a fee 
however  the court remanded the matter to the fcc for consideration of the propriety of requiring the payment of such a fee in light of mtel s reliance on the fcc s public pronouncements that no such fee would be imposed and the granting by the fcc of other paging licenses without the imposition of any fee 
payment for this license will not be required to be made unless and until such litigation is definitively resolved adversely to mtel 
the skytel way network does not currently operate on the frequency covered by this license

this capital was used to fund capital expenditures and initial working capital requirements of joint ventures in brazil  indonesia  malaysia  mexico  peru and certain other countries 
in  the company anticipates that it will require approximately million to fund the capital expenditures and working capital requirements of its international subsidiaries and capital contributions to its international joint ventures 
however  capital requirements related to its international operations may vary and will depend upon i general trends in the one way messaging industry in each particular country  ii exchange rates of each such country s currency  and iii the success achieved by each of the company s international subsidiaries and joint ventures 
in addition  the company cannot predict with certainty the timing or amount of any additional investment that may be required in connection with further international development efforts since this will be dependent upon the timing of foreign government regulatory decisions  the capital structure of any new international operations or investments and related funding obligations  and the rate of further development of international messaging operations 
earnings before fixed charges and preferred cash dividends 
mtel s fixed charges and preferred cash dividends exceeded its earnings before fixed charges and preferred cash dividends by approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

while revenues continued to increase during each of the years ended december   and  price reductions for one way messaging services  increased selling  general and administrative expenses associated with one way messaging services and start up losses associated with the skytel way tm network and international operations in argentina  colombia  hong kong and uruguay reduced operating cash flows in and the company intends to fund its capital requirements in and from borrowings under skytel s bank credit facility entered into in december  as amended on march   the proceeds from the sale of the company s pik preferred stock as defined below  net cash provided by operations and the proceeds from the sale of non strategic assets

the amendments to the skytel bank loan agreement  executed in march  requires the company to complete the sale of equity securities in each of these subsidiaries by prescribed dates 
borrowings under skytel s bank credit facility may be limited by certain covenants contained in the indenture relating to the senior notes  which limit the total indebtedness that may be incurred by the company based primarily on the number of one way and two way messaging units placed in service since september  the company believes that it may be required to solicit the consent of the holders of the senior notes to amend these covenants in in order to increase the total indebtedness authorized under the indenture 
if such consents are not obtained or are delayed  the company s ability to borrow under skytel s bank credit facility could be limited 
any amendment to the indenture relating to the senior notes will require the consent of the lending banks 
as a result of higher than projected capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of  primarily related to the purchase of pagers to support one way sales  the purchase of flex pagers to alleviate capacity constraints on the one way network and higher than expected development costs associated with the skytel way tm network  skytel incurred higher than expected borrowings under its bank credit facility

on march   the lending banks waived these covenant violations and agreed to certain amendments to the bank loan agreement to provide additional operational flexibility under the bank credit facility
