these record automotive sales represent a percent increase over  and a percent increase over the increased sales were realized despite a percent decline in automotive production in the united states  a modest percent growth in western europe s new car market  and an estimated decline of percent in the u 
s 
automotive replacement market 
overall  the company s sales in the united states remained flat  where increases in the automotive original equipment segment were offset by declines in the automotive replacement segment 
sales in europe jumped percent in the current year as a result of sales increases in all european markets served 
operating income declined percent in  largely as a result of new business costs in the us automotive replacement segment and increased manufacturing costs in both automotive segments that were not fully recovered by selling price increases 
also impacting results for was the estimated percent decline in the u 
s 
automotive replacement market 
operating income for includes million of restructuring charges to complete the restructuring plan 
these costs were anticipated as a part of the plan  but were not permitted to be recognized in expenses under generally accepted accounting principles 
operating income for includes a restructuring charge of million 
the restructuring plan was essentially completed by year end currency fluctuations had a positive impact on the comparative levels of sales and operating income during using a constant exchange rate basis  sales increased percent and operating income fell percent 
net income from continuing operations for the current year includes a special charge of million related to a judgment entered against an arvin subsidiary in connection with a divestiture and assessments by legal counsel of other pending legal matters 
net income for included a special charge of million related to increased environmental and other reserves related primarily to environmental clean up costs at a site previously owned by the company s maremont subsidiary 
during  arvin completed the sale of its percent ownership interest in space industries international  inc space industries 
previously  space industries had been reported by arvin as the technology segment 
current and historical financial information has been restated to reflect the results of the technology segment as discontinued operations 
income loss from discontinued operations also includes income from the company s schrader operations through the first quarter of the proceeds from the divestitures of space industries and schrader enabled arvin to reduce total debt by million in results of operations net sales by segment automotive original equipment    automotive replacement total    operating income by segment automotive original equipment automotive replacement total automotive original equipment oe  vs 
sales in the oe segment of  million for were percent higher than oe sales for the effect of price changes on sales was negligible 
ride control units sold increased in every major market served 
exhaust unit sales declined in the united states as a result of lower vehicle production  and increased throughout western europe 
the effect of net increased sales volume of exhaust systems approximated million  while ride control s unit volume increase approximated million 
the company recognized increased sales volumes despite essentially level market volumes in western europe and a modest decline in the north american market 
the company s sales volume in mexico declined an estimated million as a result of general economic conditions in that country 
sales increases in excess of identified price and volume factors reflect the industry s demand for higher quality  more expensive oe parts 
coated steel volumes were level with the prior year  while changing volumes in other component automotive parts posted modest decreases 
operating profit of million in the oe segment for declined by million  or percent  when compared with the decline was primarily a result of increased material and labor costs of approximately million  offset by the positive effect of productivity improvements of approximately million 
selling price increases contributed approximately million to the current year s operating profit 
costs to complete the restructuring plan for this segment  which were not permissible to be expensed in under generally accepted accounting principles  exceeded the restructuring charge by approximately million 
comparison of the effect of changes in volume from period to period is subject to a number of limitations  principally centered around what constitutes a unit for volume measurement 
the appropriate measure of a unit varies over time as products develop  varies among the different countries in which the company operates  and varies within each operating unit of the company 
as a result  there is a certain degree of imprecision and subjectivity in estimating the impact of volume changes 
vs 
oe sales in were percent higher than in primarily as a result of a percent increase in the north american automotive build rate and an easing of recessionary pressures throughout europe 
pricing pressures reduced sales prices in north america and europe 
the impact of lower sales prices was offset in both markets by arvin s success in winning significant new business 
operating income in this segment increased percent for the year as a result of the higher revenues in traditional automotive oe businesses  improved revenues and margins from coil coating operations which contributed million of the increase  and the realization of the benefit of quality and process improvement initiatives 
these gains were somewhat offset by price concessions  start up costs on new strut production  the negative impact of a labor dispute at one of the company s major north american steel suppliers and the devaluation of the mexican peso 
in addition  the company recorded a restructuring charge of million for this segment 
except for the exchange losses of approximately million related to the peso devaluation  currency fluctuations had a minor impact on the comparative balances of both sales and operating income 
automotive replacement replacement  vs 
sales in the replacement segment of million for were percent lower than replacement sales for  despite the overall percent positive effect on sales of price increases 
volume fell at an overall rate of percent 
the volume decline was most pronounced in the north american exhaust aftermarket  where the company s percent decline in volume approximated the estimated overall north american market decrease 
all north american markets reported volume declines 
the european replacement exhaust market also reported a slight decline in volume 
sales to developing countries continued to post strong increases 
operating units in the replacement segment sell their product through a variety of different customer channels including merchandisers  installers  and wholesale distributors 
as a result of period to period variations in this channel mix  in addition to normal variations in product mix  the average price of units sold may not correspond to price changes 
as in the oe segment  there is also a certain degree of imprecision and subjectivity in estimating the impact of period to period volume changes  principally because of questions as to what constitutes a unit for volume measurement 
the appropriate measure of a unit varies over time as products develop  varies among the different countries in which the company operates  and varies within each operating unit of the company 
operating profit in the replacement segment decreased million during  when compared to labor and material cost inflation amounted to approximately million 
volume declines accounted for an estimated million of the decrease and increased costs of acquiring new customers accounted for approximately million of the decrease 
both and reflect unusually high costs to acquire new business 
total new business costs were elevated by significant amounts pertaining to new customer commitments made prior to year end at year end  the comparable commitments to new customers were negligible 
reported results for include million of restructuring costs for this segment 
costs to complete the restructuring program in the replacement segment were less than million in vs 
replacement sales increased percent over the prior year 
while european sales were up slightly  stronger increases were seen in the united states in both the ride control and exhaust product lines 
increases in the united states were due to arvin s success in winning new customers in the exhaust product line and stronger overall demand  coupled with moderate price increases in ride control products 
the company also increased  by more than percent  both its united states and european sales of oe replacement parts sold to automotive dealers for service parts 
operating income improved as a result of productivity improvements in most markets represented in this segment 
however  overall operating income fell percent for this segment due to an million restructuring charge and increased costs associated with obtaining new business in the united states corporate general and administrative expenses in reached their lowest level since the expense of million represents a percent decrease compared to and a percent decrease compared to the decrease for both years was primarily the result of reduced expenditures for employee costs and professional services 
another factor contributing to the decrease was that approximately 
million of one time expenses related to the consolidation of the company s domestic data center operations were incurred in restructuring and special charges of million are included in the results of continuing operations for the components of the charges are as follows automotive original automotive corporate equipment replacement and other total employee separations asset write downs 
facility consolidations other special charges total the workforce reductions and consolidation of manufacturing facilities and product lines announced as a part of the restructuring were substantially completed by year end the restructuring charge included employee separation costs based on the minimum levels that would be paid to the affected employees pursuant to the company s workforce reduction program and contractual provisions of government programs for international business units 
additional severance expense in  which was not permitted to be recognized in under generally accepted accounting principles  was million  net of a 
million adjustment to reserves established in cash expenditures during included million for continuing operations employees separated under the restructuring plan 
actual employee separations in continuing operations were less than planned separations of persons 
asset write downs of million represented costs associated with reducing the carrying value of underperforming assets to their estimated fair values 
a majority of the assets written down were a part of a facility consolidation in the replacement segment  which closed its canadian exhaust manufacturing and distribution facilities and merged those operations into the us parent company 
facility consolidations in the united states also included a consolidation of replacement ride control manufacturing operations to the chickasha  oklahoma plant and a consolidation of certain replacement administrative functions in brentwood  tennessee 
facility consolidations also took place in europe  where the company closed a replacement ride control distribution facility 
this facility  originally located in the netherlands to accommodate faster delivery of u 
s 
and french manufactured products to a variety of locations within europe  was combined with the french manufacturing facility to utilize already existing supply lines 
cash expenditures during to complete facility consolidations approximated million for continuing operations 
total restructuring expense of million for includes million of facility consolidation expense  net of 
million of income as a result of an adjustment to a facility consolidation reserve established in the special charge included increases in environmental and other reserves related primarily to the completion of a feasibility study which identified and estimated remediation costs at the platt saco lowell site previously owned by the company s maremont subsidiary

the results also include a special credit of million as a result of a settlement with a party potentially liable for certain costs in connection with various environmental matters 
interest expense decreased less than percent 
million in  mirroring a decrease in average outstanding debt of less than percent over the same period 
during  interest expense increased percent or million 
the increase was a result of higher average borrowing rates on higher average outstanding debt 
other expense  net increased million in the increase was primarily a result of a million increase in foreign currency transaction losses  primarily in mexico 
the balance of other expense  net represents an increase of million over the prior year 
this increase was also primarily the result of higher foreign exchange losses  coupled with higher goodwill amortization 
equity earnings of affiliates decreased million in equity earnings of affiliates was adversely affected by million as a result of losses from a percent owned equity subsidiary serving the european original equipment market 
as previously disclosed  the company instituted a review of the performance of this entity  including discussions with its joint venture partners 
these negotiations have encompassed  but have not been limited to  renegotiation of ownership percentages  additional capital contributions by the partners and alternative methods of making such additions  and renegotiation of the entity s current financing arrangements with its lending institutions 
a decision on these alternative proposals has not been finalized and the outcome of these discussions remains unclear 
the company believes that a revised agreement among the entity s shareholders and creditors is necessary for the entity to continue as a going concern 
the company s investment in this affiliate at december  was million 
equity earnings of affiliates for was relatively unchanged from minority interest in net income of consolidated subsidiaries increased 
million in the current year 
in  the minority interest in net income of consolidated subsidiaries increased million from a 
million share of losses in these increases were a result of improved earnings of the company s timax business unit in both and a portion of the timax unit was contributed to the european joint venture with sogefi spa in the third quarter of in addition  minority interest in net income of consolidated subsidiaries for both years was increased by improved results from the company s percent owned spanish subsidiary  ap amortiguadores  sa income loss from discontinued operations for represents the results of space industries for the first nine months of in  the million loss primarily represents losses from space industries  net of 
million of earnings from schrader 
the income of million resulted from million of schrader s earnings  reduced by 
million of losses from space industries 
included in space industries results are a one time credit of million to reduce prior years accruals of employee benefits and a one time charge approximating million for the settlement of certain retirement benefits 
for  the results of space industries include a pre tax restructuring and special charge of million million net of tax and minority interest 
the components of this charge were as follows employee separations 
asset write downs goodwill impairment facility consolidations other special charges 
total the restructuring and related asset write downs were a result of more competition for fewer available contracts throughout as a result  the company initiated a comprehensive review of the carrying value of its intangible assets 
results of this study concluded that the full recovery of the costs associated with the development of certain space facility technology relating to the design  integration  and operation of a man tended space facility was unlikely 
as a result  undiscounted cash flows were insufficient to recover the technology segment s goodwill and the capitalized costs relating to the space facility technology 
based on the analysis of discounted future cash flows  the company recorded an impairment of million to goodwill and a charge for approximately million of capitalized space facility technology costs in the technology segment 
a principal portion of the space industries restructuring was to shift the direction of the business away from large scale space programs in the microgravity materials science field 
as a result  a number of senior management positions were consolidated from space industries houston  texas facility into a new office in washington  dc  resulting in the elimination of several senior level positions at other facilities 
employee transfers from space industries service contracts division into a new joint venture company resulted in a reduction of employees 
additional restructuring activities yielded an percent additional reduction in employee numbers 
overall  space industries headcount fell from  in september to  in september in addition to these personnel changes  the company also downsized and reduced laboratory facilities at its srl division by percent and discontinued efforts in the measurement and control area 
there were no further restructuring charges or credits in for space industries  however  cash flows through the september  sale date included 
million for lease cancellation costs and 
million for severance payments  both of which were accrued as a part of the restructuring 
income from disposal of discontinued operations relates to earnings of the company s schrader subsidiary after the decision to sell this business  adjustments in to tax liabilities related to the schrader business  and a provision to write down preferred stock received in conjunction with the sale of schrader 
there was no gain or loss recorded on the disposition of space industries 
financial condition liquidity working capital decreased million or percent in the primary reason for the decrease is the reclassification to current portion of long term debt of million of the company s medium term notes maturing in the third quarter of after the end of the third quarter  the company issued million of percent notes in a private placement 
this new debt replaced the million of percent debt which was redeemed in december of see the consolidated statement of cash flows for a more detailed analysis of changes in cash 
the current ratio decreased from at the end of to at the end of accounts receivable and accounts payable both increased percent and percent  respectively 
the primary reason for the accounts receivable increase is longer payment terms granted to customers in the replacement ride control products market 
days sales outstanding at the end of was days compared to days at the end of the increase in accounts payable is a result of increases in year end inventories and longer negotiated payment terms 
assets of business transferred under contractual arrangements and liabilities and deferred credit of business transferred represent percent of the assets of the company s former subsidiary  space industries  which was sold to a new company formed by the senior management of space industries for approximately million in cash 
under the agreement  the company guaranteed approximately million of the new company s debt incurred as a part of the transaction 
the guarantee amount  which was million at december   is scheduled to decline on a quarterly basis before expiring on september  the accounting for the space industries transaction follows the treatment set forth in the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletins topic e sab topic e accounting for divestiture of a subsidiary or other business operation 
capital resources based on the company s projected cash flow from operations and existing credit facility arrangements  management believes that sufficient liquidity is available to meet anticipated capital and dividend requirements over the foreseeable future 
capital expenditures of continuing operations were and million in and  respectively  and related to ongoing production improvements  product enhancements  new production  and manufacturing efficiencies as well as normal replacement 
planned capital expenditures for are adequate for normal growth and replacement and are consistent with projections for future sales and earnings 
near term expenditures are expected to be funded from internally generated funds 
funds generated from the february sale of schrader and the september sale of space industries were used to reduce the company s debt and for other corporate purposes

the previously disclosed case grew out of the may sale of a maremont unit  saco defense  inc  to chamberlain and relates to certain worker compensation cases which were pending at the time of the sale 
in the fourth quarter of  chamberlain was awarded million in connection with its petition for pre judgment interest  costs and attorney fees related to this judgment 
as a result of this judgment and award and revised assessments by legal counsel of other pending legal matters  the company added million during to previously established litigation reserves 
the company has filed an appeal with respect to the judgment and the post judgment award

the company is defending various environmental claims and legal actions that arise in the normal course of its business  including matters in which the company has been designated a potentially responsible party at certain waste disposal sites or has been notified that it may be a potentially responsible party at other sites as to which no proceedings have been initiated 
at a majority of these sites  the information currently available leads the company to believe it has very limited or even de minimis responsibility 
at other sites  the remediation method  amount of remediation costs  or the allocation among potentially responsible parties has not been determined 
where reasonable estimates are possible  the company has provided for the costs of study  cleanup  remediation  and certain other costs  taking into account  as applicable  available information regarding site conditions  potential cleanup methods and the extent to which other parties can be expected to bear those costs 
given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating legal and environmental exposures  actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the currently recorded estimates
