results of operations years ended september  net revenues s of total of total of total exploration sales and services    production sales and services    corrosion control services    other sales and services    total oilfield services revenues    petrochemical processing  total    years ended september  operating profit s of total of total of total oilfield services    petrochemical processing  total operations    general corporate expenses    total    year ended september  compared to year ended september  revenues 
revenues increased  or  from the year ended september  to the same period in the increase was primarily the result of the company s entry into the petrochemical processing business via the acquisitions of wedco technology  inc april and polymer service  inc july 
exploration revenues decreased  or 
the decrease is primarily due to a shift in the classification of the services provided to customers within the company s lone star  texas facility 
historically  the lone star facility provided mostly new pipe inspection 
during late fiscal year  the company began providing mostly used pipe inspection in this area 
accordingly  in fiscal year  lone star revenues were classified as production services revenues versus fiscal year  where these revenues were included in exploration services revenues 
after eliminating the effect of this reclassification  fiscal year revenues increased  or versus fiscal year demand for exploration services is affected by domestic drilling activity 
the domestic rig count averaged approximately for the year ended september  versus during fiscal year  an increase of 
in addition  the company s exploration revenues increase in fiscal year was due in part to the full year effect of the spinco acquisition in june production revenues increased  or  primarily due to the reclassification of lone star  texas revenues discussed above 
the remaining revenue increase resulted from generally high oil prices in which increased the demand for production services 
oil prices ranged from a high of approximately per barrel to a low of approximately per barrel during fiscal year compared to a high of and a low of per barrel during revenues from corrosion control services increased  or  in fiscal year versus the increase resulted primarily from greater demand for the company s services in the louisiana and west texas corrosion control markets 
revenues from other services decreased  or 
half the decrease resulted from a decline in oilfield engine sales and reconditioning revenues in canada  due to a slowdown in oilfield activity in western canada 
the remaining decrease was the result of recognizing an equipment sale in  with no comparable sale in costs and expenses 
cost of sales and services as a percentage of net revenues increased to during versus for the same period in within the oilfield service business  costs of sales and services increased to versus in fiscal year the gross margin decline within the oilfield services segment is due to in order of magnitude a softening of prices in the houston inspection and west texas coating markets  the recognition of a million in product sales during which carried gross margins greater than the company s traditional oilfield sales and services and the reclassification of certain employee expenses to cost of sales during which were recognized as sales  general and administrative expenses during fiscal year the reclassification of the employee expenses was based upon the applicable employees job functions 
the effects of lower margins in the company s oilfield service business were partially offset by the higher margins generated by the petrochemical processing business 
this business generally generates higher gross margins than the company s oilfield services business 
selling  general and administration expenses increased from  during fiscal year to  during sales  general and administrative cost as a percentage of revenues  decreased to in versus in these changes are primarily due to the wedco and psi acquisitions which increased revenues and sales  general and administrative costs  but had the effect of lowering these costs as a percentage of revenues 
the company also incurred the following lower expenses for the fiscal year versus fiscal year in order of magnitude lower insurance costs  lower moving expenses primarily related to several employee relocations in and lower payroll costs due to the reclassification of certain employee costs explained above 
these lower costs were offset by  in expenses relating to litigation costs incurred in the  in costs relate to litigation reserves established because  during the fourth quarter and subsequent to year end  management determined that it was probable that certain legal matters of the company would result in a charge to income and that these charges could be reasonably estimated 
in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
established accounting standards for the impairment of the long lived assets  certain identifiable intangibles  and goodwill related to those assets to be held and used and for long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be disposed of 
the new statement requires the value of long lived assets  certain identifiable intangibles  and goodwill to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if this change in circumstances or other initial indication has occurred  the next step in determining whether an asset has been impaired is performed using the expected future undiscounted cash flows of assets  grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows  compared to the carrying value of those assets 
if the undiscounted cash flow value is less than the net carrying value  the amount of impairment is then measured by comparing the discounted cash flows with the corresponding carrying values of the assets evaluated 
the company s previous policy was to evaluate the realizability of long term assets on an aggregate basis based on undiscounted cash flows 
management accumulated cash flow information at the lowest asset grouping levels for which there were identifiable cash flows 
these levels were represented by separate operating locations 
based on the data  the company s adoption of sfas no 
during fiscal year  resulted in a write down of long lived assets of  the sfas no 
write down related entirely to the wedco facilities which  during the fourth quarter of  management decided to close in fiscal year see consolidation plans item 
more than two thirds of the write down reduced the carrying value of goodwill created by the april acquisition of wedco technology  inc the remaining charge related to machinery and equipment within the facilities to be closed 
charges of  related to previous acquisitions made by the company 
most of the expense consists of severance and consulting fee obligations  resulting from the wedco acquisition 
during the fourth quarter of  management determined these expenses would not benefit the company in the future 
inventory writedowns of  consisted of a reduction in the carrying value of inventory  within the oilfield service operations  which partially related to the baker hughes tubular services acquisition 
depreciation and amortization increased from  for the year ended september  to  for the year ended september  the increase was primarily due to increases in property  plant and equipment and goodwill due to the wedco acquisition as well as capital expenditures made during the year 
net interest income decreased from  in to  during the fiscal year ended september  this change resulted from the debt assumed in connection with the wedco acquisition  a lower average cash balance and lower yields on the company s high quality commercial paper portfolio 
unusual items 
in the company incurred  in non recurring litigation charges 
during the fourth quarter and subsequent to year end  management determined that it was probable that certain legal matters of the company would result in a charge to income and that these charges could be reasonably estimated 
approximately of the charge relates to the settlement of the litigation of a dispute concerning the assumption of certain liabilities in connection with the acquisition of baker hughes tubular services  inc in september  see legal proceedings item 
provision benefit for income taxes 
the company decreased its valuation allowance through the fiscal year provision to reflect its ability to benefit from temporary differences 
in connection with the purchase price accounting for the wedco acquisition  the company reversed the remaining valuation allowance against net tax assets expected to be realized  resulting in a decrease of acquired goodwill 
as a result of the reversal of the valuation allowance  provisions for income taxes in future years will increase as a percentage of net income and will be greater than the company s effective tax rate

the domestic rig count averaged approximately for the year ended september  compared to an average of approximately for the year ended september  the adverse impact of the lower domestic rig count  however  was more than offset by the company s increased success in providing in plant  new pipe inspection services to steel mill and processing customers 
production revenues decreased  or less than from the year ended september to the same period in demand for these services was affected by changes in oil prices which remained relatively stable in versus oil prices ranged from a high of approximately per barrel to a low of approximately per barrel for the year ended september  compared to a high of approximately per barrel to a low of approximately per barrel for the year ended september  the impact of fiscal year acquisitions of frontier  kebco and shearer had a positive impact on production revenues 
the effect of the acquisitions  however  was offset by a temporary decline in services in the oklahoma and wyoming markets 
the decrease in california was the result of production delays following the relocation of the company s operating facility to bakersfield  california  from the city of industry  california 
revenues from corrosion control services increased  or from the year ended september to the same period in the increase was due to the full year effect of the april permian acquisition and an increased demand for the company s corrosion control services at all of its facilities 
costs and expenses
