item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the company is a leading provider of movie based motion simulation theatre attractions to the rapidly expanding out of home entertainment market 
the company is presently in the business of i licensing and distributing the films in its library and the proprietary technologies necessary to produce and exhibit showscan films  ii selling and installing attractions and specialty theatre equipment including projectors  screens  sound systems  synchronization and show control and theatre design packages used to exhibit films in the showscan process as well as format films  iii selling motion bases and other equipment used in attractions  iv producing films using the showscan process  and v operating attractions in which the company has an economic interest o o theatres 
the company is also committed to the continued recognition of the showscan r brand name worldwide 
the company announced in fiscal the new showmax product line  a complete giant screen theatre package 
the company anticipates that the showmax product line will have a positive impact on sales in future periods 
the principal sources of the company s revenues are the licensing of the showscan film library and technologies  the sale and installation of projectors  screens  sound systems and other equipment used to exhibit showscan films  and the sale of motion bases and other equipment used in most showscan attractions 
the company currently derives most of its revenues from export sales 
see note to the consolidated financial statements and item business sales and marketing 
the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on the company s net revenues or on its results of operations for the three most recent fiscal years 
comparison of year ended march  and year ended march  revenues for the fiscal year ended march  hereafter fiscal increased million or from revenues for the fiscal year ended march  hereafter fiscal 
film rentals and royalties increased million or in fiscal the increase was due primarily to the increase in the installed base of operating showscan attractions  renewals on certain licensing contracts which affected the timing of revenue recognition which accounted for  of the increase  the renewal of the imagine japan agreement which increased film revenues by approximately million  and approximately  of revenues from two specific customer agreements  which revenues constitute all of the revenues to be received with respect to such agreements 
on an annual basis  recurring film rentals and royalties should increase over time as the number of operating showscan attractions increases 
revenues from equipment sales and related services decreased million or in fiscal unit sales actually increased in fiscal  but revenues from these sales decreased as a result of the lower than average sales prices 
fiscal equipment sales includes  of revenues recognized as a result of the expiration under a customer agreement of a required installation period for two theatre sites 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the company recognizes equipment sales under the percentage of completion method of accounting  generally measured by the percentage that the labor hours incurred to date bears to the estimated total labor hours of each contract 
this results in a disparity in the comparison of equipment sales revenues over different time periods  as showscan records revenues under this method rather than on the date that the sale agreement is signed 
the actual signing of a showscan attraction sale precedes its delivery and installation by an average of six to seven months 
accordingly  the recognition of revenue for equipment sales during the current and future periods is affected by i the timing of such sales  ii the schedule of the build out of the showscan attractions and iii the shipment  delivery and installation of the equipment and related services 
cost of revenues was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal royalties and film costs as a percentage of film rentals and royalties dropped to in fiscal from in fiscal while equipment cost of sales as a percentage of equipment sales and related services remained constant at for each of the past two fiscal years 
the primary reason for the increase in film rental gross profit is due to the company s purchase in fiscal of the interests held by certain third party producers in two films distributed by the company  so that the company now owns of cosmic pinball and of devil s mine ride 
these purchases resulted in a reduction in payments to third party producers included in cost of revenues 
the increase in film rental gross profit is also attributed to more company owned films being licensed by the venues in fiscal than in the prior years 
amortization expense of the film library for fiscal and fiscal was  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses increased million or in fiscal the increase was primarily the result of the company s hiring of additional personnel in fiscal to meet the anticipated levels of showscan attractions sales 
company management also made a decision to enhance the quality of existing product lines and to develop new product lines  both of which involved the continuing employment and hiring of key personnel in the company s engineering and technology departments 
the company believes that there is a cost savings by performing such projects in house  rather than contracting projects out to outside vendors 
in addition  the company increased its bad debt provision by  in fiscal depreciation and amortization remained relatively unchanged during fiscal from fiscal the company develops  through various financing arrangements  showscan attractions in which the company has an ownership interest and accounts for its net ownership position using the equity method of accounting 
the company s loss of  on the operations of owned and operated theatres in fiscal decreased  or from the  loss posted in fiscal this loss is primarily the result of the following factors i expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition and development of future owned and operated theatre locations  ii operating losses  including initial start up and marketing expenses at the framingham theatres opened in late may of which the company has a interest and the edge theatre in san antonio  texas opened in march  of which the company has a interest  and iii the combined operating profits of the owned and operated showscan attractions at citywalk  the trocadero in london  and osaka 
the results of operations showed an improvement for the citywalk and london theatre locations in fiscal from fiscal the company earns film rentals  royalties and management fees from some of the owned and operated theatres  which are recorded separately in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations  thereby inherently increasing the operating expenses at these specific theatres 
operating income increased in fiscal to an operating profit of  from an operating profit of  in fiscal the increase in operating profit is primarily attributed to the increase in film rentals and royalties for the company offset by the increase in general and administrative expenses 
the company s net income increased to  or per share in fiscal as compared to a  net profit and per share in fiscal comparison of year ended march  and year ended march  revenues for the fiscal year ended march  fiscal increased by million or from revenues for the fiscal year ended march  fiscal 
film rentals and royalties increased by to million in fiscal the increase in film rentals and royalties was primarily due to the increase in the installed base of operating showscan attractions and the modification and extension in fiscal of a licensing agreement with a significant showscan attraction customer 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations comparison of year ended march  and year ended march   below 
revenues from film rentals and royalties are expected to increase annually in the future as the installed base of showscan attractions increases 
revenues from equipment sales and related services for fiscal increased by to million due to the significant increase in the number of showscan attractions opened in fiscal twelve showscan attractions opened in fiscal as compared to only two in fiscal cost of revenues were of revenues in fiscal as compared to in fiscal royalties and film costs as a percentage of film rentals and royalties decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase in gross margin was principally the result of charges made in fiscal to increase inventory reserves  including a one time charge for costs necessary to upgrade the company s inventory of projectors used in its film based showscan attractions 
no similar charges were made in fiscal the cost of the company s film library is being amortized over estimated future revenues  as revised quarterly  if applicable 
amortization expense of the film library for fiscal and fiscal was  and  respectively 
the decrease in amortization was related primarily to the accelerated amortization in fiscal of one of the company s specialty films 
general and administrative expenses remained relatively unchanged in absolute terms despite the company s hiring of additional personnel including a new chief executive officer and a new chief financial officer 
the resulting increase in personnel costs was primarily offset by i the charging of approximately  in general and administrative expenses to certain ventures in which the company has an ownership interest  and ii to a lesser extent  a decrease in the reserves for accounts receivable 
approximately  of accounts receivable that had been previously reserved were collected in fiscal depreciation and amortization decreased by million  or in fiscal this decrease was related primarily to a million write down in fiscal to certain of the company s camera and film production equipment which  pursuant to the company s revised business strategy  is not expected to be utilized in future periods 
no such write downs occurred in fiscal the company develops  through various financial arrangements  showscan attractions in which the company has an ownership interest and accounts for its net ownership position under the equity method of accounting 
the company s loss of  on investment in owned and operated theatres is the result of the operating losses during fiscal at two showscan attractions  plus site acquisition costs for future owned and operated theatre locations incurred through the showscan attractions venture 
the citywalk attraction located at universal citywalk adjacent to universal studios  universal city  california is owned by a venture in which the company has a interest 
the loss at that location was primarily the result of lower than expected attendance caused by disruptions due to the construction of a substantial addition to universal citywalk in the area adjacent to the theatre and the unseasonably heavy rainfall in january of in the southern california area 
the second showscan attraction  which is owned by a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  opened in late september  at piccadilly circus  london  england 
the results of operations from the london theatre were adversely affected by i seasonal factors attendance typically increases during summer months  ii interruptions during the installation testing period  and iii initial start up expenses relating primarily to marketing and advertising 
operating income increased in fiscal to an operating profit of  from an operating loss of  in fiscal this million increase in operating income was the result of the significant increases in revenue in both film rentals and royalties and equipment sales and related services and the decreases in depreciation and amortization 
the company s net income of  or 
per share  in fiscal compared favorably to the fiscal net loss of  or loss per share 
comparison of year ended march  and year ended march  revenues for the fiscal year ended march  fiscal decreased by from revenues for the fiscal year ended march  fiscal 
the decrease in revenues reflected a decrease in both revenues from equipment sales and related services and revenues from film rentals and royalties 
film rentals and royalties decreased in fiscal primarily due to the modification and extension of a licensing agreement with a significant showscan attraction customer 
although the general terms of the modified agreement were similar to the prior agreement  the company earned film rentals and royalties from the customer ratably during the entire calendar year rather than all at the beginning of each calendar year 
substantially all of the decrease in revenues from film rentals and royalties in fiscal resulted from the modification of this license agreement 
revenues from equipment sales and related services for fiscal decreased primarily due to the timing of showscan attraction sales 
although the total number of sales of showscan attractions did not significantly decrease in fiscal from fiscal  all but one sale occurred in the last quarter of fiscal because the company recognizes equipment sales under the percentage of completion method of accounting  generally measured by the percentage of labor hours incurred to date to the estimated total labor hours of each contract  the major portion of the fourth quarter sales were recognized in periods after fiscal the lack of sales in the first three quarters of fiscal is attributable  in significant part  to the announcement of the potential merger between the company and one of its competitors  omni films international  inc the merger did not occur 
the company believes that this announcement created customer uncertainty that delayed purchasing decisions by certain potential customers 
the lack of equipment sales also was due to the recessionary conditions that existed in certain of the markets in which the company transacts business  and to increased worldwide competition 
cost of revenues was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal royalties and film costs as a percentage of film rentals increased to in fiscal from in fiscal equipment cost of sales as a percentage of equipment sales and related services increased to in fiscal from in fiscal this reduction in gross margins is primarily attributable to i a one time  charge for costs necessary to upgrade the company s inventory of the projectors used in its film based showscan attractions  and ii to a lesser extent  certain additional inventory reserves 
depreciation and amortization increased in fiscal by  this increase is related primarily to  of write downs relating to certain of the company s camera and film production equipment that management does not expect to utilize in future periods pursuant to the company s revised business strategy 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal decreased by  or  due to the reduction in the company s workforce and the other cost cutting measures that were implemented during fiscal the decrease in these expenses was offset by  of one time severance charges and other expenses incurred by the company in connection with its reorganization 
in fiscal  the company recorded a provision of  for certain contract modifications 
no such provision was made in fiscal the provision is primarily the result of a customer s inability to complete its contractual commitment to purchase certain showscan attractions that had been previously ordered by the customer 
due primarily to the reduction in revenues from equipment sales and related services  the  write down of certain equipment  the decrease in revenues from film rentals and royalties  and the provision for contract modifications  the company s net loss increased in fiscal to  or per share of common stock  from a net loss of  or 
per share of common stock in fiscal liquidity and capital resources at march   the company s working capital increased to  from  at march  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased to  from  at march  the increase in working capital is primarily due to the completion of a financing transaction described below offset primarily by i the company s payment in full of a subordinated note payable  ii the funding provided by the company in connection with the construction of the showscan attractions in framingham  osaka and san antonio  and iii the company s purchase of interests in two motion simulation films 
net cash flow provided by operations was  in fiscal as a result of positive changes in several categories 
accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities increased by  while accounts receivable and equipment sales inventory decreased by a combined at march  these changes are primarily attributable to the timing of the company s showscan attraction sales and the specific contract terms of such sales which contract terms generally affect the timing of collections  shipments to customers and related payment to vendors  and the purchase of interests in two films 
net cash used in the company s investing activities was  in fiscal this was principally the result of  of purchases in short term investments  plus  of additions to the company s film library  and  of investments in o o theatres 
cash flow provided by financing activities was  in fiscal during such period  the company made in april  a payment in full of  on a subordinated note payable see below 
on september   the company completed a   net of expenses private placement of convertible notes through a european financial institution 
the company issued secured convertible notes with a conversion price of per share 
as of march    had been converted into  shares of common stock 
subsequently  through june   an additional  was converted into  shares of common stock 
the remaining  of notes are convertible at the option of the holder into  shares of common stock 
the notes have a four year maturity  bear interest at percent per annum with a semi annual interest payment schedule commencing march  and are secured by specific assets of the company  although the security excludes the company s film library and the capital stock of its subsidiaries  which includes its owned and operated theatres 
in addition to the above transactions  on september  the company converted all of its outstanding series a convertible preferred stock into  shares of common stock 
each share of series a convertible preferred stock had a liquidation value of and was converted into shares of common stock at a conversion rate of shares of common stock for each share of preferred stock 
at march   the company owed approximately  under a subordinated note payable to mr 
douglas trumbull the trumbull note  the inventor of the showscan process 
the trumbull note including interest was due and paid in full on april  the above activities had the result of increasing the company s stockholders equity from million as of march  to million as of march  and also resulted in a significant infusion of cash  increased the film library and the investments in owned and operated theatres 
the company believes that its working capital will be sufficient to fund the costs of operations for the next twelve months 
the company s business strategy includes new film productions  new product development and new product lines  enhancement of existing product lines and possible site acquisitions for additional owned and operated theatres 
the company plans to pursue further financing alternatives by one or more of the following means the selling of securities  obtaining a line of credit from a banking institution  and or forming strategic alliances or joint ventures 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain any of the aforementioned financing alternatives 
if the company is unable to generate sufficient funds from operations or is unable to raise additional capital through any of the aforementioned alternatives  the company will need to curtail its revised business strategy  specifically with regards to the timing of new film productions and the number of new o o theatres 
additionally  the company has reserved as of june   shares of common stock for issuance on the exercise of stock options  warrants  preferred stock and convertible notes 
factors that may affect future results portions of this report may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of the reader is cautioned that all forward looking statements are necessarily speculative and there are certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those referred to in such forward looking statements 
the discussion below  together with portions of the discussion elsewhere in this report  highlight some of the more important risks identified by management of the company but should not be assumed to be the only things that could affect future performance 
period to period fluctuations the company s operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons  including a the timing of sales of the company s motion simulation attractions  b the timing of delivery and installation of such sales pursuant to percentage of completion accounting and any delays therein caused by permitting or construction delays at the customer s site  c the size  type and configuration of the attractions sold  d the timing of film rental payments from existing attractions and the performance of those attractions that pay film rental based on a percentage of box office  and e the timing of sales and marketing efforts and related expenditures 
accordingly  the company s revenues and earnings in any particular period may not be indicative of the results for any future period 
the company s performance depends primarily upon the number of motion simulation attractions that it can sell and install 
this dependence has been lessening as the percentage of the company s revenues derived from on going film rental has increased though there can be no assurance that this trend will necessarily continue 
the company s results have followed a seasonal pattern  with revenues tending to be stronger in the second and fourth fiscal quarters  reflecting the buying patterns of the company s customers for new motion simulation attractions 
growth plan management of the company has adopted an aggressive growth plan that includes substantial investments in its sales and marketing organizations  the creation of new research and development programs and increased funding of existing programs  and investments in corporate infrastructure that will be required to support significant growth 
this plan  which was implemented during the latter half of fiscal and is planned to continue into fiscal  carries with it a number of risks  including a higher level of operating expenses that may not be adequately covered by increased sales and the complexities associated with managing a larger and faster growing organization 
new product development the company operates in a technology driven segment of the entertainment business 
as such  the company must continually improve its products to increase their entertainment value while also facing pressure to continually reduce the price of its products to respond to competitive pressures 
since the company s main competitors  iwerks entertainment  inc and imax corporation  have significantly more capital than the company  the company has had to rely more on its suppliers and other third parties to improve the company s existing products and to develop new ones 
the company s future results will depend in large part on its ability to remain a leader in its business segment 
international operations a significant portion of the company s revenue is from sales and film licensing outside the united states 
the company s results could be negatively affected by such factors as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  trade protection measures  policies with respect to currency and fiscal controls  longer accounts receivable collection patterns  changes in regional or worldwide economic or political conditions  or natural disasters 
though the company faces less direct exchange rate risks since nearly all of its contracts are denominated in united states dollars  fluctuations in exchange rates can significantly affect the affordability of the company s products and services overseas 
intellectual property the company has several united states patents on various processes and elements related to film projection and motion simulation 
the most important of these patents expire in october though the company s patents have never been challenged and the company believes that they are valid  third parties could still challenge the patents and a court could determine that one or more of them are invalid 
declarations of invalidity  particularly of the company s key patents  could adversely affect the marketability of the company s products and services 
in addition  the company always faces the risk that new technologies could be discovered that are superior to the company s patents 
competition the company faces intense competition in all of its product lines 
in the motion simulation business  the company s main competitor is iwerks though there are an increasing number of smaller competitors 
iwerks has substantially greater financial resources than the company and as such may be able to both price its existing products and services lower than the company as well as produce new products 
imax is a growing competitor of the company in this segment and has dedicated substantial resources to entering this market 
in the large screen  special format motion picture business  the company s main competitor is imax though iwerks is also very significant 
the format appears to be emerging as the most popular large format due primarily to the large number of films available in that format 
imax is by far the dominant company in this market 
the company is only a recent entrant into this market and has not yet made any sales 
the company will have to continue to invest funds in order to broaden its position in the market and thus short term results could be adversely affected until sales can be made 
see also the discussion in item legal proceedings regarding litigation initiated with respect to the company s entry into this market 
business disruption the company s corporate headquarters  including its research and development operations and most of its manufacturing facilities  are located in los angeles  california  a region known for seismic activity 
operating results could be materially affected by a significant earthquake or other natural disaster 
dependence on major customers the company s motion simulation business has two significant concentrations 
the first concentration involves ongoing film licenses and is located in japan where a single customer presently operates or is otherwise responsible for twelve simulation attractions 
the second concentration relates to the company s sales backlog where ua and king s entertainment co  ltd 
individually and collectively represent a substantial portion of the outstanding equipment orders to be delivered in the next few years 
of course  as each of these customers builds more theatres they will then become a concentration in the area of ongoing film rental 
in the future  the company plans to increase the number of customers with which it has multi system agreements 
the company s short and long term performance could be adversely impacted if disruptions were to occur in any of these areas of concentration such as order cancellations  license terminations or payment problems 
ability to produce additional films one of the primary factors considered by potential purchasers of motion simulation attractions is the quality and extent of the films available to be shown at the attraction 
a large portion of the company s competitive advantage resides in its popular and extensive library of ride films 
to maintain this competitive edge  the company must produce several new films each year 
film production is expensive and requires the investment of company funds to the extent that investors cannot be located with no assurance that the films produced will be popular 
iwerks and imax have each indicated that they are devoting substantial portions of their assets to the production of new ride films 
both the short and long term financial performance of the company will be adversely affected if the perceived quality and popularity of the company s film library declines either alone or in comparison to the films of the company s competitors
