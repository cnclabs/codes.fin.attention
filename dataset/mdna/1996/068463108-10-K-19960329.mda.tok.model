item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations 
competition the staff leasing and staffing services businesses are characterized by rapid growth and intense competition 
the staffing services market includes competitors of all sizes  including several  such as manpower  inc  kelly services  inc  the olsten corporation  interim services  inc  and adia services  inc  which are national in scope and have substantially greater financial and marketing resources than the company 
in addition to national companies  barrett competes with numerous regional and local firms for both customers and employees 
the company estimates that at least firms provide staffing services in oregon 
there are relatively few barriers to entry into the staffing services business 
the principal competitive factors in the staffing services industry are price  the ability to provide qualified workers in a timely manner and the monitoring of job performance 
the company attributes its growth in staffing services revenues to the cost efficiency of its operations  which permits the company to price its services competitively  and to its ability through its branch office network to understand and satisfy the needs of its customers with competent personnel 
although there are believed to be approximately  staff leasing companies currently operating in the united states  many of these potential competitors are located in states in which the company presently does not operate 
barrett believes that at least staff leasing firms are operating in oregon  but that the company has the largest presence in the state 
the company may face additional competition in the future from new entrants to the field  including other staffing services companies  payroll processing companies and insurance companies 
certain staff leasing companies operating in areas in which barrett does not now  but may in the future  offer its services have greater financial and marketing resources than the company 
competition in the staff leasing industry is based largely on price  although service and quality are also important 
barrett believes that its growth in staff leasing revenues is attributable to its ability to provide small and mid sized companies with the opportunity to provide enhanced benefits to their employees with a concomitant reduction in the clients overall personnel administration and workers compensation costs 
the company s competitive advantage may be adversely affected by a substantial increase in the costs of maintaining its self insured workers compensation program or by a general market decrease in the level of workers compensation insurance premiums

years ended december  and net income for amounted to  an increase of  or over net income of  the increase in net income over was primarily due to continued growth in revenues and gross margin  which was offset in part by increased selling  general and administrative expenses 
net income per share for was 
as compared to net income per share of 
for total revenues were  which represented an increase of  or over revenues of  the increase in revenues over was primarily due to a internal growth rate of  coupled with the acquisition of four temporary staffing businesses made during the third quarter 
these four acquisitions and continued growth of staffing services in northern california were the principal factors which contributed to the increased mix of staffing services for to of total revenues  up from of total revenues for revenues from professional employer staff leasing services  as a percent of total revenues  declined in to as compared to of total revenues in  despite a growth rate over although staff leasing revenues declined as a percent of total revenues  the company believes the continued growth of its staff leasing services is due in part to its ability to assume personnel administration functions while providing employees to clients at an overall cost that is generally less than the clients would have to pay if they carried such employees on their payrolls 
the company s services are cost effective because of i the economies of scale and  in some cases  additional benefits available to it as a professional employer organization handling a significantly larger volume of payroll  payroll taxes and employee benefits  as compared to a customer s typical administrative staff necessary to support its workforce and ii the lower cost per employee of the company s self insured workers compensation program  as compared to the third party insurance coverage its clients typically would otherwise be required to maintain 
gross margin for totaled  representing an increase of  or over the gross margin rate of of revenues  however  remained unchanged from due to a slight increase in direct payroll costs  offset by decreases in payroll taxes and benefits  workers compensation and safety incentive expenses  as a percent of revenues 
workers compensation expense includes the cost of self insurance which incorporates among other elements  case reserves for reported claims  reserves for claims incurred but not reported  additional claims administration expenses  reinsurance premiums  third party administrator fees and state assessments for the company s employees in oregon  maryland since november  washington since july  delaware since january and california since march 
effective may   the company became self insured by the united states department of labor for longshore and harbor usl h workers coverage 
in addition  the company is currently exploring an insured large deductible program which will allow it to become insured for workers compensation coverage in nearly all states where the extent of the company s operations does not yet warrant the investment to become a self insured employer 
management believes that the rates of such a program may be significantly less than they would otherwise be if the company were to obtain a more traditional form of coverage through a private insurance carrier or a state insurance fund 
there can be  however  no assurances that such a multi state arrangement can be obtained on such terms and at a cost that are acceptable to the company in the foreseeable future 
the following table summarizes certain indicators of performance regarding the company s self insured workers compensation program by quarter for and self insured workers compensation profile total workers reserve total workers comp expense as a of no 
of comp expense as a of at risk injury claims in thousands total payroll claims q  q   q   q  for the year     reserve in this context is defined as an additional expense provision for the unexpected future adverse development of claims expense commonly referred to as ibnr 
at risk claims are defined as the dollar amount of all injury claims submitted under self insured payroll less amounts covered by excess reinsurance 
the preceding table illustrates the improvement since the first quarter in the company s total workers compensation expense both in terms of total dollars and  more importantly  as a percent of total payroll dollars 
the company believes the improvement is primarily due to management s enhanced monitoring of safe work practices and the termination of its staff leasing relationship with client companies that did not conform to barrett s business philosophies and operating standards 
concurrent with the improved expense level and percentage of workers compensation expense  expressed as a percent of total payroll  the company has increased its reserves for future adverse claim development to of at risk claims as of december  selling  general and administrative expenses consist of compensation and other expenses incident to the operation of the company s headquarters and branch offices and marketing of its services 
these expenses including the amortization of intangibles amounted to  or of revenues for  as compared to  or of revenues for the increase for was primarily due to additional branch office staff added to support the increased business activity and additional workers compensation loss control branch personnel to enhance the administration of the company s self insured workers compensation programs 
the company offers various employee benefit plans  including a savings plan pursuant to code section k and a cafeteria plan pursuant to code section  to its employees  including its worksite employees 
in order to qualify for favorable tax treatment under the code  such plans must be established and maintained by an employer for the exclusive benefit of its employees 
the internal revenue service the irs has established a market segment study group regarding employee leasing for the stated purpose of examining whether professional employer organizations peos  such as the company  are the employers of worksite employees under the code provisions applicable to employee benefit plans and are  therefore  able to offer to worksite employees benefit plans that qualify for favorable tax treatment 
the market segment study group is also examining whether the owners of client companies are employees of peos under code provisions applicable to employee benefit plans 
preliminary indications are that the market segment study group may adopt the position that only a common law employer may sponsor tax qualified benefit plans 
it is not clear whether this position will adversely affect the type of co employer relationship the company maintains with its client companies 
the company is unable to predict the ultimate findings of the market segment study group and the ultimate effect of such conclusions or findings 
a definitive judicial interpretation of employer in the context of a peo or employee leasing arrangement has not been established 
the tax exempt status of the company s plans is subject to continuing scrutiny and approval by the irs and depends upon the company s ability to establish the company s employer employee relationship with leased employees 
the company is aware of an audit of a peo company which includes an audit of the tax qualified plans sponsored by the company 
as part of the peo company s audit  the irs district office reportedly asked the irs national office to issue a technical advice memorandum tam regarding whether the peo is the employer for benefit plan purposes 
generally  a tam may be requested by either the irs district office or the taxpayer 
the stated purpose of tams is to help irs personnel close cases and establish and maintain consistent holdings 
the stated position of the irs is that tams are not precedential  that is  they are limited to the particular taxpayer involved and that taxpayer s set of facts 
tams are published approximately three months after they are issued to the district office and the taxpayer 
the tam regarding the peo company has apparently been issued  but has not yet been published 
the company has learned that the tam apparently holds that the pension plan involved violates the exclusive benefit rule which requires that plans benefit only employees as the peo is not the employer for erisa purposes 
the tam apparently disqualifies the plan retroactively to its inception 
since the tam has not yet been published  the company cannot determine if the facts involved in the peo company s situation are comparable to those of the company 
if the facts are comparable and the irs applied the holding to the company as a result of an audit or requalification of the company s benefit plans  disqualification of the plans could result  as it apparently has for the peo company 
it is not clear at this time whether the irs will apply the conclusion of this tam  namely  that an exclusive benefit rule violation has occurred  to all peo situations 
such action could potentially disqualify from favorable tax treatment all the employee benefit plans of all peos 
it is  therefore  possible that the irs may propose some form of administrative relief to avoid this result  but it is unclear at this time whether it will do so 
it is also possible that any irs action in this area could be reversed or modified through judicial proceedings or congressional action 
in the event the tax exempt status of the company s benefit plans were to be discontinued and the benefit plans were to be disqualified  there could be a material adverse effect on the operations of the company 
the company has not recorded any provision for this potential contingency  as neither the likelihood of disqualification nor the resulting range of loss  if any  is currently estimable  in light of the company s current inability to properly analyze the tam regarding the peo company and the lack of public direction from the irs market segment study group 
years ended december  and net income for amounted to  an increase of  or over pro forma net income of  the increase in net income over was primarily due to substantial increases in revenues and gross margin 
net income per share for was 
as compared to pro forma net income per share of 
for total revenues were  which represented an increase of  or over the increase in revenues over was due in part to a internal growth rate of  coupled with two acquisitions during the first quarter 
see note of the notes to financial statements 
revenues from staffing services increased  or over  while staff leasing revenues rose  or over the disproportionate growth rate of staffing services as compared to staff leasing services was principally due to the acquisition of golden west temporary services in march  which provided only staffing services 
gross margin for totaled  or of revenues  which represented an increase of  or over the improvement in gross margin for of approximately basis points over was due in large part to a decrease in workers compensation expense expressed as a percent of revenues and to a reduction in the oregon unemployment payroll tax rate 
workers compensation and safety incentives expense  expressed as a percentage of revenues  decreased to in from in this overall decrease was attributable in part to a reduction in the number of injury claims and a small increase in claim reserves  despite substantial increases in the number of covered workers  as reflected by the company s increased revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses for amounted to of revenues compared to of revenues in the increase for over was primarily due to i the acquisition of two temporary staffing businesses in the first quarter of  which have higher administrative overhead requirements as compared to staff leasing services and ii additional management staff to support increased business activity  together with higher profit sharing and bonuses based on improved company performance 
the company was exempt from taxation as a subchapter s corporation until its s corporation election was terminated on april  a one time tax benefit arising from net cumulative temporary differences in the timing of reporting certain deductible items for financial statement and income tax purposes was recognized by the company as a reduction in its provision for income taxes for the year ended december  in the amount of  the pro forma effective tax rate of was the effective tax rate that would have been recorded if the company had been a subchapter c corporation 
see note of the notes to financial statements 
seasonal fluctuations the company s revenues historically have been subject to some seasonal fluctuation  particularly in its staffing services business 
demand for the company s staffing services and certain staff leasing clients decline during the year end holiday season and periods of inclement weather 
correspondingly  demand for staffing services and the operations of some staff leasing clients  particularly agricultural and forest products related companies  increase during the second and third quarters 
liquidity and capital resources the company s net cash position of  at december  increased  from year end the increase was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from the exercise of warrants to purchase common stock  offset in part by funds used to acquire two temporary staffing businesses and funds used for net purchases of restricted marketable securities 
net cash provided by operating activities for amounted to  compared to  for for  the cash flow generated by net income and increases in accrued payroll and related benefits was offset in part by a  increase in accounts receivable 
the increase in the year end accounts receivable over was the result of higher sales levels  the acquisition of four businesses in maryland and delaware and an increase in the number of days sales in receivables from days in to days at december  the increase in this ratio is primarily attributable to the increase in the sales mix of staffing services which have longer credit terms than professional employer staff leasing services 
net cash used by investing activities totaled  for  which compares to  for during  the company paid  in cash in connection with two acquisitions and had net purchases of  of restricted marketable securities to satisfy various state and federal self insured workers compensation surety deposit requirements 
during the company paid  in cash in connection with four acquisitions and purchased  in marketable securities 
these activities were primarily funded by the sale of  of marketable securities 
capital expenditures for  consisting principally of office equipment  totaled  the company presently has no material long term capital commitments 
net cash provided by financing activities for totaled  which compares to net cash used by financing activities for of  the principal source of cash provided by financing activities arose from the exercise of warrants by underwriters to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at per share 
such warrants were received by the company s underwriters in connection with its june initial public offering of common stock 
as of the date of this filing  an underwriter continues to hold warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at per share 
the remainder of the increase was due to the exercise of employee incentive stock options 
the company s business strategy continues to be focused on the acquisition of additional personnel related businesses  both in its existing markets and other strategic geographic areas and growth through the expansion of operations at existing offices 
the company actively explores proposals for various acquisition opportunities on an ongoing basis  but there can be no assurance that any additional transactions will be consummated 
the company has an unsecured million revolving credit facility of which there was no outstanding balance at december  see note of the notes to financial statements 
management believes that the available credit facility and other sources of financing  together with anticipated funds generated from operations  will be sufficient in the aggregate to fund the company s working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
inflation inflation generally has not been a significant factor in the company s operations during the periods discussed above 
the company has taken into account the impact of escalating medical and other costs in establishing reserves for future expenses for self insured workers compensation claims
