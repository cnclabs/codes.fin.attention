item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview due to the transactions and the california divestiture  the company believes that its future operating results may not be directly comparable to its historical operating results 
certain factors which are expected to affect the future operating results of the company or their comparability to prior periods are discussed below 
california divestiture 
the company has historically focused on expansion into high growth markets  which led to its entrance into southern california in during the period from through  the company opened stores in southern california and a  square foot distribution center and dairy plant in riverside  california 
management determined that because of the attractive growth prospects in the company s other principal markets and the competitive environment in southern california  it would redeploy company resources from california into such other markets 
in december the company executed a sublease with ralphs pursuant to which ralphs agreed to sublease the riverside distribution center and dairy plant for the remaining year term of the company s lease 
ralphs also agreed to purchase certain related equipment and inventory 
the sublease term commenced and the related purchases were consummated on january  in january  the company entered into agreements to sell or lease of its california stores and related equipment and three non operating properties to various supermarket companies including ralphs and others and indicated that the remaining stores would be closed as soon as practicable 
of the stores being sold or leased  four stores owned by the company are being sold outright  two store leases are being assigned  three stores owned by the company are being leased and seven leased stores are being subleased 
since december   the company has received net cash proceeds of approximately million from the store  equipment and property sales and expects to receive an additional approximately million shortly after the consummation of the transactions 
as of march   all of the california stores have been closed 
in connection with its decision to cease operations in california  the company recorded pre tax restructuring charges of million for the year ended december  to reflect the anticipated cost to the company of the california divestiture

after completion of the california divestiture  the company will continue to own real estate assets in california having an aggregate book value at december  of approximately million 
these assets include the stores leased or subleased as part of the california divestiture having an aggregate book value at december  of million  the closed stores aggregate book value million and certain non operating stores and other excess real estate aggregate book value million 
these properties have annual carrying costs of approximately million excluding depreciation and amortization 
management s present policy is to own and manage its real estate assets  including those in california  in order to maximize their long term values  and  as a result  the company maintains a fully staffed real estate  construction and property management capability 
the company believes that there are several viable strategies for maximizing the value of its california real estate assets over the next five years and that the implementation of these policies would not have any material negative impact on future earnings 
following the consummation of the transactions  management  in conjunction with yucaipa  anticipates that it will pursue a strategy to dispose of certain real estate assets in california on an accelerated basis  including leased stores  closed stores and excess land 
the company would use the net cash proceeds from the sales of these assets to either reinvest in the company s business or reduce indebtedness incurred in connection with the transactions 
if this strategy is adopted  as anticipated  the company would record a charge to earnings  which could be substantial  to reflect the difference between the anticipated cash proceeds from the accelerated dispositions and the company s existing book values and carrying costs for such assets 
this charge will cause a substantial decrease in the company s earnings for such period and net worth  but is not otherwise anticipated to adversely affect the company s liquidity or ongoing results of operations 
debt refinancing and recapitalization charges 
in connection with the anticipated consummation of the transactions at may   the company will refinance approximately million of its existing mortgage notes and unsecured indebtedness as well as approximately million of its revolving credit borrowings 
the company will also refinance approximately million of existing indebtedness of smitty s assuming a tender of the existing senior subordinated notes due of smitty s super valu  inc the smitty s notes and the senior discount debentures due of smitty s the smitty s debentures 
in connection with such debt refinancings  the company will pay make whole and other premiums estimated at approximately million 
these refinancing premiums  together with approximately million of debt issuance costs  will be written off upon the consummation of the transactions and reflected as an extraordinary charge for the quarter in which the transactions are consummated 
it is estimated that this charge  net of taxes  will be approximately million 
the company will also record approximately million of pre tax compensation expense in connection with the purchase of certain management stock options as part of the recapitalization 
integration of arizona operations 
following the merger  management of the company has estimated that approximately million of net annual cost savings as compared to costs for the pro forma combined fiscal year ended december  are achievable by the end of the third year of combined operations 
management believes that approximately million in merger related capital expenditures and approximately million of other expenses will be required to integrate arizona operations and realize such cost savings 
management anticipates that a charge related to such costs will be recorded in the quarter in which the transactions are consummated 
purchase accounting 
the merger will be accounted for as a purchase of smitty s by the company 
as a result  the assets and liabilities of smitty s will be recorded at their estimated fair value as of the date the merger is consummated 
the purchase price for smitty s will be determined by reference to the trading price of the company s class b common stock following the consummation of the merger 
the purchase price in excess of the fair value of smitty s assets will be recorded as goodwill and amortized over a year period 
the actual purchase accounting adjustments will be determined following the merger

the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding in was reduced by approximately million shares  which increased net income per common share by 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash flow from operating activities was million for fiscal and million for fiscal the decrease in cash flow from operating activities was due primarily to balance fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities resulting from the execution of cash management policies based upon cash availability 
trade accounts payable decreased cash provided by operating activities by million in and increased cash provided by operating activities by million in one of the company s principal uses of cash in its operating activities is inventory purchases 
however  supermarket operators typically require small amounts of working capital since inventory is generally sold prior to the time that payments to suppliers are due 
this reduces the need for short term borrowings and allows cash from operations to be used for non current purposes such as financing capital expenditures and other investing activities 
the company s cash used in investing activities was million during fiscal and million during fiscal investing activities consisted primarily of additions to property and equipment for new stores  remodels and equipment purchases 
the company received approximately million of cash from financing activities for fiscal and used approximately million of cash in financing activities in fiscal the primary difference in financing activities from to of million was the repurchase of common stock in in  the company purchased approximately million of its common stock under its stock buy back program 
at december  and january   the company had outstanding million and million  respectively  of long term debt  principally borrowed from insurance companies and other institutional lenders 
the company has not experienced difficulty to date in obtaining financing at satisfactory terms 
assuming that the transactions are not consummated  management believes that the financial resources available to it  including proceeds from sale leaseback transactions  amounts available under existing and future bank lines of credit  additional long term financings and internally generated funds  will be sufficient to meet planned capital expenditures and working capital requirements for the forseeable future  including debt and lease servicing requirements 
certain of the company s existing debt agreements require the company to comply with various financial covenants  including maintenance of certain levels of minimum net worth 
the company was in compliance with all such covenants at december  in order to consummate the transactions  the company expects to utilize total new financing proceeds in the amount of approximately billion 
the company will enter into the new credit facility pursuant to which it will borrow up to million of term loans the new term loans and will have available a million revolving credit facility the new revolving facility  of which approximately million is anticipated to be outstanding at the consummation of the transactions 
the company will also issue million principal amount of new senior notes  million principal amount of new senior subordinated notes and million liquidation preference of new preferred stock 
the proceeds from the new credit facility and the offerings of the company s new securities will provide the sources of financing required to consummate the transactions and pay related fees and expenses including debt refinancing premiums 
the company will also assume certain existing indebtedness of smitty s 
the new revolving facility will be available  subject to the satisfaction of customary borrowing conditions  for working capital requirements and general corporate purposes 
a portion of the new revolving facility may be used to support letters of credit  approximately million of which are anticipated to be outstanding upon consummation of the transactions 
the new revolving facility will be non amortizing and will have a six and one quarter year term 
the company will be required to reduce loans outstanding under the new revolving facility to million for a period of not less than consecutive days during the first months following the merger and to million for a period of not less than consecutive days during each consecutive month period thereafter 
assuming that the merger closes on may   giving effect to currently anticipated borrowings and letter of credit issuances  the company s remaining borrowing availability under the new revolving facility would be approximately million 
pursuant to the new credit facility  the new term loans will be issued in four tranches i tranche a  in the amount of million  will have a six and one quarter year term  ii tranche b  in the amount of million  will have a seven and one half year term  iii tranche c  in the amount of million  will have an eight and one half year term  and iv tranche d  in the amount of million  will have a nine and one quarter year term 
the new term loans will require quarterly amortization payments 
the new credit facility will be guaranteed by each of the company s subsidiaries and secured by liens on substantially all of the unencumbered assets of the company and its subsidiaries and by a pledge of the company s stock in such subsidiaries 
the company will be subject to certain customary affirmative and negative covenants contained in the new credit facility  including  without limitation  covenants that restrict  subject to specified exceptions  i the incurrence of additional indebtedness and other obligations  ii mergers and acquisitions  iii asset sales  iv the granting of liens  v prepayment or repurchase of other indebtedness  vi engaging in transactions with affiliates  vii capital expenditures  viii the making of investments  ix dividends and other payments with respect to equity interests  or x rental payments 
in addition  the new credit facility will require that the company maintain certain specified financial covenants  including a minimum fixed charge coverage  a minimum operating cash flow  a maximum ratio of total debt to operating cash flow and a minimum net worth 
the capital expenditures of the company excluding expenditures in california were million for fiscal and million for fiscal the company currently anticipates that its aggregate capital expenditures for fiscal will be approximately million  excluding the approximately million of capital expenditures which are estimated to be required in connection with the integration of arizona operations 
the company intends to finance these capital expenditures primarily with cash provided by operations and other sources of liquidity including borrowings and leases 
no assurance can be given that sources of financing for capital expenditures will be available or sufficient 
however  the capital expenditure program has substantial flexibility and is subject to revision based on various factors 
management believes that if the company were to substantially reduce or postpone these programs  there would be no substantial impact on short term operating profitability 
in the long term  however  if these programs were substantially reduced  management believes its operating businesses  and ultimately its cash flow  would be adversely affected 
the capital expenditures discussed above do not include potential acquisitions which the company could make to expand within its existing markets or to enter other markets 
future acquisitions may require the company to seek additional debt or equity financing depending on the size of the transaction 
with the exception of the transactions  the company is not currently engaged in discussions concerning any material acquisition which it considers probable 
following the consummation of the transactions  the company will be highly leveraged 
based upon current levels of operations and anticipated cost savings and future growth  the company believes that its cash flow from operations  together with available borrowings under the new revolving facility and its other sources of liquidity including leases  will be adequate to meet its anticipated requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  lease payments  interest payments and scheduled principal payments 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s business will continue to generate cash flow at or above current levels or that estimated cost savings or growth can be achieved 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of the financial accounting standards board has issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the company will be required to adopt this standard in the first quarter of the company has not performed the complex analysis required to determine the effect of implementing this new standard 
management does not currently believe the adoption of sfas no 
would have a significant impact on the company s financial condition 
effects of inflation the company s primary costs  inventory and labor  are affected by a number of factors that are beyond its control  including availability and price of merchandise  the competitive climate and general and regional economic conditions 
as is typical of the supermarket industry  the company has generally been able to maintain gross profit margins by adjusting retail prices  but competitive conditions may from time to time render the company unable to do so while maintaining its market share
