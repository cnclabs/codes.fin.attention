racing operations the registrant is subject to annual licensing requirements established by the west virginia racing commission the racing commission  the registrant s license was renewed in december  through december the registrant s revenue from racing operations is derived mainly from commissions earned on parimutuel wagering on live races held at mountaineer and on races conducted at other host racetracks and broadcast live ie  import simulcast at mountaineer 
in parimutuel wagering  patrons bet against each other rather than against the operator of the facility or with pre set odds 
the dollars wagered form a pool of funds from which winnings are paid based on odds determined solely by the wagering activity 
the racetrack acts as a stakeholder for the wagering patrons and deducts from the amounts wagered a take out or gross commission  from which the racetrack pays state and county taxes and racing purses 
the registrant s parimutuel commission rates are fixed as a percentage of the total handle or amounts wagered 
with respect to mountaineer s live racing operations  such percentage is fixed by west virginia law at three levels   and  depending on the complexity of the wager 
the lower rate applies to wagering pools involving only wins  place and show wagers while the higher rates apply to pools involving wagers on specified multiple events  such as trifecta  quinella and perfecta wagers 
with respect to simulcast racing operations  mountaineer generally has opted to apply the commission rates imposed by the jurisdictions of the host racetracks  as it may do with the consent of the racing commission 
such rates vary with each jurisdiction and may be more or less favorable than the live racing commission rates 
out of its gross commissions  mountaineer is required to distribute fixed percentages to its fund for the payment of regular purses the regular purse fund  the state  hancock county and  with respect to commissions derived from simulcast operations  mountaineer s employee pension plan fund 
after deducting state and county taxes and  with respect to simulcast commission  simulcast fees and expenses and employee pension plan contributions  approximately one half the remainder of the commission is payable to the regular purse fund

management of video lottery operations american gaming entertainment  ltd 
agel  formerly named gamma international  ltd 
was engaged by the registrant pursuant to a june management agreement the management agreement to provide management services for video lottery and other gaming activities at mountaineer permitted under west virginia law  other than its parimutuel horse racing operations the permitted activities 
under the management agreement  agel was entitled to receive a management fee of of the gross revenues of the permitted activities 
in addition  agel was entitled to receive of the earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization of all businesses conducted at or  in the case of off track betting  generated as a result of the operations at mountaineer  including the permitted activities and all parimutuel horse racing operations 
the registrant s management agreement with agel was suspended pursuant to a stay agreement effective june  until such time as the registrant s construction loan lender  bennett management and development corporation bennett complied with certain requirements of the lottery commission 
in july  agel assigned its right to conduct business with mountaineer to american newco  inc  a company owned by two officers and shareholders of agel 
simultaneously  american newco  inc entered into a consulting agreement with mpi to provide consulting services in connection with mountaineer s video lottery operations at the rate of  per month  subject to increases of up to  per month for possible additional services to be provided through march  fees under this consulting agreement are substantially less than those which would have been paid under the original management agreement 
the agreements provide that if the stay agreement or the consulting agreement are terminated in accordance with certain specified contingencies  the management agreement will also terminate 
however  the agreements also provided that if bennett should fulfill certain requirements of the lottery commission and declare not earlier than january  that it will continue as lender to mpi on a permanent basis  then the management agreement will be reinstated prospectively 
the personal involvement of the two shareholders of american newco  inc in the consulting activities is a material element of the consulting agreement 
similarly  the personal involvement of mr 
al luciani with agel is a material element of the management agreement 
since august  neither shareholder has provided such services for american newco and mr 
luciani has left the employ of agel 
management believes that there has been a material failure of performance under each agreement and  as a result  the registrant has paid no consulting fees to american newco  inc since that time 
although there can be no assurance  management believes that the management agreement will not be reinstated 
on march  the sec filed suit against the bennett funding corporation  the parent of bennett and an affiliate of a major shareholder of agel  seeking a financial judgment and civil penalties for actions that are unrelated to bennett s lending activities to mountaineer in west virginia 
also named in the suit was patrick bennett  chief executive officer of bennett  the registrant s construction lender 
management does not believe that these recent developments will have a material negative impact on the registrant s licenses or financing efforts

occupancy rates and room rates for the months ended december and averaged and  and and  respectively 
lodge facilities also include the mountaineer lodge dining room  which seats patrons for casual dining overlooking the golf course 
food and beverages are also available at the lodge in the speakeasy gaming saloon and the iron horse lounge 
table and barstool seating is available in the speakeasy gaming saloon and the iron horse lounge for the video lottery gaming and off track wagering patrons accommodated there 
the lodge and its food and beverage operations are operated in combination with its entertainment facilities and is utilized principally to increase racing attendance and video lottery play 
accordingly  the registrant maintains inexpensive room rates 
improvement plan and expanded operations since its acquisition in december  the registrant has been engaged in an ongoing effort to renovate and  more recently  enhance and expand mountaineer  which was first opened in prior to west virginia s adoption of the video lottery act in march  the registrant completed certain renovations necessary to maintain the clubhouse and lower grandstand areas  including upgrades to the plumbing and electrical systems  the installation of new furniture and finishes and the redesign of the grandstand parimutuel wagering windows 
these improvements were made during in  the registrant commenced its capital improvement program  designed to upgrade and expand mountaineer s existing facilities to a level which would allow its marketing as an upper scale gaming and racing destination resort 
in and  mountaineer invested million in building improvements  furnishings  fixtures and equipment suitable for large scale gaming activities in its race track grandstand and clubhouse  and an additional  to convert a portion of existing lodge space to gaming areas 
in response to increased patronage at its lodge gaming areas  mountaineer embarked upon an  square foot expansion to the lodge video lottery facilities in at december   mountaineer operated the riverside gaming terrace in the racetrack clubhouse and grandstand facilities  with video lottery terminals arranged on either side of a central lounge and hallway 
the speakeasy gaming saloon is the primary gaming venue in the lodge building  with video lottery terminals in operation  including in a non smoking location 
a separate lounge area adjacent to the lodge restaurant contains additional terminals 
areas in the riverside gaming terrace and speakeasy gaming saloon suitable for the addition of vlts were constructed in  and the ancillary facilities necessary to efficiently operate these additional vlts are already in place 
mountaineer has expanded its off track betting facilities in both the racetrack and lodge locations 
in and  the registrant invested million in two track side restaurants offering seating for  racing patrons  with new inch television monitors located at each table  and a total of overhead monitors with inch screens 
a simulcast control center is located in the clubhouse restaurant  which also offers video and graphic overlay capabilities 
this system enables the registrant to promote upcoming events and mountaineer s other entertainment facilities  as well as the day s live and off track racing schedule 
in  mountaineer completed the renovation of its lodge off track betting facility  offering seating for patrons in the speakeasy gaming saloon 
the lodge simulcasting facility is served by twenty four inch television monitors  as well as a foot projection screen 
the registrant currently has available mutuels windows in the racetrack facility and windows in the lodge speakeasy gaming saloon  to be supplemented by self activated portable betting terminals in and beyond 
the registrant also created a boxing arena and entertainment stage  which it has integrated into the grandstand seating 
the stage is an integral component of the registrant s efforts to expand mountaineer s customer base by offering new  complementary forms of entertainment 
mountaineer has hosted five boxing events since december  including nationally televised bouts on espn and usa cable 
mountaineer paid fixed fees and provided certain lodging at no charge to the event promoters 
mountaineer retained all proceeds from ticket sales  food and beverage sales and program sales 
management intends to engage in similar events to increase public awareness and to thereby help to increase future attendance at mountaineer 
the lodge lobby and reception area were renovated in  followed by restoration of guest rooms damaged by fire and a general renovation and upgrade of the remaining guest rooms and common areas in remaining components of the improvement plan scheduled for completion in consist of enhancements to the speakeasy gaming saloon  parking lot expansion and general paving 
the cost of these improvements is not expected to exceed million 
business strategy the registrant s business strategy is to increase revenues in all areas of operations through the promotion and expansion of its video lottery business and the enhancement of its racing and entertainment facilities 
develop and market mountaineer as diversified entertainment facility the registrant believes that the mountaineer racetrack facility has not performed to its potential in the past because it was utilized primarily to conduct parimutuel racing  thereby limiting the facility s customer base and under utilizing its sizable infrastructure during non racing times 
the expansion of video lottery operations and the introduction of bingo for local senior groups and boxing events at mountaineer has begun to remedy these effects 
management believes that the addition of such improvements and programs to those already completed  will provide the right product mix to attract an increasing number of visitors and more efficiently use mountaineer s facilities during non racing times 
it is anticipated that the resulting benefits will be shared by parimutuel  as well as video lottery and other entertainment operations  since patrons who traditionally do not visit horse racetracks may be  once at mountaineer  more inclined to wager on racing 
in addition  because a significant percentage of revenues from video lottery operations must be contributed to the racing purse fund  as video lottery revenues increase  so will the size of purses 
management believes that this will have the effect of attracting better quality racehorses  further enhancing mountaineer s appeal to traditional horse racing fans who are largely responsible for mountaineer s parimutuel revenues 
expand video lottery operations the registrant intends to expand its video lottery operations by adding up to vlts which were authorized by the lottery commission in the registrant believes that its video lottery revenues will continue to increase with the installation of new machines  the implementation of progressives and video slot games  and the implementation of its expanded marketing plan 
with its current involvement in video lottery gaming and parimutuel racing  its substantial infrastructure and grounds  and the attractive location of its facility  mountaineer is positioned to take advantage of any future forms of gaming which may be legalized in west virginia 
relocate off track wagering the registrant recently relocated its primary simulcasting operations to the speakeasy gaming saloon at the lodge 
management believes that by exposing video lottery patrons to simulcast and live racing  new racing fans can be developed  thereby increasing parimutuel operations 
the expanded clubhouse simulcast facilities are also expected to create additional excitement and increase the level of activity at the racetrack on live race days 
improve live racing product and commence export simulcasting outside hub area the registrant s ability to attract attendance at mountaineer and wagering on its live races is dependent  in part  upon the quality of the horses racing at mountaineer 
horse races at racetracks competing with mountaineer  and at the racetracks from which mountaineer receives import simulcasts  have often been of higher quality than mountaineer s horse races  thereby attracting a larger volume of wagering and higher average wagers at mountaineer 
beginning in october  mountaineer has been able to attract better quality horses by paying incrementally higher purses 
the increased purses reflect an increase in the minimum daily purses guaranteed pursuant to the registrant s agreement with the horsemen 
management s ability to increase further the size of purses will depend on increased video lottery operations and  to a lesser extent  expanded simulcast racing operations 
the registrant anticipates that it will be able to continue increasing purse sizes to levels attractive to owners of mid level quality or better racehorses 
management also expects to sponsor several stakes races in  with purses of up to  per race 
in september  mountaineer sponsored the west virginia breeders classics stakes races  with purses totaling  funded by state wide video lottery tax revenue 
mountaineer broadcast the stakes races to a number of other racetracks around the country  and intends to simulcast its regular card of live races within the next year 
wagering handles from participating racetracks are commingled with mountaineer s on site wagering handle when it exports its simulcast signal 
commence export simulcasting outside hub area export simulcasting is a highly desirable source of revenue because the direct costs associated with such operations are relatively low 
the registrant believes that the higher average purses anticipated from video lottery contributions will improve the quality of races to other racetracks  off track betting facilities  casinos and other gaming establishments once it has completed its improvement plan 
in order to make its races more attractive to simulcast outlets  the registrant anticipates that it will experiment with different post times  possibly adopting more evening racing days which are preferable because they do not compete with live racing conducted by host tracks 
increasing import simulcasting the registrant intends to increase the number and quality of races it makes available for wagering by simulcasting additional out of state races 
although management does not anticipate that it will increase the number of import signals it can receive simultaneously  it will increase the number of races displayed with each available signal 
in may  mountaineer introduced off track greyhound racing  and has since offered thoroughbred and or greyhound import simulcasting days per week 
because operating expenses associated with simulcast racing are generally lower than those associated with live racing  management believes that increases in the levels of simulcast wagering would result in greater operating profits than similar increases in live racing levels 
marketing mountaineer s primary market includes million persons of gaming age who reside within a one hour drive  or approximately miles  of the facility including the population centers of pittsburgh  pennsylvania  youngstown warren and akron canton  ohio  and wheeling  west virginia 
a secondary market of million persons of gaming age reside within a two hour drive  including cleveland  ohio and morgantown  west virginia 
both markets have an average household income of approximately  the registrant has adopted and is in the process of implementing a comprehensive marketing program to capitalize on mountaineer s recently expanded gaming facilities to create a larger and more loyal customer base 
the program includes i the players club  a player rating and tracking system designed to reward qualified play through the issuance of reward certificates which are redeemable for food and beverages  merchandise and other services  ii entertainment programming featuring boxing and other special events  iii attractive food and beverage pricing  iv comprehensive advertising  and v a bus program 
some features of the program are subject to approval by the lottery commission 
prior to the formulation of the new marketing program  the registrant s marketing efforts consisted of limited television  radio and print advertising and promotional events tied to major holidays or horse racing events 
competition mountaineer s principal direct competitors are wheeling downs  located approximately miles to the south in wheeling  west virginia and thistledown  located approximately miles to the northwest in cleveland  ohio 
wheeling downs conducts parimutuel greyhound dog racing and video lottery gaming 
thistledown conducts parimutuel thoroughbred horse racing but not video lottery 
other than wheeling downs and thistledown  there are currently no facilities offering competitive parimutuel live thoroughbred or video lottery gaming within a mile radius of mountaineer 
as a result  although there are facilities located more than miles away  management does not believe that such other facilities compete with mountaineer for a significant segment of its target customer base although they do compete to some extent for quality racehorses 
in addition  none of those facilities  all of which are located in pennsylvania and ohio  are currently licensed to offer video lottery gaming 
moreover  the one facility in west virginia  other than mountaineer and wheeling downs  offering video lottery is located in the central part of the state and  as a result  does not compete with mountaineer for customers 
however  the registrant does compete with statewide lotteries in west virginia  pennsylvania and ohio  off track wagering in pennsylvania and other entertainment options available to consumers  including live and televised professional and collegiate major sports events 
the registrant will also compete with off track wagering in ohio  if implemented as proposed 
the registrant is attempting to attract patrons by promoting mountaineer as a complete entertainment complex and destination resort offering a unique combination of quality racing  video lottery wagering  dining  special events and other entertainment options  all in a physically attractive setting which is easily accessed with ample on site parking 
to the extent that pennsylvania or ohio legalize any forms of casino gaming  the registrant s video lottery operations will compete with new gaming facilities located within driving distances from mountaineer s geographic market 
such facilities may offer more gaming machines than mountaineer as well as forms of gaming not available in west virginia 
there is no assurance that such any of such forms of competition will develop  however  management believes that the development of mountaineer into a complete entertainment complex is necessary in order to compete with casino gaming  if any  introduced in neighboring jurisdictions 
employees as of april   approximately full time persons and part time persons were employed at mountaineer  of whom approximately were represented by a labor union under a collective bargaining agreement 
as of april   the registrant also employed one part time person in its oil and gas operations in ada  michigan and  in addition to management  one person  at its corporate offices in laguna beach  california 
the registrant believes that its employee relations are good 
regulation and licensing racing the registrant s horse racing operations are subject to extensive regulation by the racing commission  which is responsible for  among other things  granting annual licenses to conduct race meets  approving simulcasting activities and establishing and regulating wagering procedures  minimum purses  post times  and other matters 
when granting licenses the racing commission has the authority to determine the dates on which mountaineer may conduct races 
in order to conduct simulcast racing  mountaineer is required under west virginia law to hold a minimum of live race days each year 
mountaineer was granted a license to conduct live race days for its meet 
west virginia law requires that at least of mountaineer s employees must be citizens and residents of west virginia and must have been such for at least one year 
in addition  certain activities  such as simulcasting races  require the consent of the representatives of the majority of the horse owners and trainers at mountaineer 
mountaineer s revenues from live racing operations are derived substantially from its parimutuel commissions  which are fixed by the state of west virginia as percentages of mountaineer s wagering handles 
the west virginia legislature could change these percentages at any time  although the registrant is not aware of any current proposal to do so 
the registrant s simulcast activities that occur outside of west virginia could be subject to regulation of other state racing commissions  as well as the provisions of the federal interstate horse racing act of  which prohibits mountaineer from accepting off track wagering on simulcast racing without the approval of the racing commission and  subject to certain exceptions  of any other currently operating track within miles  or if none  of the closest track in any adjoining state 
video lottery the operation of video lottery games in west virginia is subject to the video lottery act 
licensing and regulatory control is provided by the lottery commission 
prior to the adoption of the video lottery act in march  the registrant conducted video lottery gaming under the west virginia state lottery act pursuant to an agreement with the lottery commission which authorized the registrant to operate video lottery machines at the racetrack and lodge as part of a video lottery pilot project 
under the terms of the agreement  the registrant retained ownership or control of the video lottery machines and other equipment it provided for use in video lottery gaming 
in march  the attorney general of west virginia issued an opinion that  under the west virginia constitution  video lottery machines could not be privately owned 
as a result of the attorney general s opinion  the registrant was unable to renew its agreement with the lottery commission  which was scheduled to expire in june in october  the supreme court of appeals of west virginia found that the legislature had not adequately defined and authorized video lottery gaming and  as a result  the lottery commission s authorization of video lottery gaming at mountaineer was invalid 
the court s order was to become effective in late november  at which time video lottery gaming at mountaineer would have had to terminate 
however  the court stayed its order pending consideration and passage of satisfactory video lottery legislation 
the subsequent adoption of the video lottery act has not been contested in or otherwise addressed by the court or any other west virginia court 
under the video lottery act  only parimutuel horse or dog racing facilities that were licensed by the racing commission prior to january  and that conduct at least live racing dates for each dog or horse race meeting  or such other number as may be approved by the racing commission  are eligible for licensure to operate video lottery games 
there are four racing facilities in west virginia two horse racing and two dog racing including mountaineer  three of which satisfy the eligibility requirements of the conduct of video lottery gaming by a racing facility is subject to the approval of voters of the county in which such facility is located 
if such approval is obtained  the facility may continue to conduct racing activities unless the matter is resubmitted to the voters pursuant to a petition by at least of the registered voters  who must wait at least five years to bring such a petition 
if approval is denied  another election on the issue may not be held for a period of two years 
video lottery gaming was approved in hancock county  the location of mountaineer  on may  in order to qualify as a video lottery game  as the term is defined under the video lottery act  a game must  among other things  be a game of chance which utilizes an interactive electronic terminal device allowing input by an individual player and is not based on any of the following game themes  roulette  dice  baccarat card games or games having a video display depicting symbols which appear to roll on drums to simulate classic casino slot machines 
moreover  video lottery machines must meet strict hardware and software specifications  including minimum and maximum pay out requirements  and must be connected to the lottery commission s central control computer by an on line or dial up communications systems 
only machines registered with and approved by the lottery commission may offer video lottery games 
under the video lottery act  racetracks that conduct video lottery gaming  as well as persons who service and repair video lottery machines and validation managers persons who perform video lottery ticket redemption services are required to be licensed by the lottery commission 
the licensing application procedures are extensive and include inquiries into and an evaluation of the character  background including criminal record  reputation and associations and business ability and experience of an applicant and the adequacy and source of the applicant s financing arrangements 
in addition  a racetrack applicant must hold a valid racing license  have an agreement regarding video lottery revenues with the representatives of the majority of the horsemen  the parimutuel clerks and the breeders for the racetrack and post a bond or irrevocable letter of credit in such amount as the lottery commission shall determine 
finally  no license will be granted until the lottery commission determines that each person who has control of an applicant meets all of the applicable licensing qualifications 
persons deemed to have control of a corporate applicant include i any holding or parent company or subsidiary of the applicant who has the ability to elect a majority of the applicant s board of directors or to otherwise control the activities of the applicant  and ii key personnel of an applicant  including any executive officer  employee or agent  who has the power to exercise significant influence over decisions concerning any part of the applicant s business operations 
the registrant s license application was approved by the lottery commission in june from march until such approval  the registrant conducted video lottery gaming under a provision of the video lottery act that permitted any racetrack authorized by the lottery commission to conduct video lottery gaming prior to november  to continue to do so for a limited time without additional licensure 
licenses granted by the lottery commission must be renewed on july of each year 
a license to operate video lottery games is a privilege personal to the license holder and  accordingly  is non transferable 
in order for a license to remain in effect  lottery commission approval is required prior to any change of ownership or control of a license holder 
unless prior approval of the lottery commission is obtained  the sale of five percent or more of the voting stock of the license holder or any corporation that controls the license holder or the sale of a license holder s assets other than in the ordinary course of business  or any interest therein  to any person not previously determined by the lottery commission to have satisfied the licensing qualifications voids the license 
once licensed  a racetrack has the right to install and operate up to video lottery machines and may operate more than machines only upon lottery commission approval 
the registrant has received approval to operate a total of  machines 
video lottery machines may only be operated in the areas of the racetrack where parimutuel wagering is permitted  provided  however  that if a racetrack was authorized by the lottery commission prior to november  to operate video lottery machines in another area of the racetrack s facilities  such racetrack may continue to do so as long as there is one video lottery machine in the parimutuel wagering area for each machine located in another area of the racetrack 
accordingly  the registrant may continue to operate video lottery machines at the lodge  providing there are at least as many machines located at mountaineer s racetrack 
the video lottery act imposes extensive operational controls relating to  among other matters  security and supervision  access to the machines  hours of operation  general liability insurance coverage and machine location 
in addition  the video lottery act prohibits the extension of credit for video lottery play and requires lottery commission approval before any video lottery advertising and promotional activities are conducted 
the video lottery act provides for criminal and civil liability in the event of specified violations 
all revenues derived from the operation of video lottery games must be deposited with the lottery commission to be shared in accordance with the provisions of the video lottery act 
under such provisions  each racetrack must electronically remit to the lottery commission its gross terminal income total cash deposited into video lottery machines less the value of credits cleared for winning redemption tickets 
to ensure the availability of such funds to the lottery commission  each racetrack must maintain in its account an amount equal to or greater than the gross terminal income to be remitted 
if a racetrack fails to maintain this balance  the lottery commission may disable all of the racetrack s video lottery machines until full payment of all amounts due is made 
from the gross terminal income remitted by a licensee  the lottery commission will deduct up to to cover its costs of administering video lottery at the licensee s racetrack and divide the remaining amounts as follows is returned to the racetrack  is paid to the state s general revenue fund  is deposited in the racetrack s fund for the payment of purses  and the remaining is divided among tourism promotion  hancock county  breeders classics  veterans memorial program and the racetrack employees pension fund 
discontinued operations bartlett field leases ohio in january  the registrant  through its wholly owned subsidiary  excal energy corporation excal acquired approximately  net developed acres and  net undeveloped acres held by production of oil and gas leases in the bartlett field in southeastern ohio from biscayne petroleum corporation  an affiliate of edson r 
arneault  a director of the registrant 
the registrant agreed to provide funds to drill gas wells on such properties  and in  the registrant attempted to raise the required capital through a public offering
