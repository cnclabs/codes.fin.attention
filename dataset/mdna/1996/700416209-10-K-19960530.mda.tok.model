the company s customers for its advanced printed circuit materials include leading independent circuit board fabricators and large electronic equipment manufacturers in the computer  telecommunications  transportation  aerospace and instrumentation indus tries 
the company s electronic materials operations accounted for more than of net sales worldwide and more than of operating profit in each of the last three fiscal years 
the company s foreign electronic materials operations accounted for an average of approximately of net sales worldwide for the and fiscal years and approximately for the fiscal year ended march  the company s sales growth during the last three fiscal years has been led by strong growth in sales by its united states and singapore electronic materials operations 
more recently  increased sales by the company s european operations have also contributed to this growth 
the company s ongoing efforts to expand its higher technology  higher margin product lines have contributed to the growth of the company s sales of electronic materials during this period 
the company has also improved the manufacturing efficiencies of its electronic materials business since the beginning of its fiscal year 
these improvements have been the result of consolidating functions  more effective capacity utilization  reducing manufacturing waste and improving yields  improving the overall productivity of the company s workforce  and redesigning product in order to reduce material costs 
sales volume of the company s electronic materials segment has increased during each of the last three fiscal years 
however  growth of the company s electronic materials business was constrained during the fiscal year by the company s available manufacturing capacity 
during the fiscal year  the company expanded its manufacturing capacity in newburgh  new york and tempe  arizona  and commenced commercial operations in both locations during the early part of the fiscal year 
the company is considering further expansions of its electronic materials operations  particularly in the united states and southeast asia 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year the company s electronic materials business was responsible for the improvement in the company s results of operations for the fiscal year ended march  the united states and asian markets for sophisticated printed circuit materials were strong during the fiscal year  and the company s electronic materials operations located in these regions performed well as a result 
while the market in europe for sophisticated printed circuit materials has not been as strong as in the united states or asia  it improved over the prior fiscal year  and the company s european operations benefitted from this improvement 
during the fiscal year  the company s electronic materials business incurred raw material cost increases and additional costs associated with the company s ongoing major expansion projects in newburgh  new york and tempe  arizona 
in addition  the electronic materials business experienced temporary inefficiencies caused by operating certain facilities at levels in excess of their designed manufacturing capacity 
these cost increases and temporary operating inefficiencies adversely affected the company s gross margins 
however  the company was able to offset such effects by improving its overall operating efficiencies  in part  by consolidating functions  by continuing to reduce manufacturing waste and improve yields  and by improving the overall productivity of its workforce 
in addition  the company redesigned product in order to reduce material costs 
the company was also able to offset these cost increases and inefficiencies through its ongoing efforts to expand its higher technology  higher margin product lines 
operating results of the company s plumbing and industrial components business were not significant during the fiscal year 
results of operations sales for the fiscal year ended march  increased to million from million for the fiscal year ended february  sales of the electronic materials business for the fiscal year were million  or of total sales worldwide  compared with million  or of total sales worldwide  for the fiscal year 
this increase in sales of electronic materials was principally the result of higher volume of electronic materials shipped and an increase in sales of higher technology products 
sales of the plumbing and industrial components business for the fiscal year increased to million from million for the fiscal year 
the company s foreign electronic materials operations accounted for million of sales  or of the company s total sales worldwide  during the fiscal year compared with million of sales  or of total sales worldwide  during the fiscal year 
sales by the company s foreign operations during the fiscal year increased from the fiscal year 
while sales by each of the company s foreign operations were higher in the fiscal year compared with the fiscal year  the increase in sales by foreign operations was principally due to an increase in sales by the company s singapore operations 
the expansion of the company s singapore manufacturing facility was completed at the end of the company s fiscal year 
the gross margin for the company s worldwide operations was during the fiscal year compared with for the fiscal year 
the improvement in the gross margin was attributable to the increase in sales volume over the prior fiscal year  the continuing growth in sales of higher technology  higher margin products and improved operating efficien cies 
this improvement was offset in part by higher raw material costs  costs associated with the start up of the new facilities in newburgh  new york and tempe  arizona  and inefficiencies caused by operating certain facilities at levels in excess of designed capacity 
selling  general and administrative expenses  measured as a percentage of sales  were during the fiscal year compared with during the fiscal year 
this reduction was a function of the partially fixed nature of the selling  general and administrative expenses relative to the increase in sales 
for the reasons set forth above  profit from operations for the fiscal year increased to million from million for the fiscal year 
interest and other income  principally investment income  increased to million for the fiscal year from million for the fiscal year 
the increase in investment income was attributable to the increase in the prevailing interest rates during the current year and to the increase in cash available for investment 
the company s investments were primarily short term taxable instruments and government securities 
interest expense for the fiscal year was minimal compared with million during the fiscal year 
during the first quarter of the prior fiscal year  the company called its convertible subordinated debentures for redemption  as a result  nearly all of such debentures outstanding at the beginning of the prior fiscal year were converted into common stock during that fiscal year s first quarter  which eliminated the company s long term debt and the associated interest expense 
the company s effective income tax rate for the fiscal year was compared with for the fiscal year 
this decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of favorable foreign tax rate differentials 
net earnings for the fiscal year increased to million from million for the fiscal year 
primary and fully diluted earnings per share increased to and  respectively  for the fiscal year from and  respectively  for the fiscal year 
this increase in net earnings and earnings per share was primarily attributable to the increase in the profit from operations  the effects of the conversion of the debentures and the lower effective tax rate 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year the electronic materials business in the united states and singapore continued its strong growth in the fiscal year ended february  which significantly improved the company s operating results during that fiscal year 
as a result of this growth  enhanced operating efficiencies and continued emphasis on higher technology products  the operating profits of the electronic materials business were sufficient to offset the impact of rising raw material costs and pricing pressures 
the company s european electronic materials operations also improved during the fiscal year as a result of strengthening in the european market for the company s products 
the company focused its capital investments during the fiscal year principally on its electronic materials business for the purpose of enhancing capability and expanding capacity 
the company also continued to invest in its electronic materials business leading edge technology and product development efforts 
the expansion of the company s singapore facility was completed at the end of the company s fiscal year 
during the second half of the fiscal year  the company s plumbing hardware business returned to modest profitability 
the company s advanced composite business performance improved during the fiscal year under its new management team as it refocused its products towards non military applications  such as wireless communications 
the company s specialty adhesive tape business performed well during the fiscal year  with increased sales and earnings due in part to focusing towards high technology  high margin products 
results of operations sales for the fiscal year ended february  increased to million from million for the fiscal year ended february  sales of the electronic materials operations for the fiscal year were million  or of total sales worldwide  compared with million  or of total sales worldwide  for the fiscal year 
this increase in sales of electronic materials was principally the result of higher volume of electronic materials shipped 
sales of the plumbing and industrial component business for the fiscal year increased to million from million for the fiscal year  principally due to increased volume 
the company s foreign electronic materials operations accounted for million of sales  or of the company s total sales worldwide  during the fiscal year compared with million  or of total sales worldwide  during the fiscal year 
sales by the company s foreign operations during the fiscal year increased from the fiscal year 
while sales by the company s foreign operations were higher in the fiscal year at each of the company s foreign operations compared with the fiscal year  the increase in sales by foreign operations was principally due to increased sales of the company s singapore operations 
the gross margin for the company s worldwide operations was for the fiscal year compared with for the fiscal year 
the gross margin improved as a result of operating efficiencies  attributable in part to the increase in sales volume  more effective capacity utilization and reduced manufacturing waste 
selling  general and administrative expenses  measured as a percentage of sales  were during the fiscal year compared with during the fiscal year 
this reduction was a function of the partially fixed nature of the selling  general and administrative expenses relative to the increase in sales 
for the reasons set forth above  profit from operations for the fiscal year increased to million from million for the fiscal year 
interest and other income  principally investment income  increased to million during the fiscal year from million during the fiscal year 
this increase in investment income occurred because the average rate of interest earned by the company during the fiscal year was higher than during the fiscal year and because the company had more cash available for investment 
the company s investments were primarily short term taxable instruments and government securities 
during the fiscal year  interest expense decreased to million from million during the fiscal year 
this expense was attributable to interest on the company s convertible subordinated debentures and  to a lesser extent  on loans carried by certain of the company s foreign subsidiaries 
the decrease in this expense was due to the call for redemption of such debentures  nearly all of which were converted into common stock by may  the company s effective income tax rate for the fiscal year was compared with for the fiscal year 
the effective tax rate for the fiscal year decreased due to the impact of foreign net operating losses without tax benefit and favorable foreign tax rate differentials  offset in part by a reduction in general business credits 
the company s net earnings increased in the fiscal year to million from million during the fiscal year 
primary and fully diluted earnings per share increased to and  respectively  for the fiscal year compared with and  respectively  for the fiscal year 
the increase in net earnings and earnings per share was attributable principally to the increase in profit from operations and the effects of the conversion of debentures into common stock 
liquidity and capital resources at march   the company s cash and temporary investments were million compared with million at february   the end of the company s fiscal year 
the increase in the company s cash and investment position at march  was attributable to the receipt of million from the sale of the company s convertible subordinated notes due the notes on february  and cash provided from operating activities in excess of investments in property  plant and equipment  as discussed below 
the company s working capital was million at march  compared with million at february  the increase at march  compared with february  was due to the proceeds from the sale of the notes and increases in receivables and inventories  offset in part by higher payables 
the increase in receivables at march  compared with february  was due principally to increased sales  the increase in inventories for the same period was due to increased sales and to higher purchases of raw materials to ensure adequate supply of such materials 
the company s current ratio the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to at march  compared with to at february  during the fiscal year  the company generated funds from operations of million and expended million for the purchase of property  plant and equipment 
cash provided by net earnings before depreciation and amortization of million was reduced by a net increase in non cash working capital items  resulting in million of cash provided from operating activities 
a significant portion of the fiscal year s capital expenditures related to installation of additional capacity at new electronic materials facilities in newburgh  new york and tempe  arizona 
these expansions will increase the company s capacity and capability for the production of sophisticated printed circuit materials 
expenditures for property  plant and equipment were million  million and million in the  and fiscal years  respec tively 
the company expects the level of capital expenditures in the fiscal year to be in the same range as in the fiscal year 
the company is currently considering further expansions of its electronic materials operations  particularly in the united states and southeast asia 
at march   the company s only long term debt was the notes 
the company believes its financial resources will be sufficient  for the foreseeable future  to provide for continued investment in property  plant and equipment and for general corporate purposes 
such resources  including the proceeds from the notes  would also be available for appropriate acquisitions and other expansions of the company s business 
factors that may affect future results 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a new safe harbor for forward looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information about their companies without fear of litigation so long as those statements are identified as forward looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the statement 
accordingly  the company hereby identifies the following important factors which could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from any such results which might be projected  forecast  estimated or budgeted by the company in forward looking state ments 

the company s business is dependent on certain aspects of the electronics industry  which is a cyclical industry and which has experienced recurring downturns 
the downturns  such as occurred in the first quarter of the company s fiscal year ending march   can be unexpected and have often reduced demand for  and prices of  electronic materials 

the company s operating results are affected by a number of factors  including various factors beyond the company s control 
such factors include economic conditions in the electronics industry  the timing of customer orders  product prices  process yields  the mix of products sold and maintenance related shutdowns of facilities 
operating results also can be influenced by development and introduction of new products and the costs associated with the start up of new facilities 

rapid technological advances in semiconductors and electronic equipment have placed rigorous demands on the electronic materials manufactured by the company and used in printed circuit board production 
the company s operating results will be affected by the company s ability to maintain and increase its technological and manufacturing capability and expertise in this rapidly changing industry 

the electronic materials industry is intensely competitive and the company competes worldwide in the market for materials used in the production of complex multilayer printed circuit boards 
the company s competitors are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than the company  and the company s operating results will be affected by its ability to maintain its competitive position in the industry 

there are a limited number of qualified suppliers of the principal materials used by the company in its manufacture of electronic materials products 
substitutes for these products are not readily available  and in the recent past there have been shortages in the market for certain of these materials 

the company s customer base is concentrated  in part  because the company s business strategy has been to develop long term relation ships with a select group of customers 
during the company s fiscal year ended march   the company s ten largest customers accounted for approximately of net sales 
the company expects that sales to a relatively small number of customers will continue to account for a significant portion of its net sales for the foreseeable future 
a loss of one or more of such key customers could affect the company s profitability 

the company typically does not obtain long term purchase orders or commitments 
instead  it relies primarily on continual communication with its customers to anticipate the future volume of purchase orders 
a variety of conditions  both specific to the individual customer and generally affecting the customer s industry  can cause a customer to reduce or delay orders previously anticipated by the company 

the company  from time to time  is engaged in the expansion of certain of its manufacturing facilities for electronic materials 
the anticipated costs of such expansions cannot be determined with precision and may vary materially from those budgeted 
in addition  such expansions will increase the company s fixed costs 
the company s future profitability depends upon its ability to utilize its manufacturing capacity in an effective manner 

the company s business is capital intensive and  in addition  the introduction of new technologies could substantially increase the company s capital expenditures 
in order to remain competitive the company must continue to make significant investments in capital equipment and expansion of operations 
this may require that the company continue to be able to access capital on terms acceptable to the company 

the company may acquire businesses  product lines or technologies that expand or complement those of the company 
the integration and management of an acquired company or business may strain the company s management resources and technical  financial and operating systems 
in addition  implementation of acquisitions can result in large one time charges and costs 
a given acquisition  if consummated  may materially affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 

the company s international operations are subject to risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  exchange rates  tariffs and other barriers  political and economic instability and potentially adverse tax consequences 

a portion of the sales and costs of the company s international operations are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar and may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

the company s success is dependant upon its relationship with key management and technical personnel 

the company s future success depends in part upon its intellectual property which the company seeks to protect through a combination of contract provisions  trade secret protections  copyrights and patents 

the company s production processes require the use  storage  treatment and disposal of certain materials which are considered hazardous under applicable environmental laws and the company is subject to a variety of regulatory requirements relating to the handling of such materials and the release of emissions and effluents into the environment 
other possible developments  such as the enactment or adoption of additional environmental laws  could result in substantial costs to the company 

the market price of the company s securities can be subject to fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  changes in analysts earnings estimates  market conditions in the electronic materials industry  as well as general economic conditions and other factors external to the company 

the company s results could be affected by changes in the company s accounting policies and practices or changes in the company s organization  compensation and benefit plans  or changes in the company s material agreements or understandings with third parties
