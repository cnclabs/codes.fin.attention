item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction aet is a leading developer and manufacturer of highly specialized plastic films used in consumer product labeling  flexible packaging  health care and other applications 
aet was organized in to acquire  own and operate certain assets in the plastics products industry 
the company s apertured nets and profiles business was the result of two acquisitions  one in and one in this business develops  manufactures and sells oriented apertured films  or nets  as well as non net thermoplastic products for a number of markets 
in april of  the company acquired the opp films business from hercules  incorporated the acquisition 
the company s capital structure was significantly changed as a result of the indebtedness incurred related to the acquisition and by a secondary equity offering completed in august certain of the end use markets for the company s opp films are seasonal 
for example  demand in the snack food  soft drink and candy markets is generally higher in the spring and summer 
as a result  sales and net income are generally higher in the spring and summer 
for the purposes of this discussion and analysis  the fiscal years ended september    and are referred to as   and  respectively 
all amounts indicated are in thousands 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentages of the company s sales represented by certain income and expense items in its income statements year ended september  sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative research and development operating profit interest expense  net net income fiscal year compared to fiscal sales for of  were slightly greater than the level of  while unit volume sales of opp films increased by  revenues were flat due to insufficient price realization throughout the industry 
this depressed pricing situation was precipitated by an inventory correction on the part of customers and end users of opp films during the first half of  as they reduced inventory levels and consequently demand in anticipation of lower films prices 
demand surged late in the second quarter  and the industry is once again operating at a very high rate of capacity utilization 
overall demand for the company s products remains strong as reflected by continued growth in labeling and flexible packaging applications for consumer products such as beverages  salty snacks and confectionery 
for  foreign operations accounted for approximately of sales and approximately of operating profit 
gross profit as a percent of sales decreased to in versus in due almost entirely to the previously discussed competitive pricing situation throughout the industry at a time of rising resin costs 
resin costs increased from april to september without improvement in opp films selling prices 
the new eight meter line brought on stream during the third quarter of fiscal exceeded all internal production plans and resulted in reduced production costs in the fourth quarter 
selling  general and administrative expenses remained flat as a percentage of sales in versus investments in research and development  however  were increased another over the prior year and aggregated of sales 
the increased research and development expenditures contributed significantly to the development of twelve new products or enhancements during the sales and marketing organization has been expanded to support the company s growth in north america as well as its announced initiatives in europe  latin america and the pacific rim 
the aforementioned increases in operating expenses were partially offset by reductions during in general and administrative expenses of  primarily as a result of reduced incentive related compensation 
net interest expense for fiscal decreased  as compared to fiscal this decrease is due to increased capitalized interest on the two new lines under construction 
capitalized interest during was  as compared to  in fiscal income taxes of  for the year ended september  were less than the comparable period  due to lower pre tax earnings 
income tax as a percent of before tax earnings remained constant for fiscal earnings per share decreased from proportionately more than net income due to the increase in shares outstanding resulting from the secondary stock issuance in fiscal year compared with fiscal year sales for fiscal of  exceeded fiscal by  due primarily to the inclusion of the packaging films business for the full twelve month period in as compared with six months in sales increased over fiscal on a pro forma basis  and were driven largely by the packaging films business  which experienced increased volume of approximately  coupled with changes in product mix and increased selling prices due to higher resin costs passed on to customers 
the increase in volume was the result of strong demand for opp film products during the year  limited to a certain extent by current capacity constraints 
for fiscal  foreign operations accounted for approximately of sales and approximately of operating profit 
the company believes that the strong demand for opp film products has been caused by the continued migration from rigid to flexible packaging of various consumer products  the packaging of soft drinks and certain other liquids in plastic bottles using opp film labels as opposed to glass bottles using paper labels  and the substitution of opp films for other packaging materials such as paper or polyester foil because of lower costs or enhanced performance attributes 
the strength of demand during this period can be attributed  in part  to inventory building by customers 
the company experienced some softening of this demand at the end of the fourth quarter which management attributes to inventory level corrections by both our customers and end users of the company s films 
in times of increasing resin costs  customers will tend to buy ahead  and when they perceive that costs and prices will decrease they work down their inventories 
beginning in  the costs of polypropylene resin increased approximately in twelve months  peaked during the summer of  and started to decrease in august and september 
gross profit in fiscal of  was  greater than in fiscal due to higher sales levels resulting from the acquisition  as well as manufacturing cost reductions implemented since the acquisition 
the manufacturing cost reduction programs initiated immediately after the acquisition increased productivity 
the single greatest contributor was the headcount reduction which contributed approximately percentage points to the improved gross margin 
this increase in gross margin was partially offset by product mix and pricing pressures in the fourth quarter resulting in a gross margin of in versus in for the first nine months of the year  the company generally passed on increased raw material costs to customers in the form of price increases 
gross profits decreased in the fourth quarter as pricing on certain products was reduced in response to competitive pressures resulting from a decrease in demand caused by the previously discussed inventory level corrections 
operating expenses decreased as a percent of sales to in versus in  inclusive of the non cash charge included in as discussed below  as a result of efficiencies gained from administering a larger organization for the full year 
selling  general and administrative costs increased  in versus  while research and development costs increased  as a result of the additional weeks of inclusion of the packaging films business in as compared to the prior year 
in conjunction with the acquisition  the company reassessed its various product lines in light of the shift in management focus to the opp films business and de emphasized certain of its specialty molding products and industrial netting operations 
accordingly  the related assets  which were principally intangible in nature  were written down by  or  after taxes  to reflect their then current value 
this noncash  nonrecurring charge was included in operating expense for fiscal in january  the company agreed to a settlement of its previously disclosed shareholder litigation 
the company s portion of the settlement is shown as a nonoperating expense of  or on an after tax basis 
while the company believes the litigation was without merit  management believes it was in the best interest of the company to settle the matter 
net interest expense increased  in fiscal versus this increase was primarily the result of approximately  in additional borrowings incurred in april to consummate the acquisition 
income tax expense increased in as a result of higher earnings over income tax expense as a percent of before tax income remained constant for fiscal years and fiscal year compared with fiscal year sales for of  were  greater than in as a result of the acquisition 
sales increased over after including sales from the packaging films business of  on a pro forma basis for the comparable week period in fiscal and excluding sales from the foamed polyethylene product line that was sold in july the pro forma increase in sales was attributable entirely to sales volume increases driven by the company s packaging films business  which experienced an increase in demand shortly after the acquisition 
the increase in demand principally resulted from the strengthening economy and favorable changes in the packaging industry  including a move from glass containers to plastic bottles  which resulted in the accelerated growth of certain of the company s film products 
for fiscal  foreign operations accounted for approximately of sales and approximately of operating profit 
gross profit of  for fiscal was  more than the previous year due to the increased sales as a result of the acquisition 
the company s manufacturing cost reduction programs increased productivity over during the last six months of fiscal when measured in terms of pounds produced per manufacturing employee 
the company recorded a gross margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal of  primarily as a result of these cost reduction programs together with a more favorable product mix 
the fourth quarter gross margin represented an increase as a percent of sales of percentage points over the previous quarter and percentage points over the comparable quarter in operating expenses decreased as a percent of sales from in fiscal to in fiscal exclusive of the noncash  nonrecurring charge included as write off of intangible assets discussed below  operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased percentage points primarily as a result of efficiencies gained from administering a larger organization 
while ongoing operating expenses as a percent of total sales decreased significantly  selling  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses increased  and  respectively  for an aggregate increase of  over fiscal  and were consistent with the five fold increase in the sales of the company due to the acquisition 
in conjunction with the acquisition  the company reassessed its various product lines in light of the shift in management focus to the opp film business and de emphasized certain of its specialty molding products and industrial netting operations 
accordingly  the related assets  which were principally intangible in nature  were written down by  or  after taxes  to reflect their then current value 
this noncash  nonrecurring charge was included in operating expenses in the second quarter of fiscal as a write off of intangible assets 
net interest expense increased  in fiscal when compared with the prior year 
this increase was the result of the approximately  in additional debt incurred in april to consummate the acquisition as discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
income tax expense increased in fiscal as a result of increased earnings over income tax expense as a percent of pre tax income remained constant for fiscal years and liquidity and capital resources operating activities in provided  in cash  which was the result of  of net income before depreciation and amortization and other non cash expenditures less a  net increase in other working capital items due primarily to the significant increase in capacity in the year 
the net increase in working capital resulted from a  increase in inventory  a  increase in accounts receivable  a increase in prepaid and other charges as well as decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  additions to property  plant and equipment were  and included expenditures related to the two announced capacity expansions 
these capital expenditures were funded in part by  of borrowings pursuant to the company s bank credit facility with the balance funded by cash equivalents and investment securities 
in april  the company entered into a bank credit agreement with a group of lenders to provide the company with senior bank financing in an amount up to  the credit agreement provides for a  revolving term loan facility  a  revolving credit facility and a  standby letter of credit in support of the company s currently outstanding industrial revenue bond  each of which has a final maturity in and is secured by all the assets of the company 
the revolving term loan facility requires the company to make equal quarterly installments of  and a final payment of  to the extent the company makes optional payments under this facility  the company may reborrow such amounts up to the original scheduled availability 
the company s available credit at september  under this agreement consisted of  on the revolving term facility and  from the revolving credit facility 
in addition to the bank credit agreement  the company has  in senior notes which were used to finance the acquisition 
the senior notes are unsecured  bear interest at payable semiannually and do not require principal payments until they mature in full in the company is in the process of increasing its production capacity for opp films by approximately million pounds with the installation of two new tenter production lines  one eight meters wide and the other ten meters wide 
the eight meter line was completed in fiscal and the ten meter line is scheduled to be operational in mid fiscal the total cost of the second new line is estimated to be approximately  as of september  the company had funded approximately  of these costs  had entered into additional commitments of approximately  and anticipates approximately  of additional expenditures over the next two years 
in connection with certain of these commitments and other capital expenditures  the company has entered into foreign exchange contracts with nominal amounts of  to hedge purchases denominated in foreign currencies 
gains and losses on these contracts result from market risk associated with changes in the market values of the underlying currencies which would affect the capitalized value of the asset 
the company does not enter into foreign exchange contracts for trading purposes 
the company believes that available cash and equivalents  cash flow from operations  availability under the revolving credit facility and availability under the revolving term loan facility will provide adequate funds over at least the next twenty four months to accommodate its working capital needs  capital expenditures and debt service obligation 
inflation management reviews the prices charged for its products on a regular basis 
when market conditions allow  adjustments are made to reflect changes in product costs due to fluctuations in the cost of materials and labor as well as inflation 
the cost of raw materials for most of the company s products decreased during the early part of fiscal  and then increased to pre levels by the end of the fiscal year 
industry estimates are predicting declines in resin costs during there can be no assurance  however  that future market conditions will support a direct correlation between cost fluctuations and films pricing 
except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in this report are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  including the timely development and acceptance of new products  fluctuations in raw materials prices  the loss of one or more significant customers  the impact of competitive products and pricing  the timely completion of capital projects  the success of its efforts to expand into new markets and other risks detailed herein  in the company s prospectuses dated august  and may  and from time to time in the company s other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission
