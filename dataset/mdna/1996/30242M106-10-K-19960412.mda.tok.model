general this discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial and operating data  the description of the company s business operations and the financial statements and related notes and schedules included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the company reports its results of operations using a fiscal year which ends on the last sunday in december 
most fiscal years have weeks but some consist of weeks 
fiscal was a week year  while fiscal    and were week years 
this variation in time periods most affects revenues and related costs of sales and salary costs as other expenses such as rent and utilities are usually recorded on a monthly basis 
however  differences in the number of weeks in a fiscal year should be considered in reviewing financial data 
compared with the company s motor fuel revenues for increased over the period by  due to increased wholesale fuel sales 
wholesale fuel sales increased  gallons over this increase was due to the presence for a full year of sales resulting from a marketing arrangement begun in mid that emphasizes sales to contractors and other commercial users of fuel as well as from growth in these sales 
however  the increase in wholesale fuel sales was offset by a decline in retail fuel sales 
motor fuel sales at the company s retail outlets declined by  gallons as a result of lower sales volumes at the company s truck stops due to increased competition from new outlets in several of the company s markets 
the margin on fuel sales increased  in over this increase resulted from improved retail fuel margins cents in vs in and the additional margin from the increased wholesale activity 
merchandise sales in declined by  from the previous year due principally to the sale of the merchandise operations at ten convenience stores 
the sales of these operations are the continuation of a program begun by the company in mid to sell the merchandise operations of outlets that it believed would contribute more to the earnings of the company if operated by independent operators rather than by the company 
the company seeks to sell the merchandise operations of these outlets to independent operators who  because of their different overhead structure  are able to operate the stores less expensively than can the company 
these sales are structured such that the company retains the real estate or leasehold interest and leases or subleases the land  building  and equipment to the operator 
the company also retains the motor fuel concession at these outlets  which become self service fuel outlets for the company 
the merchandise sales decline was also affected by the absence of a full year s sales at the outlets whose merchandise operations were sold in the third and fourth quarters of the company also experienced a decline in its average weekly per store sales for convenience stores of in as compared to and a decline of in sales at the truck stops combined with their associated restaurants 
these declines are attributable to the company s efforts to increase the margin on merchandise sales at all of its outlets 
total merchandise margin declined by  due to the reduced merchandise sales but the gross profit percentage on merchandise sales increased to from reflecting the company s program of selectively increasing prices on less price sensitive items 
miscellaneous revenues were up  in over this increase resulted primarily from increases in excise tax handling fees due to increased fuel volumes and money order fees due to increased numbers of items sold and an increase in the per item fee and a gain recognized from the sale of the company s fleet fuel franchise offset by declines in food stamp commissions due to the adoption in texas of a debit card for this activity and in commissions on the wholesale sale of cigarettes due to a more competitive market 
direct store expenses consist of those costs directly attributable to the operation of the company s retail outlets  such as salaries and other personnel costs  supplies  utilities  repairs and maintenance  and commissions paid to the operators of the self service motor fuel outlets 
in these costs declined  from the prior year 
this reduction was due to the elimination of payroll and related costs  utilities  and other operating expenses at the convenience stores whose merchandise operations were sold to independent operators offset by increases in the fuel commissions paid to the operators of those stores  and increases in wage and other personnel costs at the stores operated by the company 
general and administrative expenses increased  in over this increase was caused by increased professional fees  principally attributable to the cost of consultants assisting in reorganizing certain of the company s back office processes  increased rental expense  associated with the company s increased use of leases to provide vehicles and to finance certain equipment  increased insurance costs  and increases in bank charges  associated with the trial use of a deposit pick up service at the company s convenience stores and truck stops 
these increases were offset by a reduction in bad debt expense due to better monitoring of receivables 
the  decline in depreciation and amortization expense is due to the continued full depreciation of assets acquired upon the company s formation in and the somewhat limited additions to property and equipment over the past few years 
even though the company s long term bank debt declined by  from to  interest expense was flat between the two years due to increased use of capital leases  which carry a somewhat higher but fixed interest rate  to fund capital expenditures 
the company adopted financial accounting standards board statement no 
accounting for income taxes sfas at the beginning of fiscal as a result of adopting this accounting principle  the company is required to record deferred income tax expense attributable to changes arising in the current period in the temporary differences between financial and tax reporting which are expected to reverse after  when the company will become taxable as a corporation 
these differences are due primarily to temporary differences between the financial reporting amounts and tax bases of the company s property and equipment and the increase in the deferred tax expense in as compared to is principally due to additions to fixed assets which are depreciated differently for financial reporting and tax purposes 
the deferred tax expense is expected to grow in and as the date at which the company will become taxable as a corporation grows closer since fewer of the differences between tax and financial reporting will reverse prior to such date 
the  decline in the company s total margin in as compared to was offset by significant reductions in operating expenses and depreciation and amortization such that income before income taxes and other items increased  
however  due to the increase in deferred income taxes  discussed above  and the occurrence in of a  gain from the early extinguishment of debt in connection with the refinancing of the company s bank debt in early  net income increased by  between the two years 
compared with motor fuel revenues in increased  from principally due to increases in the gallons of motor fuel sold at both wholesale and retail 
retail fuel gallons sold increased due to an increase in the average number of outlets selling fuel  primarily self service fuel outlets  same store fuel sales in gallons were up from to wholesale fuel volumes were up because of the marketing arrangement begun in mid which emphasizes sales to contractors and other commercial users 
fuel margin increased  between the two years 
retail fuel margin per gallon increased to cents per gallon in from cents in and wholesale fuel margin per gallon increased to cents in from cents in the company s merchandise sales declined  from to due to sales decreases at convenience stores offset by increases at truck stops 
the sales decline at the convenience stores resulted from the closing in late of the company s five convenience stores in illinois  the reduction in sales caused by the sale of the merchandise operations of outlets under the program discussed above  and a same store sales decline of from the prior year 
the illinois stores had not been performing well and the company elected to terminate its lease on those locations in august  while most of the sales of convenience store merchandise operations occurred in the third and fourth quarters of the increased sales at the truck stops resulted from the addition of one outlet in may and from a same store sales increase of 
the strong growth in same store sales is attributable to re merchandising the truck stops and the impact of additional traffic generated by the kentucky fried chicken and taco bell express outlets at two of the truck stops 
because of the success the company has enjoyed with the branded fast food outlets  it is expanding this concept to additional truck stops 
merchandise margin decreased  in from due to the decreased merchandise sales 
however  the gross profit percentage on merchandise sales increased to from in due principally to higher margins realized at the truck stops as a result of the re merchandising of those outlets and the branded fast food outlets 
the  increase in miscellaneous revenues in over was principally due to the  gain recognized on the sales of certain convenience store merchandise operations discussed above and increases in lottery commissions at the company s convenience stores and fuel excise tax collection fees related to the increased volume of motor fuel sold 
direct store expenses increased  in over principally due to increased personnel costs at the convenience stores and truck stops related to routine wage increases and higher fuel commissions at the self service motor fuel outlets due to the increased volumes of fuel sold by these outlets 
general and administrative expenses increased  from to these increases resulted from increases in bad debt expense related to the increase in self service fuel outlets and increased wholesale fuel business  increased professional fees related to the company s underground storage tank monitoring activity and increased efforts in marketing it s laser money order printing system  increased commissions related to its wholesale fuel sales to contractors and commercial users  and increased rent expense related to the use of lease financing for vehicles and equipment 
these increases were offset by declines in uninsured claims and bank charges 
the  reduction in depreciation and amortization expense for over was caused by the full amortization in september of the value of self service gasoline contracts and the complete depreciation in late and early of certain other assets  all of which were acquired upon the company s initial formation in may interest expense decreased  for from the prior year due to the refinancing of the company s debt in february this refinancing  which was with a different financial institution  resulted in a reduced interest rate on the debt and also established a revolving line of credit thereby enabling the company to reduce the debt outstanding from time to time by paying down on the credit line which also reduced interest expense 
interest expense was further reduced because of reductions in the balances outstanding due to scheduled payments on the company s term debt 
in addition  in connection with this transaction  the company received a  discount on the early payoff of the previous debt 
this  gain on extinguishment of debt is reflected as an extraordinary item in the consolidated income statement 
the adoption of sfas at the beginning of fiscal was accounted for as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and resulted in a noncash charge of  in the consolidated statement of operations the substantial increases in the company s total margin total revenues less costs of fuel and merchandise combined with the modest increases in operating expenses and the substantial reduction in depreciation and amortization  resulted in earnings of  an improvement of  over the prior year 
liquidity and capital resources the company has a credit agreement with a major bank under which it has a  revolving credit line with sublimits of  for cash advances and  for letters of credit to be used for working capital purposes and a term loan which had a balance at year end of  the revolving credit line matures on april   but the agreement requires that it be repaid for seven consecutive days during each calendar quarter 
the term loan is due in quarterly installments of  through march  both the term loan and the revolving credit line bear interest at the bank s prime rate 
although the interest rates on both loans are variable rates  the credit agreement provides the company with the ability to fix the rates on all or a portion of the term loan for varying periods of time up to its maturity 
in march  the company amended its credit agreement principally to provide an additional term loan of  to be used by the company to acquire and renovate a non operating fuel terminal which the company acquired in march this term loan is to be repaid in quarterly installments of  through march  the interest rate and related options on this loan are the same as on the other term debt under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement contains various requirements and restrictive covenants  including  a pledge of the company s accounts receivable and inventories  a negative pledge of the company s fixed assets  and the requirement to maintain certain financial ratios which have the effect of limiting the company s capital expenditures and distributions to unitholders 
at year end  the company was not in compliance with certain of the financial ratios but in connection with the march amendment of the credit agreement  mentioned above  the bank has waived compliance with these ratios 
during  the company has made cash distributions to its unitholders 
however  the distributions have not been made at regular  periodic intervals nor at fixed amounts 
the company anticipates that it will continue to make cash distributions to unitholders and is evaluating making such distributions on a regular quarterly basis 
however  a determination has not yet been made with respect to whether or not to make distributions in that manner  the amount of any such distributions  or the date on which such distributions might begin 
further  any future distributions will be dependent upon the continued profitability of the company  its debt service requirements  needs for capital expenditures  and compliance with the restrictions in its credit agreement 
the company s cash flows from operating activities were  less in than in this decline was due principally to a  decrease in accrued expenses which is related to the timing of fuel excise tax payments relative to the company s year end 
cash used for the purchase of property and equipment and other investing activities increased  in primarily due to increased purchases of property and equipment  some which is related to compliance with environmental regulations  and to other investments 
the company expects its level of capital expenditure to increase modestly over the next three years as it completes the upgrades of its underground storage tanks that are required to meet state and federal environmental requirements 
the company has contracted with a firm to install the necessary equipment and or to modify existing installations to meet current environmental requirements by the december deadline 
the cost of this upgrading is expected to be between  and  and is expected to be incurred ratably over   and the company will pay for some of these expenditures from its operating cash flow 
however  it has a  lease financing facility with an affiliate of its primary bank lender which may be used to fund a portion of these expenditures as well as to acquire other machinery and equipment other than underground storage tanks 
although this commitment expires in december  the company expects that it will be renewed for an additional amount at that time 
the company believes that this lease financing along with its operating cash flow and other financing alternatives that are available to it will be adequate to fund necessary capital expenditures  including the expenditures that are necessary to comply with environmental regulations 
the company s cash used in financing activities decreased by  in as compared to this significant decrease resulted primarily from reduced payments on bank debt in as compared to  when the company s debt was refinanced 
the company is party to commodity futures contracts and forward contracts to buy and sell fuel  both of which are used principally to satisfy balances owed on exchange agreements and both of which have off balance sheet risk 
changes in the market value of open futures contracts are recognized as gains or losses in the period of change 
these investments involve the risk of dealing with others and their ability to meet the terms of the contracts and the risk associated with unmatched positions and market fluctuations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company had negative working capital at year end of  as compared to a negative  at the prior year end 
the decline was largely due to the prepayment of  on the company s term debt in mid although this prepayment negatively affected working capital it helped the company to minimize interest expense 
the company believes that the availability of funds under its revolving line of credit and its traditional use of trade credit will permit operations to be conducted in a customary manner 
inflation and seasonality the company believes inflation has not had a material effect on operating results in recent years except for the upward pressure placed on wages  primarily store wages  by the federal minimum wage increases which took effect in and some federal political officials have proposed increasing the federal minimum wage again but it is uncertain at this time whether such an increase will become law 
should there be an increase in the federal minimum wage  the company expects that it s operating margins would be adversely affected in the short run as it would take some time to increase prices in order to pass along this increased cost to customers but it does not expect that it would be at a competitive disadvantage as the company believes its wage structure is in line with that of other convenience store operators 
apart from the impact of the possible minimum wage increase  operations for the foreseeable future are also not expected to be significantly impacted by inflation 
generally  increased costs of in store merchandise can be quickly reflected in higher prices to customers 
the price of motor fuel  adjusted for inflation  has declined over recent years 
however  significant increases in the retail price of motor fuels could reduce fuel demand and the company s gross profit on fuel sales 
the company s businesses are subject to seasonal influences  with higher sales being experienced in the second and third quarters of the year as customers tend to purchase more motor fuel and convenience items  such as soft drinks  other beverages  and ice  during the warmer months
