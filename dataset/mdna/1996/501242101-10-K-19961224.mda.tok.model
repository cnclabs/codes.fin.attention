item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the company s operating results primarily depend upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers and subcontract assemblers worldwide which  in turn  depend on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors 
the semiconductor industry has historically been highly volatile and experienced periodic downturns and slowdowns which have had a severe negative effect on the semiconductor industry s demand for capital equipment  including assembly equipment manufactured and marketed by the company and  to a lesser extent  packaging materials such as those sold by the company 
these downturns and slowdowns have also adversely affected the company s operating results 
the company does not consider its business to be seasonal in nature 
a significant portion of the company s revenue is derived from sales of a relatively small number of machines  most with selling prices ranging from  to over  a delay in the shipment in a limited quantity of machines  either due to manufacturing delays or to rescheduling or cancellations of customer orders  could have a material adverse effect on the results of the operations for any particular quarter 
the company believes that such volatility will continue to characterize the industry and the company s operations in the future 
the company acquired american fine wire corporation afw in october  to help mitigate the effect of volatile demand for capital equipment on the company s financial performance 
this acquisition significantly increased the portion of the company s total sales attributable to packaging materials which grew from in fiscal to in fiscal packaging materials products have different manufacturing processes  distribution channels and a less volatile revenue pattern than historically experienced by the company s equipment business 
results of operations fiscal years ended september  and september  during the fiscal year ended september   the company recorded bookings totaling million  including approximately million related to afw  compared to million during fiscal which excluded afw s operating results 
the decline in fiscal equipment bookings primarily reflects a significant reduction in demand for semiconductor assembly equipment  principally gold ball and aluminum wedge bonders  in the latter half of fiscal compared to the record levels experienced throughout fiscal and the first several months of fiscal at september  total backlog of customer orders approximated million  including million relating to afw  compared to million at september  since the timing of deliveries may vary and orders are generally subject to cancellation  the company s backlog as of any date may not be indicative of net sales for any succeeding period 
net sales for the fiscal year ended september  increased by million to million compared to million in fiscal the acquisition of afw contributed million to fiscal net sales  with approximately million of the increase attributable to sales of expendable tools and the remainder due to the company s equipment segment 
on a quarterly basis  net sales declined sharply throughout fiscal  primarily in the equipment segment 
the decline generally reflected an industry wide slowdown in capital equipment purchases during as compared to the record levels experienced during international sales shipments of the company s products with ultimate foreign destinations comprised and of the company s total sales during fiscal and  respectively 
sales to customers in the asia pacific region including korea  taiwan  malaysia  philippines  japan  singapore  thailand and hong kong accounted for approximately of the company s total sales in both fiscal and in fiscal  sales to customers located in malaysia  korea and philippines increased compared to fiscal levels  while sales to taiwan based customers declined significantly in fiscal the decline in taiwan in part reflected the impact of geopolitical uncertainty concerning china s reaction to the elections in taiwan 
equipment segment net sales increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal total unit sales in fiscal were essentially flat compared to unit sales for fiscal however  sales of gold ball wire bonders  non semiconductor dicing saws and wire bonder upgrade kits increased in fiscal  while sales of aluminum wedge bonders declined in relation to the amounts sold in fiscal during fiscal  slightly improved selling prices were realized on the model gold ball bonder line compared to the average selling prices realized on gold ball bonders during fiscal packaging materials segment net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase is due to million of sales of wire products following the afw acquisition and million due to increased sales volumes of expendable tools totaling million 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales declined to in fiscal compared to in fiscal equipment segment gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal as a result of the rapid and substantial decline in customer demand for the company s equipment in the second half of fiscal  the company experienced unfavorable overhead absorption during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal provisions for excess and obsolete inventory totaled million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
the rapid decline in customer demand in fiscal  particularly for the model turbo gold ball bonders  and the anticipated transition to the new generation model gold ball bonders in the second half of  caused the company to recognize approximately million of the provision for excess and obsolete inventory in the fourth quarter for inventory which was not expected to be used or sold with the transition to the new generation of wire bonders 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales in the packaging materials segment decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal the decrease principally reflects the effect of the afw acquisition as sales of wire products have historically had a substantially lower gross profit margin than the company s other products 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase of million consisted of approximately million related to the equipment segment  million related to the packaging materials segment  and million of incremental corporate costs 
in the equipment segment  higher employment and travel related costs  primarily in connection with the company s worldwide customer support activities during the first half of fiscal  contributed to the increase 
incremental goodwill amortization of million and other sg a costs of million associated with the afw operation accounted for the majority of the increase in the packaging materials segment 
higher sales commissions related to increased sales of expendable tools  increased travel costs related to afw integration activities and increased administrative costs to support the expanded worldwide activities of the packaging materials segment also contributed to the fiscal increase 
corporate costs grew principally as a result of implementation activities related to a new worldwide computer system 
in response to the rapid decline in customer demand for the company s products during the latter half of fiscal  the company reduced its world wide work force  primarily in the equipment segment  discontinued the planned expansion of its willow grove  pa 
facility  and deferred the implementation of a new worldwide integrated computer system 
as a result of these actions  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company incurred severance costs totaling million and a million charge to write off costs incurred in connection with the discontinued willow grove facility expansion 
research and development costs r d increased to million for the fiscal year ended september   compared to million for the same period in the prior fiscal year 
the majority of the r d costs incurred were in the equipment segment 
approximately million of the increase was due to engineering activities associated with the family of products  principally the model development program 
the fiscal increase also included approximately million related to the write down of certain engineering prototype machines to their net realizable value 
the remaining r d spending increases related to development activities for other products and continuous improvements of existing products 
the company continues to invest heavily in the development of the series wire bonders and the enhancement of many of its existing products  including  but not limited to  the model turbo gold ball bonder and model fp wedge bonder  to enable them to meet customer requirements for higher lead count devices with finer pitch requirements at faster bonding speeds than earlier models 
the company also continues to invest in new technologies which may eventually lead to improved and alternative semiconductor assembly technologies 
packaging materials segment r d costs increased to million as compared to fiscal levels 
substantially all of the r d spending in the packaging materials segment related to continuous improvement activities for existing products 
operating income declined to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decline largely resulted from higher fiscal sg a and r d costs in the equipment segment and to the decline in equipment segment gross profits during the latter half of fiscal most of the decline in operating income was realized in the us as the us operation incurred the majority of the company s r d expenses and corporate costs  and recognized the majority of the fiscal fourth quarter charges 
in connection with the october afw acquisition  the company borrowed million under its bank credit facility and million pursuant to promissory notes issued to certain former circle s shareholders 
the promissory notes were repaid in january through additional borrowings under the company s bank credit facility 
during fiscal  the company incurred million of incremental interest expense associated with these borrowings 
during fiscal  a portion of the company s convertible subordinated debentures were outstanding 
all of the remaining debentures were converted into the company s common stock or redeemed in fiscal in february  the company entered into a joint venture agreement with delco electronics corporation providing for the formation and management of flip chip technologies  llc fct or the joint venture 
fct was formed to provide wafer bumping services 
during fiscal  the company contributed million of capital to fct  and recognized million as its proportionate share of the joint venture s operating loss 
the joint venture is still in the early stages of developing its business and is expected to incur increased losses in fiscal the company s effective tax rate increased to for fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase was due primarily to the amount and geographic distribution of taxable income in fiscal in connection with the afw acquisition  the company acquired a million u 
s federal net operating loss nol carryforward 
during fiscal  afw s us manufacturing operation experienced a small loss 
since the company cannot reasonably forecast sufficient future us earnings by this subsidiary to fully utilize the acquired nol during the carryforward period  a valuation allowance was established for the full amount of this potential tax benefit 
if realized  such tax benefits would reduce the recorded amount of afw goodwill 
net income declined to in fiscal as compared to fiscal of million due to the factors previously enumerated 
in october  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  was issued 
the statement requires the recognition of the fair value of stock options and other stock based compensation to be reflected as compensation expense in the income statement  or disclosure of the pro forma effect on net income and earnings per share of such compensation expense in the footnotes to the company s financial statements commencing with the fiscal year 
the company expects to adopt sfas on a disclosure basis only 
accordingly  implementation of sfas is not expected to impact the company s consolidated balance sheet or income statement 
fiscal years ended september  and september  the company recorded bookings totaling million during the fiscal year ended september  compared to million during fiscal the increase in customer orders was primarily attributable to the following factors 
first  growing end user demand for semiconductor devices resulted in industry wide expansion both in wafer fabrication capacity and semiconductor assembly capacity in in addition  certain semiconductor manufacturers replaced older assembly capital equipment with newer  higher throughput machines capable of handling more complex semiconductor devices for a wider variety of applications 
finally  enhanced versions of the company s gold ball wire bonder model turbo introduced in late fiscal and aluminum wedge bonder model fp introduced in the second quarter of fiscal offered significant performance advantages compared to the company s earlier models  including greater throughput  finer pitch capabilities and improved programmability to handle a wider variety of applications 
favorable customer acceptance of these enhanced models contributed to the company s increased volume of orders during fiscal at september   the backlog of customer orders totaled approximately million compared to million at september  net sales for the fiscal year ended september  increased to million compared to million during fiscal approximately million of this increase was due to higher unit volume  primarily of the company s model turbo gold ball wire bonders and fp aluminum wedge bonders  and  to a lesser extent  to increased sales of consumable tools and spare parts 
higher selling prices for the model turbo ball bonder and model fp wedge bonder contributed approximately million to net sales in fiscal  over the amounts reported in fiscal in addition  approximately million of the volume increase was attributable to sales of products added from the july acquisition of assembly technologies at 
by geographic region  increases in net sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal were primarily attributable to customers located in the asia pacific region  and  to a lesser extent  to customers located in the united states 
sales to customers in the asia pacific region and the united states accounted for more than of the company s net sales in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal the increase in the gross profit percentage resulted principally from improved manufacturing overhead absorption associated with higher sales volumes  the improved gross profit margin on the gold ball and wedge bonder products largely due to the higher selling prices realized on the new  enhanced models  and to a shift in sales mix toward higher margin wedge bonders 
during fiscal  the wedge bonder product line comprised of net revenues  in fiscal  wedge bonder products accounted for of net revenues 
partially offsetting the above factors were additional inventory reserves established for slower moving products during fiscal sg a totaled million during fiscal  compared to million during fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to higher employment levels required to support the higher volume of business  increased sales incentives and commissions resulting from the higher sales levels  increased management incentives associated with improved earnings and higher outside contractor costs associated with ongoing internal management information systems development efforts 
of the total increase in sg a costs  million was related to the incremental costs incurred by the company to market and support die bonder products added through the july acquisition of at 
net r d costs increased to million for the fiscal year ended september   compared to million for the same period last year 
of the million increase in fiscal  million resulted from incremental expenditures related to development of the company s next generation of die bonders and enhancements to die bonder products added through the at acquisition 
the remainder consisted primarily of personnel related costs  outside contractor costs and prototype materials related to new product development 
gross r d expenses were partially offset by funding received from customers and governmental subsidies totaling million in fiscal and million in fiscal the company continued to invest heavily in the development of the series wire bonders and in enhancements of existing products  including the model turbo ball bonder and model fp wedge bonder to enable them to handle higher lead count devices with finer pitch requirements at faster bonding speeds than the earlier models 
in addition  the company continued to invest in new technologies which may eventually lead to improved or alternate semiconductor assembly technologies 
operating income totaled million for fiscal compared to million for the same period in fiscal this improvement resulted principally from the higher revenue levels and improved gross profit margins  offset in part by the increased sg a and r d expenses noted above 
the majority of the increase in operating profit was realized in the united states  where the company maintains its principal manufacturing operations  and in hong kong where the company s asia pacific sales activities are centered 
during fiscal  all of the company s remaining convertible subordinated debentures were converted into common stock or redeemed 
as a result  interest expense during fiscal was lower than the amount reported in fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate to in fiscal compared to the fiscal rate of was due primarily to utilization of remaining net operating loss carryforwards in fiscal  utilization in the united states of r d tax credits not previously used due to the effects of net operating losses  and to the amount and geographic distribution of taxable income in fiscal company outlook certain of the information set forth below and elsewhere in this report contains forward looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to materially differ from those set forth in the forward looking statements 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to the following the risk of volatile demand in the semiconductor industry  the deferral or possible cancellation of existing customer orders  the timing  development  introduction and acceptance of new products and enhancements to existing products  the company s ability to manufacture and ship its products on a timely basis  competitive pricing pressures  the risk that certain customers may adopt alternate semiconductor assembly processes  and international political and other developments which could impact foreign operations 
while semiconductor consumption continues to grow  the company s equipment segment was adversely affected in fiscal by industry wide overinvestment in assembly capacity in fiscal and early fiscal during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  the rate of new customer orders booked into backlog was lower than each of the previous four quarters 
this declining order rate resulted in the equipment segment s sharply lower net sales during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  led to the company s august resizing efforts which reduced anticipated annualized operating costs by approximately million  and contributed significantly to the million net loss in the fourth quarter of fiscal subsequent to the fiscal year end  the order rate has improved and the company currently anticipates significant improvements in revenues and operating results in the first half of fiscal as compared to the last half of fiscal moreover  the company continues to believe that long term growth prospects for the semiconductor industry and for the company s products remain positive 
the company is in the process of developing a new generation of wire bonder  the family  which is based on an entirely new platform and requires the development of new software and many subassemblies not part of the company s current wire bonders 
the first prequalification model ball bonder the first production model of the family was shipped to a customer in march and is presently being field tested 
the company currently expects that the product will be released in the second half of calendar development and technical risks exist in all of the company s r d projects and have the potential to delay the introduction of new products 
no assurance can be given that the introduction of the model will not be further delayed due to technical or other difficulties 
the company s inability to complete the development of and introduce the model or other new products  or its inability to manufacture and ship these products in volume and on a timely basis  could adversely affect the company s competitive position 
the company s planned transition to the model platform also involves numerous other risks  including the possibility that customers will defer purchases of the current model of gold ball wire bonders in anticipation of the availability of the model  or that the model will fail to meet customer needs or achieve market acceptance 
to the extent that the company fails to accurately forecast demand in volume and configuration for both its current and next generation wire bonders and generally to manage product transitions successfully  it could experience reduced orders  delays in product shipments  and increased risk of inventory obsolescence 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully develop and manufacture new products  including the model  that new products introduced by the company will be accepted in the marketplace  or that the company will manage its product transitions successfully 
the company s failure to do any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
liquidity and capital resources during the past three fiscal years  the company has financed its operations principally through cash flows from operating activities 
cash generated by operating activities totaled million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal cash and total investments increased to million at september  from million at september  at september   working capital increased to million compared to million at september  the accounts receivable balance decreased by million during fiscal reflecting the significantly reduced sales volumes in the latter half of fiscal and collection of a million note receivable outstanding at september  approximately million of this reduction resulted from lower sales levels by the company s hong kong subsidiary 
partially offsetting this reduction was an increase of million due to the afw acquisition 
gross inventory increased million at september  of this increase  million resulted from the afw acquisition 
the remainder of the increase was due to increased levels of raw materials and finished goods on hand as customers either delayed or canceled orders 
this increase was partially offset by additional inventory reserves  of which million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as a result of the significant decline in customer orders for company products 
trade accounts payable and accrued expenses at september  decreased by million to million compared to the balance at the end of fiscal the decrease in trade accounts payable of million is directly attributable to the decreased level of inventory purchases during the latter half of fiscal the decrease in accrued expenses at september  primarily relates to reductions in accrued expenses related to the afw acquisition 
as described in notes and to the company s consolidated financial statements  the company acquired afw on october  of the total purchase price  million was financed by borrowings under the company s bank credit facility 
in october  the company acquired semitec  inc semitec for approximately million  including transaction costs 
of the total purchase price  million must be paid to the former semitec shareholders in cash or in registered shares of company common stock by june during fiscal  the company invested approximately million in property and equipment  primarily to expand company facilities  upgrade equipment used in the company s manufacturing activities  including tooling used in the manufacturing process  and for r d test equipment suitable for the company s new products 
the company presently expects fiscal capital spending will not exceed million 
the principal capital projects planned for fiscal include completion of the new micro swiss manufacturing facility in yokneam  israel  relocation of afw s singapore based manufacturing and administrative facilities into a single new leased facility and the purchase of new tooling equipment necessary to commence manufacture of the series of machines 
relocations of the micro swiss operations in the first quarter of fiscal and the afw singapore operations in late fiscal are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows or liquidity 
through september   the company contributed million in capital to the newly formed fct 
the company expects its fiscal capital contributions to the joint venture will not exceed million 
in april  the company renegotiated the terms of its bank credit facility resulting in a restated loan agreement providing for a million revolving credit facility  expiring in february and a million revolving credit facility expiring in march as of september   the million borrowed under the revolving credit facility was classified as long term debt as the company presently does not expect any principal payments under this loan during fiscal there were no borrowings under the million credit line during fiscal a significant portion of the company s consolidated earnings are attributable to undistributed earnings of certain of its foreign subsidiaries 
deferred income taxes have not been provided on that portion of undistributed foreign earnings which is expected to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations 
if funds were required to be repatriated to fund the company s operations or other financial obligations  additional us federal income tax expense could be required to be recognized 
the amended gold supply agreement dated october  between afw and its subsidiaries collectively  the afw companies and their gold supplier contains certain financial covenants and prohibits the afw companies from paying any dividends or making any distributions without the consent of the supplier if  following any such dividend or distribution  the net worth of the afw companies would be less than million 
the company believes that anticipated cash flows from operations  its working capital and amounts available under its revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet the company s liquidity and capital requirements for at least the next fiscal year  including any debt service requirements under its bank credit facility 
the company may  however  seek equity or debt financing to provide capital for corporate purposes and or to fund strategic business opportunities  including possible acquisitions  joint ventures  alliances or other business arrangements which could require substantial capital outlays 
the timing and amount of such potential capital requirements cannot be determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors  including demand for the company s products  semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment industry conditions and competitive factors and the nature and size of strategic business opportunities which the company may elect to pursue
