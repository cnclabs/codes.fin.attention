during calendar year  computer city and incredible universe represented of total sales and operating revenues compared to of the total 
management anticipates that tandy s consolidated gross profit percentage will continue to decline as the effects of the computer city and incredible universe expansions are increasingly reflected in the revenue and gross profit mix 
during radioshack s gross margin decreased when compared to due to the rapid growth of cellular phone and digital satellite system sales 
it is anticipated that radioshack s gross margin as a percentage of sales in could be equal to or slightly exceed the comparable figure due to emphasis on higher margin categories 
computer city s gross margin remained relatively flat in when compared to competitive forces have continued to play a major factor in keeping margins flat in margins are not expected to vary much in as these competitive forces in the marketplace remain in place and may even increase in some quarters 
incredible universe s gross margins decreased slightly in compared to reflecting the fact that personal computers and related equipment  which inherently have lower margins  contributed a larger portion to the overall sales mix in versus this trend is expected to continue in gross profit as a percentage of sales declined in to from the level of 
expansion of the computer city and incredible universe store formats impacted gross margin during these years

additionally  radioshack incurred minor advertising expense increases primarily relating to inflation 
rent expense in decreased as a percentage of sales in comparison with the prior year  while the dollar amounts remained relatively stable 
this decrease as a percentage of sales directly relates to the closing of tandy name brand stores and the increase in the number of computer city and incredible universe stores  as they have lower rent expense as a percentage of sales than the company as a whole 
the relatively stable dollar amount is the result of the reduction in rent expenses related to the closed tandy name brand units offset by the rent of the additional radioshack  computer city and incredible universe stores 
the expenses of the credit operations have significantly declined as a result of the sale of the private label credit card portfolios which was completed by march  the sale of the credit card portfolio balance has eliminated most of the risk of uncollectible accounts receivable  thereby significantly reducing the bad debt provision during as compared to prior years 
in addition  servicing costs associated with the portfolio have also been eliminated with the sale

radioshack s advertising spots were shifted from sports related events to prime time shows in order to reach a broader audience 
rent expense increased slightly in dollars but decreased as a percentage of sales during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the increase in rent expense was due to a net increase of radioshack stores and the addition of computer city stores and six incredible universe stores 
incredible universe and computer city formats typically have lower rent  as a percentage of sales  than tandy overall 
the company s credit operations were successful in supporting sales of the retail operations during and private label credit cards represented of credit sales for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  expenses associated with the credit card operations  which are included in sg a expense  decreased as a percentage of sales during this period because of a decrease in credit losses which reflected a stronger economy 
as discussed above  the company sold its computer city and incredible universe private label credit card portfolios in and in the first quarter of sold its radioshack and mcduff private label credit card portfolios

other sg a expenses increased  from to radioshack merchandise repair expenses increased  in primarily reflecting an increase in extended service plan sales

interest income for includes the amount of interest received prior to the sale of the radioshack and mcduff portfolios 
the decrease in interest income from the credit card operations from to was a result of increased use of certain special sales promotions and marketing initiatives  some of which provided for no interest charges for specified initial periods 
the decline in average credit card receivables in resulted from increased payments from credit customers reflecting the overall improvement in the economy and a desire by consumers to shift debt to lower interest rate instruments 
other interest income relates primarily to short term investments of the company 
the ast research  inc ast note will mature in july and  therefore  interest income derived therefrom will be less in than in previous years 
interest income relating to the intertan notes will continue in the company does not anticipate interest income relating to settlements with the irs in the increase in interest expense for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  is due to an increase in the use of short term borrowing facilities 
the use of these facilities was significantly higher during the year ended december  as the company retired long term debt  funded store expansion and funded the share repurchase program 
even though short term debt outstanding at the end of the year decreased  the weighted average of seasonal bank loans outstanding during the year increased from  in to  in  and the weighted average interest rate rose from in to in assuming interest rates do not change significantly  it is anticipated that the weighted average of short term debt used during will increase as compared to that used in due to a greater need for funds for the share repurchase and store expansion programs 
although a portion of the funds will be met with cash flows from operations  proceeds from the ast note due in july and continuing principal payments from the intertan notes receivable  the company still anticipates that a portion will be met through increased debt borrowings 
as a result  the company expects to incur net interest expense in long term debt decreased from december  due to the repayment of debt such as medium term notes and senior notes
