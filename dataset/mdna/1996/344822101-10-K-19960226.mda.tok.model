discontinued operations 
on may   the company sold the assets of its retail division to thorn apple valley  inc the sales price approximated million in cash payments plus the assumption of long term debt of approximately million and certain current liabilities related to the division of approximately million 
in connection with the sale the company wrote off approximately million of intangible assets and recorded a net loss on disposition of approximately million 
the results of operations and cash flows of the division have been reported as discontinued operations and prior years have been restated to reflect this treatment 
accordingly  the results of continuing operations do not include the operations of the retail division 
restructuring and integration 
in december  the company announced a restructuring program that resulted in a million charge against operating income in the restructuring program identified specific manufacturing facilities and operations that related to excess capacity  as well as duplication of activities after the acquisition of the specialty brands division 
as of december   the company has consolidated production operations  closed two production facilities and two distribution facilities and discontinued a production operation 
the company has also reduced employment at various other locations as scheduled 
of the original million provision  the balance of the accrued liabilities remaining at december   is million and million remains as a reserve against property  plant and equipment 
management believes that the remainder of the reserve is adequate to complete the restructuring and integration program 
income taxes 
after considering utilization restrictions  the company has approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards nols which will be available as follows million in  million in each of the years and  million in and million in nols not utilized in the first year that they are available may be carried over and utilized to reduce taxable income earned in subsequent years  subject to their expiration provisions 
these carryforwards expire as follows million in  million in  million in  million in and million during the years through as a result  management anticipates that the company s cash income tax liability for the next four to five years will not be material 
the amount of the company s nols and the limitation of their availability are subject to significant uncertainties 
in addition  a future change in stock ownership could result in the company s nols being substantially reduced or eliminated 
the company has implemented certain stock transfer restrictions which reduce this risk of loss 
in accordance with fresh start reporting as prescribed by statement of position  financial reporting by entities in reorganization under the bankruptcy code  issued by the american institute of certified public accountants  the company will not reflect the realized income tax benefit of pre reorganization nols and deductible temporary differences in its statement of operations 
instead  such benefit is reflected first as a reduction in the reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets reorganization value and then as a reduction in other intangible assets arising from bankruptcy  thus reducing future intangible amortization expense 
due to the non deductibility of amortization of certain intangible assets  the annual effective tax rate in future years is expected to be in excess of the statutory income tax rate 
in  the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
implementing the standard resulted in the company recording a deferred tax benefit of approximately million for deductible temporary differences 
the company provided a valuation allowance for the remaining net deductible temporary differences and nols 
in determining the valuation allowance  the company considers projected taxable income during the next four years 
the projected taxable income before nols is expected to be higher than the financial pre tax income due to the non deductible amortization of the intangible assets related to reorganization value and other non deductible intangible assets and the fact that the tax basis of the assets was not increased as a result of the reorganization in september accordingly  the company expects to realize the net deferred tax asset from future operations  which contemplates annual increases in sales consistent with industry projections  and historical operating margins but does not anticipate any material asset sales or other unusual transactions 
the acquisitions of kpr and tnt are expected to increase the likelihood that the net deferred tax asset will be realized 
this analysis is performed on a quarterly basis 
the company will adjust the valuation allowance when it becomes more likely than not that the net deferred tax benefits will be realized in the future 
the company anticipates that this analysis will support the elimination of a significant portion of the valuation allowance in because a majority of the deferred tax assets and nols are attributable to pre reorganization temporary differences  the majority of the adjustment will be recorded as a reduction of reorganization value and other intangible assets arising from bankruptcy and the remainder will be recorded as a reduction of income tax expense

management believes that cash flow from operations combined with the borrowing capacity available under the company s credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the company s existing operating and debt service cash requirements for the foreseeable future

the company s primary raw materials are fresh and frozen meat  cheese  vegetables  milk products and flour 
severe price swings in such raw materials  and the resultant impact on the price the company charges for its products  at times have had  and may in the future have  material adverse effects on the demand for the company s products and its profits 
the company utilizes several techniques for reducing the risk of future raw materials price increases 
these techniques include purchasing and freezing raw materials during seasonally low cost periods of the year  negotiating certain minimum purchase commitments at set prices and periodically entering into futures contracts 
such techniques are generally employed prior to an expected seasonal price increase and in connection with fixed price sales agreements to hedge the cost of raw materials for both firm and forecasted sales commitments that will occur during a seasonal sales peak 
futures contracts as described above are accounted for as hedges 
accordingly  resulting gains or losses are deferred and recognized as part of the product cost 
the company s fiscal year end is typically a seasonal low point in hedging activities and deferred losses as of the end of fiscal  and were each less than million

a subsidiary of the company is a defendant in a lawsuit filed prior to the company s acquisition 
the plaintiff alleges liability based upon patent infringement  misappropriation of proprietary information  unfair business practices and breach of contract 
although the plaintiff has not specified any amount of damages  liability for patent infringement may include disgorgement of profits which the company believes could be material 
the subsidiary has denied these allegations and contends that the plaintiff s patents are invalid and that  even if valid  the process and equipment used by the subsidiary does not infringe the patents 
the company and its subsidiary instituted a declaratory judgement action against the plaintiff 
see business legal proceedings 
the litigation is complex and the ultimate outcome can not be presently determined 
although the company will vigorously defend its interests  no assurance can be given that a material adverse effect will not result from the litigation 
impact of changing prices and inflation as previously discussed  the impact of changing prices on the company s operations is primarily a function of the company s raw material commodity prices 
these prices are subject to many forces including those of the marketplace and inflation 
the impact of changing prices on raw materials has decreased since the company exited the volatile retail refrigerated processed meat case business 
the company does not believe that inflation played a major role in either the cost of raw materials or labor  or the selling price of its products during fiscal  fiscal or fiscal like many food processors  the company periodically adjusts selling prices of its products  subject to competitive constraints and costs of raw materials
