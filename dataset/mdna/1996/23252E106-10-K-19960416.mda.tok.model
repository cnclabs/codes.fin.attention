in may  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for certain debt and equity investments sfas 
the company adopted the provisions of the standard in the first quarter the cumulative effect of adopting sfas as of january  was not material to the company s financial condition or results of operations

liquidity and capital resources at december   the company s working capital was approximately million  including cash and investments of million  its current ratio was to and total short term and long term borrowings were approximately million 
as a result of the sale of the lumex division  completed on april  for million in cash  the company s financial condition was considerably improved as the company repaid all of its borrowings other than approximately million 
the remaining debt structures are industrial bond financings on two of the company s properties at rates well below the bank prime rate 
in prior years the company s manufacturing operations had generated sufficient cash flow through earnings and asset management to meet its operating needs  including capital expenditures 
the company s leasing subsidiary  cybex financial corp  utilized a combination of long and short term borrowings and  beginning in  began selling portions of its lease portfolio under limited recourse agreements as a means to fund leasing activities 
during the company significantly increased capital expenditures  including a re layout of the lumex division s bay shore manufacturing facility  and experienced significant growth in leasing activities for lumex division s therapeutic support systems  which  combined with larger than expected operating losses  resulted in significant expansion of corporate borrowings

the company sells portions of its lease portfolio under several different limited or full recourse programs 
generally  recourse is limited to less than of the lease stream sold and may be reduced annually 
leases are secured by the equipment sold as well as personal guarantees and often require cash downpayments 
these provisions  combined with the company s ability to refurbish and remarket equipment returned  have effectively limited the company s exposure to losses due to default 
losses under these programs were not significant during the past three years 
with the close of the sale of its lumex division and the concurrent paydown of short and long term borrowings the company s capital structure is conservative with total bank debt representing of total stockholders equity 
the company has a million bank line of credit under which  subsequent to the sale of the lumex division  there were no outstanding borrowings 
management expects the cash flow generated from its manufacturing operations plus the net proceeds from the sale of the lumex division will be sufficient to meet its general working capital and capital expenditure requirements  including those related to the restructuring of its continuing operations 
the company s finance subsidiary is expected to support its continued growth through periodic sales of its lease portfolios
