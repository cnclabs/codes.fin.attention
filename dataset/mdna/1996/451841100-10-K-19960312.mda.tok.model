item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations significant developments four year growth plan and plan in the fall of  the company announced a four year growth plan designed to increase revenues million to million  reduce the operating ratio four percentage points to and reduce interest expense million to million 
by december   the company had achieved the operating ratio and interest expense reduction goals 
therefore  in the spring of  the company developed and announced plan this new plan is designed to build on the success of the plan and position the company for the next century 
plan calls for i revenue to grow from the base of million to million by the end of  ii the continued reduction of the operating ratio to below  and iii a long term equity enhancement program of increased dividends and share repurchases 
as of december   following revenue increases of  and in  and  respectively  revenue was higher than and only million below the original four year million target 
the revenue of million is slightly ahead of the target specified in plan contributing to the revenue growth since were gains in intermodal  grain and grain mill and chemicals  despite a decline in coal 
plan was developed primarily as a management tool and is subject to factors and assumptions which could impact on its achievability 
the most significant risks that could impact plan are its economic assumptions  the haulage agreement with the southern pacific railroad southern pacific and export grain demand 
the plan assumes industrial production will rise  an average in each year through with a soft landing of in historically  the company s growth excluding coal and export grain  which are not affected by industrial production  has been to of industrial production 
plan assumes the historical trend will continue 
as to the southern pacific  intermodal haulage between memphis and chicago is expected to remain in excess of  units annually 
however  the southern pacific and the union pacific railroad have indicated that this business will be re evaluated following their merger 
unlike the very low level and the unusually strong grain traffic levels  plan expects export grain traffic will be closer to the historical norm 
local union agreements in the company began to negotiate separate distinct agreements with each of its eleven unions on a local basis effectively withdrawing from the traditional pattern of bargaining on a national basis with the other railroads 
to date eight unions  representing of the railroad s union workforce  have ratified agreements which cover wages and work rule issues through these agreements provide wage increases of per year on average 
upon ratification  signing bonuses of million were paid 
in november  the company and the united transportation union utu entered into a tentative agreement subject to membership ratification 
this agreement represented a significant change in the basis of paying operating employees  with an hourly wage system replacing a mileage based system 
on february   the company was notified by the utu that its members had rejected the agreement 
as a result  no amounts have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements associated with this agreement 
the company will seek counsel of the national mediation board who facilitated the agreement in november 
ccp holdings  inc acquisition on january   the company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to purchase all the stock of ccp holdings  inc  for approximately million in cash  and the assumption of approximately million in net debt and approximately million of capitalized lease obligations 
the company expects to fund the acquisition using funds from its existing line of credit and the proceeds of public debt issued by the railroad 
the railroad will transfer the funds to the company via a combination of dividends and intercompany loans 
the purchase will not close until required regulatory approval from the surface transportation board is obtained  which is expected by no later than september the company will account for the transaction as a purchase 
the total purchase price is subject to various potential adjustments for up to one year after the closing date 
ccp holdings  inc  principal subsidiaries are the chicago  central and pacific railroad ccp and the cedar river railroad crr 
these two railroads comprise a class ii freight system which operates miles of road 
ccp operates from chicago west to omaha  nebraska  with connecting lines to cedar rapids and sioux city  iowa 
crr runs north from waterloo  iowa to albert lea  minnesota 
ccp holdings  inc s revenues were approximately million  its operating ratio was approximately  and its shareholders equity was approximately million at december  railroad industry mergers during  the merger of the burlington northern railroad and the sante fe railway and the merger of the union pacific railroad and the chicago and northwestern railroad were completed and the intended acquisition of the southern pacific by the union pacific railroad was announced 
these consolidations have the potential to increase competition in the railroad s service territory 
to date  the impact on the railroad s operation or financial results has not been material  but continued consolidations could limit the railroad s access to shippers 
stock split on january   the board declared a for stock split in the form of a stock dividend to holders of record on february  new certificates will be issued march  fractional shares will be settled in cash at a rate of per share 
when certificates are issued  the approximate million shares outstanding will increase to approximately million 
all share counts  options outstanding  option prices and per share information presented in this annual report have been restated to reflect the for split as if it had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented

the expense associated with this transaction is accounted for as other income expense  net  not interest expense  net  and when coupled with paydowns of other existing debt  produced the decrease in interest expense 
net income was further affected by two unusual transactions

a significant source of cash in million was the realization of settlement proceeds with numerous insurance carriers in connection with asbestos and hearing loss casualty claims

another million will be spent to construct a bulk transfer facility along the mississippi river in louisiana 
these expenditures are expected to be met from current operations or other available sources 
the aforementioned capital expenditures excludes the january announcement of the acquisition of ccp holdings  inc for million cash and assumption of debt and capital lease obligations 
see significant developments 
since  a major financial goal has been to reduce leverage  expand funding sources  lower funding costs and obtain upgraded credit ratings from the debt rating services 
some of the steps taken have included replacing high coupon public debt with private debt and public debt with lower interest rates  renegotiating existing bank credit agreements  obtaining separate unsecured credit lines for the company and the railroad  selling accounts receivables and initiating in and expanding in a commercial paper program 
under the railroad s commercial paper program a total of million can be issued and outstanding at any one time 
the program is supported by a million revolver with the railroad s lending group see below 
at december   standard poor s corporation s p  moody s investor services moody s and fitch investors service fitch have rated the commercial paper a  p and f  respectively  and million was outstanding 
for the year the rates ranged from to 
the railroad views this program as a significant long term funding source and intends to issue replacement notes as each existing issue matures 
therefore  commercial paper borrowings are classified as long term 
the railroad s public debt is rated baa by moody s and bbb by s p 
in  the railroad entered into a revolving agreement to sell undivided percentage interests in certain of its accounts receivable  with recourse  to a financial institution 
the agreement  which expires in june  allows for sales of accounts receivable up to a maximum of million at any one time 
the railroad services the accounts receivable sold under the agreement and retains the same exposure to credit loss as existed prior to the sale 
at december   the maximum had been sold pursuant to the agreement 
costs related to the agreement fluctuate with changes in prevailing interest rates 
these costs  which are included in other income expense  net  were million for the year ended december  in april  the railroad concluded negotiations with its bank lending group whereby the railroad s revolver was amended and restated  for the third time since becoming unsecured in september  to a million revolver expiring in fees and borrowing spreads are predicated on the railroad s long term credit ratings 
currently  the annual facility fee is basis points and borrowings under this agreement are at eurodollar offered rate plus basis points 
this amended facility replaced the million revolver due in the revolver will be used primarily for backup for the railroad s commercial paper program but can be used for general corporate purposes 
the available amount is reduced by the outstanding amount of commercial paper borrowings and any letters of credit issued on behalf of the railroad under the facility 
no amounts have been drawn under the revolver 
at december   the million was limited to million because million in commercial paper was outstanding and 
million in letters of credit had been issued 
the company has million day floating rate revolving loan agreement which charges a basis point annual facility fee and libor plus basis points on any borrowings  and expires in august no amounts have been drawn upon during the company s financing leasing subsidiaries have approximately million in long term borrowing agreements which were used to acquire a total of locomotives during and and  freight cars in the company believes that its available cash  cash generated by its operations and cash available from the facilities described above will be sufficient to meet foreseeable liquidity requirements 
additionally  the company believes it and its primary subsidiary the railroad have access to the public debt market if needed 
various borrowings of the company s subsidiaries are governed by agreements which contain financial and operating covenants 
all entities were in compliance with these covenant requirements at december   and management does not anticipate any difficulty in maintaining such compliance 
certain covenants of the railroad s debt agreements require specific levels of tangible net worth but not a specific dividend restriction 
the railroad paid dividends to the company of million in  million in and million in at december   the railroad s tangible net worth exceeded the required level by approximately million 
in january  the railroad declared and paid a dividend of million to the company 
in  the railroad prepaid the holders of its million senior notes at face value plus accrued interest and a prepayment penalty 
the monies used to fund the prepayment were provided by commercial paper  the net proceeds of the million non callable year notes due may and million from existing lines of credit 
the prepayment resulted in an extraordinary loss of million  million after tax 
per share 
the line of credit borrowings were replaced with the proceeds of medium term notes mtn 
the mtn s expire as follows million coupon in  million coupon in  and million coupon in in  a million extraordinary loss  net of million in tax benefits  was incurred in connection with the railroad s tender offer for its million senior subordinated debentures debentures and the costs associated with calling the debentures 
in connection with the tender offer for the debentures  the railroad issued million of non callable  year notes due and irrevocably placed funds with a trustee to cover principal  a premium and interest through the first call date of october   for the untendered debentures 
the railroad has entered into various diesel fuel collar agreements designed to mitigate significant changes in fuel prices 
as a result  approximately of the railroad s short term diesel fuel requirements through june and for the period july through june are protected against significant price changes 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company has paid approximately million  million and million in   and  respectively  for severance  lump sum signing awards and other costs associated with the various agreements signed in  and the previously announced agreement with the united transportation union covering wages and work rule issues through failed to ratify 
see significant developments 
as the company continues to negotiate with its remaining operating unions on a local level  agreements may be reached that require significant lump sum payments 
it is too early to determine if separate agreements will be reached but management believes available funding sources will be sufficient to meet any required payments 
long term equity enhancement program the company paid its sixteenth consecutive quarterly cash dividend on january  the board believes quarterly dividends are an integral part of its announced long term equity enhancement program designed to increase stockholder value through dividend payments and stock repurchases 
actual dividends are declared by the board of directors based on profitability  capital expenditure requirements  debt service and other factors 
at december   the railroad exceeded its tangible net worth covenant by million 
during  the company completed the million stock repurchase program acquiring  shares in open market transactions 
while intended to be an annual component of the long term equity enhancement program  the board concluded that alternative funding needs  most notably the acquisition of ccp holdings  inc  the expansion of the intermodal facility in chicago and the construction of a bulk transfer facility in louisiana warranted the suspension of share repurchases for the board intends to review the level of stock repurchase annually 
environmental liabilities the company s operations are subject to comprehensive environmental regulation by federal  state and local authorities 
compliance with such regulation requires the company to modify its operations and expend substantial manpower and financial resources 
under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of superfund  and similar state and federal laws  the company is potentially liable for the cost of clean up of various contaminated sites 
the company has been notified that it is a potentially responsible party at sites ranging from those with hundreds of potentially responsible parties to sites at which the company is primarily responsible 
the company generally participates in the clean up at sites where other substantial parties share responsibility through cost sharing arrangements  but under superfund and other similar laws the company can be held jointly and severally liable for all environmental costs associated with such sites 
the company is aware of approximately contaminated sites and various fueling facilities at which it is probably liable for some portion of the clean up 
the company paid approximately million in toward the investigation and remediation of those sites  and anticipates future expenditures of between million and million annually 
furthermore  recent amendments to the clean air act require the environmental protection agency to promulgate regulations restricting the level of pollutants in locomotive emissions which could impose significant retrofitting requirements  operational inefficiencies or capital expenditures in the future 
for all known sites of environmental contamination where company loss or liability is probable  the company has recorded an estimated liability at the time when a reasonable estimate of remediation cost and company liability can first be determined 
adjustments to initial estimates are recorded as necessary based upon additional information developed in subsequent periods 
estimates of the company s potential financial exposure for environmental claims or incidents are necessarily imprecise because of the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and extent of contamination  the varying costs of alternative methods of remediation  the regulatory clean up standards which will be applied  and the appropriate allocation of liability among multiple responsible parties 
at december   the company estimated the probable range of its estimated liability to be million to million  and in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
had a reserve of million for environmental contingencies 
this amount is not reduced for potential insurance recoveries or third party contribution where the company is primarily liable 
the risk of incurring environmental liability in connection with both past and current activities is inherent in railroad operations 
decades old railroad housekeeping practices were not always consistent with contemporary standards  historically the company leased substantial amounts of property to industrial tenants  and the railroad continues to haul hazardous materials which are subject to occasional accidental release 
because the ultimate cost of known contaminated sites cannot be definitively established and because additional contaminated sites yet unknown may be discovered or future operations may result in accidental releases  no assurance can be given that the company will not incur material environmental liabilities in the future 
however  based on its assessments of the facts and circumstances now known  management believes that it has recorded adequate reserves for known liabilities and does not expect future environmental charges or expenditures to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations  cash flow or liquidity
