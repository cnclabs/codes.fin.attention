overview since commencement of its operations in october  the company has been developing interactive technologies and software applications 
to date  it has devoted a majority of its resources to research and development activities  marketing and licensing its technology  recruiting and supporting third party licensees  and expanding its administrative organization 
more recently and in the future the company will devote greater resources to its multi platform software publishing and distribution businesses  and other businesses derived from leveraging its graphics technologies into other markets 
prior to december  the company generated a majority of its revenue from software royalties and pressing fees on titles published by its software licensees for the do multiplayer platform 
the company has also derived revenue from the sale of development systems to licensees  license fees for rights to manufacture do formatted cds  software title development activities whereby the company developed titles under contract for publishing by third parties  engineering activities under contract to third parties  technology licensing fees  and the licensing and distribution of software titles published by the company and others 
revenue has also been generated from royalties paid by semiconductor foundries upon their sale of licensed chipsets to hardware system manufacturers see results of operations below 
in the near term  the company expects to derive the majority of its revenue from technology licensing fees and the publishing and distribution of internally and externally developed software titles 
while revenue from title development for third parties was a significant contributor to revenue for fiscal year and for the first quarter of fiscal year  the company does not expect any additional such revenue as the company now funds and publishes its own software titles 
for most of fiscal year and fiscal year  the focus of the company s business was on maximizing royalty revenues from the pressing of third party software cds that played on the do multiplayer systems marketed and distributed by panasonic and goldstar  which failed to achieve market acceptance 
as a result  this third party cd pressing royalty stream is expected to decrease significantly  to less than of revenue in fiscal year the company is in the process of establishing operations as a multi platform entertainment software developer and publisher  and also intends to leverage its d graphics technologies into multiple markets 
these technology revenues will mostly be in the form of license fees with the near term focus on the video game console  pc  and digital video markets 
the company generally recognizes revenue from the sale of software titles  development systems  or digital video systems at the time of shipment 
revenue from the m technology license agreement with matsushita  and the joint development and license agreement with cirrus logic  and other engineering contracts  is recognized using the percentage of completion method 
the company and matsushita entered into a definitive license agreement  dated december   pursuant to which the company granted matsushita a perpetual  exclusive  worldwide license  with the right to grant sublicenses  with respect to the company s bit interactive multimedia technology known as m the m technology for use in both hardware and software for games and for all other applications the technology license agreement 
the license was granted in exchange for an upfront license payment of million to be paid in two installments and for certain royalties which shall be paid for certain software products manufactured after january   which are compatible with the m technology 
as of march   the company had received the first installment of the license fee of million  less million in japanese withholding taxes  of which million has been recognized as revenue for the fiscal year ended march  as of march   the company had incurred approximately million of costs in connection with fulfilling its commitments under the technology licensing agreement 
the remaining million payment  less million in japanese withholding taxes  is scheduled to be received by june   provided that the company has delivered to matsushita certain deliverable items pertaining to the m technology pursuant to the technology licensing agreement 
on april   the company agreed to make certain modifications to the m system design  pursuant to the terms of an addendum the addendum to the technology licensing agreement 
as consideration for providing engineering and certain support services  the company will receive an aggregate fee of approximately million to be received in installments in fiscal and the payments by matsushita are contingent upon the company timely meeting certain milestones  as stipulated in the addendum 
the company intends to recognize this revenue as these milestones are achieved 
concurrent with the execution of the technology license agreement  matsushita and the company entered into a separate stock purchase and license agreement whereby matsushita acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of do japan co  ltd 
for  the approximate book value of the entity at the date of closing 
this entity of approximately people was responsible for the third party support activities of the bit do multiplayer platform 
in february  the company licensed the d graphics portion of the m technology to cirrus logic  a leader in video graphics controllers  for the development of high end d graphics chips for the pc market 
under the terms of the joint development and license agreement with cirrus logic the cirrus agreement the company will develop certain modifications to the d engine  which is a component of its proprietary semiconductor technology 
as consideration under such agreement  the company is to receive a non refundable amount not to exceed million  of which million was received as of march  and the remaining million is scheduled to be paid as certain dates are achieved and as the company fulfills its obligations specified under the agreement 
revenue pertaining to the cirrus agreement will be recognized using the percentage of completion method based on the costs incurred to fulfill its commitments as specified in the agreement 
as of march   the company had recognized million of revenue in connection with the cirrus agreement 
in november of  the company acquired the business  including all of the assets and certain of the liabilities of cyclone studios  a software developer 
consideration for the purchase consisted of upfront cash and stock  and potential future consideration based upon the financial performance of the respective new division 
the upfront portion of the purchase price  approximately  was expensed as acquired in process research and development in the third quarter of fiscal on may   the company acquired all the outstanding capital stock of archetype interactive corporation archetype  a person software developer of a multi user role playing game designed to be played over the internet 
in exchange for the outstanding capital stock of archetype  the company issued shares of its common stock to the archetype shareholders 
the company intends to account for this acquisition under the pooling of interests method 
on may   the company entered into a letter of intent to purchase the assets and assume certain liabilities of new world computing  inc nwc  an entertainment software company 
as consideration for the purchase  the company will issue approximately million shares of its common stock to nwc 
the actual number of shares to be issued by the company will be subject to adjustments based upon certain nwc assets and liabilities on the closing date  which is anticipated to occur in early july in addition  under the terms of the letter of intent  the company will be obligated to make a cash payment to nwc in the event that the value of the do stock issued in the transaction falls below per share during a period following the closing date 
the closing of the transaction will be subject to the company s satisfactory completion of due diligence and other customary conditions of closing 
the company intends to account for the acquisition using the purchase method of accounting 
the company expects that its operating results will fluctuate as a result of a wide variety of factors  including changes in the composition of the company s revenues  the timing of new hardware and software product introductions by its licensees and by its competitors  the company s expenditures on research and development  marketing and promotional programs  and the general state of the national and global economies 
in addition  the company s revenue will be affected by the seasonal nature of the market for consumer electronics products and variations as a result of the demand for particular software titles 
the market for the company s interactive multimedia software products is highly competitive 
a variety of companies offer products that compete directly with the company s software products 
the company has recently announced a strategy to develop games for the pc platform 
the market for pc entertainment software products is hit driven  price sensitive and characterized by a large number of similar products competing for limited retail shelf space 
the company also intends to develop games for the m platform  which is expected to be manufactured and marketed by matsushita 
however  until the company has successfully ported or created new games for the pc platform or until the m platform is launched and a reasonable installed base is created  both of which could take many quarters  the company s ability to successfully compete in these markets is unknown 
publishing revenues associated with titles specifically for the do multiplayer platform are expected to decline substantially 
the company s technology business is also very competitive 
the focus of this business is the design and licensing of bit d graphics technologies for the video game console and pc markets 
there have been a number of new entrants into these markets over the past two years introducing low cost  high performance graphics chips 
although agreements have been signed with matsushita and cirrus logic to license the company s technology  there can be no assurance that any future agreements of this nature can be completed

see note h of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in july  the company completed a private equity financing of approximately million 
the current ratio current assets to current liabilities was
