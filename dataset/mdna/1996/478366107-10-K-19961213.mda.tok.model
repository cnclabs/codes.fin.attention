environmental  health and safety matters the company s us operations are governed by federal environmental laws  principally the resource conservation and recovery act  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  the clean air act  and the clean water act  as well as state counterparts environmental laws  and by federal and state laws addressing worker safety and health worker safety laws 
these laws govern ongoing operations and the remediation of sites associated with past operations 
under certain circumstances these laws provide for civil and criminal penalties and fines  as well as injunctive and remedial relief 
the company s policy is to comply with applicable environmental laws and worker safety laws  and it has expended substantial resources  both financial and managerial  to comply with such laws and for measures designed to protect the environment and maximize worker protection and safety 
the company believes it is in substantial compliance with such laws  and maintains procedures designed to ensure compliance 
however  the company has been  and in the future may become  the subject of formal or informal enforcement actions or proceedings 
such matters typically are resolved by negotiation with regulatory authorities resulting in commitments to compliance or abatement programs and payment of penalties 
historically  neither such commitments nor penalties imposed on the company have been material 
environmental laws require that certain parties fund remedial actions regardless of fault  legality of original disposal or ownership of the site 
the company is currently participating in environmental assessment and remediation at a number of sites under these laws  and it is likely that in the future the company will be involved in additional environmental assessments and remediations 
such sites include facilities that had been engaged in the recycling of lead batteries 
future remediation expenses at these and other sites are subject to a number of uncertainties  including the method and extent of remediation dependent  in part  on existing laws and technology  the percentage and type of material attributable to the company  the financial viability of site owners and the other parties  and the availability of insurance coverage 
a charge to earnings is recorded for sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
environmental considerations are a part of all significant capital expenditure decisions  however  expenditures in related solely to environmental compliance were not material 
environmental remediation  compliance and management expenses incurred by the company in were approximately million 
at september   an accrued liability of approximately million was maintained relating to environmental matters 
the company s environmental liabilities are undiscounted and do not take into consideration any possible recoveries of future insurance proceeds 
because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities  future expenses to remediate the currently identified sites could be considerably higher than the accrued liability 
however  while neither the timing nor the amount of ultimate costs associated with known environmental assessment and remediation matters can be determined at this time  the company does not expect that these matters will have a material adverse effect on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
on june   the company appealed to the wisconsin court of appeals  the milwaukee county circuit court s order granting the summary judgement motion of the employers insurance of wausau and dismissing johnson controls complaint seeking to recover environmental response costs at sites 
the circuit court based its decision on the reasoning of a wisconsin supreme court case that held that under the law of wisconsin  response costs under cercla are not damages as that term is used in comprehensive general liability policies 
this appeal is still pending 
the company has not recorded any anticipated recoveries of future insurance proceeds  and therefore  the outcome of this case should have no significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
if future environmental and worker safety laws contain more stringent requirements than currently anticipated  expenditures may have a more significant effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in general  the company s competitors face the same laws  and  accordingly  the company should not be placed at a competitive disadvantage 
risk factors except for the historical information contained herein  certain matters discussed in this management s discussion and analysis are forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act pslra of  which involve risks and uncertainties  and are subject to change based on various important factors 
the company wishes to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the pslra by cautioning that numerous important factors as discussed in the company s form k filing dated september   among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  the company s actual results and could cause its actual consolidated results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statement made by  or on behalf of  the company
