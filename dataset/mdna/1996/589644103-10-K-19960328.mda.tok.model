item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company continues to strive for profitable growth and has made several advances in that area during the past year 
through a reinsurance pooling agreement between meridian mutual and meridian security  the company currently receives percent of all the property and casualty business of the combined insurance operations 
during the fourth quarter of  meridian mutual and meridian security gained admittance to the states of iowa and minnesota 
meridian mutual was also granted a license to write property and casualty business in the state of pennsylvania  with meridian security expecting to receive regulatory approval for admission during the first quarter of meridian security charted new territory in by beginning to write personal and farm lines policies in the states of kentucky  ohio  tennessee  and wisconsin 
on december   meridian mutual entered into an indemnity reinsurance agreement with celina mutual insurance company celina  covering a book of commercial lines business 
under this agreement  celina will transfer approximately million of its pennsylvania commercial lines annual premiums to meridian mutual along with access to approximately independent insurance agents located in the state of pennsylvania 
since this transaction occurred at the end of the year  it had no impact on the company s statement of income 
meridian mutual s underwriting results related to this business will be pooled with meridian security s 
on february   the company announced its intent to acquire citizens security group inc citizens for approximately million in cash 
this pending acquisition will fit well into the company s plan for geographic expansion into additional midwestern and north central states 
when the acquisition of citizens is completed  the company s operating territory will expand into four additional states minnesota  missouri  north dakota and south dakota  and its revenue base will increase in iowa  ohio and wisconsin 
the company will gain control of citizens security mutual insurance company as a result of the acquisition 
direct written premiums for the citizens affiliated companies were approximately million in underwriting results of citizens are expected to be incorporated into a pooling arrangement with meridian mutual and meridian security 
during  the company continued implementation of processes that were re engineered during personal computer based client server technology is now in use to support the data gathering activities and rating of four major lines of business 
a commercial lines select business unit was organized to handle certain commercial accounts by identifying those that require further underwriter scrutiny  and assigning those accounts to underwriters with the appropriate level of authority 
resulting productivity improvements were as high as forty percent for some of the affected transactions 
these productivity gains allow the company to increase policy counts with minimal staffing increases 
during  the company expects to install an automated personal lines underwriting system that will enable policies meeting certain criteria to be issued without manual review  thus reducing costs without increasing risk 
if an application for certain types of policies receives a passing grade electronically  the policy will be automatically issued 
if the application is kicked out electronically for any number of reasons  it is then passed on to an underwriter for further review 
we believe this is how automation can be used to assure consistent underwriting compliance and cost effectively leverage the experience of senior underwriters 
the company has made substantial progress in automated agency interface 
meridian began uploading private passenger automobile and homeowners policy information from agencies during information is entered on the agencies computer systems and then transmitted directly to meridian s computer system 
uploading and downloading reduce the duplication of efforts by both agency and company personnel for processing policies 
by the end of  over agencies were receiving policy information downloaded directly from meridian s mainframe computer 
plans for include adding approximately more upload agencies and more download agencies 
results of operations compared to in  the company reported record highs in net income of million and earnings per common share of 
this compares to net income of million and per share 
the improved results were primarily attributed to increased revenues and a reduction in all three components of the combined underwriting and expense ratio 
total revenues increased percent to million from million while the statutory combined ratio improved to percent from percent for net premiums earned for reflected percent growth to million from s million 
this growth was attributed to nearly all major lines of business 
meridian s personal lines production for experienced growth of percent 
this was primarily attributed to the homeowners and private passenger automobile lines of business  which reflected earned premium growth of percent and percent  respectively 
farmowners achieved earnings growth of percent  while meridian s commercial lines of business grew percent over the level 
the increase in commercial lines was attributed primarily to percent growth in the commercial automobile line and percent increase in voluntary workers compensation business 
depressing the commercial lines growth was a reduction of nearly  in assumed earned premiums from the national workers compensation pool nwcp 
this partially resulted from actions taken by meridian to control the type of workers compensation business it would accept in states where the nwcp was unprofitable 
the commercial lines growth was also hampered by soft market conditions  primarily in the state of michigan where premium volume declined from the level 
meridian has addressed its products  rates and personnel in the state of michigan and will continue to monitor these actions for improved results 
total policy count  on a pooled basis  for increased by approximately  policies  or percent  over the total 
net investment income for increased percent to million from million in resulting primarily from a larger invested asset base 
a reduction in the company s pre tax net investment yield to percent in from percent in primarily was a result of a greater proportion of common stocks and tax exempt bonds in the investment portfolio and increased investment expenses 
during the company realized gains on the disposition of invested assets of million compared to million of realized gains for the prior year 
such gains were realized primarily on the sale of common stocks and have an insignificant effect on future investment yields 
the company s incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses of million for increased percent over s million  primarily as a result of the increased volume of business 
the statutory loss and loss adjustment expense ratio improved to percent in comparison to percent for the previous year 
the company reflected improved results in its commercial multiple peril  homeowner and workers compensation lines of business 
the loss ratio for commercial multiple peril improved significantly from s ratio of percent to a percent ratio in homeowners also recorded a reduction from percent in to percent in a reduction in liability claims for the current period was the primary reason for the improvement in these lines of business 
the company also experienced improved underwriting results in both the voluntary and involuntary workers compensation lines 
partially offsetting these improvements was deterioration in the personal and commercial automobile and farmowners lines of business 
the loss ratio for personal and commercial auto increased to percent from percent in primarily as a result of increased severity 
the deterioration in the farmowners loss ratio to percent for from percent in was caused by a rise in liability claims 
general operating expenses incurred during of million decreased percent from million reported for lower state income taxes  reduced assessments from the nwcp and certain economies of scale were the primary contributors to the expense reduction 
the reduced expenses  combined with a slight reduction in the company s average commission rate  produced a statutory expense ratio of percent for the current period compared to percent for the prior year 
amortization expenses of million for the period increased percent from million  corresponding with the company s growth in premium volume 
the company s effective tax rate in increased to percent compared to the prior year s percent 
this increase was attributed to an overall growth in taxable income causing the company to be subject to less relative impact of tax exempt income and the dividends received deduction 
compared to net income for was million  or per share of common stock 
this compares to income before change in accounting method of million  or per share for on approximately  fewer weighted average shares outstanding 
the cumulative effect of the accounting change for income taxes added  or 
per share  to the results 
the company s net premiums earned in increased percent to million from the million reported in commercial lines growth of million came primarily from the workers compensation and commercial package products 
personal lines premiums grew million in  with the majority of growth seen in the personal automobile and homeowners lines of business 
farmowners products reported growth of million 
total year end policy count for all meridian lines increased percent over net investment income of million represents an improvement of percent over the total of million 
the company s effective investment yield for declined to percent from percent in a greater emphasis on the purchase of tax exempt municipal bonds and equity securities produced a lower average portfolio yield 
realized gains of million declined from the million reported at year end the company s statutory loss and loss adjustment expense ratio deteriorated slightly from the percent reported in to percent for the year end loss ratio for commercial auto was percent compared to percent reported in increase in liability claim frequency accounts for the higher ratio in this line 
however  improvement was seen in the voluntary workers compensation results from the percent reported in to percent reported at year end  due to both an increase in earned premiums and a decline in the average loss payment 
meridian continues to monitor the legislative environment for workers compensation in our operating states to optimize underwriting results 
general operating expenses totaled million  a slight decrease from the million reported in reduced commission expenses were partially offset by an increase in state income taxes 
higher deferred acquisition costs relating to increased premium volume caused the company s amortization expense to grow by percent to million from the million reported in the company s effective tax rate for was percent compared to percent for a larger proportion of tax exempt interest and the dividends received deduction contributed to the effective rate reduction 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary need for liquidity is to pay shareholder dividends  and its main source of liquidity is the receipt of dividends from its subsidiaries 
the company s subsidiaries are subject to state laws and regulations which restrict their ability to pay dividends 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the principal need of the company s insurance subsidiaries for liquid funds is the payment of claims and general operating expenses in the ordinary course of business 
the funds of the company s insurance subsidiaries are generally invested in securities with maturities intended to provide adequate cash to pay such claims and expenses without forced sales of investments 
over the next year  a relatively small portion of the company s bond portfolio is scheduled to mature 
approximately percent of the company s investment assets are held in fixed maturities  substantially all of which are believed to be readily marketable 
within the fixed maturity portfolio  the company holds approximately percent in mortgage backed pass through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations 
the company has attempted to reduce the prepayment risks associated with mortgage backed securities by investing a majority of the collateralized mortgage obligations in planned amortization and very accurately defined tranches 
these investments are designed to alleviate the risk of prepayment by providing predictable principal prepayment schedules within a designated range of prepayments 
the company has no exposure to high risk derivatives in its portfolio 
the company s fixed income investment portfolio consists almost entirely of investment grade securities  the average quality of which is rated aa aa 
the company currently holds all of its fixed maturity investments in the available for sale category which are carried at market value 
in  the carrying values for these investments increased significantly 
as a result  the company at december  recorded unrealized gains in the bond portfolio of approximately million  net of deferred income taxes 
at year end  the company recorded unrealized losses on the bond portfolio of approximately million  net of deferred income taxes 
net unrealized appreciation of investments added to the company s book value per share at december   compared to unrealized losses causing a decrease of per share in december  s book value of 
on february   the company announced that it has entered into a letter of intent to acquire citizens security group  inc of red wing  minnesota for approximately million in cash 
the transaction is subject to the execution of a definitive acquisition agreement and approvals by state regulatory authorities  the companies boards of directors and citizens common and preferred shareholders 
it is anticipated that the acquisition will be completed by mid approximately percent of the cash will be generated from the sale of a portion of meridian security s investment portfolio with the balance likely to be financed with bank debt 
such acquisition financing has not yet been finalized 
this acquisition is expected to generate approximately to million of net premium writings in seven states  four of which the company does not currently operate in 
beginning in  state insurance regulators required companies to calculate risk based capital rbc 
rbc is the capital required to cover the varying degrees of risk inherent in a company s assets  loss reserves  underwriting  and reinsurance 
the company action level rbc is the minimum amount of capital required in order to avoid regulatory action 
meridian security s adjusted capital of million in is over four times the required minimum 
impact of inflation inflation can have a significant impact on property and casualty insurers because premium rates are established before the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses is known 
the company attempts to anticipate increases from inflation in establishing rates  subject to limitations imposed for competitive pricing 
the company considers inflation when estimating liabilities for losses and loss adjustment expenses  particularly for claims having a long period between occurrence and settlement 
the liabilities for losses and loss adjustment expenses are management s estimates of the ultimate net cost of underlying claims and expenses and are not discounted for the time value of money 
in times of inflation  the normally higher investment yields may partially offset potentially higher claims and expenses
