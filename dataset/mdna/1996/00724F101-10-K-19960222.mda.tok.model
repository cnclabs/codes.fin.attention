results of operations overview adobe systems incorporated adobe or the company develops  markets  and supports computer software products and technologies that enable users to create  display  manage  communicate  and print electronic documents 
the company licenses its technology to major computer  printing  and publishing suppliers  and markets a line of application software products and type products for authoring and editing visually rich documents 
the company distributes its products through a network of original equipment manufacturer oem customers  distributors and dealers  and value added resellers vars and system integrators 
the company has operations in the americas  europe  and the pacific rim 
in october  the company acquired frame technology corporation frame 
frame  established in  developed  marketed  and supported writing and publishing software for the creation and distribution of critical business and technical documents 
to effect the combination  approximately million shares of adobe s common stock were issued in exchange for all of the outstanding common stock of frame 
the merger was accounted for by the pooling of interests method  and accordingly  all annual and interim financial information prior to the merger has been restated to combine the results of the company and frame 
in connection with the merger  the company recorded million of merger transaction costs and million of restructuring costs in the fourth quarter of in august  the company acquired aldus corporation aldus 
aldus began operations in and created computer software solutions that help people throughout the world effectively communicate information and ideas 
aldus focused on three lines of business applications for the professional print publishing  graphics  and prepress markets  applications for the general consumer market  and applications for the interactive publishing market 
to effect the combination  approximately million shares of adobe s common stock were issued in exchange for all of the outstanding common stock of aldus 
the merger was accounted for by the pooling of interests method  and accordingly  all annual and interim financial information prior to the merger has been restated to combine the results of the company and aldus 
in connection with the merger  the company recorded million of merger transaction costs and million of restructuring costs in the fourth quarter of in addition  the company incurred one time expenses that are not included in the restructuring charge but were related to the aldus acquisition 
these charges included the write off of certain capitalized software development costs  transition personnel bonuses  and relocation expenses among others  and totaled approximately million 
in january  the company spun off its prepress applications product business to a newly established company  luminous corporation luminous 
under the terms of the agreement  luminous has acquired or licensed and will continue to develop  market  and distribute adobe s prepress application products 
adobe will retain a minority equity interest in luminous and will maintain ownership of certain core technologies for adobe prepress products 
luminous will pay royalties to adobe based on a percentage of revenue from certain products for the next two years 
revenue from prepress application products was approximately million in fiscal revenue change change total revenue revenue growth in and is attributable to increases in both licensing activity related to the company s postscript interpreter and application products shipments resulting from the release of new and enhanced products 
in  the increase in application products revenue was partially offset by the divestiture of aldus freehand in january and the discontinuance of aldus photostyler in late  as further discussed below 
product unit volume as opposed to price growth was the principal factor in the company s revenue growth in application products revenue 
no customer accounted for more than percent of the company s total revenue in   or change change product group revenue licensing percentage of total revenue licensing revenue is derived from shipments by oem customers of products containing the adobe postscript interpreter and the display postscript system 
such products include printers in both roman and japanese languages  imagesetters  and workstations 
licensing revenue is also derived from shipments of products containing the configurable postscript interpreter cpsi by oem customers 
cpsi is a fully functional postscript interpreter that resides on the host computer system rather than in a dedicated controller integrated into an output device 
the configuration flexibility of cpsi allows oems and software developers to create and market a variety of postscript products independently of controller hardware development 
the number of units shipped by oems continued to grow on an annual basis in and royalty per unit is generally calculated as a percentage of the end user list price of a printer  although there are some components of licensing revenue based on a flat dollar amount per unit that typically do not change with list prices 
during this period  some oems introduced lower end printers or reduced their list prices on lower end printers  which resulted in lower royalties per unit on such printers 
however  in and  this trend was offset by increased demand for cpsi and  in  by increased demand for color capability as well as greater penetration into the japanese market  all of which have higher royalties per unit 
the company has seen year to year increases in the number of oem customers from which it is receiving licensing revenue and believes that such increases are attributable to the continued acceptance of postscript software  as well as to the diversification of the company s customer base across multiple platforms 
change change product group revenue application products percentage of total revenue application products revenue is derived from shipments of application software programs marketed through retail and distribution channels  however  the information products are becoming more widely distributed through vars and systems integrators 
application products revenue grew in primarily due to increased demand for adobe photoshop  adobe pagemaker  adobe framemaker  and the adobe acrobat family of products 
the company released adobe pagemaker for the macintosh platform late in the third quarter  and for the windows and windows platforms in the fourth quarter 
in addition  the company released adobe photoshop for the windows platform in the first quarter and released new adobe acrobat products or new versions of existing products throughout the year 
the revenue growth was partially offset by the divestiture of aldus freehand in january and the discontinuance of aldus photostyler late in these two products aggregated million of revenue in in  application products revenue increased as a result of higher sales of adobe illustrator  adobe photoshop  and adobe pagemaker  all of which benefited from the release of new versions in adobe framemaker also showed strong revenue growth 
the release of aldus freehand divested by the company in january for windows and the power macintosh platforms also contributed to the revenue increase 
other factors affecting revenue growth include the release of localized versions for the japanese market of adobe photoshop  adobe illustrator  and adobe pagemaker for the macintosh platform  increased sales of adobe premiere  a video editing and sequencing tool  and the release of adobe illustrator and adobe photoshop for selected unix platforms 
reduced sales for individual typeface packages offset a portion of the revenue growth in direct costs change change direct costs percentage of total revenue direct costs include royalties  amortization of acquired technologies  and direct product  packaging  and shipping costs 
during and  direct costs also included amortization of typeface production costs  which totaled million and million  respectively 
gross margins are affected by the mix of licensing revenue versus application products revenue  as well as the product mix within application products 
the increase in direct costs  in absolute dollars  has been mitigated by actions taken by the company to reduce direct costs 
in  the company achieved lower per unit manufacturing costs for certain products  reduced royalty agreement rates  and reduced typeface production costs amortization 
these actions also benefited and in addition  the purchase relating to adobe photoshop  as further discussed below  resulted in lower direct costs for that product as a percentage of its revenue 
on march   the company entered into an agreement with the developers of the technology underlying its adobe photoshop product under which the company made a lump sum payment to the developers of million in lieu of all royalty obligations incurred in connection with the technology after the beginning of the fourth quarter of accordingly  million of the amount paid to the developers was applied to accrued royalties related to the fourth quarter of and the period prior to the execution of the agreement 
the balance of million is being amortized over months 
this transaction has been recorded on the consolidated balance sheets in other assets as part of purchased technology 
prior to this agreement  the company paid the developers a royalty for each copy of adobe photoshop sold by the company 
to date  the amortization expense related to the purchase has been less than the per copy royalty expense that would otherwise have been incurred 
the company also delivers its type library on its type on call cd rom media  and end users wishing to license typeface designs call the company with a credit card number to receive the unlocking code for the desired typeface 
this method of delivery also contributes to reduced direct costs 
other applications are also available through the company s distributors on cd rom 
operating expenses change change software development costs research and development percentage of total revenue research and development expenses consist principally of salaries and benefits for software developers  contracted development efforts  related facilities costs  and expenses associated with computer equipment used in software development 
research and development expense has increased significantly over the last three years as the company invested in new technologies  new product development  and the infrastructure to support such activities 
the increase reflects the expansion of the company s engineering staff and related costs required to support its continued emphasis on developing new products and enhancing existing products 
many of these engineers are working with oem customers to design and implement postscript level devices 
the company continued working with many of its oem customers in a co development program 
this allows customers to be more self sufficient in new device development by taking on more of the implementation task themselves rather than relying so heavily on the company s engineers 
while this mitigates certain costs  the company continues to make significant investments in development of its postscript and application software products 
the company believes that continued investments in research and development are necessary to remain competitive in the marketplace  and are directly related to continued  timely development of new and enhanced products 
accordingly  the company intends to continue recruiting and hiring experienced software developers 
while the company expects that research and development expenditures in will increase in absolute dollars  such expenditures are expected to decline as a percentage of revenue 
change change software development costs amortization of capitalized software development costs percentage of total revenue in the implementation of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  software development expenditures on adobe products  after achieving technological feasibility  were deemed to be immaterial 
certain software development expenditures on frame and aldus products have been capitalized and are being amortized over the lives of the respective products 
in the fourth quarters of and  software development expenditures on frame and aldus products  respectively  after reaching technological feasibility  were immaterial and the company anticipates this trend to continue in the future 
accordingly  the fourth quarter of and all of reflect the additional expense of amortizing capitalized software development costs acquired with aldus 
all such capitalized software development costs acquired with aldus were fully amortized at the end of likewise  the fourth quarter of did  and all of will  reflect the additional cost of amortizing capitalized software costs acquired with frame in addition to the actual development expenditures classified as research and development made prior to achieving technological feasibility 
amortization of capitalized software development costs decreased in as a result of achieving full amortization of all aldus products by the end of the increase in was due to the amortization of adobe pagemaker  released in the second half of  and the release of other new application products 
it is expected that amortization of software development costs will decrease both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue during as the software products acquired with frame become fully amortized 
change change sales  marketing  and customer support percentage of total revenue sales  marketing  and customer support expenses generally include salaries and benefits  sales commissions  travel expenses  and related facility costs for the company s sales  marketing  customer support  and distribution personnel 
sales  marketing  and customer support expenses also include the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue  such as advertising  trade shows  and other market development programs 
increases in sales  marketing  and customer support expenses are due to increased advertising and promotional expenditures for upgrades of existing products and further development of customer and technical support services to support a growing installed base of customers 
in  reduced costs resulting from the restructuring of the combined company after the acquisition of aldus in resulted in a decrease in costs as a percentage of revenue 
this decrease was partially offset by the effect of the acquisition of frame as well as increased advertising relating to the release of adobe pagemaker and expenses from several major trade shows 
decreased costs expected to result from the restructuring of the combined company after the acquisition of frame will be partially offset by continuing efforts to expand markets and increase penetration into targeted software markets  as well as to respond to increased competition in the software industry 
as a result  sales  marketing  and customer support expenditures are expected to decrease from spending levels as a percentage of revenue 
change change general and administrative percentage of total revenue general and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and benefits  travel expenses  and related facility costs for the finance  human resources  legal  information services  and administrative personnel of the company 
general and administrative expenses also include outside legal and accounting fees  bad debts  and expenses associated with computer equipment and software used in the administration of the business 
general and administrative expenses have decreased each year since  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue 
the expense reflects a higher spending level attributable to the growth of systems  processes  and people necessary to support overall increases in the scope of the company s operations  as well as additional costs incurred for the legal defense and settlement of an aldus class action securities lawsuit 
general and administrative spending decreased as a percentage of revenue in from due to a reduction of salary and depreciation expense resulting from restructuring activities  as well as reduced legal expenditures 
the decrease reflects savings related to the restructuring of the combined company after the acquisition of aldus  partially offset by costs related to the acquisition of frame and write downs related to certain intangible assets 
the company expects general and administrative spending in to be slightly lower than levels as a percentage of revenue 
change change write off of acquired in process research and development percentage of total revenue during   and  the company acquired in purchase transactions one or more software developers 
in each of these transactions  a portion of the purchase price was allocated to in process research and development and was expensed at the time of the acquisitions 
in  this expense relates to ceneca communications  inc  in  to lasertools corporation and compumation  incorporated  and in  to ah software  inc doing business as after hours software and the company of science art 
change change merger transaction and restructuring costs percentage of total revenue merger transaction and restructuring costs for were million 
this represents charges of million less the reversal of million of excess reserves related to restructuring costs recorded in prior years 
during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded merger transaction and restructuring costs associated with the acquisition of frame of million and million  respectively 
the restructuring costs included million related to cash expenditures and noncash items of million  consisting primarily of write offs of redundant equipment and intangible assets 
as of december   million of the balance in accrued restructuring costs represented expected future cash expenditures related to the frame acquisition  most of which will be spent in to execute the acquisition of frame  the company incurred transaction costs consisting principally of transaction fees for investment bankers  attorneys  accountants  financial printing  and other related charges to negotiate the merger  conduct financial and technical due diligence  file appropriate regulatory documents  and solicit shareholder votes 
as a result of the acquisition of frame  certain sales  technical support  customer service  distribution  and administration functions have been or will be combined and or reduced 
such restructuring costs include severance and outplacement charges of million related to approximately terminated employees 
affected employees received notification of their termination by november   and final assignments are expected to be completed by mid to facilitate the operations of the company  the combined organization migrated to common management information systems  which resulted in a write off of the book value of the abandoned systems  as well as of other redundant equipment 
in addition  certain intangible assets that will have no benefit to the combined company were written off 
the write off of abandoned equipment and intangible assets included in restructuring costs was million 
in addition  redundant offices in europe  japan  canada  and the united states will be eliminated 
lease and third party contract termination payments totaling million  resulting from the planned closure of facilities  are accrued as part of the restructuring costs 
the company is unable to determine what effects the merger and restructuring actions will have on future operating results and the financial condition of the organization 
during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded merger transaction and restructuring costs associated with the acquisition of aldus of million and million  respectively 
these costs included million of current and future cash expenditures related to merger transaction fees and expenses  severance and outplacement for approximately terminated employees  and lease and third party contract termination payments resulting from the planned closure of facilities 
noncash items of million consisted primarily of write offs of redundant information systems and equipment and of duplicate product lines 
as a condition to the acquisition of aldus  effective january  the company no longer sells and distributes freehand  the illustration program previously sold and distributed by aldus 
also  photostyler  an image editing software tool  was discontinued in the fourth quarter of  as the product competed with certain existing products of the company 
in addition to the acquisition related expenses recognized in the restructuring charge  the company incurred approximately million of certain one time charges that were recognized in operating expenses 
these charges included writing off certain capitalized software development costs  transition personnel bonuses  relocation expenses  and expenses incurred for integrating the two companies benefit plans 
in the fourth quarter of  the company analyzed the remaining accrued restructuring costs related to the acquisition of aldus 
as a result of this review  it was determined that approximately million represented excess reserves and  therefore  this amount was reversed and credited to merger transaction and restructuring costs in the consolidated statements of income 
as of december   million of the balance in accrued restructuring costs represented expected future cash expenditures related to the aldus acquisition  primarily related to payments under leases on redundant offices that will be incurred in future periods 
due to lower than anticipated revenues experienced in the first three quarters of  frame undertook certain restructuring measures to reduce the size and scope of its operations and re evaluated and redirected its product and distribution strategies 
these actions resulted in restructuring charges totaling million 
in addition  frame incurred other charges relating to the restructuring of approximately million  which consisted primarily of write offs of capitalized software  obsolete inventory and equipment  and the settlement of certain contingencies 
of the total restructuring and other charges  million resulted from the write off of assets  which occurred in  and million involved cash outflows  of which million were incurred in during  the results of the settlement of certain contingencies and changes in frame s foreign distribution in japan were more favorable than expected by approximately million 
however  these amounts were offset by increased estimates of costs related to facilities previously vacated and frame s decision to curtail significantly its irish operations resulting in a charge for termination costs  vacated facilities  and fixed asset write offs 
in  frame paid approximately million in salary costs and approximately million related to the settlement of certain contingencies  changing its foreign distribution in japan  the relocation of its european headquarters  lease payments for vacated facilities  and other charges 
during  frame made cash payments of million and million related to the curtailment of its irish operations and vacated leased facilities  respectively 
in addition  an analysis of its remaining accrued restructuring costs in the fourth quarter of indicated that approximately million represented excess reserves 
this amount was reversed and credited to merger transaction and restructuring costs in the consolidated statements of income 
as of december   million remained accrued and represented anticipated future cash outflows related to lease payments on vacated facilities 
nonoperating income change change interest  investment  and other income percentage of total revenue interest  investment  and other income increased by million in from and decreased by million in from the increase in from is primarily due to a larger investment base and generally higher interest rates in compared to in addition  the company increased the weighted average days to maturity of its investments in  which generated higher rates of return 
interest and other income was adversely impacted by million in  as the company sold several securities acquired in the aldus acquisition for losses in principal created by increases in interest rates during  and for the write off of an investment in a privately held enterprise 
interest  investment  and other income in included a gain of million on the sale of common stock held as an investment and a million write off of an investment in a privately held enterprise 
interest  investment  and other income in would have increased approximately million absent the net gain on the sales of common stock and the losses experienced in such increase is attributable to increased levels of cash invested and a slight increase in interest earned on the company s investments from small increases in prevailing interest rates 
income tax provision change change income tax provision percentage of total revenue effective tax rate the company s effective tax rate in decreased significantly over the effective tax rate of  due primarily to smaller one time  nondeductible merger transaction and restructuring costs and increased tax exempt income 
the company s effective tax rate in increased significantly over the effective tax rate of  due primarily to one time  nondeductible merger transaction and restructuring costs 
an analysis of the differences between the statutory and effective income tax rates is provided in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
net income and net income per share change change net income percentage of total revenue net income per share weighted shares in thousands    net income for represents a percent increase over  while net income decreased percent from that of results of operations in each of the three years included several one time charges that would not normally be included in the company s operating results 
a reconciliation of the reported results of operations to the results of operations excluding these one time charges for each of the years follows 
income before income net income tax net income taxes provision income per share in thousands  except per share amounts reported results of operations    write off of acquired in process research and development ceneca communications  inc   acquisition of frame merger transaction costs   restructuring costs    other one time charges    effect of fourth quarter antidilutive common stock equivalents results of operations excluding one time charges    income before income net income tax net income taxes provision income per share in thousands  except per share amounts reported results of operations    write off of acquired in process research and development compumation  incorporated   lasertools corporation   acquisition of aldus merger transaction costs   restructuring costs    other one time expenses resulting from the acquisition    results of operations excluding one time charges    income before income net income tax net income taxes provision income per share in thousands  except per share amounts reported results of operations    write off of acquired in process research and development ah software  inc and the company of science art   restructuring of frame s operations    results of operations excluding one time charges    furthermore  the future effective tax rate is expected to be approximately percent 
had this rate been in effect in   and  the net income per share  excluding the above one time charges  would have been   and per share  respectively 
factors that may affect future results of operations the company believes that in the future its results of operations could be affected by various factors such as the ability of the company to integrate adobe  aldus  and frame product lines  renegotiation of royalty arrangements  delays in shipment of the company s new products and major new versions of existing products  market acceptance of new products and upgrades  growth in worldwide personal computer and printer sales and sales price adjustments  consolidation in the oem printer business  and adverse changes in general economic conditions in any of the countries in which the company does business 
in connection with the merger with frame  the company has sought to reduce combined expenses by the elimination of duplicate or unnecessary facilities  employees  marketing programs  and other expenses 
the company believes that the major impact of such reductions will occur in the first and second quarters of but expects some additional impact in later quarters of the company expects that these reductions will benefit future operating results  but the reductions could adversely impact the earnings of the combined company 
in addition  the integration of the product lines of the two companies could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations  including the potential for charges for certain discontinued business components 
as previously stated  effective january   the company no longer markets freehand and discontinued marketing of photostyler in late these two products aggregated million of revenue and million of gross profit in there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to replace this lost revenue or that it will be able to do so as profitably 
the company s oem customers on occasion seek to renegotiate their royalty arrangements 
the company evaluates these requests on a case by case basis 
if an agreement is not reached  a customer may decide to pursue other options  including licensing a postscript language compatible interpreter from a third party  which could result in lower licensing revenue for the company 
the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating income from its subsidiaries located in europe and the pacific rim 
while most of the revenue of these subsidiaries is denominated in us dollars  the majority of their expense transactions are denominated in foreign currencies  including the japanese yen and most major european currencies 
as a result  the company s operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
to date the impact of such fluctuations has been insignificant and the company has not engaged in any significant activities to hedge its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the company s ability to develop and market products  including upgrades of currently shipping products  that successfully adapt to current market needs may also have an impact on the results of operations 
a portion of the company s future revenue will come from these products 
delays in product introductions could have an adverse effect on the company s revenue  earnings  or stock price 
the company cannot determine the ultimate effect that these new products or upgrades will have on its sales or results of operations 
although the company generally offers its application products on macintosh  windows  and unix platforms  a majority of the overall sales of these products to date has been for the macintosh platform  particularly for the higher end macintosh computers 
to the extent that there is a slowdown of customer purchases in the higher end macintosh market or if other operating systems  such as windows  become more prevalent among the company s customers  the company s operating results could be materially adversely affected 
during  the company entered the internet market  which has only recently begun to develop 
the internet market is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an increasing number of market entrants who have introduced or developed products addressing authoring and communication over the internet 
as is typical in the case of a new and evolving industry  demand and market acceptance for recently introduced products and services are subject to a high level of uncertainty 
the software industry addressing the authoring and electronic publishing requirements of the internet is young and has few proven products 
moreover  critical issues concerning the commercial use of the internet including security  reliability  cost  ease of use and access  and quality of service remain unresolved and may impact the growth of internet use  together with the software standards and electronic media employed in such markets 
due to the factors noted above  the company s future earnings and stock price may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
any shortfall in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock in any given period 
additionally  the company may not learn of such shortfalls until late in the fiscal quarter  which could result in an even more immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock 
finally  the company participates in a highly dynamic industry 
in addition to factors specific to the company  changes in analysts earnings estimates for the company or its industry and factors affecting the coprorate environment or the securities markets in general will often result in significant volatility of the company s common stock price 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and requires long lived assets to be evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company will adopt sfas no 
in fiscal and does not expect its provisions to have a material effect on the company s consolidated results of operations in the year of adoption 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and will require that the company either recognize in its consolidated financial statements costs related to its employee stock based compensation plans  such as stock option and stock purchase plans  using a prescribed methodology  or make pro forma disclosure of such costs in a footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
the company expects to continue to use the intrinsic value based method of accounting principles board opinion no 
 as allowed under sfas no 
 to account for all of its employee stock based compensation plans 
therefore  in its consolidated financial statements for fiscal  the company will make the required pro forma disclosures in a footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
financial condition cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments change change cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments the company s cash balances and short term investments have increased each year due to profitable operations  partially offset by expenditures for capital outlays and other investments 
in and  growth in cash balances and short term investments was reduced by increased merger and acquisition activity 
cash equivalents consist of highly liquid money market instruments

in addition  in the company paid approximately million to acquire ceneca communications  inc  to buy out its future royalty obligation with respect to its adobe photoshop product  and to invest in various companies  either directly or through a limited partnership arrangement 
in the future  additional cash may be used to acquire software products or technologies complementary to the company s business 
net cash provided by financing activities during was million  primarily resulting from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans  partially offset by repurchases of common stock and payment of dividends 
the company s principal commitments as of december  consisted of obligations under operating leases  a real estate development agreement  and various service and lease guarantee agreements with a related party 
the company has entered into a real estate development agreement for the construction of an office facility and in will enter into an operating lease agreement for this facility 
the company will have the option to purchase the facility at the end of the lease term 
in the event the company chooses not to exercise this option  the company is obligated to arrange for the sale of the facility to an unrelated party and is required to pay the lessor any difference between the net sales proceeds and the lessor s net investment in the facility  in an amount not to exceed that which would preclude classification of the lease as an operating lease  approximately million 
the company also is required  periodically during the construction period  to deposit funds with the lessor to secure the performance of its obligations under the lease 
during  the company increased its deposits by approximately million  and as of december   the company s deposits under this agreement totaled approximately million in united states government treasury notes and money market mutual funds 
these deposits are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
the company has also entered into various agreements with mcqueen holdings limited mcqueen  a european operating entity  whereby the company has agreed to guarantee obligations under operating leases for certain european facilities utilized by mcqueen  and to guarantee certain levels of business between adobe and mcqueen 
the company currently owns percent of the outstanding stock in mcqueen 
the company s ownership percentage has increased over that of because mcqueen repurchased some of its previously outstanding shares 
the company believes that existing cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  together with cash generated from operations  will provide sufficient funds for the company to meet its operating cash requirements in the foreseeable future
