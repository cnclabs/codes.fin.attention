the need to stage the acquisition and use of raw materials such as land and finished lots and the need  on certain projects  to construct community facilities ahead of the start of home construction requires homebuilders such as the company to commit working capital for longer periods than many traditional manufacturing companies 
when building inventory  the company uses substantial amounts of cash that are generally obtained from borrowings  available cash flow from operations and partners contributions to joint ventures

interest rates and inflation the long term impact of inflation on the company is manifested in increased land  land development  construction and overhead costs balanced by potential increased sales prices 
the company generally contracts for land significantly before development and sales efforts begin and  accordingly  to the extent land acquisition costs are fixed  increases or decreases in the sales prices of homes may affect the company s profits 
since the sales prices of homes are fixed at the time of sale and the company generally sells its homes prior to commencement of construction  any inflation of costs in excess of those anticipated may result in lower gross margins 
the company generally attempts to minimize that effect by entering into fixed price contracts with its subcontractors and material suppliers for specified periods of time  which generally do not exceed one year 
housing demand  in general  is adversely affected by increases in interest costs  as well as materials and other costs 
interest rates  the length of time that land remains in inventory and the proportion of inventory that is financed affect the company s interest costs 
if the company is unable to duplicate its past ability to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs  or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly  affecting prospective buyers ability to adequately finance a home purchase  the company s revenues  gross margins and net income would be adversely affected 
increases in sales prices  whether the result of inflation or demand  may affect the ability of prospective buyers to afford a new home
