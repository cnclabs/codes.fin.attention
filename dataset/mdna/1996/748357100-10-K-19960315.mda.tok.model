item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations compared with revenues during  the company s revenues were million  up over the company s business base is made up of the government contract segment and the commmercial packaging segment 
the government contract segment consists of questech research division qtrd and questech service company qtsc  the packaging segment consists of questech packaging  inc qtpi 
the growth during was due to a increase in revenues at qtrd  which sustained the same growth rate during each of the last two years  despite continued business contraction at qtsc 
qtpi posted sales during late december   as a result of an initial shipment to its customer under a supply contract 
government contracts in the aggregate  revenues from department of the army contracts account for a significant portion of the company s revenue base 
specifically  one such contract accounted for over of the company s revenues during each of the last three years 
during  however  most of the growth arose primarily from increased efforts on air force contracts 
qtrd continued to contribute towards consolidated revenues 
during  it successfully recompeted a major department of the army contract  which has an award value of million over a performance period of five years 
however  qtrd did not commence performance under the new award  pending a resolution of a bid protest filed by a competitor 
the gao inspector general subsequently ruled in favor of the company  resulting in the issuance of delivery orders during thus  the new contract did not impact revenues 
commercial packaging qtpi manufactures thermoformed infant bottle liners  which are marketed under the step munchkin brand 
in december  qtpi made an initial shipment to munchkin  inc based on a small production lot 
at year end  manufacturing facilities were first placed in service and were operating significantly below capacity 
increased sales are principally dependent on the ability of qtpi to increase its production during operating expenses the company s operating expenses during rose to million  up over salaries  wages and employee benefits remained constant as a percentage of sales  primarily as a result of heightened direct labor activity on government contracts 
the increase in other operating expenses also included the cost of subcontract teaming efforts and travel related to performance on government contracts  and start up production and engineering costs at qtpi 
excluding corporate expense allocations  the cost of maintaining qtpi s operations was approximately million  up from approximately  during most of the cost increase was related to technical management and engineering support not associated with equipment fabrication  prior to the manufacturing equipment being placed in service 
income from operations income from operations for was approximately million  up over  as a result of favorable margins and increased billable hours on government contracts 
favorable margins from the government contracts business segment allowed the company to support the start up operations of qtpi  and achieve modest growth in operating income 
interest expense interest expense increased over  primarily because of increased borrowings under the line of credit 
the line of credit interest expense was partially mitigated by reduced interest cost associated with curtailments of other long term borrowings 
charges arising from settlements of litigation during  other expense was  down from  during  resulting from cost savings made possible by the conclusion of significant litigation activities  including a re structuring of its case planning and strategy 
based on its assessment of the expected outcome of outstanding litigation  management believes that it has provided adequate allowances in the financial statements 
taxes during  the company s effective tax rate was of pre tax income  compared to during for tax purposes  the company benefited from an increase in certain non taxable income 
net earnings for  primary and fully diluted earnings per share were 
and 
on earnings of  these amounts reflected a and increase over per share earnings of 
primary and fully diluted  respectively during the increase in per share amounts was less than the net earnings growth due to the dilutive impact of common stock equivalents 
liquidity and sources of capital liquidity and cash flows the following table compares selected financial data that measure the company s liquidity and capital resources at december   and in thousands of dollars  except for ratios working capital    current assets    current liabilities    availability under line of credit    working capital ratio current assets over current liabilities 
during  the principal use of cash flow was to fund capital expenditures of million

the remaining amount was expended towards the following leasehold improvements at the headquarters office as a result of the renegotiated lease and qtrd field offices  purchases upgrades of office equipment  primarily computers  and the development of a new management information system 
the company also paid its current landlord  to re negotiate the headquarters lease and permit reduced occupancy expenses for the duration of the lease 
the use of cash for financing activities included a cash advance to a former founder as initial payment towards the cost of acquiring his shares 
at the end of  the company acquired inventories which consisted of rolls of plastic sheets and unpackaged liners at qtpi 
management expects to shorten the lead time between production and shipment  thereby minimizing work in process 
however  inventories in the aggregate can be expected to increase in due to anticipated growth in levels of production 
cash to defray these transactions was principally provided by income from operations 
during  the principal use of cash flow was to fund financing activities  including cash advance to the stock employee compensation trust sect for acquisition of stock from former founders  and repayments made under the line of credit 
cash applied toward capital expenditures was during  cash flows were applied towards capital expenditures in the amount of  and financing transactions  consisting of line of credit curtailments and payments under various agreements with former founders 
capital expenditures in excess of million are planned for a significant portion of this amount is allocated towards expanding qtpi s production equipment and facilities 
the remaining amount is intended for the following new furniture and office equipment slated for newly opened sites to support government contract requirements  and the installation of a wide area network 
management is evaluating its options for financing certain of its manufacturing equipment expected to be placed in service during long term capital requirements at december   the company had long term obligations amounting to million  which consisted of the following installment payments on several capital leases for office equipment  expiring in and  sums owed to former founders as a result of a confidential settlement agreement  sums owed to certain related parties in connection with their employment agreements  the major portion of which remains non executory until the subject employees retirement or termination 
in addition to the accrued postretirement benefit cost of million  the company has an unrecognized transition obligation of million in connection with its postretirement benefit plans 
the obligation was deferred upon the company s adoption of sfas during future impact of known trends  demands  commitments  events or uncertainties defense industry the current business environment for the defense contracting industry continues to be characterized by a general atmosphere of uncertainty 
this uncertainty is the result of several factors including defense budget cuts  base closures and consolidations  and increased competitive pressures 
these factors will continue to shape the defense contracting industry over the next several years 
however  given the emergence of unforeseen threats  there is the possibility these trends may be curtailed or reversed 
in addition  several segments within the industry  such as the area of information warfare  will provide growth opportunities for contractors 
management anticipates that there will be little impact on the company s existing contracts during due to base closures 
vint hill farms station  the site of qtrd s major army support contract  is one of the bases scheduled to be closed by the dod in late however  management believes the mission being supported at vint hill high technology engineering services will be relocated to another base  and will not go away 
the company will provide support to this mission under its newly awarded contract 
the company recently won a large army high technology engineering services contract 
consequently  it is anticipated that army work will continue to remain a significant percentage of the company s overall business over the next several years 
as the result of the decreased defense appropriations  competition among contractors has increased considerably 
large contractors who typically targeted only large programs now pursue programs of any size 
therefore  bigger contractors have become the company s direct competitors 
further  competitive pressures have caused many firms to merge with other companies 
the competitors who remain often gain increased expertise and experience through the mergers  resulting in formidable competition for the company 
management believes the company is positioned well to withstand the rigors of the current environment through a superior technical track record and competitive pricing

during  the company had reserves which were adequate and did not set aside any reserves for contract cost disallowances 
the company had reserved approximately  for cost disallowances during based on existing circumstances and internal controls  management believes that its current reserves for potential cost disallowances are adequate 
income from operations income from operations for was million  compared to million in the increase  compared to a increase between and  was made possible through the following a favorable margins on existing contracts due to the optimal realignment of project resources and advantageous rates  b management s continued cost containment efforts and controls  which have been in place since  c re engineering of operations  with a focus on consolidation  or maximization of use  of existing corporate resources
