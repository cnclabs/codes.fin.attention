these estimates related to maintenance expenses  usair service fee expenses and property tax recoveries 
after expenses based on third quarter estimates were finalized in the fourth quarter  third quarter maintenance expenses were understated by  and usair service fees were understated by  in addition  after final negotiations with taxing authorities were concluded in the fourth quarter  the savings realized from property tax reevaluations originally anticipated in the third quarter were reduced by  fiscal the operating results for fiscal continued the positive trend from fiscal passenger revenues increased  attributable to the improved yield per revenue passenger mile of cent in fiscal from cent in fiscal the result of these overall improvements is a current year operating income of  and a net income of  versus operating income of  and a net loss of  in fiscal operating expense increases of partially offset the revenue improvement 
annual revenues for the and fiscal years were  and  respectively 
the increase over the prior year was due to the absence of low fare competitors in the company s markets and to continued industrywide fare growth 
additionally  in february  the company implemented local market fares for travel between company controlled destinations  thus stimulating travel and increasing revenues 
revenues were significantly hampered  however  by inclement weather in the company s operating area during the third quarter of severe winter storms caused the cancellation of approximately  flights during this quarter 
as a result  the company estimates that operating revenues were adversely impacted by approximately  harsh weather in the northeast section of the united states caused further revenue losses as connecting passengers with reservations on the company s flights were unable to initiate their trips 
the company experienced yield erosion in the months of may and june  the yield declined from cent in april to cent in may and cent in june 
while some slippage in yield is normal  the presence of low cost low fare competitors in the company s service area exacerbated the negative effects 
while these pressures have subsided in the first quarter of fiscal  yield fluctuations can be volatile and as such cannot be predicted 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued results of operations  continued fiscal  continued available seat miles increased over fiscal the growth is primarily due to increased daily service to longer haul markets  including columbus  georgia  lexington  kentucky and lynchburg  virginia  increasing total weekday departures to from in fiscal the company  while able to implement changes in its flight schedule after receiving the consent of usair  has limited control over the cities it serves as a usair express carrier 
the company is not aware of schedule changes being contemplated that would have a significant impact on operations 
while the number of revenue passengers carried decreased by  revenue passenger miles increased as compared to fiscal as a result of changes to the company s service schedule 
because the low fare competition of continental lite in was not present in to depress fares  the company was able to maintain higher average ticket prices of in fiscal versus in fiscal  thus increasing yield per revenue passenger mile to cent  an increase of over operating costs per available seat mile increased from cent to cent for fiscal to contributing factors include increases in fuel costs  pilot training expenses  usair fees and engine overhaul expenses 
a portion of these increases were offset by cost reductions recognized in the company s aircraft hull insurance  professional fees and property tax expenses 
flight operations expense increased to  in  compared to  in fiscal in fiscal reductions in aircraft lease rates were achieved through negotiations with lessors  which the company continued receiving the benefit of in fiscal additionally  more favorable hull insurance rates and reductions in the insured value of the company s aircraft yielded a decrease in hull insurance expense of or  as compared to several factors impacted the pilot salaries  resulting in escalations from  in fiscal to  in  a increase 
pilot turnover in the fourth quarter was exceptionally high due to recruiting and hiring by the major airlines 
because the internal pilot reserve was depleted  the company incurred significant training costs in order to maintain necessary crew levels 
additionally  during the period of crew shortages  flight lines were being covered by existing pilot crews at the higher pay rates due to overtime 
the effect of these factors in the fourth quarter of as compared to the same period of is an increase in salaries and training costs of  or 
furthermore  the final two increases under the pilot salary reduction plan were phased in during october  and february  under the plan negotiated with the air line pilots association alpa  pilot salaries were initially reduced by in october   with of the original concession being reinstated after each subsequent four month period 
flight attendant salaries increased or  over the previous fiscal year due to scheduled service increases 
crew travel expenses  encompassing meal allowances and accommodations  remained relatively unchanged at  and  from fiscal year end to  respectively 
in april  four new crew bases were established in lynchburg  virginia  cincinnati  ohio  lexington  kentucky and kinston  north carolina  placing a total of crews at these locations 
while crew bases are designed to reduce crew travel expenses  the savings were not evident for the fiscal year ended june  because of expenses associated with moving the crews 
the company estimates that it will recognize a savings of approximately  in fiscal related to the establishment of additional crew bases 
fuel and oil expenses are sensitive to market fluctuations in price and asms flown 
as previously discussed  asms grew by only over the prior year 
however  the escalation of market prices of fuel significantly affected the current year s fuel expense 
fuel expenditures totaled  in fiscal  representing an increase of to  in  when the average price per gallon of fuel increased from cent to cent 
total fuel consumption was million gallons versus million gallons in fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase between years was directly related to the increased service schedule 
fuel expense for includes the cent per gallon federal excise tax on transportation fuels which the company became obligated to pay on october  as fuel expense is only of total operating expenses  the company does not believe it is cost effective to attempt to manage fuel price risk  thus no derivatives or other off balance sheet instruments are used for hedging purposes 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued results of operations  continued fiscal  continued maintenance materials  repairs and overhead experienced an increase over the previous year  from  to  in fiscal the escalation was due exclusively to the increase in annual amortization of engine and gear overhauls from  in to  in from march  through the end of fiscal  expenditures related to overhauls of dash airframe and engine components were  with amortization lives ranging from to months 
amortization of these overhaul additions was the principal factor in the increase in overhaul expense for the fiscal year ended ground operations expense increased over  as expenses went from  to  the principal factor in the higher expenses is the increase in usair handling fees that the company pays as a result of usair handling the company s passengers in certain markets 
these handling fees have increased as follows march  per passenger  march  per passenger  july  per passenger and january  per passenger 
the increase in handling fees has been mitigated by the schedule changes which enable the company to handle more of its own traffic and the company s reimbursement rate for operating concourse d which increased to  in january  the company cannot predict the timing or extent of any future passenger handling fee adjustments 
inclement weather in the winter months caused an additional  in aircraft servicing charges in fiscal as compared to  as deicing fluid purchases drastically increased 
advertising  promotion and commissions expense decreased from of passenger revenue in fiscal to of passenger revenue in the reason for this decrease was the revised rate structure for commissions paid to travel agencies  which went into effect during march  commissions paid on travel agency generated tickets decreased from an average of in to in as approximately of tickets collected by the company are written by travel agencies  the savings from this structure change was approximately  partially offsetting this reduction was an increase in reservations fees charged by usair 
on january   the reservations fee charged changed to a new fee structure resulting in an additional  in expense 
per passenger during the last two quarters of the fiscal year over fees which would have been paid under the old structure 
the company cannot predict the timing or extent of any future reservations fee adjustments 
total general and administrative expenses decreased or  from to contributing to this decrease were reductions in professional fees incurred and property tax assessment adjustments 
professional fees were lower due to the absence of extensive lease and union negotiations that were present during prior years 
property tax assessments have been reduced as of the tax year beginning january   going forward through the revaluation of the aircraft fleet to market value as of the date of filing january  in the company s most significant ad valorem taxing district  north carolina 
this revaluation and other property tax adjustments resulted in savings in calendar of  the company intends to refile personal property returns for the years available under local statutes  and anticipates refunds of  related to property reclassifications 
such refunds will be recorded as a reduction of general and administrative expense in the period in which they are received 
depreciation and amortization decreased slightly from  in fiscal to  in  as asset additions for rotable flight equipment  ground equipment and leasehold improvements were minimal in the current year  and thus little depreciation was generated on current year property additions 
in fiscal  recognition of net operating loss carryforwards offset income tax expense at the statutory rate  but the company s effective federal income tax rate was  which reflects the impact of the alternative minimum tax on operations 
income tax expense was thus  versus in at june  the company had approximately  of united states federal regular tax operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income 
these carryforwards begin expiring on june  the estimates of future results included above are based upon present information regarding operations and future trends 
while the company believes that the estimates constitute its best judgment on future results  the actual results may differ materially from the estimates 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued results of operations  continued fiscal the operating results for fiscal reflect significant improvement over fiscal year the cost reduction plan initiated by the company was the principal reason for the improvement 
this plan reduced operating costs by  even though capacity  as measured by available seat miles  increased 
the operating expense reductions  while encompassing all functional areas within the company  were focused on the following areas aircraft leases  pilot pay and passenger handling 
operating results also benefitted from the improved yield per revenue passenger mile  which increased from cent in fiscal to cent in fiscal the result of these improvements was operating income of  and a net loss of  as compared to an operating loss of  and net loss of  in fiscal revenues for the years ended june  and were  and  respectively 
the increase in yield in fiscal was the result of industrywide fare increases implemented in the third quarter of fiscal and the elimination of the low fare division of continental  continental lite  in the same period 
continental lite was a direct competitor of usair and the company in its service area  and usair reduced fares  including the joint fares shared with the company  to avoid losing market share and to stimulate traffic in the winter of the continental lite pricing and service strategy was eliminated by continental airlines in the third quarter of fiscal  which allowed usair to alter its pricing strategy and thus resulted in increased yields for the company based upon higher joint fares 
the number of available seat miles asms increased in fiscal over fiscal  primarily as a result of changes in the company s service schedule 
in conjunction with usair s strategy of eliminating jet service to short haul markets and turning this flying over to usair express commuter operators  the company initiated all turbo prop service to augusta  georgia in february  and jacksonville  north carolina and lynchburg  virginia in may also during  the company ceased service to several cities it had previously served on a shared basis with usair from charlotte  north carolina 
these cities were wilmington  north carolina  asheville  north carolina  tri cities  tennessee  columbia  south carolina  huntsville  alabama and knoxville  tennessee 
the net effect of this schedule change was an increase in asms  as fourth quarter capacity increased by over the third quarter and over the same quarter in fiscal the number of revenue passengers carried decreased by and revenue passenger miles rpms decreased by in fiscal as compared to fiscal the primary reason for the reduced passengers and rpms is the elimination of the low fare  traffic stimulation environment which existed in the company s service area until the cessation of continental lite as previously addressed 
operating costs per available seat mile in fiscal declined from cent to cent  as compared to the previous fiscal year 
the increases in fuel  maintenance  advertising  general and administrative and depreciation were more than offset by decreases in flight operations and ground operations 
flight operations expense decreased by in fiscal to  compared to  in fiscal the principal reason for this reduction was a decrease in aircraft lease expense 
see discussion below under liquidity and capital resources 
in addition  pilots salaries and related costs decreased in fiscal as a result of the implementation of a salary reduction plan negotiated with the air line pilots association alpa 
the reduced pay levels began in october and will be phased back in over sixteen months 
the plan entailed an initial pay reduction in october after each subsequent four month period  an additional of the initial reduction was reinstated until february  at which time the salaries reverted to the levels prior to october  the company has previously estimated that the alpa agreement would result in savings of approximately  from october  through january  at present staffing levels  of which  would be realized in fiscal the actual savings were  which differed from the projection due to the increased block hours flown due to the service schedule increase in the fiscal fourth quarter 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued results of operations  continued fiscal  continued crew travel expenses were reduced by  or  in fiscal as a crew base was established in augusta  georgia  to decrease crew per diem and lodging expenses 
a jacksonville  north carolina crew base was established in august  efficient utilization of pilots allowed the company to operate the increased capacity without adding new pilots  thus pilot training costs consisted only of recurrent training 
this efficiency enabled the company to reduce crew training costs by  or 
flight attendant salaries and related costs increased  or  due to scheduled service increases  and hull insurance expense increased  or  due to rate increases 
fuel and oil expense increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the average cost per gallon of fuel into plane decreased to cent in from cent in  reflecting the continued savings to the company from the purchase of fuel through a usair subsidiary 
total fuel consumption was million gallons in fiscal versus million gallons in fiscal the increase from year to year was a direct result of increased levels of operations 
maintenance materials  repairs and overhead increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the higher costs were attributable to an increase in the number of flight hours flown  however  the cost of maintenance repairs and materials per asm in fiscal was cent compared to cent per asm in fiscal ground operations expense decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal in july of  usair increased handling fees that the company pays for its passengers 
at this time the company was paying per passenger handled by usair 
in march of  the company assumed responsibility for ground operations at concourse d at the charlotte douglas international airport in conjunction with the implementation of cost cutting measures by usair 
the company assumed the responsibility for the salaries and benefits of the concourse d employees  and in return received  per month from usair and a reduction in passenger handling fees to per passenger 
in january of  the company s reimbursement rate for operating concourse d increased to  per month 
in march   the per passenger handling fee charged by usair increased to and increased to in july  the company cannot predict the timing or extent of future passenger handling fee adjustments 
the reduction in ground operations expenses  while primarily due to the concourse d realignment  was also due to operational efficiencies experienced at other stations operated by the company 
advertising  promotion and commissions expense increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  a increase 
this increase is directly related to the passenger revenue increase  as these expenses as a percentage of passenger revenue remained constant  of revenue in fiscal and of revenue in fiscal general and administrative expense increased to  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to passenger liability and property insurance increases of  or 
passenger liability rate increases more than offset the reduction in passengers and the resultant decrease in rpms 
depreciation and amortization increased from  in fiscal to  in  primarily as a result of increased depreciation on rotable flight equipment reclassified from inventory in fiscal fiscal the financial results for fiscal reflected the difficult environment facing the company 
the company was able to limit the increase in operating expenses to  but operating revenue decreased by 
the decrease in operating revenue was directly related to lower ticket prices caused by increased fare competition and cancellation of flights due to weather in the third quarter 
the result was an operating loss of  and a net loss of  these results compare to an operating loss of  and net loss of  in fiscal item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued results of operations  continued fiscal  continued for fiscal as in fiscal  the depressed yield per revenue passenger mile led to net operating losses 
the yield per revenue passenger showed a steady increase to cent in the three month period ended march   but at the end of that period  the yield decreased due to usair s fare reductions as part of its strategy to avoid losing market share 
the number of revenue passengers carried decreased by in fiscal as compared to fiscal  however  the number of revenue passenger miles increased by over the same periods 
in fiscal  the company s passengers on average took longer flights as evidenced by the increase in the length of average passenger trip over fiscal the number of revenue passengers carried was affected by a reduction in opportunities to connect traffic over the charlotte hub and weather related cancellations in january and february of the number of available seat miles increased in fiscal over fiscal  as a result primarily of changes in the company s service schedule 
in the first three month period  asms were in excess of million  but that level was not obtained in the remaining three quarters of fiscal during the last three quarters of fiscal  the company reduced and terminated service to columbus  georgia and panama city  florida  that represented two of the longer stage lengths in the company s system 
for fiscal year  the company did not have full deployment of its fleet due to capital improvements and overhauls 
operating costs per asm in fiscal declined slightly from cent to cent  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increases in the expense categories of flight operations  ground operations and general and administrative expenses were offset to a degree by decreases in the categories of fuel  maintenance and advertising  promotion and commissions 
flight operations expense had an increase of approximately  due to the addition of fifteen pilots for anticipated new flying 
those pilots were furloughed in the three month period ended june  per passenger fees charged by usair for passenger handling and reservations service increased on july   resulting in an aggregate cost increase of approximately  per month 
those per passenger fees were reduced on march  resulting in an aggregate cost reduction based on the number of revenue passengers in that period of approximately  per month 
other efficiencies created by the company taking over the handling of concourse d in charlotte also contributed to the cost reductions 
a increase in insurance expense affected both flight operations and general and administrative expenses 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash needs result from continuing operations including capital expenditures necessary to the operation of its aircraft  and the payment of creditors in accordance with the schedule set forth in its plan of reorganization as modified by subsequent agreements 
during fiscal the company satisfied its cash requirements through internally generated funds and borrowings under a revolving line of credit agreement with an affiliate of an aircraft manufacturer  secured by all of the company s accounts receivable 
the company also utilized short term loans from certain directors and officers secured by owned flight equipment  and through the deferral of certain scheduled lease payments pursuant to note agreements to satisfy its cash needs 
in september  the company and jet acceptance corporation jaco restructured the entire remaining amount due to jaco under the bankruptcy plan  including the august  installment of  the amount due was approximately  net of  discount at as of june  under this agreement  the company issued a promissory note to jaco in the principal amount of  payable in forty eight equal monthly installments of  consisting of principal and interest  beginning on january  additionally  the remaining balance due under the bankruptcy plan of  was satisfied in december  with the issuance of  shares of the company s common stock to jaco 
the stock must be held by jaco  with certain exceptions  for a minimum of one year from issue date before it can be transferred 
in conjunction with this agreement  the company agreed to accept delivery of four used jetstream aircraft prior to june  two jetstream aircraft were delivered in fiscal this agreement was modified in september   and any further commitment for future additional aircraft beyond the two already accepted was eliminated 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued liquidity and capital resources  continued restructuring in september   the company made the bankruptcy payment of  due to the unsecured creditors 
after the bankruptcy installments due in september   the company has payments to unsecured creditors of  due annually each august until the company intends to make these payments when due 
during fiscal the company had available a line of credit the line in an amount not to exceed  from british aerospace asset management turboprops amt 
amt is an affiliate of jaco and british aerospace holdings  inc  the company that had previously collateralized the company s bank line through a loan purchase agreement 
the line of credit permits the company to borrow up to of a borrowing base  which consists of the company s transportation and nontransportation charges to airlines clearing house  inc ach or such greater amount as amt shall determine  but in no event more than  the line of credit is secured by all of the company s accounts receivable  bears interest at prime and terminates on december   but must extended by amt for successive one year periods until december  subsequent to june   amt committed to increase the maximum credit available to  other financing during fiscal  the company obtained several short term loans from certain directors and officers 
amounts borrowed under these loans ranged from  to  and earned interest at the rate of ten percent 
the aggregate maximum and average amounts outstanding under these loans were  and  respectively 
in connection with these loans  the company issued to the lending parties options or warrants to purchase  shares of the company s common stock 
capital expenditures capital expenditures consist of major component overhauls and fixed asset replacement 
capital expenditures in fiscal were  as compared to  in fiscal the increase is primarily due to increased expenditures for engine overhauls on the dash aircraft 
the company projects fiscal capital expenditures to be approximately  the components of the capital budget are  of engine overhauls   of airframe and landing gear overhauls on the company s aircraft and  for other capital items 
operating cash flow the company receives payments for airline tickets under interline agreements through the airlines clearing house one month in arrears 
historically  this payment in arrears has caused significant cash flow problems in the last half of each month 
the company has a line of credit with amt to provide a steady cash flow between ach settlements 
the company believes that the restructuring stated above and improved revenue environment will provide sufficient cash flows to provide for continuing operations  capital expenditures and scheduled debt and bankruptcy payments absent adverse changes in current market conditions 
if operating cash flows and the line of credit are insufficient to meet obligations  the company has these financing sources available issuance of stock  short term loans from officers and directors  extending terms with trade creditors and restructuring aircraft lease payments 
the company received with the june airlines clearing house ach payment on the scheduled settlement date of june  however  because the first business day subsequent to receipt of funds was july   the company maintained possession of the full settlement amount of  as of june  ordinarily  amt accesses the settlement on the first business day subsequent to the transfer utilizing amounts necessary to satisfy the line of credit balance  plus interest of  at june  and accrued aircraft lease payments due to jaco  returning the remaining cash funds to the company s account 
other short term liabilities not settled from the residual funds on july  included outstanding loans from company directors and officers in the amount of  because of the timing of the ach settlement  the company also delayed its june  employee payroll to july  also  accounts payable reflect an increase of  over june  from  to  as of june  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued liquidity and capital resources  continued operating cash flow  continued accounts receivable increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase is attributable to greater passenger revenue in june  versus june  resulting from increased passenger traffic plus an increase in subcontracted handling fees billed to usair 
related party receivables went from  in fiscal to in as the receivable amount of  recorded in june  related to the sale and leaseback of certain aircraft engines was received in july  this sale and leaseback transaction was with a partnership consisting of various members of the company s board of directors 
other noncurrent assets increased from  in fiscal to  in as prepayments for engine overhauls expected to be completed in a time period greater than the next twelve months increased by  over the respective balance sheet dates 
accounts payable increased to  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal due to the extension of terms with trade creditors and the timing of payments 
notes payable  including current maturities  decreased from  in fiscal to  in due to the issuance of stock to satisfy  in long term debt and scheduled debt payments
