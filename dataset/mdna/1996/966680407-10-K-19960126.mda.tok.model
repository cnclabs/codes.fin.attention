item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition results of operations comparison of to sales for the company for fiscal were million  an increase of million over fiscal sales increased in largely as a result of the company s acquisitions of a data networking and communications business in april  which contributed million to sales  and an aerospace business in march of in the aggregate  the acquired businesses and product lines accounted for million of sales  compared to million in  reflecting the implementation of the company s previously announced strategy of growth by selective acquisitions to complement the company s existing businesses and product lines 
management expects that the acquired businesses and product lines will contribute to sales in fiscal at least at the annual rate at which they contributed in fiscal the acquisitions offset decreases in government sales and termination claims 
in the first quarter of  million of sales were recognized related to the partial settlement of a termination claim against a defense electronics products customer 
an additional  final settlement of million was recognized in the second quarter of the company has been able to achieve increased sales of its aircraft fluid and pneumatic control devices over the past three years despite relatively low new aircraft build rates 
increased emphasis has been placed on expanding sales from overhaul repairs  retrofits  upgrades and spare components to end users such as airlines  cargo carriers  maintenance stations  military bases and government agencies 
new aircraft production now appears to be on the rise  which may further contribute to an improved business climate for these company products 
the company has also positioned itself for continued growth in the aerospace segment by expanding its product offerings through acquisitions and growth in related markets  including fire and overheat detection equipment and industrial markets 
during fiscal  the company also marketed its aircraft fluid control and other aerospace products to manufacturers of industrial  land based gas turbines  which are similar to jet engines 
the company intends to continue to do so 
a reduced united states defense budget has contributed to both the decline in sales to the us government and delays in the receipt of new contract bookings in the aerospace segment 
the outlook for future sales is difficult to predict given the uncertainties related to the defense budget and related reductions and terminations of us government defense contracts 
any negative effect on aerospace segment sales related to this uncertainty may be offset in the future by contracts for new  technologically advanced electronic defense systems  new commercial products  and sales of aerospace and electronic products into industrial markets 
thus  past company performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance 
gross margin for the company increased in fiscal to million  or of sales  from million  or of sales in fiscal gross margin for the communications segment was in fiscal gross margin for the aerospace segment increased to of sales from of sales in fiscal affecting the comparability of the years are three items which had a net positive impact of million on aerospace gross margin in  compared to million in the first item is recognition in of million of gross margin related to the company s insurance claim for earthquake damage brought about by the january  northridge  california earthquake 
the second item is recognition in of million of gross margin related to the company s defined benefit pension plan  while related gross margin in was million 
this actuarially determined pension income is the result of an expected return on plan assets which exceeded the interest cost on the projected benefit obligation 
the last item is a termination claim settlement which contributed million of gross margin in  compared to million in when the effects of these items are removed from both years  aerospace segment gross margin as a percentage of sales is in compared to in engineering expenses for the company as a percentage of sales increased to in from in this increase is due to the inclusion of six months of results of the communications segment in management expects engineering expenses as a percentage of sales to increase further in fiscal to reflect full year operating results of the communications segment 
engineering expenses as a percentage of sales in the aerospace segment increased to in  from in  due to up front costs related to its industrial business product lines 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the company as a percentage of sales increased to in from in in  the aerospace segment received a million earthquake recovery which was reflected as a reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses 
excluding the effects of the termination claim included in and revenues  as well as the earthquake recovery in  the aerospace segment s selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased to in from in the communications segment of the business spends more on salespeople and marketing programs  as a percentage of sales  than the aerospace segment 
consequently  the inclusion of six months of communications segment results has increased the overall percentage for the company 
management expects selling  general  and administrative expenses to increase further in fiscal to reflect full year operating results of the communications segment 
during the second quarter of  concurrent with the acquisition of wci  a charge to earnings was recorded related to acquired in process research and development 
the effect was to reduce net income for the second quarter and the year by million  or per share 
during the third quarter of  a charge to earnings was recorded to reflect restructuring actions at wci  along with expenses associated with combining a substantial portion of the company s beaverton  oregon operation into the wci operation in santa clara  california 
the effect was to reduce net income for the third quarter and year by million  or per share 
interest expense increased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal primarily as a result of higher interest rates and incremental debt from the purchase of wci 
comparison of to sales for fiscal increased to million from fiscal sales of million 
sales increased in in part as a result of the company s acquisition of a telecommunications business in july  two aircraft fluid control product lines in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and an aerospace business in march of the acquisitions offset decreases in government sales 
in the aggregate  the acquired businesses and product lines accounted for million of sales  compared to million in the aerospace business acquired in march contributed million to sales 
the increased sales in fiscal also included the recognition of million of sales during the first quarter of related to the partial settlement of a termination claim against a defense electronics products customer 
sales of defense electronics products were adversely affected during the first and second quarters of fiscal by the january northridge  california earthquake and by delays in the receipt of new contract bookings 
gross margin increased in fiscal to million  or of sales  from million  or of sales in fiscal the increase was due primarily to a product mix that included a higher portion of after market aircraft fluid control products 
also contributing to the increase in gross margin in was million of gross margin resulting from the partial termination claim settlement described above  under which the company recorded as revenue million  with an associated cost of sale of million 
the increase in gross margin was offset partially by lower margins in radio frequency survivability products resulting primarily from a higher mix of cost plus contracts in compared to and  to some degree  from the effects of the interruption of the business and damage caused by the january northridge  california earthquake 
as a percentage of sales  engineering  selling and general and administrative expenses increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase primarily was the result of additional expenses of the acquired aerospace business  and executive bonus payments made for compared to limited payments made for the increase was offset partially by income associated with the company s defined benefit pension plan 
general in fiscal   and  approximately   and  respectively  of the company s sales were directly or indirectly attributable to the united states government 
all of these sales  with the exception of a minor amount in  relate to the aerospace segment 
companies engaged in supplying military equipment to the united states government are subject to competition  changes in the continuing availability of congressional appropriations  changes in contract timing and scheduling  complexity of designs and the potential for obsolescence  and other changes which may result from world events 
a loss of government business  although not anticipated by the company  could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
in august  the company was awarded a million cost reimbursement contract from the united states army to develop three new versions of the company s previously developed battlefield electronic countermeasures system  capable of detonating incoming artillery and mortar rounds  designated the shortstop electronic protection system seps 
during  the company met performance requirements and developed three full scale seps development models 
the contract did not contribute a material amount of revenue to the company in  but successful development of the new seps versions slated for delivery starting late in fiscal could  subject to all of the risks and uncertainties that apply to military procurement generally  as discussed above  result in subsequent seps production contracts  which could then have a material effect on the company s sales 
there can be no assurance  however  whether or when any such contracts would be awarded 
the company is discussing with various foreign governments the potential sale and installation of a company designed radar system that detects tactical ballistic missiles and allows early warning for the civilian population and for deployment of weapons 
there are currently no firm commitments for the system at this date 
if the discussions result in an agreement  annual sales of defense electronics products could increase materially 
because of the uncertainties of the military procurement processes of foreign governments  the need for the foreign government to provide budget authority for the potential procurement  and all the uncertainties that apply to military procurement generally  as discussed above  there can be no assurance that an agreement will be reached or  if reached  what the contract price would be

interest on loans outstanding under the credit agreement are based  at the company s option  on libor or the agent bank s prime rate 
the annual interest rate based on libor may range between libor plus and libor plus  and the annual interest rate based on the prime rate may range between prime and prime plus 
the agreement includes financial covenants with respect to financial leverage  cash flow  and tangible net worth 
proceeds from the credit facility were used at closing to repay million of loans outstanding under a prior credit facility and will be used in the future to fund working capital and acquisitions 
the company s ratio of long term debt  including the current portion  to capitalization stockholders equity plus debt was at october   compared to at the end of while stockholders equity increased by million for the year  reflecting a million contribution from net income and million from net exercises of employee stock options and related tax benefits  debt increased by million 
this increase in debt resulted from the additional debt used to finance the acquisition of wci  which was partially offset by cash from operations 
cash flow provided by operations in fiscal was million  compared to million in fiscal the reduction in operating cash flow in compared to resulted from the buildup of recoverable income taxes not yet received in cash  which caused a million decrease  and a decrease in net income of million 
these reductions were substantially offset by increased cash flows from operating assets and liabilities and an increase in non cash expenses 
cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  which included million for the acquisition of wci and capital expenditures of million 
during fiscal  the company used cash of million to make acquisitions and had capital additions of million 
cash flow provided by financing activities was million in fiscal  primarily the result of the issuance of a convertible subordinated note to finance the acquisition of wci  while million of cash was used in fiscal  primarily to reduce debt 
the company expects to receive a net income tax refund of million  plus interest of approximately million  under an agreement reached with the internal revenue service closing the audit of the company s and income tax returns 
the refund is subject to approval by the congressional joint committee on taxation  which is not expected until the second quarter of fiscal included in accounts receivable at the end of fiscal are no significant claims related to certain united states government prime contracts and subcontracts compared to million at the end of fiscal an additional claim of million is included in other assets at the end of fiscal these claims have been recorded in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles to the extent of contract costs incurred 
these costs were incurred in connection with customer caused delays and disruptions  errors in technical data  a partial termination for convenience and other unanticipated causes 
these claims were filed for amounts aggregating million at october   compared to million at year end  substantially in excess of amounts recorded 
while the outcome of these claims presently cannot be determined  in the opinion of the company and its counsel the recorded amount is a reasonable estimate of the minimum amount expected to be collected 
these claims are subject to negotiation and audit by the us government  the prime contractor customer  or both  and are presently at various stages of negotiation  litigation or appeal 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company submitted a claim to its insurance carriers to recover the costs of repair and replacement of assets and for the costs of business interruption brought about by the january northridge  california earthquake 
a final settlement in the amount of million was reached in the third quarter of fiscal  and full payment has been received 
capital expenditures for fiscal were million  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in fiscal reflects various costs associated with the relocation of the company s headquarters office from leased space into an existing owned manufacturing facility  as well as upgrades to engineering equipment 
at october   there were approximately million of approved capital expenditures outstanding for the replacement and upgrade of existing plant and equipment at the company s various facilities 
funds for these and other capital expenditures are expected to be provided from operations 
capital expenditures are subject to limitations by covenants contained in the company s credit agreement 
it is anticipated that the amounts under the covenants will be sufficient to allow the company to continue to maintain and upgrade existing facilities 
the company intends to continue its previously announced strategy of growth by selective acquisitions that complement the company s core businesses  financed by cash from operations and from borrowings under its revolving credit facility and  where appropriate  by issuance of new debt or equity securities of the company 
the company intends to pursue its acquisition strategy with careful regard for profitability and the company s need for liquidity 
there can be no assurance  however  that any acquisitions will occur or that an acquisition that does occur will not adversely affect the company s net income or liquidity 
as a result primarily of the activities of its discontinued operations  the company is a potentially responsible party in a number of actions filed under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of cercla
