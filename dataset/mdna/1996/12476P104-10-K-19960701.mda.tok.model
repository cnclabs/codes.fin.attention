item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company  the notes thereto and other information presented elsewhere herein 
except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
such forward looking statements are accompanied by cautionary factors which could cause cai s actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statement 
the cautionary factors presented should not be construed as exhaustive 
liquidity and capital resources the wireless cable industry requires significant capital 
cai s plan for continued expansion requires substantial capital investment on a continuing basis and availability of sufficient financing is essential to that plan 
funds are required for the lease or acquisition of channel rights  the acquisition of wireless cable systems  the construction of system head end and transmission equipment  start up costs related to the commencement of operations and subscriber installation costs 
cai has financed its capital requirements since inception through a combination of the issuance of debt and equity securities  the incurrence of loans and the assumption of debt and other liabilities in connection with acquisitions 
cai has incurred operating losses since inception and its cash flow from operating activities has to date been insufficient to cover its operating expenses 
cai estimates that the launch of a new analog wireless cable system in a typical market assuming or more channels per market requires the expenditure of approximately million of start up costs  consisting of approximately million for system head end and transmission equipment and approximately million for the other pre operational and start up expenses  and incremental installation costs of approximately per subscriber for equipment and labor at subscriber locations 
the company has made the decision to convert some of its analog systems to digital  as it is doing with the norfolk virginia beach system  and to initially set up digital systems as with the boston  massachusetts market 
a digital wireless cable system will cost much more than analog  including higher incremental installation costs per subscriber when subscriber equipment becomes available 
the head end and transmission expenditures must be made before programming can be delivered to subscribers 
labor installation costs for a subscriber are incurred only after that subscriber signs up for services 
during the year ended march   cai expended approximately million to purchase equipment  million to fund operating activities  million to acquire the new york system  and million to acquire wireless channel rights 
during this period cai funded its cash requirements out of existing cash balances  an issuance of equity securities generating net proceeds of approximately million  debt proceeds of million  and the disposition of equipment generating net proceeds of approximately million 
at march   cai had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
since march   cai has raised an additional million of equity capital through the issuance of  shares of common stock 
on may   at the stage i closing cai received million from bell atlantic and nynex  the proceeds of which were used to retire million of short term notes issued in connection with the purchase of the new york system  provide a required million cash deposit under the acs merger agreement  and to pay million of cost associated with the short term debt issued for the acquisition of the new york system and for transaction expenses and working capital 
in june  cai received million from an affiliate of smith barney pursuant to a term note  the proceeds of which were used for working capital 
on september   the company received million from the senior notes offering  net of million in underwriting costs and interest  of which million was placed in escrow to cover three years of interest  plus million from the sale of  shares of senior preferred stock and the stage ii warrants to banx 
these funds were used in part to pay the cash portions of the following acquisitions acs million  ecnw million  the baltimore assets million and the pittsburgh assets million 
the non cash portion of the purchase prices was satisfied with cai common stock or debt  primarily notes 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources continued additionally  the company loaned acs million to pay off acs bank debt and another million to pay other costs incurred by acs relating to the acs acquisition and for other corporate purposes 
cai also used million to repay the interim financing it received from smith barney holdings  inc  including interest  and another million to pay legal and other fees relating to the merger  stage ii closing and the offering of the senior notes 
during the year ended march   cai expended approximately million to purchase equipment  million to fund operating activities and million to acquire wireless channel rights in addition to the mergers and acquisitions mentioned previously 
during fiscal  cai funded its cash requirements out of existing cash balances and the financings more fully described above 
at march   cai had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
pursuant to the terms of the participation agreement  cai and heartland agreed to contribute to cs wireless certain wireless cable assets  including related operating liabilities  or the stock of subsidiaries owning wireless cable assets for systems located principally in the midwestern and southwestern regions of the country 
the transaction closed on february  cai owns approximately of cs wireless  heartland approximately  and affiliates of bell atlantic and nynex own approximately 
the remaining equity interest was sold to purchasers in the unit offering 
the combination of these assets into cs wireless resulted in a company with approximately million los households and  subscribers  making it one of the largest wireless cable companies in the united states in terms of subscribers and los households 
through fiscal the company plans to spend million primarily for the purchase and installation of digital compatible head end transmission equipment in connection with a br agreement with banx the br agreement 
cai is committed through open purchase orders to expend approximately million primarily for capital expenditures associated with the development of the boston and norfolk virginia beach digital transmission facilities as of march  in addition  during that period  the company is obligated to pay minimum license fees and lease payments of approximately  million 
management believes that the company s growth plan will require additional funds during the fiscal year  especially if cai determines to effect additional acquisitions or to accelerate its anticipated growth rate or system launch rate  and or if banx fails to exercise its options with respect to markets as contemplated by the br agreement 
such additional funds may take the form of debt or equity securities issuances  borrowings under loan arrangements or sales of assets including channel rights or wireless cable systems 
cai s ability to engage in financings  asset sales or acquisition transactions is limited by the contractual arrangements entered into with banx  and significant transactions likely will require its prior consent 
in addition  the senior notes impose similar restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt and on the ability to effect asset sales 
there is no assurance that any additional financings will be available to the company on satisfactory terms and conditions  if at all 
in the event that such additional financings are not available to the company  management can and will defer capital expenditures and other costs currently contemplated  including the deployment of digital head end equipment which will affect the company s ability to implement its obligations under the br agreement 
the present revenue stream and cash resources available to the company are adequate to sustain the company s needs through mid if such actions were taken 
however  expansion plans would be adversely impacted 
there is no assurance that any additional financings will be available to the company on satisfactory terms and conditions  if at all 
comparison of operating results seven months ended march  compared to eight months ended august the company started operating the albany system effective september  from which the company generated all of its revenues  million 
the company had a net loss of million for the seven months ended item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations comparison of operating results continued march  the loss resulted primarily from a million non cash compensation charge associated with stock sales to employees  approximately million of corporate general and administrative expenses associated with developing a corporate administration and additional markets hartford  rochester and virginia beach  and million of interest expense 
costs and expenses for the seven month period ended march  totaled million versus million in the prior eight month period ended august  the costs and expenses included million of programming and license fees   of marketing  and million of depreciation and amortization expense

such revenue of million for the seven months ended march  was from the albany system only 
cai had a net loss of million for the year ended march  primarily due to operating costs and interest expense and expenses associated with the development of cai s hartford  rochester  hampton roads  and albany markets 
programming and license fees were million for the year ended march  compared to million for the seven month period ended march  these costs are primarily attributable to the albany system acquired in august and have increased with the growth of subscribers and the acquisition of the new york system 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations comparison of operating results continued cai s general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended march  from million for the seven month period ended march  the increased general and administrative expenses are due primarily to costs associated with increased staffing levels  facility expenses  supplies  utilities  equipment  and other costs associated with four new systems being started and larger corporate headquarters 
depreciation and amortization increased to million for the year ended march  from million for the seven month period ended march  depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended march  are comprised of approximately million of depreciation related to property and equipment  most of which was acquired in  and approximately million of amortization of primarily wireless channel rights compared to approximately million and million  respectively  for the seven month period ended march   during which time the company only operated the albany system 
interest income increased to million for the year ended march  compared to million for the seven month period ended march  the increase in interest income is attributable to the interest income earned on the proceeds received from cai s initial public offering that occurred in february other income increased to million for the year ended march  compared to no other income for the seven month period ended march  the increase in other income is primarily attributable to a gain on the sale of transmission equipment  made available after the may albany system equipment upgrade 
interest expense decreased to million for the year ended march  from million for the seven month period ended march  the interest expense is primarily associated with notes issued in the acquisition of the new york system in january the interest is primarily associated with bridge notes issued prior to cai s initial public offering 
interest expense related parties decreased to  for the year ended march  from million for the seven month period ended march  the related party interest expense is associated with a million outstanding note payable to a shareholder 
the related party interest expense is primarily due to shares of cai common stock issued in conjunction with a short term borrowing originating in august year ended march  compared to year ended march  cai s total revenue was million for the year ended march  as compared to million for the year ended march  primarily due to the acs acquisition on september  and a full year of operations for the new york system 
acs contributed million to the overall increase of million for its six months of operations included since the date of acquisition 
the new york system contributed million of the increased revenue 
the remaining increase of million is attributable to the growth of subscribers in the other systems 
cai s television subscription revenue was million for the year ended march  as compared to million for the year ended march  resulted from the following systems albany vs 
million  rochester vs 
million  new york city vs 
million  hampton roads vs 
million  philadelphia vs 
million  cleveland vs 
million  bakersfield vs 
million  washington vs 
million  hartford vdt vs 
million  and providence smatv vs 
million 
the systems with zero for the prior year were acquired in the current year 
the increase in the new york city television subscription revenue is due to a full year of operations for the year ended march  as compared to only three months of operations included in the year ended march  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations comparison of operating results continued the television subscription revenue for cleveland and bakersfield totaling million is for the period that these two systems were part of cai 
cleveland and bakersfield were acquired as part of the acs acquisition and subsequently contributed to cs wireless 
cs wireless was consolidated with cai until the cs closing february  
cs wireless revenue and expenses are not included in cai s consolidated financial statements after that date 
through december   cai will account for cs wireless on a three month lag that corresponds with cs wireless december fiscal year end 
cai s net loss of million for the year ended march  is higher than the net loss of million for the year ended march  by million due primarily to substantial increases in depreciation and amortization million and interest expense million offset by a deferred income tax benefit of million and increased interest income of million 
the operating loss increased to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march   a change of million  which approximated the depreciation and amortization increase of million 
the increase is primarily due to the depreciation and amortization associated with property and equipment  wireless channel rights  and goodwill acquired in connection with the acs and ecnw acquisitions and to a lesser extent on additional investment in property and equipment 
programming and license fees were up six times from million for the year ended march  to million for the year ended march  in line with television subscription revenue also up almost six times 
marketing expenses were up slightly from million for the year ended march  to million for the year ended march  reflecting less emphasis on marketing and more on acquisitions during the year 
general and administrative expenses went from million for the year ended march  to million for the year ended march   primarily due to the general and administrative expenses of then newly acquired acs and ecnw million and a full year of the new york system net increase of million 
general and administrative costs should stabilize due to the combination of acs and cai s administrative operations 
general and administrative expenses  other than those associated with new acquisitions and the new york system  increased million over the prior year primarily due to increased salaries  personnel and professional fees incurred to develop  acquire  integrate and manage new systems 
interest expense increased to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march   a change of million  primarily due to interest expense incurred on the senior notes issued on september  and the term notes issued on may  interest expense will continue to increase next year by approximately million to reflect the first full year of interest expense on the senior notes 
interest income was million for the year ended march  as compared to million for the year ended march  the increase is primarily due to income earned on the debt service escrow for the senior notes and on funds remaining from the issuance of the senior notes which are invested until used 
the operating loss of million for the year ended march  includes million for the cleveland and bakersfield systems which are now part of cs wireless 
while cai will no longer include those systems revenue and expenses in its statements of operations  cai will include its share of cs wireless s net loss to the extent of its ownership 
based on an unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for cs wireless for the year ended december  prepared as if the contributions contemplated by the participation agreement had occurred on january   cs wireless net loss would have been million  of which cai s share would approximate million 
cai will record its share of cs wireless loss with a corresponding reduction in its investment in cs wireless 
cai has not guaranteed any debt or commitments of cs wireless 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations inflation management does not believe that inflation has had or will have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
management believes it will be able to increase subscriber rates to keep pace with inflationary increases in costs without a significant decline in the number of subscribers 
seasonality of installation activities the rate at which new subscriber installations occur can be affected by severe winter or other weather conditions and limited daylight hours in the winter months in certain markets 
therefore  cai may experience lower than average subscriber growth and capital expenditures primarily during the winter season
