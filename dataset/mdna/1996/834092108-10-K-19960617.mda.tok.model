the main reasons for the percentage decrease in fiscal over fiscal were savings achieved from lower distribution costs  primarily in north america  which caused selling and marketing expenses to grow at a slower rate than net sales

the net interest expense for fiscal has also been adjusted for this repayment and for this change in interest rates  as well as for increased indebtedness arising from the acquisition 
foreign currency adjustments for fiscal and fiscal no translation adjustments were necessary as the brazilian real had strengthened slightly against the us dollar during this period

accounts payable which have increased in line with inventory growth is partly offset by a reduction in accrued and other liabilities  primarily being expenditures on the company s reorganization  provided for following the acquisition in fiscal the most significant cause of the decrease from fiscal to fiscal was the decrease in net income  after adding back non cash charges  caused by higher interest expense and one time cash charges associated with the ipo million  and other operating cash movements million 
during fiscal inventories as a percentage of net sales grew to from in the prior year  resulting from a increase in inventory levels

currency exchange rates as a result of the company s worldwide operations  currency exchange rate fluctuations tend to affect the company s results of operations and financial position 
the two principal effects of currency exchange rates on the company s results of operation and financial position are i translation adjustments for subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency and ii translation adjustments for subsidiaries in hyper inflationary countries 
translation adjustments for functional local currencies have historically been credited or debited  as appropriate  to the parent company investment account  following consummation of the acquisition  such adjustments have been made to shareholders equity 
for the fiscal years ended march  and  the four months ended march   and the eight months ended november   such translation adjustments were approximately million  million  million  and million  respectively 
during fiscal the company has benefited from reduced manufacturing costs at its mexican facility arising from the continued weakness of the mexican peso 
for translation adjustments of the company s subsidiaries operating in hyper inflationary countries  until recently primarily brazil  the functional currency is determined to be the us dollar  and therefore all translation adjustments are reflected in the company s statements of operations 
for the fiscal years ended march  and no translation adjustments were necessary as the brazilian real had strengthened slightly against the us dollar during these periods 
for the four months ended march  and the eight months ended november  such translation adjustments were  and  respectively 
in hyper inflationary environments  the company generally protects margins by methods which include increasing prices monthly at a rate appropriate to cover anticipated inflation  compounding interest charges on sales invoices daily and holding cash balances in us dollar denominated accounts where possible 
because a majority of the company s debt is us dollar denominated  the company may hedge against certain currency fluctuations by entering into currency swaps however certain currencies  such as the brazilian real  cannot be hedged  although no such swaps had been entered into as of march  as of march  certain of the company s foreign subsidiaries had entered into forward contracts for intercompany purchase commitments in amounts other than their home currency 
the carrying amount of the forward contracts approximates fair value  which has been estimated based on current exchange rates 
for further financial data of the company s performance by region  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
seasonality the company s business is somewhat seasonal  with third quarter results generally weaker than the other three quarters as a result of lower sales during the holiday season  and fourth quarter results generally the strongest 
inflation inflation continues to affect the cost of the goods and services used by the company 
the competitive environment in many markets limits the company s ability to recover higher costs through increased selling prices  and the company is subject to price erosion in many of its standard product lines 
the company seeks to mitigate the adverse effects of inflation through cost containment and productivity and manufacturing process improvements 
approximately of the company s net sales during fiscal were derived from its operations in south america  the majority of which are in brazil  which has experienced periods of hyper inflation 
in june  the brazilian government introduced a new currency  the real  and adopted certain financial plans to reduce inflation in that country 
from june through march   inflation has reduced to approximately per month  compared to a rate of approximately per month in june  for the full year 
since introduction of this plan  the brazilian real has strengthened slightly against the us dollar 
for a description of the effects of inflation on the company s reported revenues and profits and the measures taken by the company in response to inflationary conditions  see currency exchange rates above
