item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since its commencement of operations in march  metra has been engaged in the development and commercialization of diagnostic products for the detection and management of metabolic bone diseases and disorders 
the company has developed and is currently marketing for research and clinical use four immunodiagnostic tests to measure bone resorption loss and formation and one immunodiagnostic test to detect certain pediatric growth disorders 
in the united states  three of these tests have received k clearance from the fda for clinical use and two of these tests are being marketed for research use only 
the company is currently marketing its products in japan for research use only and for research as well as clinical use in numerous other countries  including germany  italy  spain and the united kingdom 
the company s principal sources of revenue are product sales and partner revenues 
product sales are principally derived from sales of the company s bone resorption and formation tests for research and clinical use 
partner revenues result from certain collaborative relationships and primarily consist of milestone payments and licensing fees received from these partners and revenues from sales to these partners of proprietary reagents for use with their test formats 
the company s revenues from product sales have historically resulted from international sales for clinical and research use and from sales in the united states for research use 
in november and december of  the company received k clearance from the fda for its pyrilinks and pyrilinks d products 
revenues from clinical sales in the united states will be dependent  in part  upon the rate at which the company can increase awareness and acceptance of its products among clinicians 
the company commenced its marketing efforts in the united states upon receiving k clearance  and does not anticipate significant revenues from clinical sales of its products in the united states unless and until the results of its marketing efforts are realized 
as a result of the significantly increased sales and marketing activities in the united states following receipt of the fda clearances  the company expects expenses associated with such activities to increase in future periods 
there can be no assurance that the company can successfully increase market awareness or acceptance of the company s products in a timely manner or at all  and failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
historically  the company s quarterly revenues have fluctuated significantly 
partner revenues have fluctuated primarily as a result of the timing of milestone payments received from corporate collaborations 
product sales have fluctuated primarily as a result of the introduction of new products  seasonal variations in demand  the rate of acceptance of the company s products  and variations in the timing and volume of distributor purchases 
the company expects that its revenues will fluctuate as a result of these and other factors 
such fluctuations may result in the company failing to meet securities analysts expectations  which could have a material adverse effect upon the market price of the company s common stock 
in june the company announced that for the fourth quarter of and for fiscal its product sales would not meet securities analysts expectations 
subsequent to this announcement  the market price of the company s common stock dropped from to on the first full day of trading after the announcement 
the company expects that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of its revenues in the future 
also  the company expects to incur increased costs related to sales and marketing  clinical studies  manufacturing  research and development  general and administrative expenses and expansion of its facilities 
as a result  the company expects its results from operations will vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year and will depend on  among other things  gaining regulatory clearances in the united states  japan and elsewhere  the rate of acceptance of the company s products in the marketplace  the availability of reimbursement  the timing of fees and milestone payments from its partners in collaborative relationships  the execution of new collaborative relationships  costs associated with the development of the company s products and costs associated with and the financial impact of acquisitions  including the company s recent acquisition of osteo sciences corporation osteo 
effective january   the company completed the acquisition of osteo  a company engaged in the development of a portable ultrasound product designed to assess bone fragility 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
as a result of the acquisition  the company took a one time charge to operations in the quarter ending march  related to acquired in process research and development of approximately  this charge was primarily composed of the purchase price of approximately  with the balance related to costs and expenses associated with the acquisition  the fair value of liabilities assumed including reserves for future costs related to the acquisition  less the fair value of tangible assets acquired 
prior to the acquisition  research and development expenses constituted a significant percentage of the operating expenses incurred by osteo 
the company intends to continue the research and development activities related to ultrasound technology at levels which exceed the level historically performed by osteo 
as a result  the company expects that its research and development expenses will increase from the levels experienced prior to the acquisition 
the company s gross margin is affected by a number of factors  including product mix  product pricing  the extent of diagnostic test sales compared to reagent sales and royalty revenue  the percentage of direct sales compared to distributor sales and manufacturing costs  including overhead and material costs 
due to seasonal factors such as customer and distributor vacations  the company expects reduced product sales during the summer months  particularly in europe 
as a result of this seasonal effect  the company s revenues could be lower in the quarters ending june and september than in the other quarters 
the manufacturing  testing  labeling  distribution  marketing  advertising and promotion of the company s products are subject to extensive and rigorous government regulation in the united states and other countries 
the company can only commence marketing its products for clinical use after regulatory requirements are satisfied  thus  the company s future product sales and profitability are uncertain 
there can be no assurance that additional regulatory approvals will be obtained in a timely manner  if at all  and significant difficulties and costs that may be encountered by the company in its efforts to obtain additional regulatory approvals could delay or affect the company s ability to sell its products for clinical use in the united states or internationally 
inability to obtain regulatory approvals or any other failure to comply with the regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company has limited experience in manufacturing its products and relies on key sources of supply for certain ingredients and other product components 
if the company experiences significant demand for its products  the company will have to expend significant capital resources to develop large scale manufacturing capabilities 
metra has established corporate partner relationships with a number of companies  including sumitomo pharmaceuticals co  ltd  ciba corning diagnostics corporation a subsidiary of chiron corporation  bayer corporation  diagnostic products corporation  and abbott laboratories 
the company expects to continue to rely on current and future collaborative relationships to develop products and to provide milestone  royalty and reagent sales revenues 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to negotiate acceptable agreements in the future  that such new agreements or existing agreements will be successful  or that the other parties to the agreements will not terminate such agreements or pursue alternative technologies 
competition in the market for the company s diagnostic products from other medical technology companies  biotechnology companies  pharmaceutical companies and research and academic institutions both in the united states and abroad is intense and is expected to increase 
many of the company s competitors have substantially greater financial  technical and human resources than the company 
in addition  many of these competitors have significantly greater experience than the company in research and development  manufacturing  marketing and selling diagnostic products  undertaking clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approvals and third party reimbursement 
developments involving competitors  including introduction of new diagnostic products and receipt of regulatory approvals  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry 
litigation  which would result in substantial cost to and diversion of effort by the company  may be necessary to enforce patents issued to the company  to protect trade secrets or know how owned by the company  to defend the company against claimed infringement of the rights of others or to determine the ownership  scope or validity of the proprietary rights of the company and others 
an adverse determination in any such litigation could subject the company to significant liability to third parties  could require the company to seek licenses from third parties  which licenses may not be available or  if available  may not be on terms acceptable to the company  and ultimately could prevent the company from manufacturing  selling or using its products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s ability to successfully commercialize its products depends in part on the availability of  and the company s ability to obtain  adequate levels of third party reimbursement for clinical use of its diagnostic tests 
although the company s products are available for clinical use in certain european countries  reimbursement is currently available in only certain of those countries 
in the united states  reimbursement is not available for research use only products 
reimbursement for the company s fda cleared tests is determined by cpt codes and may vary by state 
in addition  reimbursement under a specific cpt code is not currently available for the company s pyrilinks and pyrilinks d products 
there can be no assurance that reimbursement in the united states or foreign countries will be available for any of the company s products  or if available  will not be decreased in the future  or that reimbursement amounts will not reduce the demand for  or the price of  the company s products 
the unavailability of third party reimbursement or the inadequacy of reimbursement for medical procedures using metra s tests could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations from inception primarily through the sale of preferred and common stock  payments related to collaborative research and development agreements  sales of the company s diagnostic products for research and clinical use and  to a lesser extent  through equipment financing 
in july  the company completed its initial public offering of  shares of common stock 
all preferred stock was automatically converted into shares of common stock upon closing of the offering 
the cash proceeds from the company s initial public offering  net of underwriters discounts were  total additional expenses associated with the offering were  resulting in net proceeds from the offering of  in april   the company had a follow on offering of  shares of common stock

the leases are both classified as capital leases and expire in fiscal year both leasing agreements include negative covenants which require an irrevocable letter of credit in the event of non compliance of the covenants 
the company s future capital requirements depend upon  among other things  the costs of research and development programs  the funding of clinical and regulatory related studies  the expansion of marketing and selling activities  costs involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  and the time and costs associated with obtaining regulatory approvals for future products 
funds may also be used for investments in  or acquisitions of  complementary businesses  products or technologies  in expanding the company s manufacturing capacity or in improving its existing facilities 
although the company believes that its current cash  cash equivalents and investment securities will be sufficient to meet the company s operating expenses and capital requirements through fiscal  the company s future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including regulatory actions by the fda and other international regulatory bodies  market acceptance of its products  expansion of the company s marketing and sales activities and the cost of intellectual property protection 
the company may  however  seek additional equity or debt financing to fund further expansion of its manufacturing capacity  or to fund other projects or acquisitions 
the timing and amount of such capital requirements cannot be precisely determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors  including demand for the company s products  product mix changes  industry conditions and competitive factors 
there can be no assurance that if it becomes necessary to raise additional capital  that such capital will be available on acceptable terms  if at all
