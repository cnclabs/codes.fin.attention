see nuclear generating station developments herein for additional information 
in february  ace filed a petition with the bpu requesting approval of a pilot economic development power contract program for large commercial and industrial customers that would permit ace to offer contracts for electric service on a negotiated basis 
no formal action was taken by the bpu regarding this filing 
the requested terms of the filing were superseded by the regulations established through legislation enacted in july that authorizes the bpu to approve alternate forms of economic regulation and allows utilities to provide discounted rates in order to retain large customers 
the law provides for the recovery of up to percent of the value of the discount in a subsequent base rate case if it can be adequately demonstrated that the discount benefits all ratepayers 
on october   the bpu issued a summary decision to consider and implement standards for off tariff rate agreements which incorporate  among other things  certain tests and conditions to be satisfied prior to entering into such agreements 
specific off tariff pricing arrangements with ace s customers will be limited by the resources available in the company s business plan 
on march   the bpu issued its decision making final the provisional million increase in lec rates requested in april for further information  see note of ace s notes to financial statements  incorporated by reference herein as exhibit a 
ace expects to file its lec request for the period june  through may  with the bpu in april ace expects to reflect in its filing a nuclear performance penalty of million associated with nuclear performance  which amount would not be recovered from customers and has already been charged against earnings 
at this time  the amount of its lec request for has not been finalized 
by order dated march   the bpu ordered ace s base rates related to salem unit interim and subject to refund  effective immediately  pending a full hearing as to whether salem i is currently used and useful 
the bpu ordered ace to file briefs within fifteen business days with regard to why the bpu should not  after hearings  immediately declare base rates related to salem unit interim and subject to refund pending hearings to determine if salem unit is used and useful 
ace is also required to furnish  within fifteen business days  the actual level of net plant investment associated with each of the salem units  based on ace s last base rate case  the amount of operating and maintenance expenses included in current base rates for each unit  the level of replacement power costs associated with the salem outage to date and the amount of projected monthly replacement power costs for the duration of the outage 
separate hearings will be held by the bpu regarding the issue as to whether or not salem unit and salem unit are no longer used and useful and the actual level of any appropriate rate reduction

on january  public service electric gas company ps filed a petition with the bpu requesting approval for an alternate rate making methodology 
included in ps s plan is a proposal to implement an immediate rate reduction and a plan for an indexed price cap mechanism  effective january  ps s plan also outlines certain categories of costs not subject to the price cap index as well as certain economic development program proposals  a mechanism to share productivity gains with customers and depreciation changes affecting utility plant assets 
ps s plan also proposes the elimination of ps nuclear performance standard 
on january   ace filed a motion to intervene in the proceeding based on the effect the outcome of the ps proceeding could have on ace  including tariff and rate matters  depreciation  ownership and operation of jointly held nuclear generating facilities and flexible utility pricing 
at this time ace cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding 
energy requirements and power supply ace s kilowatt hour sales decreased by approximately over sales 
commercial sales grew by  offset by declines in residential and industrial sales of and  respectively 
the utility systems peak demand of  mw occurred on july  and was above the previous peak demand recorded on july  of  mw 
for the five year period of through  ace s estimate of projected annual sales growth is and peak load growth adjusted for weather is 
these include the estimated effects of load reducing cogeneration and demand side management programs 
ace has generally been able to provide for the growth of energy requirements through the construction of additional generating capacity  joint ownership in larger units and through capacity purchases from other utilities and nonutilities

power pool and interconnection agreements ace is a member of the pennsylvania new jersey maryland interconnection association pjm  an integrated power pool which coordinates the bulk power supply of eleven member utilities in pennsylvania  new jersey  delaware  maryland  virginia and the district of columbia  and is interconnected with other major utilities in the northeastern united states 
as a member of pjm  ace is required to plan for reserve capacity based on estimated aggregate pjm requirements allocated to member companies 
ace periodically files its capacity addition plans with pjm which are intended to meet forecast capacity and reserve obligations 
pjm member companies make use of a planning year concept in reviewing capacity and reserve requirements 
each planning year commences on june and ends on the succeeding may pjm provides for after the fact accounting by its members for differences between forecast and actual load experience 
ace is also a party to the mid atlantic area coordination agreement  which provides for coordinated planning of generation and transmission facilities by the companies included in pjm 
further coordination of short term power supply planning is provided by inter area agreements with adjacent power pools 
pjm currently operates on the basis of reliability of service and operating economy 
to meet the goals outlined by ferc in its open access nopr  pjm has developed a comprehensive proposal under which current members of pjm and other load serving entities will purchase regional network transmission rights that are intended to enable them to reliably and economically integrate generation and load 
generators selling power to serve pool load will not have to purchase transmission service independently  which is intended to create a regional wholesale power market 
in order to meet the requirements to functionally unbundle transmission  pjm has proposed to reorganize into an independent system operator iso with responsibility for operating the bulk power system  administering the regional transmission service tariffs and managing the pool s competitive energy market 
pjm will replace the existing system of cost based centralized dispatch with an expanded  hourly bid price pool in which all sellers will be able to bid their energy into the pool and all load serving entities will be able to buy energy from the pool 
further  under the proposal  pjm will create new contractual mechanisms to ensure participation by all entities responsible for serving load in decisions affecting reliability 
each load serving entity that chooses to operate in the pjm control area will be required to execute an agreement to maintain adequate generation reserves and to share those reserves on a reciprocal basis 
pjm will establish an enhanced regional planning process  under the supervision of the iso  to meet mid atlantic area reliability council reliability requirements applicable to both generation and transmission 
the pjm proposal is subject to ferc approval and is expected to be filed with ferc in power purchases and sales ace is currently purchasing mw of capacity and energy from pp l coal fired sources 
by letter dated march   the company notified ppl that this capacity and energy sales agreement will be terminated effective march to replace the ppl arrangement  the company has signed a letter of intent with peco energy peco for the purchase of mws for the period beginning march  through may  ace also has agreements with certain other electric utilities for the purchase of short term generating capacity  energy and transmission capacity on an as needed basis  which are utilized to the extent they are economic and available 
ace has agreed to sell mw of firm capacity to baltimore gas electric co 
for the period june  through may  capacity planning new generating capacity built by a utility is subject to a certificate of need con process 
a con is required prior to constructing a new generating facility in excess of mw  or adding either mw or of capacity  whichever is smaller  to an existing site 
in addition  new jersey utilities are required to comply with a stipulation of settlement approved by the bpu in july the purpose of the stipulation of settlement is to procure future capacity and energy from qualified cogeneration and small power production facilities through an annual competitive bidding process  based on a long term capacity plan 
the amount to be bid upon is subject to bpu review and will be based upon such factors as a utility s five year projected capacity needs and its current generating capacity  service life extension plans for existing units  new construction  power purchases and commitments from other utilities and non utility sources 
in general  the procedures provide that each utility will procure non utility power when needed through an evaluation system which ranks proposed projects on price and non price factors 
the price of such power is capped at the utility s avoided cost  which avoided cost is subject to bpu review  with a floor price of of such avoided cost 
non price factors in the evaluation process include project status and viability  fuel source and efficiency  project location and environmental effects 
the stipulation of settlement referred to above was due to expire on september  the bpu ordered an extension of the current filing requirements consistent with purpa requirements through february  similarly  the con was set to expire on january  since no processes were in place to replace the con  the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep readopted the legislation and extended it through january  ace  pursuant to the terms of the july stipulation  filed data with the bpu in october covering the year period from through the filing indicated that ace did not require additional capacity until when the need would be met with combined cycle units and or power purchases using the pre described evaluation system 
subsequent updates to the load forecast and the recent negotiations to purchase mw of capacity and associated energy from another utility commencing in delays the need for additional capacity until the year ace s ability to meet its planned capacity obligations and its projected load growth will depend upon the continued availability of currently owned and purchased generating capability  on the availability of capacity from cogeneration and other non utility generating sources  on ace s own planned capacity additions and on capacity purchases from sources yet to be determined 
ace s installed capacity  planned capacity additions  and capacity purchase arrangements for are expected to be sufficient to supply its share of pjm reserve requirements during that period 
the on going outage of the salem units has reduced ace s installed generating capacity and has required ace to secure additional capacity  sufficient to meet pjm reserve requirements 
increases in pjm reserve requirements and less than anticipated benefits associated with conservation and load management efforts could further increase ace s need for additional generating capacity 
to the extent that such capacity provided by others is not available  ace would be required to pursue other sources of capacity  and to accelerate or expand its construction program which  in certain instances  may require additional regulatory approvals and construction expenditures which could be substantial 
on an operational basis  ace expects to be able to continue to meet the demand for electricity on its system through operation of available equipment and by power purchases 
however  if periods of unusual demand should coincide with forced outages of equipment  ace could find it necessary at times to reduce or curtail load in order to safeguard the continued operation of its system 
see note of the accompanying notes to financial statements herein for additional information 
nonutility generation additional sources of capacity for use by ace are made available by non utility sources  principally cogenerators 
ace currently has four  bpu approved power purchase agreements for the purchase of capacity and energy from non utility sources under the standard offer methodology developed and approved by the bpu in august project fuel mw date of location type provided commercial operation chester  solid pennsylvania waste september pedricktown  new jersey gas march carney s point  new jersey coal march logan township  new jersey coal september total an amendment to the agreement between ace and the sponsors of the pedricktown facility has restructured ace s payment for capacity and energy reducing the energy component of the payment 
the amendment also increased the available capacity of the facility from mw to mw and returns the project s thermal host to ace as a retail customer effective november renegotiation of a third contract is currently underway and is expected to be completed in the third quarter of see note of the accompanying notes to financial statements for additional information regarding the recovery of capacity costs

ace is collecting through rates amounts to fund its share of estimated future costs relating to the decommissioning of the five nuclear units in which it has joint ownership interests 
such estimated decommissioning costs are based on studies and forecasts including generic estimates provided by the nuclear regulatory commission nrc 
funding to cover the future costs of decommissioning each of the five nuclear units  as currently authorized by the bpu and provided for in rates  is million annually 
site specific studies are currently being performed and expected to be completed during at that time  adjustments to funding amounts may be required 
see notes and of the accompanying notes to financial statements for additional information relating to nuclear decommissioning 
ace has been advised that the nrc has raised concerns that the thermo lag fire barrier systems used to protect cables and equipment at the peach bottom station may not provide the necessary level of fire protection and has requested licensees to describe short and long term measures being taken to address this concern 
ace has been advised that peco has informed the nrc that it has taken short term compensatory actions to address the inadequacies of the thermo lag barriers installed at peach bottom and is participating in an industry coordinated program to provide long term corrective solutions 
by letter dated december   the nrc stated that peco s interim actions were acceptable 
peco has advised ace that peco has been in contact with the nrc regarding peco s long term measures to address thermo lag fire barrier issues 
in  peco completed its engineering re analysis for peach bottom 
the re analysis identified proposed modifications to be performed over the next several years in order to implement the long term measures addressing the concern over thermo lag use 
nrc approval of the proposed modifications is pending 
ace has been advised that in october general electric company ge reported that crack indications were discovered near the seam welds in the core shroud assembly in a ge boiling water reactor bwr located outside the united states 
as a result  ge issued a letter requesting that the owners of ge bwr plants take interim corrective actions  including a review of fabrication records and visual examinations of accessible areas of the core shroud seam welds 
both peach bottom units and and hope creek are affected by this issue and both peco and ps are participating in the ge bwr owners group to evaluate this issue and develop long term corrective action 
in june  an industry group was formed and subsequently established generic inspection guidelines which were approved by the nrc 
peco has advised ace that peach bottom was last examined during its fall refueling outage and the extent of the cracking identified was determined to be within industry established guidelines 
in a letter to the nrc dated november   peco concluded that there is a substantial margin for each core shroud weld to allow for continued operation of unit peco has also advised ace that peach bottom was examined in october during its refueling outage 
although some crack indications were identified  peco advised that they were considered to be much less severe than those found on unit and no repairs were required to operate unit for another two year cycle 
at the hope creek unit  ps advised ace that during the spring refueling outage  ps inspected the shroud of hope creek in accordance with ge s recommendations and found no cracks 
ps reports that due to the age and materials of the hope creek shroud and the historical maintenance of low conductivity water chemistry  hope creek has been placed in the lowest susceptibility category under industry established guidelines 
hope creek must undergo another shroud inspection during its next refueling outage in  or install a preemptive repair that would maintain the structural integrity of the shroud under all normal and design basis accident conditions for the remaining life of the plant 
ace cannot predict what further action will be taken with regard to these units or what long term corrective actions  if any  will be identified 
the periodic review and evaluation of nuclear generating station licensees conducted by the nrc is known as the systematic assessment of licensee performance salp 
under the revised salp process  ratings are assigned in four assessment areas  reduced from seven assessment areas operations  maintenance  engineering and plant support the plant support area includes security  emergency preparedness  radiological controls  fire protection  chemistry and housekeeping 
ratings are assigned from to  with being the highest and being the lowest 
as previously reported under part  item i business  regulation and note of the notes to financial statements in the company s annual report on form k  new jersey administrative code a requires that all new jersey electric utilities file with the bpu a nuclear decommissioning cost update by january  and every four years thereafter 
ps  on behalf of the co owners of the salem  hope creek and peach bottom stations  has engaged an independent engineer to develop this estimate 
ace is a  and owner of the salem  hope creek and peach bottom stations  respectively 
ace expects that its share of nuclear decommissioning cost will increase  however  the magnitude of the increase cannot be determined at this time 
salem station ace is a owner of salem nuclear generating station salem operated by ps 
salem consists of two  mw pressurized water nuclear reactors pwr representing  kw of ace s total installed capacity of  kw 
ace s net investment in the salem station was approximately million  or of ace s total assets at december  ace was advised on january   the nrc issued its salp report for the salem station for the period covering june  through november  the salem salp report was issued under the revised salp process in which the number of assessment areas has been reduced from seven to four operations  maintenance  engineering and plant support the plant support area includes security  emergency preparedness  radiological controls  fire protection  chemistry and housekeeping 
the nrc assigned ratings of in the functional area of plant support  in the area of engineering and in the areas of operations and maintenance 
the nrc noted an overall decline in performance  and evidenced particular concern with plant and operator challenges caused by repetitive equipment problems and personnel errors 
the nrc has noted that although ps has initiated several comprehensive actions within the past year to improve plant performance  and some recent incremental gains have been made  these efforts have yet to noticeably change overall performance at salem 
ace has been advised that on march   representatives of the nrc staff met with the boards of directors of ps and ps parent company  public service enterprise group  to reiterate the previously expressed concerns with regard to salem s operations 
the nrc staff acknowledged that ps had made efforts to improve salem s operations  including making senior management changes  but indicated that demonstrated sustained results have not yet been achieved 
ace has been advised by ps that its own assessments  as well as those by the nrc and the institute of nuclear power operations  indicated that additional efforts are required to further improve operating performance  as reflected in the restart plans referred to above 
ps has advised ace that ps is committed to taking the necessary actions to address salem s performance needs 
it is anticipated that the nrc will continue to maintain a close watch on salem s restart activities and subsequent operational performance 
no assurance can be given as to what  if any  further or additional actions may be taken or required by the nrc to improve salem s performance 
as previously reported  a salem nrc enforcement conference was held on july  related to certain violations of nrc requirements at salem 
the violations included valves that were incorrectly positioned following a plant modification in may  non conservatisms in the setpoints for a pressurizer overpressure protection system and several examples of inadequate root cause determination of events  leading to insufficient corrective actions at salem 
on october   the nrc proposed cumulative civil penalties of  related to these violations 
ps has advised the nrc that the proposed penalties would not be contested 
ace has been advised that on october   ps declared an alert at salem unit the event involved a problem with the overhead annunciator panel in the unit control room 
ps has chartered a significant event response team sert to investigate the event  determine the root causes and suggest corrective actions 
simultaneously  the nrc formed a special inspection team to investigate the event during the period october through october what actions the nrc might take  if any  cannot be determined at this time 
at the time of the event there was no fuel in the reactor  no release of radiation and no danger to the public or on site personnel 
salem and have been out of service since may  and june   respectively 
ace has been advised that since that time  ps has been engaged in a thorough assessment of each unit to identify and complete the work necessary to achieve safe  sustained  reliable and economic operation 
ps has stated that it will keep each unit off line until it is satisfied that the unit is ready to return to service and to operate reliably over the long term and the nrc has agreed that the unit is sufficiently prepared to restart 
on june   the nrc issued a confirmatory action letter documenting these commitments of ps 
ace was advised that on december   ps presented its restart plan for both units to the nrc at a public meeting 
on february   the nrc staff issued a letter to ps indicating that it had concluded that ps s overall restart plan  if implemented effectively  should adequately address the numerous salem issues to support a safe plant restart  and describing further actions the nrc will undertake to confirm that ps actions have resulted in the necessary performance improvements to support safe plant restart 
as a part of ps comprehensive review  ace has been advised that an extensive examination is being performed on the steam generators  which are large heat exchangers used to produce steam to drive the turbines 
within the industry  certain pwr s other than salem have experienced cracking in a sufficient number of the steam generator tubes to require various modifications to these tubes and replacement of the steam generators in some cases 
until the current outage  regular periodic inspections of the steam generators for each salem unit have resulted in repairs of a small number of tubes well within nrc limits 
as a result of the experience of other utilities with cracking in steam generator tubes  in april  the nrc issued a generic letter to all utilities with pressurized water reactors 
this generic letter requested utilities with pressurized water reactors to conduct steam generator examinations with more sensitive inspection devices capable of detecting evidence of degradation 
subsequently  ps conducted steam generator inspections of the salem units using the latest technology available  including a new  more sensitive  eddy current testing device 
with respect to salem i  ace has been advised that the most recent inspection of the steam generators is not complete  but partial results from eddy current inspections in february using this new technology show indications of degradation in a significant number of tubes 
the inspections are continuing and ps has decided to remove several tubes for laboratory examination to confirm the results of the inspections 
removal of the tubes should be completed in march and preliminary results of the state of the salem tubes from the subsequent laboratory examinations should be known in april 
however  based on the results of inspections to date  ps has concluded that the salem outage  which was expected to be completed in the second quarter of  will be required to be extended for a substantial additional period to evaluate the state of the steam generators and to subsequently determine an appropriate course of action 
degradation of steam generators in pwrs has become an increasing concern for the nuclear industry 
nationally and internationally  utilities have undertaken actions to repair or replace steam generators 
in the extreme  degradation of steam generators has contributed to the retirement of several american nuclear power reactors 
after the salem tubes are fully examined  ps will be able to evaluate its course of action in light of nrc and other industry requirements 
ace has been advised that the examination of the salem steam generators was completed in january using the same testing device used in salem the results of the salem inspection are being reviewed again to confirm their results in light of the experience with salem although this review has not yet been completed  results to date appear to confirm that the condition of the salem steam generators is well within current repair limits at the present time 
ps will also remove tubes from the salem steam generators for laboratory analysis to further confirm the results of this testing 
ace has been advised that ps had planned to return salem to service in the second quarter of and salem in the third quarter of as a result of the extent of the recently discovered degradation in the salem steam generators  ps is focusing its efforts on the return of salem to service in the third quarter 
the additional steam generator inspections and testing on salem is not expected to adversely affect the timing of its restart 
however  the timing of the restart is subject to completion of the requirements of the restart plan to the satisfaction of ps and the nrc as well as to the normal uncertainties associated with such a substantial review and improvement of the systems of a large nuclear unit  so that no assurance can be given that the projected return date will be met 
ace s share of additional operating and maintenance expenses associated with salem restart activities in was million 
in operations and maintenance expenses are estimated to be million and capital expenditures to amount to million 
ace s share of total operating and maintenance expenses for both salem units for the year was million and capital costs were million 
for  ace does not presently expect its share of operating and maintenance expenses or capital costs for salem station to exceed amounts  however this could change as a result of the steam generator inspection results referred to above 
the outage of each salem unit causes ace to incur replacement power costs of approximately thousand per month per unit 
such amounts vary  however  depending on the availability of other generation  the cost of purchased energy and other factors  including modifications to maintenance schedules of other units 
based on the information provided by ps regarding the delay in the return of salem unit  the return of salem unit in the third quarter of and expected operation of the other nuclear units in which ace has an ownership interest  ace presently estimates that its aggregate nuclear capacity factor for will be approximately 
such capacity factor would result in an estimated penalty of million under the bpu nuclear performance standard 
on february   the salem co owners filed a complaint in united states district court for the district of new jersey against westinghouse electric corporation  the designer and manufacturer of the salem steam generators  under state and federal rico statutes alleging fraud  negligent misrepresentation and breach of contract 
the westinghouse complaint seeks compensatory and punitive damages 
on march   ace filed a complaint in superior court of new jersey against ps seeking compensatory damages based on allegations of breach of contract and negligence 
ace has been advised that the other nonoperating co owners of salem have filed a similar complaint against ps in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania 
ace was advised in that the njdep issued a draft new jersey pollutant discharge elimination system njpdes permit to the salem station which required closed cycle cooling 
in response to the draft permit  ps submitted further written comments to the njdep regarding the ecological effects of station operations demonstrating that salem was not having and would not have an adverse environmental impact and that closed cycle cooling was an inappropriate solution 
ps also developed and submitted a supplement to the permit renewal application setting forth an alternative approach that would protect aquatic life in the delaware estuary and provide other ecological benefits 
ps proposed intake screen modifications to reduce fish loss  a study of sound deterrent systems to divert fish from the intake and a limit on intake flow 
in addition  ps proposed conservation measures  including the restoration of up to  acres of degraded wetlands and the installation of fish ladders to allow fish to reach upstream spawning areas 
finally  ps proposed a comprehensive biological monitoring program to expand existing knowledge of the delaware estuary and to monitor station impacts 
in june  ace was advised that the njdep issued salem a revised draft permit which reconsidered the requirement for closed cycle cooling and adopted the alternative measures proposed by ps with certain modifications 
a final five year permit was issued on july  with an effective date of september  the environmental protection agency epa  which has the authority to review the final permit issued by the njdep  completed its review and has not raised any objections 
certain environmental groups and other entities  including the state of delaware  have filed requests for hearings with the njdep challenging the final permit 
the njdep granted the hearing requests on certain of the issues and ps has been named as a respondent along with the njdep in these matters which are pending in the office of administrative law of the state of new jersey 
ace has been advised that ps is implementing the final permit 
additional permits from various agencies must be obtained to implement the permit 
no assurances can be given as to receipt of any such additional permits 
ps has advised ace that it estimates that the cost of compliance with the final permit is approximately million  of which ace s share is and is included in ace s current forecast of construction expenditures 
on march   the bpu announced that all revenues associated with salem unit would be made interim and subject to refund effective immediately  pending further investigation and hearings on the steam generator cracking and the expected return date of the unit 
the bpu also announced that ace must demonstrate why revenues for salem unit should not be made interim and subject to refund 
for further information with regard to this and other rate issues  see rates herein 
at this time  it is not possible to predict what other actions may be taken in any regulatory  administrative or civil proceedings by ace or others  the outcome of any such proceedings  if commenced  or the ultimate amount of responsibility of ace for costs and penalties arising from such proceedings 
hope creek station ace is a owner of hope creek nuclear generating station hope creek which is operated by ps 
an outage of the hope creek unit can cause ace to incur replacement power costs currently estimated to be thousand per month  depending on the availability of other generation  the cost of purchased energy and other factor including changes in maintenance schedules of other units 
hope creek is currently undergoing a refueling and maintenance outage which commenced november  the nrc s most recent salp report for hope creek for the period june through april  assigned ratings of in the area of plant support and a rating of in the functional category of engineering  operations and maintenance 
the nrc noted an overall decline in performance in the operations  maintenance and engineering areas compared to the previous salp period  and cited weak root cause analysis as a dominant factor 
ace has been advised by ps that as a result of an internal allegation report  ps submitted a licensee event report in october which stated that the hope creek control room was understaffed for approximately three minutes and a decision was made by those involved that the incident did not warrant initiation of nrc reporting documentation 
ps has advised ace that a meeting with nrc region i personnel was held on october  in which the nrc expressed a high degree of concern over the issue 
after investigation by both the nrc and ps  on september   the nrc issued two level iv violations with no civil penalty 
ps has advised ace that a small amount of low level radioactive material was released to the atmosphere at hope creek on april  ps advised that the release did not exceed federal limits nor pose any danger to the public or plant employees  however  a trailer driven offsite had exceeded the limit for releasing materials and was later cleaned 
ps and the nrc have investigated the event  and on june  an enforcement conference was held 
on july   the nrc issued a notice of violation for the hope creek unplanned release which noted four violations 
no fine was issued  partly because of the comprehensive corrective actions taken following the event and the plant s history of limited enforcement action 
ace has been advised that on july   during a manual shutdown of hope creek for repair of control room ventilation equipment  operators partially opened a valve for a period of time and reduced the effectiveness of the shutdown cooling system 
although the impact of the event to plant safety was minimal  the positioning of the valve and the resulting temperature change violated plant procedures and technical specifications 
on july   nrc staff met with plant management concerning this issue and subsequently decided to assign a special inspection team to independently evaluate this event as well as ps response to it  including ps procedures and training for operator handling of abnormal conditions 
ace was advised that on september   the nrc s special inspection team issued its report and identified several areas where operator and senior plant management performance during this event was inadequate 
ps has advised ace that an nrc enforcement conference was held on november   and on december   the nrc issued a level iii violation for this event with a civil penalty of  as previously reported  ps had advised ace that the nrc  by letter dated december   informed ps that a plant performance review performed by the nrc for the period april  to october  indicated a continued decline in plant performance  and that ps had determined to extend the refueling outage to include the implementation of corrective actions to eliminate operational deficiencies noted by the nrc and detected by ps through self assessment 
ps has also advised ace that in the nrc december   letter the nrc requested a management meeting prior to restart to allow ps to present its self assessment of the progress made during the outage and of the readiness of the unit for restart 
ace has also been advised that on february  the nrc commenced a readiness assessment team inspection for hope creek  scheduled to be completed on march   and that the hope creek unit is expected to return to service in march it is not possible to predict the outcome of the nrc inspection or what other actions which may be taken by the nrc with respect to hope creek 
ace has been advised that by letter dated january   the nrc requested a meeting with ps senior management to discuss its concerns regarding declining trends in performance at hope creek 
the meeting has not yet been scheduled but is expected to occur after the restart of hope creek from its current refueling and maintenance outage 
peach bottom station ace is a owner of peach bottom atomic power station peach bottom operated by peco 
ace has been advised that on january   the nrc issued its salp report for the peach bottom station for the period covering may  through october  the nrc assigned ratings of in the functional areas of plant operations  maintenance and plant support 
engineering received a rating of 
the nrc found continued improvement in performance during the period 
operator performance continued to be a strength  as well as operations management oversight 
effective engineering management actions to improve the overall self assessment and system performance were noted  as well as good management oversight activities 
response to emerging issues  equipment problems and event related issues were noted as particularly strong 
however  lapses in the quality of technical work and in modification implementation indicated inconsistent performance  and resulted in a repeat rating of for the engineering area 
ace has been advised that peco will be taking actions to address weaknesses discussed in the salp report 
as previously reported in the june  report on form q  ace has been advised by peco that on august   the nrc held an predecisional enforcement conference regarding three alleged violations in control and design activities and technical specification requirements regarding operability of the emergency diesel generators 
ace has been advised that on august   the nrc issued its notice of violation report and  in the report  recognized that peco identified the problem issues  conducted a detailed root cause evaluation and took appropriate corrective actions 
the nrc elected not to propose a civil penalty in this case based on the identification and corrective action taken by peco 
ace has been advised by peco that  by letter dated october   the nrc has approved peco s request to rerate the authorized maximum reactor core power levels of peach bottom units no 
and by to  mws from the current limits of  mws 
the amendment of the peach bottom unit no 
facility operating license was effective upon the date of the nrc approval letter 
the amendment of the unit no 
facility operating license became effective with the completion of hardware changes which were done during unit no 
s fall refueling outage 
fuel supply ace s sources of electrical energy including power purchases for the years indicated are shown below source coal nuclear oil natural gas interchange and purchased power nonutility the prices of all types of fuels used by ace for the generation of electricity are subject to various factors  such as world markets  labor unrest and actions by governmental authorities  including allocations of fuel supplies  over which ace has no control 
oil residual oil and distillate oil for ace s wholly owned stations are furnished under two separate contracts with a major fuel supplier 
ace has a contract for the supply of sulfur residual oil for both deepwater and b 
l 
england stations and for distillate oil sufficient to supply ace s combustion turbines 
both contracts expire october  see environmental controls air for information concerning the use of particular fuels at b 
l 
england station 
on december   the oil supply at deepwater station was sufficient to operate deepwater unit for days  and the supply at b 
l 
england station was sufficient to operate unit for days 
coal ace has contracted with one supplier for the purchase of sulfur coal for b 
l 
england units and through april  on december   the coal inventory at the b 
l 
england station was sufficient to operate units and for days 
see environmental controls air herein for additional information relating to bl england station 
ace has contracted with one supplier for the purchase of sulfur coal for deepwater unit through june  on december   the coal inventory at deepwater station was sufficient to operate unit for days 
the keystone and conemaugh stations  in which ace has joint ownership interests of and  respectively  are mine mouth generating stations located in western pennsylvania 
the owners of the keystone station have a contract through  providing for a portion of the annual bituminous coal requirements of the keystone station 
a combination of long and short term contracts provide for the annual bituminous coal requirements of the conemaugh station 
to the extent that the requirements of both plants are not covered by these contracts  coal supplies are obtained from local suppliers 
as of december   keystone and conemaugh had approximately a day supply and a day supply of coal  respectively 
gas ace is currently capable of firing natural gas in six combustion turbine peaking units and in two conventional steam turbine generating units 
ace has entered into a firm electric service tariff with the local distribution company for the supply of natural gas to its units 
the tariff provides for the payment of certain commodity and demand charges 
portions of the gas supply are obtained from the spot market under short term renewable gas supply and transportation contracts with various producers suppliers and pipelines 
nuclear fuel as a joint owner of the peach bottom  salem and hope creek generating units  ace relies upon the respective operating company for arrangements for nuclear fuel supply and management 
ace is responsible for the costs thereof to the extent of its particular ownership interest through an arrangement with a third party 
generally  the supply of fuel for nuclear generating units involves the mining and milling of uranium ore to uranium concentrate  conversion of the uranium concentrate to uranium hexafluoride  enrichment of uranium hexafluoride and fabrication of fuel assemblies 
after spent fuel is removed from a nuclear reactor  it is placed in temporary storage for cooling in a spent fuel pool at the nuclear station site 
under the nuclear waste policy act of nwpa  the federal government has a contractual obligation for transportation and ultimate disposal of the spent fuel 
see note of the accompanying notes to financial statements for financing arrangements for nuclear fuel 
ace has been advised by peco  the operator of peach bottom  that it has contracts for uranium concentrates to fully operate peach bottom units and through on february   two companies which supply uranium concentrates to peco filed petitions for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
the two companies supply approximately half of peco s and requirements for uranium concentrates 
in addition  one of the companies is under contract to supply approximately of peco s uranium concentrate requirements for the period to peco has made alternate arrangements with other suppliers to satisfy its short term requirements for uranium concentrates 
peco is also finalizing arrangements with another supplier to satisfy peco s longer term needs 
ace has been advised that peco does not anticipate any difficulties in obtaining its requirements for uranium concentrates 
ace has also been advised by peco that its contracts for uranium concentrates will be allocated to the peach bottom units  and other peco nuclear facilities in which ace has no ownership interest  on an as needed basis 
ace has also been advised that peco has contracted for the following segments of the nuclear fuel supply cycle with respect to the peach bottom units through the following years nuclear unit conversion enrichment fabrication peach bottom unit peach bottom unit ace has been advised by ps  the operating company for the salem and hope creek stations  that it has arrangements which are expected to provide sufficient uranium concentrates to meet the current projected requirements of the salem and hope creek units through the year and approximately of the requirements through ps has advised ace that present contracts meet the other nuclear fuel cycle requirements for the salem and hope creek units through the years indicated below nuclear unit conversion enrichment fabrication salem unit salem unit hope creek coverage through  approximately through  and approximately through ps has advised ace that it does not anticipate difficulties in obtaining necessary enrichment service for the salem and hope creek units 
in conformity with the nwpa  ps and peco  on behalf of the co owners of the salem and hope creek  and peach bottom stations  respectively  have entered into contracts with the us department of energy doe for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel from those stations 
under these contracts  the doe is to take title to the spent fuel at the site  then transport it and provide for its permanent disposal at a cost to utilities based on nuclear generation  subject to such escalation as may be required to assure full cost recovery by the federal government 
under nwpa  the federal government must commence the acceptance of these materials for permanent offsite storage no later than  but it is possible that such storage may be delayed indefinitely 
ace has been advised that the doe has stated that it would not be able to open a permanent  high level nuclear waste storage facility until  at the earliest 
legislation has been introduced in congress for the construction of a temporary storage facility which would accept spent nuclear fuel from utilities in or soon thereafter 
ace has been advised that the nrc has determined that spent nuclear fuel generated in any reactor can be stored safely and without significant environmental impacts in reactor facility storage pools or in independent spent fuel storage installations located at reactor or away from reactor sites for at least years beyond the licensed life for operation which may include the term of a revised or renewed license 
the doe is exploring options to address delays in the currently projected waste acceptance schedules 
the options under consideration by the doe include offsetting a portion of the financial burden associated with the costs of continued on site storage of spent fuel after it is not possible for ace to predict when any type of federal storage facility will become available  or what offsets to the costs of storage  if any  will be available 
peco has advised ace that spent fuel racks at peach bottom units and have storage capacity until for unit and for unit options for expansion of storage capacity at peach bottom beyond the pertinent dates  including rod consolidation  are being investigated 
ps has advised ace that as a result of reracking two spent fuel pools at salem  the availability of adequate spent fuel storage capacity is conservatively estimated through for salem and for salem  prior to losing an operational full core discharge reserve 
the hope creek pool is also fully racked and it is conservatively expected to provide storage capacity until  again prior to losing an operational full core discharge reserve 
the units can be safely operated for many years beyond these dates  as pool storage capacity will continue to be available 
these dates assist in planning the need for additional storage capacity that may be needed to operate the units until the expiration of their operating license 
nuclear decommissioning see note nuclear plant decommissioning and other of the accompanying notes to financial statements for information relating to decommissioning of the five nuclear units in which ace has an ownership interest 
the energy policy act states  among other things  that utilities with nuclear reactors must pay for the decommissioning and decontamination of the doe nuclear fuel enrichment facilities 
the total costs are estimated to be million per year for years  of which ace s share is estimated to be million 
the act provides that these costs are to be recoverable in the same manner as other fuel costs 
ace has recorded a liability of million and a related regulatory asset of million for such costs at december  ace made its first payment related to this liability to the respective operating companies in september and continues to make payments as required 
in ace s lec filing  the bpu approved a stipulation of settlement which included  among other things  the full lec recovery of this and future assessments 
in january  the bpu adopted njac a which was designed to provide a mechanism for periodic review of the estimated costs of decommissioning nuclear generating stations owned by new jersey electric utilities 
the purpose of this regulation is to insure that adequate funds are available to assure completion of decommissioning activities at the cessation of commercial operation 
the regulation established decommissioning trust fund reporting requirements for electric utilities in order to provide the bpu with timely information for its oversight of these funds 
on january   ps and ace jointly filed with the bpu its nuclear decommissioning cost updates pursuant to njac a et seq 
in order to comply with njac a a  ps and ace jointly filed nrc cost estimates for each of their five jointly owned nuclear units 
these cost estimates are based on the nrc s existing generic formula 
ace and ps do not believe that these nrc generic estimates provide an accurate estimate of the cost of decommissioning the nuclear units 
inclusion of these nrc generic estimates should not be interpreted as a validation by ace and ps of the appropriateness of these estimates for estimating the cost of decommissioning the nuclear units 
ace and ps believe these costs are best estimated with periodic site specific studies 
such site specific studies are currently being undertaken and upon completion will be filed with the bpu later in regulation ace is a public utility organized under the laws of new jersey and is subject to regulation as such by the bpu  among others  which is also charged with the responsibility for energy planning and coordination within the state of new jersey 
ace is also subject to regulation by the pennsylvania public utility commission in limited respects concerning property and operations in pennsylvania 
ace is also subject  in certain respects  to the jurisdiction of the ferc  and ace maintains a system of accounts in conformity with the uniform system of accounts prescribed for public utilities and licensees subject to the provisions of the federal power act 
the construction of generating stations and the availability of generating units for commercial operation are subject to the receipt of necessary authorizations and permits from regulatory agencies and governmental bodies 
standards as to environmental suitability or operating safety are subject to change 
litigation or legislation designed to delay or prevent construction of generating facilities and to limit the use of existing facilities may adversely affect the planned installation and operation of such facilities 
no assurance can be given that necessary authorizations and permits will be received or continued in effect  or that standards as to environmental suitability or operating safety will not be changed in a manner to adversely affect the company  ace or its operations 
pursuant to legislation enacted in the state of new jersey in  no public utility can commence construction of certain electric facilities without having obtained a certificate of need from the appropriate state regulatory authorities 
for purposes of the legislation  such electrical facilities are electric generating units at a single site having a combined capacity of mw or more and electric generating units which  when added to an existing electric generating facility  would increase the installed capacity of such facility by or by more than mw  whichever is smaller 
operation of nuclear generating units involves continuous close regulation by the nrc 
such regulation involves testing  evaluation and modification of all aspects of plant operation in light of nrc safety and environmental requirements  and continuous demonstration to the nrc that plant operations meet applicable requirements 
the nrc has the ultimate authority to determine whether any nuclear generating plant may operate 
in addition  the federal emergency management agency has responsibility for the review  in conjunction with the nrc  of certain aspects of emergency planning relating to the operation of nuclear plants 
as a by product of nuclear operations  nuclear generating units  including those in which ace owns an interest  produce substantial amounts of low level radioactive waste llrw 
such waste is presently accumulated on site pending permanent storage in federally licensed disposal facilities located elsewhere 
the federal low level radioactive policy act  as amended llrwpa  provides that each state must have a permanent storage faciity operational by january  ace has been advised that to date pennsylvania has met such requirements by entering into a compact with west virginia  maryland  delaware and the district of columbia 
to date  new jersey has complied with the llrwpa requirements by entering into a compact with the state of connecticut and certifying its capability to manage  store or dispose of low level radioactive waste requiring disposal after december  ace has been advised by ps and peco that llrw generated at salem  hope creek and peach bottom is being temporarily stored in on site facilities pending development of permanent disposal sites in new jersey and pennsylvania 
ps s on site facility  completed in september  provides storage for years from hope creek and salem 
it will be used for interim storage of radioactive materials and waste  and if it proves necessary in the future  to temporarily store waste until new jersey provides a permanent disposal facility 
peco has advised that is has an on site llrw storage facility for peach bottom which will also provide at least years of temporary storage 
peco has also advised that pennsylvania is pursuing its own llrw site development via state selected candidate sites  along with a volunteer plan option 
new jersey has introduced a volunteer siting process to establish a llrw disposal facility by the year public meetings have been held across the state in an effort to provide information to and obtain feedback from the public 
to date  there have been no volunteers identified 
in june  new jersey enacted legislation providing for funding of an estimated million cost of establishing a facility for disposal by fee regulation provided for in the statute will permit the state to recover costs of such facility from waste generators 
in march  new jersey enacted the public utility fault determination act which requires that the bpu make a determination of fault with regard to any past or future accident at any electric generating or transmission facility  prior to granting a request by that utility for a rate increase to cover accident related costs in excess of million 
however  the law allows the affected utility to file for non accident related rate increases during such fault determination hearings and to recover contributions to federally mandated or voluntary cost sharing plans 
the law further allows the bpu to authorize the recovery of certain fault related repair  cleanup  power replacement or damage costs if substantiated by the evidence presented and if authorized in writing by the bpu 
in april  atlantic jersey thermal systems  inc ajts  a wholly owned subsidiary of ats  filed a petition with the bpu for an order declaring that ajts not be deemed a public utility under new jersey law subject to the bpu s jurisdiction by reason of either its ownership and operation of a proposed thermal energy production facility serving certain customers in atlantic city or the sale of thermal energy therefrom 
ajts has proposed that its thermal energy services would not constitute the operation of facilities for public use  but will service a limited number of large  sophisticated energy consumers through individually negotiated service agreements 
the bpu has not yet issued a ruling and the final outcome cannot be determined at this time 
information regarding ace s nuclear power replacement cost insurance and liability under the federal price anderson act is incorporated herein by reference to note of ace s notes to financial statements  filed as exhibit a to this report 
environmental matters general ace is subject to regulation with respect to air and water quality and other environmental matters by various federal  state and local authorities 
emissions and discharges from ace s facilities are required to meet established criteria  and numerous permits are required to construct new facilities and to operate new and existing facilities 
additional regulations and requirements are continually being developed by various government agencies 
the principal laws  regulations and agencies relating to the protection of the environment which affect ace s operations are described below 
construction projects and operations of ace are affected by the national environmental policy act under which all federal agencies are required to give appropriate consideration to environmental values in major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment 
the federal resource conservation and recovery act of rcra provides for the identification of hazardous waste and includes standards and procedures that must be followed by all persons that generate  transport  treat  store or dispose of hazardous waste 
ace has filed notifications and plans with the u 
s 
epa relating to the generation and treatment of hazardous waste at certain of its facilities and generating stations 
the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of cercla  as amended by the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of sara  and rcra authorize the epa to bring an enforcement action to compel responsible parties to take investigative and or cleanup actions at any site that is determined to present an imminent and substantial danger to the public or to the environment because of an actual or threatened release of one or more hazardous substances 
the new jersey spill compensation and control act spill act provides similar authority to the njdep 
because of the nature of ace s business  including the production of electricity  various by products and substances are produced and or handled which are classified as hazardous under the above laws 
ace generally provides for the disposal and or processing of such substances through licensed independent contractors 
however  the statutory provisions may impose joint and several responsibility without regard to fault on the generators of hazardous substances for certain investigative and or cleanup costs at the site where these substances were disposed and or processed 
generally  actions directed at funding such site investigations and or cleanups include all known allegedly responsible parties 
ace has received requests for information under cercla with respect to certain sites 
one site  a sanitary landfill comprising approximately acres  is situated in atlantic county  new jersey 
ace received a directive  dated november   from the njdep  identifying ace as one of a number of parties allegedly responsible for the placement of certain hazardous substances  namely  flyash which had been approved as landfill material 
an administrative consent order aco has been executed and submitted to the njdep by ace and at least four other identified responsible parties 
site remediation will include a soil cover of the site 
ace has joined with three other parties and will cooperate in implementing the terms of the aco 
approximately eight additional responsible parties have also been identified by the njdep 
ace  together with the other signatories to the aco  will pursue recovery against those persons who may also pursue recovery against other responsible parties not named in the njdep directive 
ace has been served a summons and complaint dated june  in a civil action brought pursuant to section a of cercla on behalf of the epa 
ace has been named as one of several defendants in connection with the recovery of costs incurred  and to be incurred  in response to the alleged release of hazardous substances located in gloucester county  new jersey 
approximately separate financially solvent entities have been identified as having responsibility for remediation which is now predicted to be in excess of million 
sufficient discovery has been conducted to establish that ace s contribution to the clean up and remediation activity will be within the lower tiers of financial participation 
notwithstanding the joint and several liability imposed by law  primary responsibility will be apportioned among others  including federal and state agencies and private parties 
it is estimated that ace s contribution for the remediation and clean up of both the atlantic county and gloucester county sites is not expected to exceed million 
the new jersey environmental clean up responsibility act was supplemented and amended in june and became the new jersey industrial site recovery act 
the act provides  among other things  that any business having certain standard industrial classification code numbers that generates  uses  transports  manufactures  refines  treats  stores  handles or disposes of hazardous substances or hazardous wastes is subject to the requirements of the act upon the closing of operations or a transfer of ownership or operations 
as a precondition to such termination or transfer of ownership or operations  the approval of the njdep of a negative declaration  a remedial action work plan or a remediation agreement and the establishment of the remediation funding source is required 
various state and federal legislation have established a comprehensive program for the disclosure of information about hazardous substances in the workplace and the community  and provided a procedure whereby workers and residents can gain access to this information 
implementing the regulations provides for extensive recordkeeping  labeling and training to be accomplished by each employer responsible for the handling of hazardous substances 
ace has implemented the requirements of this legislation to achieve substantial compliance with appropriate schedules 
ace is also subject to the wetlands act of  which requires applications to and permits from the njdep for conducting regulated activities including construction and excavation within the coastal wetlands  as defined therein 
legislation enacted in by the state of new jersey designates certain areas as fresh water wetlands and restricts development in those areas 
the new jersey coastal area facility review act cafra requires applications to and permits from the njdep for construction of certain types of facilities within the coastal area as defined by cafra 
recent changes in regulations effective july may have substantive impact and are in the process of being finalized 
although the cafra regulations  as initially drafted  exclude certain utilities from the most rigorous portions of the regulations  electric utilities were not excluded 
at the present time  the njdep indicates that the final rules will exclude electric lines and substation construction and maintenance from the definition of public development 
these activities will then be excluded from regulation 
the regulations do not effect existing facilities or equipment and ace does not presently have construction of such facilities or equipment planned 
ace will continue pursuit for the exemption 
public concern continues over the health effects from exposure to electric and magnetic fields emf 
to date  there are not conclusive scientific studies to support such concerns 
the new jersey commission on radiation protection corp is considering promulgation of regulations which would authorize the njdep to review all new power line projects of kilovolts or more 
while the promulgation of such regulations may affect the design and location of ace s existing and future electric power lines and facilities and the cost thereof  current discussions with corp indicate that such regulations would not significantly impact ace s operations 
ace s program of prudent field management implements reasonable measures  at modest cost  to limit magnetic field levels in the design and location of new facilities 
such amounts as may be necessary to comply with any new emf rules cannot be determined at this time and are not included in ace s estimated construction expenditures 
air the federal clean air act  as amended  requires that all states achieve specified primary ambient air quality standards relating to public health by december  unless the deadline is extended for certain pollutants for a particular state by appropriate action taken by the epa  and also requires that states achieve secondary ambient air quality standards relating to public welfare under the clean air act within a reasonable time 
the clean air act also requires the administrator of the epa to promulgate revised new source performance standards for sulfur dioxide  particulates and nitrogen dioxide  mandate the use of the best technological system of continuous emission reduction and preclude the use of low sulfur coal as a sole means of achieving compliance with sulfur regulations for new power plants 
the clean air act amendments caaa  which provide for penalties in the event of noncompliance  further provide that state implementation plans sip contain emission limitations and such other measures as may be necessary  as determined under regulations promulgated by the epa  to prevent significant deterioration of air quality based on regional non degradation classifications 
the njdep is using the new jersey administrative code  title  chapter njac as its sip to achieve compliance with the national ambient air quality standards adopted by epa under the clean air act 
njac currently provides ambient air quality standards and emission limitations  all of which have epa approval  for seven pollutants  including sulfur dioxide and particulates 
ace believes that all of its fossil fuel fired generating units are  in all substantial respects  currently operating in compliance with njac and the epa approved sip 
in november  the caaa was enacted to provide for further restrictions and limitations on sulfur dioxide and other emission sources as a means to reduce acid deposition 
phase i of the legislation mandates compliance with the sulfur dioxide reduction provisions of the legislation by january  by utility power plants emitting sulfur dioxide at a rate of above pounds per million btu 
plants utilizing certain control technologies to meet the phase i sulfur dioxide reductions could be permitted  subject to epa approval  to either postpone compliance until or receive an early reduction bonus allowance for reductions achieved between and phase ii of the legislation requires controls by january  on plants emitting sulfur dioxide at a rate above pounds per million btu 
ace s wholly owned b 
l 
england units and and its jointly owned conemaugh units and  in which ace has a ownership interest  are affected by phase i  and all of ace s other fossil fueled steam generating units are affected by phase ii 
the keystone station  in which ace has a ownership interest  is impacted by the sulfur dioxide provisions of title iv of the caaa during phase ii 
in addition  all of ace s fossil fueled steam generating units will be affected by the nitrogen oxide provisions of the caaa 
compliance with the legislation will cause ace to incur additional capital and or operating costs 
on april   the njdep renewed ace s expiring certificates to operate control apparatus or equipment for the three generating units at bl england station for a period of five years  expiring april  a draft renewal permit is currently under review by the njdep and is expected to be issued by the end of march the caaa title v operating permit  becoming effective in  will supersede the current permitting requirements 
the cost of certain power purchase arrangements between ace and other electric utilities may also be affected by the legislation 
a portion of the capital costs necessary to continue compliance with the caaa are included in ace s current estimate of construction expenditures shown under construction and financing above 
ace expects that costs associated with compliance would be recoverable through rates  and may be offset  in part  by utilization of certain allowances as permitted by the caaa  the value of which is not presently determinable 
the caaa requires that reductions in nitrogen oxide nox be made from the emissions of major contributing sources and each state must impose reasonable available control technologies on these major sources 
njdep regulations adopted in november require that a compliance plan be filed with the njdep 
ace s compliance plan  filed april   has been accepted by the njdep 
draft permits for acceptable conditions are to be finalized before may with compliance by may  preliminary capital expenditures are estimated at million over the next five years to achieve compliance with phase ii nox reductions 
the necessary emission reductions are based on modeling results and regulatory agency discussions and could result in additional changes to equipment and in methods of operation and fuel  the extent of which has not been fully determined 
water the federal water pollution control act  as amended the clean water act provides for the imposition of effluent limitations to regulate the discharge of pollutants  including heat  into the waters of the united states 
the clean water act also requires that cooling water intake structures be designed to minimize adverse environmental impact 
under the clean water act  compliance with applicable effluent limitations is to be achieved by a national pollution discharge elimination system npdes permit program to be administered by the epa or by the state involved if such state establishes a permit program and water quality standards satisfactory to the epa 
having previously adopted the new jersey pollution discharge elimination system njpdes  njdep assumed authority to operate the njpdes permit program 
during  ace received njpdes permits for discharges to surface waters for all facilities with existing epa issued npdes permits 
during  ace received draft renewal permits for both bl england station and deepwater station for discharges to surface waters as well as groundwater 
ace filed extensive comments with the njdep contesting the numerous newly imposed conditions in both permits 
the njdep subsequently issued final permits for both stations containing certain conditions which are unacceptable to ace 
ace filed requests for adjudicatory hearings contesting the unacceptable conditions contained in the permits 
ace has reached a resolution with the njdep relating to groundwater permits at bl england station which required ace to conduct additional studies  which were completed in a draft njpdes permit was issued in february to include past contested conditions and bring current permit limitations with respect to today s environment and technology 
most of the contested conditions were resolved with the issuance of the npdes permit renewal effective january  ace has adjudicated two minor issues related to permit conditions requiring that a pollutant reduction and a dilution study is being conducted to comply with the latest njpdes requirements 
effective december   the njdep adopted new surface water quality standards which  in part  provide guidelines for heat dissipation from any source and which become standards for subsequent federal permits 
these njdep guidelines were included in the final epa permits issued for the b 
l 
england  deepwater  salem  and hope creek stations 
on receipt of the permits for b 
l 
england and deepwater stations  ace filed with the epa a request for alternative thermal limitations variance in accordance with the provisions of section a of the act 
the njdep and epa have subsequently determined that b 
l 
england units and are in compliance with applicable thermal water quality standards 
the request for a section a variance for deepwater station has not yet been acted upon 
ace is not able at this time to predict the outcome of the request  but it believes that it has adequately supported the request for such variance 
ace believes that all of its wholly owned steam electric generating units are  in all substantial respects  currently operating in compliance with all applicable standards and njpdes permit limitations  except as described herein above 
all current surface water discharge permits for bl england have been renewed as of january  and ace has filed for renewal of the ground water discharge permits for b

england and surface water discharge permits for deepwater 
the delaware river basin commission drbc has required various electric utilities  as a condition of being permitted to withdraw water from the delaware river for use in connection with the operation of certain electric generating stations  to provide for a means of replacing water withdrawn from the river during certain periods of low river flow 
such a requirement presently applies to the salem and hope creek stations 
as a result of such requirement  ace and certain other electric utilities constructed the merrill creek reservoir project 
ace owns a ownership interest in the reservoir project 
although ace expects that sufficient replacement water would be provided by merrill creek during periods of low river flow to permit the full operation of salem and hope creek  such events cannot be assured 
environmental control technology  generally  is in the process of further development and the implementation of such may require  in many instances  balancing of the needs for additional quantities of energy in future years and the need to protect the environment 
as a result  ace cannot estimate the precise effect of existing and potential regulations and legislation upon any of its existing and proposed facilities and operations  or the additional costs of such regulations 
ace s capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental requirements in amounted to million  and its most recent estimate for such compliance for the years is million 
such estimates do not include amounts which ace may be required to expend to comply with phase ii requirements of the caaa at bl england unit and keystone station or the normal costs of compliance with radiation protection 
such additional costs which ace may incur in affecting compliance with potential regulations and legislation are not included in the estimated construction costs for the period see construction and financing 
future regulatory and legislative developments may require ace to further modify  supplement or replace equipment and facilities  and may delay or impede the construction and operation of new facilities  at costs which could be substantial

results of the nonutility companies are reported in other income 
revenues operating revenues electric increased and in and  respectively 
components of the overall changes are shown as follows millions levelized energy clause kilowatt hour sales unbilled revenues sales for resale other total lec revenues increased in due to a provisional rate increase of million in july and a million increase in july changes in kilowatt hour sales are discussed under billed sales to ultimate utility customers 
overall  the combined effects of changes in rates charged to customers and kilowatt hour sales resulted in increases of and in revenues per kilowatt hour in and  respectively 
the changes in unbilled revenues are a result of the amount of kilowatt hours consumed by  but not yet billed to  ultimate customers at the end of the respective periods  which are affected by weather and economic conditions  and the corresponding price per kilowatt hour 
the changes in sales for resale are a function of ace s energy mix strategy  which in turn is dependent upon ace s needs for energy  the energy needs of other utilities participating in the regional power pool of which ace is a member  and the sources and prices of energy available 
the decline in the sales for resale reflects a decrease in the demand of the power pool  the decline in market prices and a reduction in excess energy sources when compared to the previous year 
the decrease in supplemental excess energy sources reflect the expiration of a megawatt purchase capacity arrangement in may  and expiration of other short term purchase contracts 
the increase in sales for resale for was the result of being able to meet the demands of the regional power pool due to the extreme weather conditions during the first six months of billed sales to ultimate utility customers changes in kilowatt hour sales are generally due to changes in the average number of customers and average customer use  which is affected by economic and weather conditions 
energy sales statistics  stated as percentage changes from the previous year  are shown as follows avg avg avg avg customer class sales use of cust sales use of cust residential 
commercial 

industrial 
total the decrease in total sales was attributable to weather conditions that led to below normal electricity consumption for a majority of the year and a decreased number of billing days in compared to the increase in total sales was due to an increase in the number of billing days in compared to and  to a lesser extent  weather 
the commercial sector experienced continued growth during due to sales increases across all the major commercial subsectors 
commercial growth in both years benefitted from night lighting programs 
the sales declines in the industrial sector are primarily related to the impact of two former customers taking energy service from independent power producers commencing in june and january costs and expenses total operating expenses increased and in and  respectively 
included in these expenses are the costs of energy  purchased capacity  operations  maintenance  depreciation and taxes 
energy expense reflects costs incurred for energy needed to meet load requirements  various energy supply sources used and operation of the lecs 
changes in costs reflect the varying availability of low cost generation from ace owned and purchased energy sources  and the corresponding unit prices of the energy sources used  as well as changes in the needs of other utilities participating in the pjm power pool 
the cost of energy is recovered from customers primarily through the operation of the lec 
excluding the effects of snjei discussed below  earnings generally are not affected by energy costs because these costs are adjusted to match the associated lec revenues 
in any period  the actual amount of lec revenue recovered from customers may be greater or less than the actual amount of energy cost incurred in that period 
such respective overrecovery or underrecovery of energy costs is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as a liability or an asset as appropriate 
amounts in the balance sheet are recognized in the consolidated statement of income within energy expense during the period in which they are subsequently recovered through the lec 
ace was underrecovered by million and by million at december  and  respectively 
the increase in is due to the combination of the election to defer recovery of million of recoverable fuel costs  lower than projected kilowatt hour sales and greater than projected purchased fuel as replacement for salem station generation 
as a result of implementing the southern new jersey economic initiative snjei  ace is forgoing the recovery of energy costs in lec rates in the amount of million and million for the and lec periods  respectively 
after tax net income has been reduced by million and million due to the effects of the initiative for and  respectively 
energy expense decreased in primarily due to the increase in underrecovered fuel costs  offset in part by the effects of the snjei referred to above 
in  energy expense increased due to the snjei and the increase in the levelized energy clause that reduced underrecovered fuel costs 
production related energy costs for decreased due to reduced generation 
the average unit cost of energy decreased to cents per kilowatt hour in compared to cents per kilowatt hour in production related energy costs for increased by due to increased overall generation and the high cost of energy from additional nonutility sources 
the cost per kilowatt hour was cents 
purchased capacity expense reflects entitlement to generating capacity owned by others 
purchased capacity expense increased and in and  respectively 
the increases reflect additional contract capacity supplied by nonutility power producers in each year 
operations expense decreased and in and  respectively 
these decreases reflect the benefits of ace s restructuring programs  initiated in and the decrease was offset in part by the additional costs associated with salem station restart activities 
net after tax savings approximated million in related to the workforce reduction recorded in employee separations throughout ace of approximately employees largely occurred on march  the original estimate of net after tax savings of million was based on a full year assessment 
maintenance expense decreased and in and  respectively  due to cost saving measures 
depreciation and amortization expense increased and in and  respectively  as a result of continued increases in ace s depreciable electric plant in service 
state excise taxes expense increased in due to an increase in the tax base used to calculate the tax in comparison to the tax base 
in  state excise taxes expense decreased relative to the higher tax assessment in federal income taxes increased in and decreased in as a result of the level of taxable income during those periods 
employee separation costs is the provision by ace in for the reduction of its workforce 
other net within other income expense decreased in due to the net after tax impacts of the write off of deferred nuclear study costs of million and the write down of the carrying value of asp s commercial property of million 
the litigation settlement for represents an additional allocation to customers of the proceeds from the settlement associated with the peach bottom station shut down in prior years 
interest on long term debt increased in due to increased amounts of debt outstanding during the year 
in  interest on long term debt decreased due to refunding of higher cost debt 
at december   and  ace s embedded cost of long term debt was  and  respectively 
preferred stock dividend requirements decreased and in and  respectively  as a result of continuing mandatory and optional redemptions 
embedded cost of preferred stock as of december   and was  and  respectively 
outlook over the next five years  aei will devote considerable resources to the development of energy related businesses and markets 
aee s business plan calls for additional investments of million 
aee s investment strategy will further its long term objectives of becoming a wholesale energy supplier and aggregator as well as a provider of energy services for its customers 
aee also expects to make additional investments in energy related technologies and services while continuing to pursue strategic business alliances and services that will support its growth and financial performance 
aee s business plan indicates a positive contribution to earnings in throughout this period  however  ace s utility business will continue to be the primary factor influencing the company s overall financial performance 
factors such as regional economic trends  abnormal weather conditions and inflation will continue to be important determinants of ace s financial performance 
however  continued competition from independent power producers and the anticipated deregulation of the electric utility industry are becoming the most critical strategic factors for ace 
fundamental changes in the industry have led to the emergence of significant competitive issues for ace  including heightened competition in the wholesale bulk power market  the growth of the independent power industry and the pressure to offer more competitive rates to customers 
ace is closely monitoring deregulation of the industry on both a state and federal level 
the federal energy regulatory commissions ferc on going rulemaking proceeding is proposing changes to rules governing transmission access and pricing 
ferc is also establishing guidelines for recovery of stranded costs and investments stemming from wholesale transactions 
in response to ferc s initiative  the power pool in which ace participates has proposed significant changes to its structure and operation 
state jurisdictions across the country  including new jersey  are closely examining the issues surrounding deregulation or are creating new regulations designed to foster a more competitive industry 
ace is playing an active role in the bpus on going energy master plan proceeding 
among other things  the proceeding is investigating the extent to which utilities  in a competitive environment  may be threatened with the inability to recover investments or long term commitments prudently made  and placed into rates under traditional ratemaking regulations 
to date  the bpu has made no formal policy pronouncement regarding deregulation or the recovery of stranded commitments 
in anticipation of heightened competition in energy markets  ace is pursuing a number of initiatives designed to strengthen its position in the marketplace 
the cost of ace s power supply  including the cost of power purchased from independent power producers  along with its retail prices are expected to be critical success factors in a competitive marketplace 
ace is focusing on cost and rate control measures as well as the development of new energy related products and services 
to allow for more flexibility and closer cost control  ace transferred its production operations to its subsidiary  deepwater operating company  on january  alternate pricing mechanisms and long term discount power contracts are being explored as a means of retaining key customers that are at risk of leaving ace s system 
while any such discounts are intended to have a long term beneficial impact  they could have a detrimental effect on ace s operating revenues and net income in the short term 
ace s net income and its levelized energy adjustment rates may be affected by the operational performance of nuclear generating facilities and a bpu mandated nuclear unit performance standard 
net income may also be affected by significant changes in the decommissioning costs associated with the nuclear units 
at this time  it is not known what impact there may be on future operations and financial condition associated with the uncertain status of salem station unit the electric utility industry continues to be capital intensive 
ace has lowered its planned construction budget to million for  with an expected reduction in its external cash requirements 
ace s ability to generate cash flows or access the capital markets to fund capital requirements will be affected by competitive pressures on revenues and net income  as well as regulatory initiatives and rate developments 
the fasb issued two new statements in statement no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and statement no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
both statements are effective for the company in statement no 
primarily concerns accounting for the impairment and disposal of property  plant and equipment 
statement no 
permits a fair value based method to account for stock based compensation as an alternative to the intrinsic value based method currently permitted 
the company currently employs stock based compensation which has not had a material impact on the financial statements 
the company has not yet fully assessed the impacts on its financial statements of the requirements of these new accounting standards 
inflation inflation affects the level of operating expenses and also the cost of new utility plant placed in service 
traditionally  the rate making practices that have applied to ace have involved the use of historical test years and the actual cost of utility plant 
however  the ability to recover increased costs through rates  whether resulting from inflation or otherwise  depends upon both market circumstances and the frequency  timing and results of rate case decisions
