factors that may affect future results the client server development tools market is characterized by rapid changes in technology and user needs 
compatibility of the company s products with customers preferred operating systems and database management systems are important to future results of the company 
the current market trend appears to be weighted towards building client server and cooperative applications using a changing mix of operating systems 
revenue from the company s enterprise client server tools area declined this past year 
products in this area accounted for of fiscal revenue  and the company expects demand for these products to remain flat or continue to decline 
this decline was more than offset by increased revenues from the company s new client server products 
because of the rapidly changing market  there is no assurance that this substantial growth will continue 
future operating results could be affected by the market s acceptance of the company s existing and new products in this rapidly changing market 
competition in the software development tools market is very intense 
new and established companies continue to develop and market competitive products 
principal factors affecting competition are product performance and functionality  compatibility with the customer s operating environment  ease of use  price and quality of customer support  documentation and services 
the company anticipates that it will continue to experience competition from current vendors and new firms entering the market 
the company markets and sells its products directly through its own operations in the united states  united kingdom  germany  france  belgium  japan and australia and through a network of dealer distributors in other countries 
consequently  the company s results are affected by changes in the global economies and foreign currency exchange rates 
although the company does not believe that its business is subject to seasonal variations  sales historically tend to be strongest during the fourth quarter of a fiscal year 
as a result  the company typically experiences lower revenues for the first quarter of a fiscal year than in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year 
the company s experience has also been that a major portion of its revenue is recognized during the last month of a fiscal quarter and that fluctuations in revenue and earnings may occur due to the timing of orders 
quarterly results therefore can vary to the extent that sales for a quarter are delayed  particularly since a large portion of the company s expenses do not vary with revenues

the company will continue to follow the guidance of apb inflation has not had a material effect on the past results of the company  however  there can be no assurance that the results of operations will not be affected in the future
