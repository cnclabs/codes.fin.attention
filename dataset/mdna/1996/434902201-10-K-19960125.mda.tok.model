the company also has a contingent liability to repay a portion of agency commission referral fees received principally from some lending institutions whereby the company referred customers to one or more third party financing sources and earned referral fees agency commissions if the lender consummated a loan contract with the customer 
in some cases the company is required to pay back chargeback a pro rata amount of the referral fee to the lender if the loan does not reach maturity for various reasons such as foreclosure  refinancing  or loan pay off  and only if the charge back amount exceeds reserves retained by the lender 
the company records commission income based upon the amount earned less allowances for chargebacks 
in determining the allowance  the company takes into consideration the total customer loans outstanding and estimates the exposure for potential chargebacks associated with these loans 
the company estimates the probability for loan pay offs and the potential chargebacks to the company related thereto 
the company also considers the current and predicted future economic conditions  the effects of changes in consumer interest rates and the aging of all it s customer loans outstanding representing potential chargebacks to the company 
the company s chargeback allowance was   and  as of the end of fiscal  fiscal and fiscal respectively 
chargebacks were    for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the  chargebacks in fiscal was primarily the result of negotiated settlements with third party financing sources reducing future chargeback potential 
management expects the current allowance for chargebacks to be sufficient to repay this contingency and does not expect the ultimate liability to have a significant impact on the liquidity of the company 
the company s board of directors  in fiscal  set specific strategic targets for the expansion and or diversification of the company s operations  primarily through acquisition  with the ultimate goal of increasing the company s value to its shareholders 
these targets  if obtained  will mostly likely require the company to seek additional capital 
since its initial public offering in the company has funded its expansion plan with internally generated cash  debt from financial institutions for flooring rvs  and a issuing limited amount of common stock 
the company s management is currently evaluating alternative sources of capital  its cost and its ultimate effect on the capitalization of the company 
the company currently has million maximum borrowing under floor plan contracts of which million was not used as of the end of fiscal in addition  the company has a million credit facility available for financing this expansion of dealership real property 
the company s management feels it can obtain additional debt financing at reasonable interest rates for expansion and or diversification of its operations 
currently management has no expansion or diversification prospects requiring a secondary stock offering or a conversion of the financing debt to common stock 
management does intend to continue to issue common stock and or options on common stock as a partial payment for acquisitions when cost effective 
however  management expects the dilutive effect on the common stockholders of the company resulting from issuing such common stock or options to be minimal 
management believes that during the next twelve months cash generated by operating activities  cash and cash equivalents on deposit with financial institutions and financing currently available from floor plan financing companies will be sufficient for its capital and operating needs for its existing operations 
results of operations results of operations for fiscal compared to fiscal sales and service revenue increased to million in fiscal from in fiscal primarily due to revenue from two rv dealerships acquired on august  sacramento and bakersfield  california

this increase  on a same store basis  compares favorably to the national rv shipment data  according to the recreation vehicle industry association rv business  january  reporting total rv unit shipments to dealers for the ten months ended october decreased 
even though this data is not totally comparable  it does indicate the company s change in rv sales were significantly better than the industries national average 
however  the company s total revenue decreased on a same store basis in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as compared to the same quarter of fiscal the company s management believes this decrease was the beginning of a trend whereby the company s revenue will follow more closely the national downward trend due to decreased consumer sentiment over concern about the national economy 
furthermore  the company s management believes this downward trend will extend at least through the first quarter of fiscal  unless the consumer confidence in the national economy increases

revenue from these two dealerships accounted for of the increase revenue in fiscal and fiscal revenue increased in all the company s markets resulting primarily from increased sales of both new and used recreational vehicles 
on a same store basis  a decease in new rv unit sales was offset by a increase in the average selling price  resulting in a net increase in revenue from the sale of new rvs 
the average selling price increase of new rvs resulted from the continuation of a shift in demand  beginning in fiscal  from lower priced towables to higher priced motorized 
used rv revenue increased  on a same store basis  as a result of a increase in unit sales and a increase in the average price of used rvs sold

inflation the company s management believes that increases in the cost of new vehicles and boats that may result from increases in inflation can be offset by higher resale prices for used retail vehicles and boats as well as higher retail prices for new vehicles and boats although there may be a lag in the ability of the company to pass such increases on to its customers 
historically  increases in operating costs are passed on to the consumer when the market allows 
the company s management believes that its business has not been significantly affected by inflation despite increased chassis and manufacture conversion costs experienced 
seasonality although the recreational vehicle business is a year round business in the southeastern united states and california  the recreational vehicle industry is seasonal 
the company has significantly higher sales in the second quarter of its fiscal year  and significantly lower sales in its first and fourth quarters 
during slack seasons at a particular dealership  the company reduces inventory of both new and used rvs and introduces other cutbacks in operations minimizing the impact of the seasonality on the results of operations 
because a substantial portion of the company s expenses are fixed  operating income tends to be lower in the first quarter and fourth quarter of the company s fiscal year and higher in the second and third quarters
