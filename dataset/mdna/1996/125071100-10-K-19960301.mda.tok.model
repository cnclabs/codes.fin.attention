conversely  in periods of decline in demand  operating results can deteriorate quickly because realization of cost savings typically lags implementation of downsizing and cost reduction programs

results of operations  year ended december  vs 
year ended december  consolidated revenues from continuing operations advanced over the prior year  and operating profit margins on revenues improved to from in technical services segment revenues  which in represented of the company s consolidated revenues  grew over the prior year 
operating profit margins for technical services were in compared with in the growth of revenues was due to strong demand in most of the industrial markets served by the segment 
revenues in the automotive and telecommunications markets were well ahead of a year ago  as were aircraft aerospace  electronics and power energy 
demand in the chemical petrochemicals markets  however  fell somewhat short of a year ago 
an important impetus for growth in technical services was a continued rise in and acceptance of the concept of outsourcing 
temporary services segment revenues  which in represented of the company s consolidated revenues  grew over the prior year 
operating profit margins for temporary services were in compared with in the segment improved its performance with better margins and cost containment following the integration of the old cdi temporary services branches into the todays operations network

inflation the technical services and temporary services business segments services are priced generally in close relationship with direct labor costs 
management recruiters middle management search services are priced as a function of salary levels of job candidates 
in recent years inflation has not been a meaningful factor 
liquidity and capital resources expansions and contractions in the levels at which the company s businesses operate directly affect consolidated working capital  which in turn has a direct relationship to total capital employed because of the high concentration of total assets represented by current assets 
working capital increased in primarily because of the higher levels of business at which the company was operating 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to as of december  and and to as of december  the company s main sources of liquidity have been from operations and from borrowings  including a revolving credit agreement and short term lines of credit with banks 
the revolving credit agreement provides for borrowings of up to million 
long term borrowings outstanding under all agreements at december  were million 
considering the most restrictive of the limitations placed on bank borrowings by the agreements  the available borrowing capacity to the company under the revolving credit agreement using borrowings outstanding as of december  was million 
these sources have been adequate to support growth opportunities in the company s businesses 
the consolidated ratio of long term debt to total capital long term debt plus shareholders equity was as of december  compared with as of december  and as of december current assets represent a high portion of consolidated total assets 
an important source of liquidity is the company s large current asset position with its concentration of highly liquid receivables 
this source could be tapped voluntarily by reducing the volume of business accepted  thereby turning a portion of working capital into cash 
similarly  when the company s business levels contract  such as during periods of economic decline  a portion of working capital is turned into cash 
the company believes that the public and private debt and equity markets would be currently available as sources of additional capital 
during  as it phases out and disposes of its discontinued operations  the company expects to realize net proceeds of approximately million 
to the extent that proceeds are realized in cash  the company intends to use such proceeds to pay down long term debt 
new accounting standards in march  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of statement  which requires companies to review long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held  used or disposed of  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company has adopted statement  which had no significant effect on the financial statements 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which is effective beginning in this statement encourages the fair value based method of accounting for stock options and similar equity instruments granted to employees 
this method requires that the fair value of equity instruments granted to employees be recorded as compensation expense 
however  the statement allows companies to continue to use the intrinsic value based method which  in most cases  does not result in a charge to earnings 
the company will not adopt the fair value based method of accounting for stock options 
however  if the fair value based method of accounting were applied to grants of stock options in  the effect would not be material
