net sales in the fourth quarter of were million excluding  in incremental deferred revenue recognized in the fourth quarter 
sales in the fourth quarter were lower by approximately million than the average of the prior quarters in  primarily as a result of lower sales of the company s methylprednisolone product 
net sales in the first quarter of are expected to be at a similar level as the fourth quarter of the company anticipates the sales level will increase in the second and third quarters of as a result of entering the seasonal high sales period for certain of its products and continued growth in sales of certain other products

the lower gross margin in compared to is attributable to the product sales mix and price erosion on certain of the company s products 
the gross margin in was favorably impacted by the recognition of million in deferred revenues 
the company generated a substantially lower gross margin in the fourth quarter compared to prior quarters in as a result of lower sales and product mix 
while gross margin in the first quarter of is expected to be similar to the fourth quarter of  gross margin in the second and third quarters of is expected to increase as a result of the expected increase in sales 
in  the increases in the company s gross margin were due primarily to increased sales of methylprednisolone along with the effects of higher overhead absorption due to volume increases and manufacturing efficiencies 
there can be no assurance that  with the company s current limited product line  the present gross margin levels can be maintained if the company s products  particularly methylprednisolone  should experience increased competition

other matters as noted above  a conscious decision was made in early to increase expenditures for manufacturing and other launch activities in anticipation of the approval of the company s conjugated estrogens product and to provide the additional personnel and capital resources needed to implement the company s business plan 
this planned investment in the future contributed substantially to increased expenses  and therefore reduced levels of performance  in the fourth quarter and the year ended december  this commitment has increased through the first quarter of which could result in a first quarter loss in excess of the reported loss for the fourth quarter of  exclusive of the charge pertaining to hallmark 
the company remains optimistic regarding the approval of its conjugated estrogens product 
however  management also recognizes the importance of balancing the needs between a strong product development commitment and conserving resources 
in keeping with this combined commitment  steps have been taken recently to implement operational changes consistent with these two corporate goals see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources

accordingly  in the fourth quarter of the valuation allowance was reduced and a million deferred tax benefit was recorded 
the carrying value of the deferred tax asset and the related valuation allowance are based on a forecast of future operating results  which excludes potential revenues associated with products that are under development or have not yet obtained regulatory approval 
full utilization of this million deferred tax benefit will require future taxable income of approximately million

liquidity and capital resources as explained in item business private placement of series c convertible preferred stock the company successfully raised million through an offering of series c preferred stock  of which the first million million net of issuance costs was received in november as a result  the company had a capital surplus of million at december  compared to a capital deficiency of million at december  the company s working capital situation also improved to a surplus of million at december  compared to a working capital deficiency of million at december  the company closed on the second stage of the private placement  which provided net proceeds of million  in february during the third and fourth quarters of  the company reorganized the terms of certain borrowing arrangements with its bank  which resulted in expanded borrowing capacity under the company s revolving credit facility and modified repayment due dates on the term note 
the amended terms of the revolving credit facility permit the company to borrow up to million  based upon eligible collateral  through march  when the principal balance is due 
the expressed intention of the company and its bank is to review quarterly the company s financial condition and  if appropriate  extend the due date of the revolving credit facility in order to maintain a fifteen month term 
the company made a million principal payment on its term note in december as amended  the million balance of the term note at december  required a principal payment of million on march   with the remaining million due on june  in february the company made the million term note principal payment due on march  under a separate agreement in march  the bank made available to the company an additional million of term financing collateralized by existing equipment 
at march  the company s borrowings on the revolving credit facility were million 
based on the eligible collateral value of million on that date  the company could borrow an additional million under this facility 
the current terms of the note payable to the state of ohio require a balloon payment of  in november the company s capital expenditures were million in and million in the majority of these expenditures relate to a project which commenced in to expand the company s manufacturing facility by approximately  square feet in order to meet the initial projected manufacturing requirements of its hrt products  primarily its anticipated conjugated estrogens products 
the facility expansion and related facility testing were completed in the second quarter of investment in facility and equipment with respect to the hrt facility is approximately million  approximately million of which was satisfied under the company s agreement with ortho mcneil see notes to consolidated financial statements note b 
the company funded the balance of the project with borrowings on its revolving credit facility 
operating activities in used approximately million in cash primarily as a result of an increase in accounts receivable associated with strong sales in the latter part of the fourth quarter and extended payment terms offered to certain customers 
inventory increased by approximately million  principally as a result of purchases of conjugated estrogens raw materials in anticipation of the commercial launch of the product 
as a result of a reduction in sales and continued expenditures associated with the anticipated commercial launch of conjugated estrogens the company recorded a net loss of million excluding the million reserve against amounts advanced to hallmark and the  incremental deferred revenue recognized in the fourth quarter in the fourth quarter of the company expects net sales in the first quarter of to be at a similar level as the fourth quarter of net sales in the second and third quarters of are expected to increase over the levels projected for the first quarter of  as a result of entering the seasonal high sales period for certain of the company s products and continued growth in sales of certain other products 
the company continues to prepare for the anticipated commercial launch of conjugated estrogens and  accordingly  is maintaining a higher level of operational and corporate infrastructure than would otherwise be required 
the company is monitoring the status of its conjugated estrogens application closely and continues to remain optimistic on ultimate approval of the product  however  approval is not assured 
pending approval of the product  management of the company is implementing steps designed to balance the merits of continued preparedness for the launch of conjugated estrogens with the resulting impact on the company s operating results and financial condition 
if the company receives approval from the fda for its anda filing for the 
mg 
strength of conjugated estrogens and this product is successfully manufactured and marketed  the resulting favorable financial impact is expected to be significant 
accordingly  the company s longer term operating plan is significantly impacted by this event 
if  however  conjugated estrogens is ultimately not approved by the fda  the company will incur certain write offs related to investments made to date in inventory and other pre launch activities  and provisions of certain of the company s contractual agreements would become applicable 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note b 
the company is currently pursuing several business development opportunities  which could result in additional products and profit contributions 
on a longer term basis  if invamed is ultimately successful with its verapamil sr product development pursuits  or the company is successful with certain of its other product development pursuits  the availability of these products could significantly improve the company s operating results 
again  success is not assured 
the company intends to increase its resource commitment to product development pursuits as its resources permit 
continued expansion of the company s product development efforts will necessitate capital investment in equipment and facility to provide the capabilities to produce the resulting products in commercial quantities 
while the company has not finalized the capital requirements related to its business plan  the resources required are significant 
to the extent the necessary capital is not available  either from operations or other sources  implementation of the company s plans will be restricted or delayed 
in addition  as described under results of operation operating expenses  the company s general and administrative expenses have increased as needed to support and execute the company s business plan and to address the requirements of the company s current and anticipated increased operating levels 
management recognizes the importance of both the future benefits from continuing these increased expenditures and the current necessity of conserving the company s resources 
accordingly  management is implementing steps designed to balance these dual concerns 
these steps will result in reductions in operating expenses pending approval of the company s conjugated estrogens products or success in other pending business development opportunities 
the need to balance the questions of spending for the future and conserving current resources may become even more significant if the company completes its acquisition of hallmark 
the company believes that hallmark s technical expertise and its capabilities with respect to advanced drug delivery systems will contribute significantly to the long term success of the company s product development program 
however  the only commercial product currently manufactured by hallmark is captopril 
with the highly competitive market conditions associated with this product  the company does not anticipate that captopril will make a significant contribution to sales or profits 
therefore  if the company proceeds with the hallmark acquisition and the company s revenue base is not enhanced by the approval and marketing of the company s conjugated estrogens product or through other products  the company expects that it will need to execute certain restructurings and other additional cost cutting efforts to curtail operating expenses in order to support the company s and hallmark s product development activities
