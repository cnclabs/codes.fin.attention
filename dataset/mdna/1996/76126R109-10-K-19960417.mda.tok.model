item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following section includes a discussion and analysis of the results of the company for the year ended december  and the period from april  commencement of operations through december  the discussion and analysis of the historical results of liberte for the years ended june   and and for the nine months ended march  are set forth in the excerpts from the annual report on form k of liberte for the fiscal year ended june  and the quarterly report on form q of liberte for the quarter ended march  attached as appendix i to this form k 
the company commenced operations on april  although there was a change in the control of the assets transferred to the company  in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position  financial reporting by entities in reorganization under the bankruptcy code  the company did not qualify to use fresh start reporting because the reorganization value of liberte s assets immediately before the confirmation of liberte s plan of reorganization was greater than the total of all post petition liabilities and allowed claims 
therefore  the company initially valued its assets at liberte s net carrying value 
the company has classified the swapped assets as defined in business background into four categories operating real estate properties  earning loans  non earning loans  and assets held for sale 
as of december   approximately in value of the company s real estate assets consisted of operating real estate properties 
liberte accounted for all of its foreclosed real estate as assets held for sale in accordance with the aicpa s statement of position  accounting for foreclosed assets sop 
the net cash activity from the foreclosed assets was recorded in liberte s statements of operations 
results of operations general the company s current objective is to maximize shareholder value through i actively managing its real estate and mortgage portfolio to optimize both cash flow and capital appreciation  ii selectively disposing of certain assets and iii acquiring interests in real property and mortgages offering superior profit potential 
the company believes that the market price of the common stock is trading at prices below market value of the company s assets net of its liabilities 
accordingly  the company has undertaken an analysis of its operating and financial activities to consider alternative strategies that  consistent with the objective of maximizing long term shareholder value  as indicated above  will increase the market price of the common stock 
strategies that the company may pursue would include  but would not be limited to  changes in the composition of the company s asset portfolio  business combinations  the disposition of significant portions of the company s assets  the sale of the company or the liquidation of the company 
the company has disposed of a portion of its current portfolio 
the future performance of the company s portfolio of assets will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  including the future performance of the real estate market  the availability of financing to prospective asset purchasers and to other factors beyond the company s control 
for these reasons  the results of the company s operations from period to period may not be comparable 
as a result of the impact of the consummation of liberte s plan of reorganization  including the retention by liberte of approximately of the net carrying value of its total assets upon its emergence from bankruptcy  the different accounting treatment for most of the real estate properties transferred to the company from liberte and the different debt structure of the company  the results of operations of the company are not comparable to the historical operations for liberte  therefore  such a comparison is not presented 
for a discussion of the historical operations of liberte  see appendix i to this form k 
year ended december  compared to the period april  commencement of operations through december  the net loss for the year ended december  decreased to  from  for the period from april  commencement of operations through december  primarily due to greater total revenues and the extraordinary gain resulting from purchases of interests in its senior debt for the year ended december   partially offset by greater total expenses for the year ended december  total revenues increased  for the year ended december   primarily due to an increase in revenues from its operating real estate properties of  this increase in revenues is due to the acquisition of three operating properties barrington hills  stuart square and vermont avenue  two of which were acquired in late december and one in february and because the prior period represents only nine months of operations 
investment income for the year ended december  decreased to  from  for the period ended december  primarily due to a lower amount of cash available for investment for the year ended december  total expenses increased  for the year ended december  as compared to the period ended december  notwithstanding that the period was three months longer than the period  total expenses increased primarily due to expenses associated with the three operating properties acquired in late and early  offset by a decrease in expenses of non income producing assets and general and administrative expenses 
notwithstanding that the period was three months longer than the period  general and administrative expenses decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the period ended december   primarily because the earlier period included  of non recurring costs incurred in connection with the start up of the company s operations  consulting fees paid to liberte under the consulting agreement which was terminated effective as of december  and the company s efforts to register the common stock 
the extraordinary gain of  in the current period is a result of the  face amount of senior debt that the company purchased for approximately  net of closing costs throughout the company monitors the value of its assets on a continuous basis to ascertain that the net carrying value of its assets reflect fair value based on current information available to the company 
accordingly  for the year ended december   the company recorded write downs of  relating to the impairment of value of mortgage loans  and assets held for sale 
for the period ended december  the company recorded write downs of  relating to the impairment of value of operating properties  mortgage loans  and assets held for sale 
such write downs were taken so as to reduce the net carrying value of these assets to amounts that in the company s judgement reflect fair value 
no independent appraisal of these assets has occurred or is contemplated 
since the determination of fair value is based on future economic events which are inherently subjective  the amounts ultimately realized may differ materially from the net carrying values as of december  and upon consummation of liberte s plan of reorganization on april   liberte s transferred to the company substantially all of its assets 
thus  the company began actively managing its portfolio of assets upon inception on april  this process of actively managing the portfolio has  in some cases  yielded improved market related information compared to that which was available at the time of the assumption of liberte s assets 
this information indicated that the fair value of certain assets was below their net carrying values 
in this regard  the events or changes in circumstances which occurred for the year ended december  and the period april  through december  that have given rise to the write downs for impairment indicated above include one or more of the following i in the case of operating properties  management considered any changes in occupancy or desirability of the property and the company s intended holding period  received information regarding sales or fair value information on comparable properties  and received non binding offers from interested buyers for certain properties  ii in the case of mortgage loans  management entered into negotiations and or agreements for payoffs or workouts on certain mortgages  received non binding offers for sale on certain mortgages or received new fair value information regarding the collateral  and iii in the case of assets held for sale  as a result of actively marketing such assets  the company has recorded write downs for impairment of asset value based on non binding offers received  sales prices of comparable properties and sales prices for partial sales of properties 
the portfolio of assets held for sale  excluding operating properties and mortgage loans under contract for sale  primarily consists of vacant  unimproved or partially improved  subdivided land which is typically sold off a few lots or parcels at a time 
consequently  as lots or parcels are sold  management adjusts the net carrying value of the remaining lots or parcels for each property to the lower of cost or fair value based on the sale prices of the lots or parcels sold 
no active  formal market exists for a majority of the company s portfolio of assets held for sale nor do these properties generate any cash flow 
consequently  the determination of fair value is extremely subjective
