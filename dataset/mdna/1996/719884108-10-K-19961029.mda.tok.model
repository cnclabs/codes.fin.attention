sales for fiscal year were lower than planned  resulting in higher inventory levels at july  the increased investment in inventory has reduced the company s borrowing availability on its revolving bank line of credit 
during the year  the company implemented programs to significantly reduce inventory levels through improved inventory management and improved sales from south america and the us in the third and fourth quarters

in december  the bank increased the line of credit from  to  increased the borrowing limit against eligible inventories from  to  and extended the term of the line of credit from may  to december  the revolving line of credit is used to fund operating expenses  product purchases and letters of credit for import purchases 
the line has a  sublimit for outstanding letters of credit 
the amount available to borrow at any one time is based upon various percentages of eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventories as defined in the agreement 
the credit facility is subject to certain financial tests and covenants 
at july   the company was in technical violation of a financial covenant relating to pico macom s bank line of credit 
this covenant restricts the maximum advances to affiliates by pico macom 
pico macom s bank has issued a waiver of this violation effective july  all other covenants relating to this line of credit were met as of july  management is confident that the bank line of credit will be renewed

to the extent that the company were unable to obtain such additional financing  it would be forced to restrict and or postpone its growth plans 
profitability of operations is subject to various uncertainties including general economic conditions and the actions of actual or potential competitors and customers 
the company s future depends on the growth of the cable tv market in the united states and internationally 
in the united states  a number of factors could affect the future profitability of the company  including changes in the regulatory climate for cable tv  changes in the competitive structure of the cable and telecommunications industries or changes in the technology base of the industry 
internationally  the company s profitability depends on its ability to penetrate new markets in the face of competition from other united states and foreign companies 
other impact of technological obsolescence the company s products are subject to technological obsolescence as government regulations  competition or the nature of the broadband communications industry could require changes in the current product lines 
the rapid changes in all sectors of the communications industry and the entry of new technology could significantly impact the sale of the company s products 
while management is not aware of any specific products  regulations or requirements that would create significant obsolescence in the next fiscal year  technological obsolescence could materially affect the operating results of the company in any fiscal period 
impact of inflation and changing prices although the company cannot accurately determine the precise effect of inflation  the company has experienced some increased costs of materials  supplies  salaries and benefits due to inflation 
the company attempts to pass on increased costs and expenses by increasing selling prices  when possible  and by developing more useful and economical products that can be sold at favorable profit margins 
foreign operations because a substantial portion of the company s products are purchased from vendors in taiwan  china  malaysia and thailand the far east  the company is subject to price increases imposed by those vendors to compensate for currency fluctuations 
during fiscal years through the us dollar generally maintained its purchasing power against the currencies of the countries from which the company purchases most of its products 
if the us dollar were to weaken  the company would consider setting price increases for its products 
continued weakening of the us dollar could cause the company to lose its competitive costing edge to us based manufacturers which could adversely affect operating results 
restrictive foreign government regulations or political instability could also materially affect the operating results of the company 
as discussed above  foreign economic and financial uncertainties could also materially affect sales levels to foreign customers which could materially affect the operating results of the company
