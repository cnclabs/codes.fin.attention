item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations industry trends and outlook the company experienced growth during fiscal year due to new products used in computer and communications applications 
the commercial semiconductor industry and the markets in which the company s products are used are characterized by rapid changes and short product life cycles 
the market for the company s military and aerospace products remains fiercely competitive 
the company plans to address these issues by focusing efforts on eliminating less profitable product lines and pushing new product development 
typical of the semiconductor industry  the company has experienced declines in average selling prices over the life of its product lines 
efforts to offset this decline include increasing units shipped  finding new applications for existing products and introduction of new products 
management will continue to take steps to offset the impact of declines in average selling prices  however  there is no assurance that these efforts will be successful 
the company also derives a significant amount of revenue from the sale of foundry wafers 
these wafers are generally purchased by manufacturers who package the individual silicon die in their products 
demand for these wafers can vary significantly based on demand for the manufacturer s finished product 
the foundry business is also very competitive  with other foundries offering similar services 
the revenue generated by this segment can vary significantly depending not only on macro trends within the semiconductor industry  but also on conditions at specific customers 
as previously disclosed the company expects that foundry revenue will decline in the first quarter of fiscal compared to levels in the fourth quarter of fiscal subsequent to the company s fiscal year end  there was a general downturn in the semiconductor industry due primarily to excess inventory in the personal computer market 
results of operations semtech posted record sales of million in fiscal year compared with million in fiscal and million in net income was  in compared to  in and  in the results of operations for the three years ended january  have been restated to reflect the pooling of eci 
sales sales for fiscal year increased over fiscal and over fiscal year the increase was primarily due to the increased shipment of analog semiconductor products used in commercial applications 
increased sales of the company s lines of linear regulators  transient voltage suppressors tvs  and foundry wafers represented a majority of the increased revenues 
sales of commercial semiconductors continued to increase in fiscal compared to prior periods 
sales of devices used in computer and peripheral applications represented about of total sales for the year 
communications applications represented  industrial applications  and foundry customers represented 
this mix is attributable to the company s acquisition of eci semiconductor and the development and marketing of new products for a diverse customer base 
for the year  sales to military and aerospace customers remained relatively flat in absolute dollars and decreased to approximately of total sales 
the company expects the military market will be flat or decline slightly in fiscal year the company has implemented a strategy for selective participation in the military market 
the asia pacific region continued to show increased demand for the company s products in fiscal a large portion of this demand was for devices used in computer applications 
sales to customers located in the asia pacific region were approximately of the total sales for all of fiscal  compared to in fiscal sales to european customers represented of fiscal s total sales compared to in fiscal the company would expect that sales to both the asia pacific and european regions will grow in absolute dollars as added investment in computer and communications equipment is forecasted for these regions 
orders new orders for fiscal year amounted to million 
the company s book to bill ratio for the year was 
semtech witnessed increases in the order rates for its lines of linear regulators and transient voltage suppressers tvs 
the company also experienced significant growth in the orders of foundry wafers 
foundry wafers are fabricated wafers that are sold to customers who then use the wafer to produce their own finished products 
linear regulators  which are used in powering applications  are designed to both regulate and drop output voltage levels 
tvs devices provide overvoltage protection to sensitive electronic circuits 
the company experienced limited success in booking orders for its line of dc to dc power converters 
orders from customers located in asia pacific continued to grow in fiscal the company was successful in identifying additional business opportunities with several suppliers of computer and telecommunications products 
bookings from asia pacific customers represented approximately of the total orders received in fiscal the entire asia pacific region has become strategically important for achieving additional new customers and increased order levels 
as was planned  semtech opened a branch office in taiwan to support sales and marketing effort in the region 
in the company took steps to improve both domestic and foreign direct and distribution sales coverage by reviewing and in some cases extending agreements with key distributors 
this improved coverage is expected to help unit sales of both military and commercial products 
the company ended fiscal year with million in backlogged orders compared to million and million at the end of fiscal years and  respectively 
a majority of the company s backlog is shippable within six months 
gross margin the company s gross profit margin for fiscal year improved to compared to in and in this increase was due to added shipments of higher margin devices  improved capacity utilization and improved production yields 
the company s overall gross margin continued to be adversely affected by margins received on products sold to military customers 
included in the cost of sales are certain expenditures for engineering costs and process development which the company considers to be production related 
gross margin improvement over time is dependent on the company s ability to develop and introduce higher margin commercial products  more fully utilizing capacity and achieving further yield improvements 
the company s strategic plan calls for the introduction of additional proprietary products  which tend to fetch higher margins than industry standard and custom parts 
management also intends to continue to pursue any available steps to improve manufacturing efficiencies 
these efforts are expected to be partially offset by a decline in the company s older product lines 
selling  general and administrative  and engineering costs related to selling  general and administrative  and engineering in were million  representing an increase of over the million in and an increase of over the million in the rise was due to across the board increases in research and development spending  the addition of several strategic marketing individuals  increased commission expense and variable compensation 
both sales and engineering costs increased due to the company s overall efforts to increase sales long term 
the specific areas in which semtech expended more resources were primarily sales  advertising  and engineering 
operating expenses were of net sales in versus in and in management expects expenses related to sales  general and administrative and engineering to increase in absolute dollar terms in fiscal year due to efforts to grow net sales 
interest and other expense in fiscal year  the company had interest expense of  compared to  in and  in the decline in interest expense is due to a lower average daily debt balance in fiscal compared to and semtech had net other expense of  in  which included  for costs associated with the acquisition of eci semiconductor   of interest income   loss on disposition of assets and  of miscellaneous expenses 
semtech had other income of  in  which included  of interest income and  of foreign currency transaction gains  partially offset by miscellaneous expense of  in fiscal  the company incurred net other expense of  which included foreign currency transaction losses totaling   of miscellaneous expenses that included the amortization of intangibles   loss on disposition of assets   in restructuring charges taken to reduce headcount in our corpus christi and scotland facilities and interest income of  the cost savings generated through the restructuring were originally estimated at  per quarter 
the actual savings have not differed materially from this original estimate 
income tax expense income tax expense for fiscal was  compared to  and  in and  respectively 
the effective tax rate was higher in than in due to increased revenues generated from california based operations and due to the utilization of r d credit and alternative minimum tax credit carry forwards during fiscal the annual tax rate for fiscal is expected to approximate the rate for fiscal as of fiscal year end  the company had  in deferred tax assets  which is net of related valuation reserves 
the valuation reserve has been established in accordance with sfas no 
financial condition during fiscal year  the company improved its financial condition 
semtech s working capital ratios  which measure the company s ability to meet its short term obligations are presented 
working capital beginning of year    end of year    increase decrease in working capital   working capital ratios the increase in working capital for fiscal was the result of  of cash generated by operations 
during fiscal  the company invested approximately million in capital equipment and approximately million in inventory to support its commercial product lines 
despite these investments and the repayment of debt  the company s net cash balance increased by million in fiscal semtech s working capital ratio increased to in from in and in the company maintains a credit facility with a financial institution for working capital and equipment acquisition 
this line provides up to million of credit and extends until august this arrangement is collateralized by the company s domestic assets and contains provisions regarding current ratios  debt to worth  and net worth 
during fiscal  the company borrowed  against this line  which was converted into a year note 
in october  the company entered into a four year term loan in the amount of  both loans were for the purchase of capital equipment and are collateralized by the related equipment 
the company s foreign subsidiary also maintains an overdraft credit line in the amount of  pounds sterling with a commitment from its bank to expand this line to  pounds sterling 
this line is based on a percentage of foreign assets and is guaranteed by the company 
no amounts were outstanding under the line at january  efforts by the company over the past several years to increase commercial semiconductor product sales have been effective 
new products have been introduced for such applications as computer and telecommunications equipment 
in order to develop  design and manufacture new products  the company has had to make significant investments over the past several years 
such investments  including the addition of several design and applications engineers  aimed at developing additional new products will continue 
semtech fully intends to continue to invest in those areas that have shown potential for viable and profitable market opportunities 
certain of these investments  particularly the addition of design engineers  will probably not generate significant payback in the short term 
the company plans to finance these investments with cash generated by operations  cash on hand  and borrowings from the company s credit facilities 
in an on going effort to grow the company and improve its long term financial position  the company has examined potential acquisitions 
although no agreements have been reached  the company will continue to investigate possible acquisitions that fit with the company s strategic plan 
if the company does choose to enter such a transaction  several forms of financing will be examined 
the leverage ratios presented below indicate the extent to which the company has been financed with debt 
total debt increased by  in fiscal year this increase was the result of a borrowing to finance certain capital equipment purchases  partially offset by regular principal payments and conversion of debentures 
existing debt services are supported by adequate cash flows from operations 
long term debt as a of total capitalization total debt as a of total capitalization total capitalization is defined as the sum of long term debt and shareholders equity 
during fiscal year  semtech purchases of new capital equipment were  these additions were made primarily to expand manufacturing capacity and improve efficiency 
funding for these purchases was made from the company s operating cash flows  cash reserves  and debt obligations 
management plans to make capital expenditures in fiscal to increase test  assembly and wafer fabrication capacity 
as of january   the company had approximately  of outstanding commitments for machinery and equipment purchases 
the company believes that current internal cash flows together with cash reserves and existing credit facilities are sufficient to support these capital expenditures 
accounts receivable days sales outstanding  calculated by annualizing fourth quarter results for and  improved to forty one days as of january  from forty seven days as of january  days sales outstanding are impacted by sales within europe at standard terms of sixty to ninety days 
inventory turns increased to as of january  from as of january  this increase was primarily due to the company s new products inventory which turned at a faster rate than the military inventory 
all inventory which is obsolete or in excess of one year s demand is fully reserved 
inflation inflationary factors have not had a significant effect on the company s performance over the past three fiscal years 
a significant increase in inflation would affect the company s future performance
