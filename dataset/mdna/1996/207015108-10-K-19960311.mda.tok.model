management continues to believe that any future impact inflation might have on operating expenses will be partially offset by customer growth and by general rate increases to the extent necessary to maintain reasonable earnings 
the company has continued to invest in the future of the telecommunications industry through the ownership of the publicly traded stock of other telecommunication companies 
during the company s total investment in these publicly traded stock grew due to unrealized appreciation of such stock 
the current market value item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued of such investment is  
although the company currently plans to retain such stock as investments  it is a source of liquidity should the need arise

with the acquisition of bvt it will be able to achieve greater economies of scale and expand its service area over a substantially greater area 
formation of conestoga wireless company and pcs bidding in march  the company and infocore  inc infocore formed conestoga wireless company cwc 
the company owns and infocore owns  of cwc 
cwc is bidding in the fcc auctions for personal communication services pcs bandwidth 
pcs is a wireless communications service based on lower power and a higher frequency bandwidth than cellular service 
pcs is anticipated to be more reliable  of better quality and less expensive than cellular 
the service areas for which cwc is bidding include the reading  lancaster  pottsville  stroudsburg  and sunbury basic trading areas 
these auctions may not be completed until the second quarter of management does not know at this point whether cwc will be the successful bidder for any of the aforementioned service areas 
the company anticipates that  if it is successful in the bidding process  it would be able to fund its share of the cost of the pcs licenses out of current earnings  but it would have to obtain financing from outside sources to fund its share of the development of the pcs system

at december   for example  the company had approximately million of long term debt outstanding as compared to approximately million item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued of common equity 
this resulted in a ratio of debt to equity 
in connection with the acquisition of bvt  and pcs licenses  the company could incur significant amounts of debt and preferred stock 
although a higher level of debt and preferred stock is not unusual in the telephone utility industry  the additional debt and preferred stock may have important consequences on the company s future operations  including i the company will incur significant interest expense  and have significant preferred stock dividend and principal repayment obligations  ii the company will be subject to significant unscheduled preferred stock redemption obligations because the preferred shares issuable in the acquisition may be put by the holders thereof beginning two years after the effective date thereof  iii the company s increased leverage may make it more vulnerable to economic downturns and reduce its flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions  and iv payment of dividends on the company s common shares  may be restricted by the level of financial resources needed to service the company s additional debt and preferred stock 
regulated industry conestoga telephone company ctt is subject to a rate making process regulated by the pennsylvania public utility commission puc called rate base rate of return 
in the puc issued a show cause order against ctt  which was an investigation into the rates of the company to determine whether its earnings were excessive under this form of regulation 
during an agreement between the puc and the ctt was reached 
ctt agreed i to provide its customers with touch tone service free of charge  ii not to increase rates for three years  iii to provide certain dialing areas with an optional extended area service plan 
the puc agreed not to file a show cause order concerning rates and earnings for a period of three years 
this agreement affects the revenues  prices and earnings of ctt as reflected throughout this form k 
increased income can only be achieved through increased customers  greater volume of traffic on the network and through control of its expenses 
an amendment to the pennsylvania public utility act passed in  provides for streamlined rate regulation and a method for determining rates other than the rate base rate of return regulation and procedures 
this new regulation referred to as chapter  provides a price stability mechanism in which a telephone company s annual revenues from non competitive services may be permitted to change in line with the gross domestic product price index  minus  with no limitation on earnings by the regulated company 
in order to avail itself of the procedures permitted by chapter  ctt must commit itself to provide universal broadband services by as of yet  ctt has not determined the full effects of such a pricing mechanism 
therefore ctt has not availed itself of the alternate pricing procedures 
the telecommunication industry continues to undergo fundamental changes  which may have a significant impact on financial performances 
the recently passed federal telecommunications act  while apparently lifting the ban on cross ownership between cable and telephone companies in communities served by the local telephone company  opens the local telephone company s market to new competitors providing local exchange service 
management recognizes that there will be substantial competitive pressure within the local loop from many players 
it also believes that competition will bring many new opportunities for the local exchange companies 
management is endeavoring to position the company to take advantage ofthese opportunities as they arise  and remains optimistic about the future
