table games drop at the sands did not change significantly for the year ended december  compared with and decreased million 
for the year ended december  compared with the sands slight decrease in drop during compares with an increase of in table drop for all other atlantic city casinos during the same period 
as a result  the sands table game market share expressed as a percentage of the atlantic city industry aggregate table game drop decreased to during from in the sands table game drop decrease is largely attributable to an increase in competitive pressures in the rated table market segment  of which a significant portion is in the high end and mid market segments 
such decreases have been partially offset by increases in the unrated table segment 
the decrease in table drop compares with an increase of 
in table drop for the overall atlantic city industry during the same period 
consequently  the sands table game market share declined slightly to from during as a result of the grand opening on july   the number of table games  excluding poker  increased significantly and table games were made more accessible to casino patrons 
these changes resulted in table drop for the final six months of exceeding table drop for the same period of by million 
this improvement could not  however  completely mitigate the million decrease in table game drop experienced prior to july a number of factors adversely affected the first six months table games performance including i the relocation of many blackjack tables to a less accessible temporary gaming space during construction and the periodic closing of selected tables on the main casino floor as construction neared completion  ii the severe winter weather during the first quarter  particularly on weekend periods which generally affect the sands to a greater degree than its competitors since the sands caters to premium table players who concentrate their visits over weekend periods  iii the overall trend in the atlantic city marketplace towards slot machine play and iv competitive pressures  particularly in the high end table patron segment 
slot machine handle increased million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  compared with the previous years 
the sands slot machine handle increases compare with and increases  respectively  in slot machine handle for all other atlantic city casinos during the same periods 
although the sands increase in the average number of slot machines during was comparable to the overall atlantic city industry increase  the sands increase in slot machine handle lagged the increase in handle for all other atlantic city casinos 
during the second quarter of  the sands discontinued certain marketing programs and promotions particularly slot promotions which included cash giveaways which management deemed to be only marginally profitable 
this strategy worked well during the second quarter  however  entering the peak summer season  many of the sands competitors increased such spending programs and the sands lost market share in the highly profitable mass market segment 
the increase in the average number of slot machines at the sands during compared with was  compared to the atlantic city industry increase of 
the sands slot handle increase lagged both its own capacity increase and the average industry handle increases due to the construction related factors mentioned above as well as to a decrease in the number of bus patrons during the first six months of marketing efforts implemented for the grand opening were continued through the remainder of and resulted in overall increases in bus patrons of versus a decline of for the atlantic city industry and in cars parked of for the year compared to the increase in slot handle during the last six months of of reflects both the expansion of gaming space and the introduction of new slot machines operated at a higher payback percentage  which encourages extended patron play 
the sands loss of market share in table game drop and slot machine handle during is also a direct result of significantly increased competition from a number of casinos in atlantic city which completed significant expansion projects and mounted aggressive marketing campaigns during this period 
similarly  during  the sands incurred significant marketing and advertising expenditures associated with the opening of its expanded gaming facility on july  such expenditures primarily impacted slot machine handle from the infrequent mass market customer and resulted in record levels of gross wagering during the third quarter of  which could not be sustained in revenues casino revenues at the sands  including poker and simulcast horse racing wagering revenues  increased by million for the year ended december  compared with casino revenues during the second quarter of included the recognition of approximately million resulting from the reversal of certain progressive jackpot liabilities  the exclusion of such amount from revenues results in a more comparable increase in casino revenues of 
casino revenues were also negatively impacted by decreases in both the table games and slot machine hold percentages at the sands during compared to during  casino revenues at the sands increased by million compared with the revenue increases result from the expansion of gaming space as demonstrated by the aforementioned increases in slot machine and table games gross wagering during the second half of the year of and  respectively 
the impact on revenue of such volume increases was enhanced by improved hold percentages on table games  but diminished by a decline in slot machine hold percentages  such a decline is consistent with the competitive trend in atlantic city towards lower slot hold percentages 
table games benefited from improved table hold percentages and other casino revenues benefited from increases of million in poker revenues during compared to as a result of a full year of poker operations poker commenced at the sands during june  from improved simulcast revenues and from the introduction in of keno

departmental expenses casino expenses at the sands increased million during and million during compared with the prior years 
higher operating costs during the first half of resulted primarily from increased casino patronage at the expanded sands facility 
the increased costs were most apparent during the first quarter of  which saw a million increase compared to the first quarter of higher operating costs were substantially offset during the remainder of by decreases in marketing programs as previously discussed and by other cost containment measures implemented by management 
the increase was primarily due to higher operating costs during the second half of the year as a result of increased casino patronage at the expanded sands facility 
in addition  marketing costs preparatory to the grand opening  including the implementation of an aggressive mass marketing strategy and direct costs of approximately million  contributed to the increase 
rooms expense increased  and  during and compared with the prior years reflecting both improved occupancy at non casino properties as well as increased operating costs at the sands during the last six months of costs associated with patronage increases subsequent to the grand opening offset lower costs at the sands earlier during the year which resulted primarily from inclement weather during the first quarter of food and beverage expense decreased  during compared with and increased slightly by  during compared with increased costs associated with the third quarter opening of the epic buffet were offset by increases in food and beverage complimentaries allocated to the casino department

in addition  phc earned interest income during on the underlying indebtedness of a noncasino hotel which it had previously sold  such indebtedness was repaid during the third quarter of interest expense did not change significantly during either or from prior years 
income tax benefit provision phc and its subsidiaries have tax net operating loss carryforwards nol s totaling approximately million after reduction for approximately million used by hcc in  of which approximately million do not begin to expire until the year additionally  phc and its subsidiaries have various tax credits available totaling approximately million  many of which expire by the year in the first quarter of  phc adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the new standard requires that the tax benefit of such nol s and credit carryforwards be recorded as an asset and  to the extent that management can not assess that utilization of such nol s is more likely than not  a valuation allowance should be recorded 
due to losses sustained for both financial and tax reporting by phc and its subsidiaries through  management was unable to determine that realization of that asset was more likely than not and  thus  provided valuation allowances for the entire deferred tax asset for all periods presented
