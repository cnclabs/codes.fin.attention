cost of sales fiscal compared to fiscal as a percent of net sales  cost of sales other than depreciation and amortization increased to percent in fiscal from percent in the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributed to the decline in steel selling prices mentioned previously  elevated cost of fifo inventories charged to cost of sales due to production curtailments at the company s rebar merchant facilities in the first three quarters of the year and an increase in raw material billet costs at the company s high quality rod production facilities 
at the company s mini mill facilities  the cost to convert scrap into finished steel products rose modestly in fiscal to approximately per ton  compared with per ton for fiscal the increase was primarily the result of production curtailments to reduce inventory levels 
the company also experienced a transformer failure at the birmingham  alabama facility in the second quarter which contributed to the rise in conversion cost

compliance with environmental laws and regulations the company is subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning  among other matters  waste water effluents  air emissions and furnace dust disposal 
company management is highly conscious of these regulations  and supports an ongoing capital investment program to maintain the company s strict adherence to required standards 
the company has been advised by the virginia department of waste management of certain conditions involving the disposal of hazardous materials at the company s norfolk  virginia property which existed prior to the company s acquisition of the facility 
the company has also been notified by the department of toxic substances control dtsc of the environmental protection agency of the state of california of certain environmental conditions regarding its property in emeryville  california 
the company has performed environmental assessments of these sites and developed work plans for remediation of the properties for approval by the applicable regulatory agencies 
the company has received approval by dtsc for its remedial action plan for the emeryville site and is currently implementing the plan 
as part of its ongoing compliance and monitoring programs  the company is voluntarily developing work plans for environmental conditions involving certain of its operating facilities and properties which are held for sale 
based upon the company s study of the known conditions and its prior experience in investigating and correcting environmental conditions  the company estimates that the potential cost of these site restoration and remediation efforts may range from  to  approximately  of these costs is recorded in accrued liabilities at june  the remaining costs principally consist of site restoration and environmental exit costs to ready the idle facilities for sale see note to the consolidated financial statements  and have been considered in determining whether the carrying amounts of the properties exceed their net realizable values 
these expenditures are expected to be made in the next one to two years  if the necessary regulatory agency approvals of the company s work plans are obtained 
though the company believes it has adequately provided for the costs of all known environmental conditions  the applicable regulatory authorities could insist upon different and possibly more costly remediative measures than those believed by the company to be adequate and in accordance with existing law 
except as stated above  the company believes that it is currently in compliance with all known material and applicable environmental regulations 
impact of inflation the company has not experienced any material adverse effects on operations in recent years because of inflation  though margins can be affected by inflationary conditions 
the company s primary cost components are ferrous scrap  high quality semi finished steel billets  energy and labor  all of which are susceptible to domestic inflationary pressures 
finished product prices  however  are influenced by nationwide construction activity  automotive production and manufacturing capacity within the steel industry 
while the company has generally been successful in passing on cost increases through price adjustments  the effect of steel imports  severe market price competition and under utilized industry capacity has in the past  and could in the future  limit the company s ability to adjust pricing
