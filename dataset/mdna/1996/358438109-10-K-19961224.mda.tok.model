the capital required to fund this expansion  principally to finance inventory  fixtures and leasehold improvements  is estimated to be million and is intended to be provided by the company s lines of credit 
seasonality the company has in the past experienced a well defined seasonality in its business with respect to both total revenues and profitability 
generally  the company experiences substantially increased sales volume in the days preceding major holidays  including christmas  valentine s day and mother s day 
due to the impact of the christmas shopping season  the company experiences the strongest results of operations in the first quarter of its fiscal year 
if for any reason the company s sales were below those normally expected for the first quarter  the company s annual results could be materially adversely affected 
the seasonality of the company s business puts a significant demand on working capital resources to provide for an inventory buildup for the christmas season 
furthermore  the christmas season typically leads to a seasonal buildup of customer receivables that are paid down during subsequent months 
however  to the extent that the company s expansion program continues  it can be expected that increased levels of accounts receivable related to such expansion may affect the historical seasonal decline in customer receivables 
inflation the impact of inflation on the company s operating results has been moderate in recent years  reflecting generally lower rates of inflation in the economy and relative stability in the prices of diamonds  gemstones and gold 
substantially all of the leases for the company s retail stores located in malls provide for contingent or volume related rental increases 
in prior years  the company has been able to adjust its selling prices to substantially recover increased costs 
while inflation has not had  and the company does not expect that it will have  a material impact upon operating results  there is no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future

 accounting for stock based compensation  which requires that an employer s financial statements include certain disclosures about stock based employee compensation arrangements regardless of the method used to account for them 
this statement is effective for transactions entered into in fiscal years that begin after december  therefore  the company does not intend to change its method of accounting for stock based employee compensation arrangements and will include the required disclosures in the financial statements for the year ending september
