at the beginning of fiscal  the company changed its method for reporting comparable store sales 
under the new method  a comparable store is one that has been open fifteen full months full weeks and which doesn t have a store within four miles of it that has been open less than twelve full months full weeks 
the prior method treated a store as a comparable store when it was open a full fiscal year 
the new method is intended to eliminate the effect the sales transfer effect on an existing store s sales that can occur when a new store is opened within four miles of a store that has been open more than full months 
fifteen full months was selected as the period when a new store should be tracked as a comparable store because it is the earliest uniform time a store has sales in both the current and prior year  and the prior year sales is not distorted because of the grand opening promotions which occur during the first one to three months the store is open 
based on historical experience  and subject to certain exceptions  the company believes that a sales transfer effect typically occurs within a radius of approximately four miles
