gross margins were million in  an increase of or million from the increase was due to higher sales volume offset slightly by a lower gross margin rate 
the gross margin rate decreased to in from in due mainly to three factors 
first  tooling and packaging design costs were a higher percent of revenues in as compared to in support of the company s expanded product line 
second  international sales as a percentage of worldwide revenues were higher in compared to the company s gross margin on international sales is significantly lower than domestic sales because international prices are lower as the customer is responsible for the cost of importing  promoting and reselling the product 
third  sharp price increases on plastics and packaging materials occurred in the third and fourth quarters of such cost increases occurred too late in the year for the company to be able to pass on cost increases through product price increases 
these three factors reducing the gross margin rate were partially offset by the elimination of duty on toys imported into the united states 
advertising and promotion expenses were million or of net revenues in as compared to million or of net revenues in the decrease in advertising and promotion expenses as a percent of net revenues was a result of higher marketing efficiencies domestically  coupled with the effects of the higher sales growth rate internationally where the company s distributors absorb their own advertising costs

in management s opinion  other than the sharp price increases on plastics and packaging materials noted above  general inflation did not have a material impact on the company s business in the company did not implement any substantial price increases in or on continuing product lines 
the toy industry is affected by changing consumer tastes  shifting cultural and demographic trends and general economic conditions 
consequently  the company s results are dependent  in large part  on management s experience in the toy industry and its ability to identify and capitalize on current trends and market new products in a timely and efficient manner 
the company may not always be able to anticipate changes in consumer demand or to respond quickly to such changes once they are identified  and such inabilities could have an adverse impact on the company 
historically  a relatively small number of items have contributed a large portion of the company s revenues in each year 
a decrease in popularity of a particular item during any year could have a material adverse impact on revenues and profits for that year 
the company s strategy emphasizing multi year extendable brands is intended to mitigate such adverse impacts 
the company does not carry insurance for political  social or economic unrest or disruption for several reasons  including  but not limited to  costs of such insurance and the limited insurance coverage available 
the impact on the company from such unrest or disruption would depend on general factors  including  but not limited to  the nature  extent and location of such unrest or disruption and the company s ability to procure alternative manufacturing sources outside of the country involved  retrieve its tooling  relocate its production in sufficient time to meet demand  and pass cost increases likely to be incurred resultant from above through to the company s customers as product price increases 
the company s products are produced principally in china  which currently is designated with mfn status by the united states 
this allows products imported into the united states from china to be accorded the most favorable import duties 
in late  congress approved the gatt uruguay round  which allows imports into the united states of toy merchandise with unconditional duty free entry from any nation with mfn status 
generally  the trade negotiations between china and the united states have been difficult  but both sides have shown their willingness to resolve trade disputes and avoid punitive sanctions 
punitive sanctions could result in the united states imposing higher duties on selective chinese made products imported into the united states these sanctions would be put in place through section of the trade act of  as amended 
in the past  section sanctions proposed by the united states did not include sanctions or punitive damages against toy imports from china 
as such  the company would be unaffected 
the loss of mfn status for china  however  would result in a substantial imported into the united states 
this increase in duty would be large enough that it could materially affect the company s business 
products shipped from china to other countries should not be affected 
other toy companies also source product from china and would be affected to similar degrees 
however  the impact on the company from any significant change in duties on its chinese produced product would depend on several factors including  but not limited to  the company s ability to procure alternative manufacturing sources outside of china  retrieve its tooling located in china  relocate its production in sufficient time to meet demand  and pass cost increases likely to be incurred resultant from above through to the company s customers as product price increases 
in  certain quotas on chinese produced toy products were introduced in the european economic community 
these quotas did not have a material impact on the company s business in and are not expected to have a material impact in the foreseeable future
