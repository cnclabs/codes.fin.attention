the first and fourth quarters historically have contributed approximately and  respectively  of the company s annual net sales 
the acquisitions of heath and mcdougal have not materially changed the seasonal nature of the company s net sales 
the revenue seasonality also affects the company s operating cash flow 
a net cash deficit from all the company s activities is normally incurred through the middle of the third quarter 
this deficit is funded through the draw down of cash and marketable securities  supplemented by short term borrowings  principally commercial paper 
in october  the company acquired heath  a leading publisher of elementary  secondary  and college educational products  for million in net cash  including investment advisory and other third party costs

the company has pledged up to million shares of inso corporation common stock as the collateral for the redemption of the exchangeable notes sails due  that were issued in august at maturity  the principal amount of each sails will be mandatorily exchanged for a number of shares of inso common stock  or at the company s option  cash with an equal value 
the number of shares which could be issued in exchange will be dependent on inso s market share price at the time of the redemption 
the company will record as additional non cash interest expense  over the life of the sails  the excess of the current inso stock price over the maximum redemption price at maturity 
the additional non cash interest expense to be recorded through august  based upon inso s december  stock price  is million 
if the company chooses to redeem the sails with shares of inso common stock  it would record a gain representing the excess of the redemption amount over the book value of the company s investment in inso 
the company s ownership percentage of inso after this redemption would be less than 
the remaining non pledged inso shares may be sold by the company  subject to certain restrictions  as market conditions and events warrant 
the company had million in short term borrowings outstanding at december  there were no short term borrowings outstanding at december  average short term borrowings increased in primarily due to million in commercial paper financing for the heath acquisition  the increase in seasonal borrowing needs as a result of including a full year of operations for mcdougal  and the incremental impact of funding heath operations for the final two months of average short term borrowings increased in compared to primarily due to the bridge financing of million for the mcdougal acquisition  higher seasonal borrowing requirements  and the early redemption in march and june of million of senior notes which were scheduled to mature in and  respectively 
the company financed the march redemption of the senior notes with a combination of the inso dividend and operating cash

at december   the company s debt including the short term borrowings for the heath acquisition was million as compared with million discounted value million at the end of the company s percentage of debt to total capitalization debt plus stockholders equity was at the end of as compared to at the end of the increase in the percentage is principally due to the million in commercial paper and bank financing which partially funded the heath acquisition  and the million sails issuance 
the capitalization percentage at december  decreases to excluding the short term borrowings 
the company s cash and marketable securities position at the end of was million  compared to million at the end of net cash from operations in decreased million from  primarily due to the increase in inventories and the additional seasonal operating losses from the acquisition of heath

the company s financing activities contributed million in  million in  and required million in the increase in financing sources in was a result of the incremental borrowings of million used to finance the heath acquisition and the million sails issuance 
financing activity outflows in included million less to repurchase stock than in the increase in financing sources included proceeds from the notes 
financing activity outflows in included million to retire debt and the repurchase of million more common stock than in in  the company continued the reorganization of certain administrative and corporate functions begun in  culminating in the actions resulting in the special charges taken in the second quarter of  first quarter of  and the second quarter of related to workforce changes and distribution consolidation and outsourcing 
these actions  as well as other measures taken over the past four years  are expected to continue to reduce costs and increase efficiency 
the company remains committed to further investment in new technology and enhancement of existing technology now used in the publishing process 
these efforts are expected to yield further operating and publishing cost savings  as well as to free up capital to pay down debt and to invest in new product development 
the company believes that its cash and marketable securities position  along with funds generated from operating activities and borrowing facilities  will be sufficient to meet total cash requirements for the foreseeable future  including the refinancing of the borrowings from the heath acquisition 
the periodic use of the short term debt market  primarily commercial paper  for seasonal liquidity needs will continue 
the average seasonal borrowings in are expected to be higher than undertaken over the past three years due in part to the addition of heath s seasonal operations 
impact of inflation and changing prices although inflation is currently well below that of prior years  which has benefited recent company results  particularly in the area of manufacturing costs  there are offsetting costs 
the company s ability to adjust selling prices always has been limited by competitive factors and long term contractual arrangements which either prohibit price increases or limit the amount by which prices may be increased 
the combination of a weak domestic economy and low inflation results in lower tax receipts at the state and local level  which adversely affects the funding and buying patterns for textbooks and other educational materials 
in  the company started to experience higher prices for paper goods which continued into although there has been some softness in recent prices for certain paper products  the company anticipates that the trend to higher prices will continue as the demand for high quality paper continues to outpace the available supply 
the most significant company investments affected by inflation include book plates  other property  plant  and equipment and inventories 
the last in  first out lifo method is used to value substantially all inventory and  therefore  the cost of inventory charged against income approximates replacement value 
the incremental replacement cost expense amounted to million in as compared with 
million in the company s publishing business does not require a high level of investment in property  plant  and equipment 
such net assets represented of consolidated assets at december  the company s net investment at the end of in capitalized book plates for educational and reference works represented approximately of total assets 
the company continues to commit funds to new publishing areas through both acquisitions and internal growth 
management believes that by valuing its inventory using the lifo method  continuing to emphasize technological improvements  and quality control  the company can continue to moderate the impact of inflation on its operating results and financial position
