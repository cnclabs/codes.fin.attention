while it is possible that the company may incur similar losses on its remaining purchase commitments under the supply agreement see note to the consolidated financial statements  the company does not consider such losses probable  nor can the amount of any loss which may be incurred in the future presently be estimated due to a number of factors  including but not limited to potential increased demand for oncaspar from rpr  expansion into additional markets outside the us and the possibility that the company could renegotiate the level of required purchases 
if the company does not achieve increases in sales of oncaspar beyond current levels or cannot renegotiate its commitment  a loss would be incurred on the remaining purchase commitment

to date  the company s sources of cash have been the proceeds from the sale of its stock through public and private placements  sales of adagen  sales of oncaspar  sales of its products for research purposes  contract research and development fees  technology transfer and license fees and royalty advances 
the company s current sources of liquidity are its cash  cash equivalents and interest earned on such cash reserves  sales of adagen  sales of oncaspar  sales of its products for research purposes and license fees 
management believes that its current sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash requirements  based on current spending levels  for approximately the next two years 
upon exhaustion of the company s current cash reserves  the company s continued operations will depend on its ability to realize significant revenues from the commercial sale of its products  raise additional funds through equity or debt financing  or obtain significant licensing  technology transfer or contract research and development fees 
there can be no assurance that these sales  financings or revenue generating activities will be successful 
in management s opinion  the effect of inflation on the company s past operations has not been significant
