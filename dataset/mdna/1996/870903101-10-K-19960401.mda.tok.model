item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following table sets forth certain information about the company s two business segments 
year ended december  of of of amount sales amount sales amount sales dollar amounts in thousands sales environmental products and services    textile chemical specialties    total    cost of sales environmental products and services    textile chemical specialties    total    gross margin environmental products and services    textile chemical specialties    total    operating expense environmental products and services    textile chemical specialties    total    operating income environmental products and services    textile chemical specialties    total    compared to operations sales for improved by compared to  the result of increases in the environmental products and services segment and the textile chemical specialties segment of and  respectively 
the environmental products and services segment experienced sales growth in the ion exchange  specialty polymer and biochemicals product lines 
ion exchange resins sales increased due to improved business activity in the industrial resin product line 
however  as in  average selling prices declined by because of continued market competition and resin overcapacity 
market share remained flat 
sales of specialty polymers jumped due to higher selling prices and a substantial increase in business in the toners product line 
biochemical product line sales increased due to increases in the average selling price  initial revenues gained from a land farming bioremediation project for a major us oil company  and improved industrial  municipal and foreign sales volumes 
reverse osmosis membrane product line sales remained relatively flat year to year 
sales in the textile chemical specialties segment increased substantially in both the america and europe divisions 
the america textile chemical business increased due to the acquisition of the auralux corporation in january  the full year effect of the july acquisition of the cnc international textile chemical business  and improved sales of liquid for solid  preparation  garment finishing and carpet products 
overall quantities sold increased 
however  average selling prices declined by due to product mix and competitive pricing to maintain existing business 
the europe division s textile chemical sales increased in us dollars and in terms of local currencies 
physical volume increased due to greater market penetration  primarily in belgium  france  germany and turkey 
average selling prices in terms of dutch guilders and excluding year to year currency fluctuations increased slightly 
us organic chemical product line sales improved due to increased average selling prices combined with additional custom distillation and flaking business 
gross margin for equaled versus in as both segments showed year to year declines 
the environmental products and services segment gross margin was as compared with in margins in the ion exchange and specialty polymers product lines dropped due to substantial increases in the cost of several major raw materials  particularly styrene  and overall selling price decreases  partially offset by favorable manufacturing variances and cost control measures 
an unfavorable product mix resulted in a drop in the biochemical product line gross margin 
production yield improvements and lower costs for a major raw material combined to improve the reverse osmosis membrane product line margins which more than offset an average selling price decrease 
the textile chemical specialties segment gross margin dropped to from s level of 
the america textile chemical division gross margin fell due to an unfavorable product mix  particularly in the finishing product line  increased raw material costs and lower average selling prices 
these negatives were somewhat offset by lower freight costs  better manpower utilization and productivity improvements 
the europe textile chemical division margins declined due to the weakness of the lire in italy  the company s largest market in europe  and increased us dollar translated costs relating to the strong guilder in the netherlands  where manufacturing costs are incurred 
also impacting the european margin were higher raw material costs which were only partially offset by slight increases in average selling prices 
the organics product line margin improved in over due to product mix and increased average selling prices which more than offset higher raw material and manufacturing costs 
operating expenses as a percentage of sales for the year improved slightly to as compared to last year s as both of the company s segments continued with cost control measures while sales remained on the upswing 
operating expenses as a percent of sales in the environmental products and services segment were as compared with in similarly  in the textile chemical specialties segment  operating expenses were of sales versus last year 
income taxes and other items the company s provision for income taxes was computed using applicable prevailing income tax rates 
the company s effective tax rate of for increased over last year s rate of 
this increase was the result of the company earning more of its income in jurisdictions with higher tax rates  such as mexico  canada and japan  and certain purchase accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of the common stock of the auralux corporation 
other expense was million in versus million in the increase was primarily due to higher interest and amortization costs related to the acquisition of the auralux corporation in january and the full year effect of the july acquisition of the cnc international textile chemical business 
compared to operations sales increased by compared to the prior year on the strength of a improvement in the textile chemical specialties segment 
the environmental products and services segment sales dropped by 
sales in the textile chemical specialties segment increased in due to improvements in both america and europe division textile chemical businesses as well as the us organic chemicals product line 
the america textile chemical business  which comprised of sales in this segment  improved over the prior year 
the growth in volume resulted from increased sales of new products for wrinkle free cotton finishes and liquid for solid applications  pacific rim expansion  and the full year and partial year effects  respectively  of the acquisitions of the national starch and cnc international textile chemical businesses 
overall quantities sold increased and selling prices averaged higher than europe division textile chemical sales  which comprised of sales in this segment  improved in terms of us dollars by while local currencies sales were up 
tonnage sold increased 
these results were primarily due to improved market conditions and increased market share in western europe  particularly in italy and spain  strong sales growth in the middle east and eastern europe  and successful new products and programs 
these gains were partially offset by a drop in selling prices in terms of dutch guilders 
us organic chemical product line sales  which accounted for of the segment  improved due to increased proprietary and toll manufacturing activity 
average selling prices in this area fell 
the environmental products and services segment sales declined primarily in the ion exchange and reverse osmosis membrane product lines 
sales of ion exchange resins  which comprised of this segment  dropped primarily due to further declines in the industrial resin product line 
pricing deteriorated due to excess capacity of resins in the marketplace  and continuing competition from foreign resin manufacturers 
market share remained flat compared to while average selling prices fell 
reverse osmosis membrane product line sales  which comprised of sales in this segment  declined  the result of reduced sales to a large overseas customer combined with an overall reduction in selling prices 
quantities shipped decreased 
the decline in environmental products and services sales was somewhat offset by a increase in sales of the biochemical product line 
these products  which accounted for of segment sales in  had an overall volume increase of along with improved average selling prices of 
the increases were due to improved activity in products for the consumer market  primarily for drain maintenance 
sales in the remaining product lines in this segment fell by in  primarily the result of lower toner polymer activity and the non recurring sales of tank cleaning and equipment products  a business that was sold in december  somewhat offset by increased specialty polymer sales 
the gross margin for was  a decline from in in the textile chemical specialties segment  the combined margins in the america textile chemical business and the organic chemicals product line improved by one percentage point due to favorable product mix and lower freight and raw material costs 
the europe division gross margin increased by 
due to lower raw material costs and reduced allowances to customers 
however  since a greater percentage of the sales  versus  in the textile chemical specialties segment came from the america division  which carries a lower margin than europe  the overall segment margin of essentially equalled last year s rate 
the gross margin in the environmental products and services segment fell to from in ion exchange resin margins dropped year to year as a result of reduced selling prices coupled with increased raw material costs 
higher manufacturing expenses and an unfavorable product mix contributed to a lower margin in the biochemical business 
margins in the reverse osmosis membrane product line also declined versus due to product customer mix 
somewhat offsetting these was an increase in toner polymer margins due to mix and productivity gains 
operating expenses were of sales for compared to for last year 
this favorable impact was primarily the result of concerted effort to reduce and control spending in all segments and manpower reductions in the environmental products and services segment 
separately  operating expenses as a percent of sales in the textile chemical specialties segment and the environmental products and services segment were and  respectively  as compared to and in income taxes and other items the company s provision for income taxes was computed using applicable prevailing income tax rates 
the company s effective tax rate increased from in to in the increase principally resulted from a change in the us tax law relating to the deductibility of travel and entertainment expenses  the amortization of intangible assets resulting from certain purchase accounting allocations in connection with the acquisition of the textile chemical assets of the national starch and chemical company and increased withholding taxes relating to a dividend payment between two of the company s foreign subsidiaries 
other income expense was an expense of million in versus million in the improvement was a net result of the following items a reduction in interest expense due to the redemption of the company s junior subordinated debentures the subordinated debentures which was funded from excess cash and borrowings from the company s revolving credit facility which carry a lower interest rate 
an increase in the amortization of intangibles which reflect additional goodwill charges related to the acquisition of certain textile chemical assets in june and july see item  business

since july  the company has incurred approximately million in costs in order to identify and remediate certain soil and groundwater contamination at various facilities which it currently or formerly occupied in the state of new jersey 
approximately million of these expenditures were charged against the liability established at the time the company acquired the sybron chemical group from sybron corporation 
the remaining expenditures have been treated as land improvements 
during   and the company spent approximately   and  respectively  in measuring the extent of contamination at its wellford  south carolina facility 
these expenditures were charged against earnings in the periods incurred 
during   and the company spent approximately   and  respectively  to identify and remediate certain soil contamination at its facility in ede  holland which existed at the time the company acquired this facility from sybron corporation 
approximately  of the costs incurred in were treated as land improvements while the remainder were charged against amounts previously reserved 
the cost of remediating contamination at the company s existing facilities is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s annual operating results  cash flow or its financial condition 
at december   the company has accrued approximately  to offset future environmental assessment and remediation costs 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents increased to million as of december  as compared with million as of the end of the prior year 
net cash flow generated by operating activities was million for versus million in this improvement  which was partially offset by higher inventory levels  principally resulted from the acquisition of the auralux corporation as well as increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
net cash used by investing activities increased to million principally resulting from the january purchase of auralux corporation 
net cash provided by financing activities increased to million in principally due to increased borrowings which funded the aforementioned acquisition 
at december   the company had a million multi currency unsecured revolving credit facility with bank of boston which expires in july the amount owed under this credit facility was approximately million

the last swap agreement expired in february the company s effective interest rate on all borrowings during was 
during  the company expects its capital expenditures for existing operations to be somewhat in excess of levels due to a planned relocation and expansion of the mexican manufacturing facility and upgrading of the yantic facility 
the company further believes that between its anticipated operating cash flow and present credit facilities  it will be able to fund capital expenditures and meet its short term and long term financial obligations 
new accounting pronouncements fas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and fas  accounting for stock based compensation  were issued by the financial accounting standards board in march and october  respectively 
fas establishes accounting standards for the impairment of long lived assets  for certain identifiable intangible assets and goodwill related to those assets to be held and used and for long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be disposed of 
fas requires that such assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company has chosen to adopt fas in and it is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements 
fas establishes financial and reporting standards for stock based compensation plans 
adoption is not required by the company until under fas  the company may choose to reflect the fair value of stock options as compensation cost based on the value of the option which is recognized over the vesting period or retain the current approach set forth in apb opinion and expand its footnote disclosure to provide pro forma disclosure as if it had adopted the fair value accounting method 
the company expects to retain its current accounting methodology and expand its footnote disclosure when fas is adopted 
foreign exchange the company has subsidiaries in europe  asia  africa and the americas and  for all subsidiaries  the company has determined the functional currencies are the subsidiaries local currency 
the company has a large manufacturing facility in ede  holland which manufactures and sells chemicals either directly to customers or to various subsidiaries which are principally in europe 
intercompany balances arise between the dutch operation and various subsidiaries 
the company recognized exchange losses in the europe division in of  compared to  for the similar period 
this was the result of weak european currencies  primarily the italian lira and british pound versus the dutch guilder 
the us dollar also weakened against the dutch guilder  german mark  and spanish peseta 
inflation and trends united states average selling prices in the us fell during as a result of competitive market factors 
raw material costs were up an average of primarily due to substantial price increases in several major raw materials including a increase in the cost of styrene  one of the company s major raw materials in the environmental products and services segment 
these unfavorable factors were partially offset by productivity improvements and concerted cost control efforts 
europe the europe division s textile chemical average selling price for  in dutch guilders  increased slightly less than 
continued growth is anticipated in the environmental products and services segment during aided by expected penetration in the ion exchange export market and higher biochemical sales increases in industrial and consumer applications 
continued increases in sales are expected in the textile chemical specialties segment during due to additional market penetration into several new areas in europe  the middle east  the far east  latin america and mexico 
the company recognizes that future growth in the us market is dependent on introducing new products into the marketplace that cannot be easily duplicated and streamlining their development 
to accomplish this goal  a new vice president of technology  focusing on textile chemical research and development  was recently hired
