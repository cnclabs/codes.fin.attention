item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company has experienced significant losses from continuing operations over the past three fiscal years  largely as a result of the substantial costs incurred to develop  obtain fda approval of and commercially launch the female condom 
consumer research completed by independent organizations revealed significant rates of acceptance among those individuals who have recently tried the female condom in the us further  the company continues to make progress in establishing partnerships with companies seeking to market the female condom in countries outside the us and us in the near term  the company s revenue will depend on global public sector sales  key country partners  and consumer acceptance in the us the company believes that a variety of factors will determine the ultimate level of worldwide acceptance of the female condom including  global public sector use  cultural factors  availability of funds to spend on marketing and promotional programs in the us  production volume levels and the resultant effect on the cost of the female condom  the regulatory environment and agreements with third parties to market the female condom in select international markets 
in fiscal  the company plans to  distribute the female condom to developing countries based on its agreement with unaids  promote the female condom through media which may include television  print and the world wide web  finalize contractual agreements with international distributors and begin shipments of the female condom to major international markets  and increase sales volume and lower product costs through increased production volume at its london based manufacturing facility 
as a result of acquiring chartex in  the company has significant production capacity of the female condom 
if sales volume does not increase  fixed manufacturing costs will cause further operating losses 
the company believes that as awareness of the female condom increases  sales will grow 
accordingly  if resources permit  fhc will continue to incur marketing and advertising costs in the us to promote consumer awareness and use of the female condom 
until sales increase to a level sufficient to fund these costs  the company will continue to incur operating losses 
results of operations fiscal year ended september  fiscal compared to fiscal year ended september  fiscal continuing operations the female health company had revenues of million and a net loss of million per share in fiscal compared to revenues of million and a net loss of million per share in fiscal fiscal revenues reflect a decline in us sales  a consequence  in part  of reduced domestic advertising and promotional expenditures  some pipeline fill in  and sales returns of dated product  offset largely by the inclusion of chartex sales since the february  acquisition 
net revenues for both periods pertain exclusively to sales of the female condom 
in fiscal cost of goods sold increased from million to million principally due to fixed manufacturing costs at the company s chartex production facility which are included in cost of goods sold since the chartex acquisition 
cost of goods sold includes  and  for a reduction in the expected value of the company s inventory in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the inventory write down reflects historical rates of sale and on hand inventory levels of dated product 
in  the female condom was granted a two year product life by the fda 
then in july  the fda extended the product s useful life to three years 
in response to an application by the company  the fda recently notified the company verbally that it will extend the product s useful life to four years and is considering a useful life in excess of four years 
the company s finished goods inventory and current retail inventories in the us generally reflect expiration dates between july and september  although the product s useful life is one year longer and may actually extend further pending approval from the fda 
the company s obsolescence and sales return provisions reflect costs associated with repackaging the company s product to ensure it is properly labeled

net revenues pertain exclusively to sales of the female condom 
approximately of reality sales for fiscal were trade sales and were sales to the public sector 
in fiscal  approximately of reality sales were retail trade and were for the public sector 
the company reported a gross margin in fiscal before the million inventory write down compared to in fiscal the decrease in gross margin percentage relates primarily to shift in mix of sales between trade and public sector  with public sector sales carrying reduced pricing 
the million inventory write down was due to lower than expected sales and the level of product inventory on hand at september  product purchases were impacted by minimum purchase requirements under the company s supply agreement with chartex

actual royalties due are paid by reducing the prepaid royalty asset on the company s balance sheet 
reality exclusivity fees decreased

subsequent royalty periods are for months 
the company ceased accruing further exclusivity shortfall amounts as of june   as explained in note to the financial statements

exclusive of this nonrecurring item  net revenues of discontinued operations increased million over the prior year amounts 
financial condition  liquidity and sources of capital historically  the company has incurred significant operating losses 
cash used in continuing operations was million  million and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
historically  the company has funded operating losses and capital costs  in large part  by securing outside sources of capital  primarily through the sale of common stock 
during fiscal  the company received approximately million in proceeds from newly issued notes payable  million net of transaction costs from the sale of convertible debentures and warrants  million net of transaction costs from the sale of common stock 
the company also realized approximately million net of transaction costs from the sale of holdings 
the total cash cost of the chartex acquisition including expenses was approximately million 
together with the proceeds from financing transactions discussed above  fhc used these amounts to fund current operations of the company including for working capital and marketing expenditures and to repay existing liabilities 
subsequent to its fiscal year end  the company completed the sale and lease back of its manufacturing facility raising approximately million net of the repayment of the mortgage secured by the facility to fund working capital requirement and for general corporate purposes 
due to the company s sale of holdings and its purchase of chartex  the company does not believe that its historical liquidity  results of operations and capital requirements are necessarily representative of expected future results of operations or capital requirements 
in the near term  fhc management expects operating and capital costs to continue to exceed funds generated from operations due principally to the company s fixed manufacturing costs relative to current production volumes and the ongoing need to spend heavily on advertising and promotion in the us to expand consumer awareness and acceptance of the female condom 
increased demand for the female condom may add to the company s near term cash requirements as investment in working capital is required to support higher sales and production levels 
with the exception of a final payment of pounds  due on manufacturing equipment purchased in  the company does not anticipate significant capital expenditures for fiscal in  management will pursue other avenues to obtain financing including pursuing strategies to secure additional capital from a debt or equity securities offering 
until internally generated funds are sufficient to meet cash requirements  fhc will remain dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient capital from outside sources 
while management believes that revenue from sales of the female condom will eventually exceed operating costs and that ultimately operations will generate sufficient funds to meet capital requirements  there can be no assurance that such level of operations will ultimately be achieved  or be achieved in the near term 
likewise  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to source all or any portion of its required capital through the sale of debt or equity or  if raised  the amount will be sufficient to operate the company until sales of the female condom generate sufficient revenues to fund operations 
in addition  any funds raised may be costly to the company and or dilutive to stockholders 
if the company is not able to source the required funds or any future capital which becomes required  the company may be forced to sell certain of its assets or rights or cease operations 
the company does not currently have in place any line of credit financing and has not yet actively pursued such financing 
depending on the level of sales of the female condom and estimated operating losses  it may be difficult to source such financing initially 
if the company is not able to source additional capital  the lack of funds to promote the female condom may significantly limit the company s ability to realize value from its existing inventory and to capitalize on the investments made in the female condom 
impact of inflation and changing prices although the company cannot accurately determine the precise effect of inflation  the company has experienced increased costs of product  supplies  salaries and benefits  and increased general and administrative expenses 
the company attempts to pass on increased costs and expenses by increasing selling prices  when possible  and by improved efficiencies of operations 
foreign currency and market risk the company manufactures the female condom in a facility located in london  england 
further  a material portion of the company s future sales are likely to be in foreign markets 
manufacturing costs and sales to foreign markets are subject to normal currency risks associated with changes in the exchange rate of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar 
in addition  some of the company s future international sales may be in developing nations where dramatic political or economic changes are possible 
such factors may adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition
