compared to the nature of the company s operations changed radically in because of the change in investment focus from investments in structured securities to multifamily real estate located in california s central valley 
as a result  during the company sold a majority of its investments in structured securities and acquired a portfolio of four income producing residential real estate properties 
income from residual interests and interest only bonds declined by more than half because these investments were included in the company s portfolio for only a portion of the year 
sales of these investments resulted in a loss of  although  of this loss had been previously recognized as a reduction of shareholders equity 
net interest margin interest income from mortgage certificates net of interest expense on cmos declined in to a net interest expense of  from net interest expense of  in as shown in the following table 
the primary cause of the decline was a change in the method of amortization of original issue discount on cmot to a method that better relates amortization to principal reductions 
in thousands change interest income from mortgage certificates    amortization of market discount net interest income    interest expense on cmos    amortization of original issue discount   net interest expense    net interest margin  net interest margin continues to be negative because of the retirement of some of the lower coupon bonds leaving primarily bonds which bear an interest rate equal to or close to the mortgage rate 
the reserve for loss on investments was reduced by  in in relation to the decline in the amounts of principal outstanding in the underlying residual series 
in the first partial year of real estate operations  the company s income from real estate operations before depreciation and amortization funds from operations was  however  real estate operations after depreciation and amortization showed a loss of  the first year of real estate operations relates to properties acquired in a series of four closings throughout and therefore does not constitute a full year of operations 
during the year  the company made some needed improvements to the properties 
the company anticipates improved results from real estate operations in future years as much of the secured real estate debt is expected to be refinanced in at lower interest rates 
interest expense on repurchase agreements decreased from  in to  in this is the result of a decrease in the average amount of debt outstanding from  in to  in however  this reduction was offset by an increase in the weighted average interest rate from in to in management and residual interest administration fees remained essentially constant in because of the somewhat increased level of average invested assets related to real estate acquisitions offset by a  decline in the residual interest administration fee 
in the company incurred management fees of  and residual interest administration fees of  as compared to fees of  and  respectively  in general and administrative expense declined from  in to  in because of overall economies on the part of the company and the manager in compared to as a result of the accounting change described above which adjusted the carrying value of the company s structured securities to fair value  operating results were likely to be favorable in most stable interest rate environments

in the company incurred management fees of  and residual interest administration fees of  as compared to fees of  and  respectively  in general and administrative expense declined from  in to  in because of lower costs of stockholder communications and the capitalization in of certain consulting fees 
outlook the company has determined that it will direct its future investments principally to multifamily residential properties 
with regard to real estate investments  the acquisition strategy of the company is to identify communities with an expanding employment base and demographics which will continue to provide economic growth 
after identifying communities with a strong potential economic growth  the company attempts to seek out those areas within a chosen community which are most likely to be positively affected by the economic growth of the community 
finally  the property sought for purchase within a given area is chosen because it is considered to be among the highest quality properties in that area and can be purchased below replacement cost 
management believes that this strategy will allow income from each of the properties to rise before the properties encounter significant competition from new construction 
on december  the company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire four multifamily housing properties in california s central valley 
these properties consist of units together with acres of unimproved land slated for development of an additional units 
the properties were purchased in a series of closings occurring between mid january and mid november  the aggregate purchase price for the properties was be  including existing debt to be assumed by the company 
prior to  the company s primary business was the ownership of structured securities 
because mortgage interest rates increased in  the high level of prepayments experienced in and subsided 
if mortgage rates decline sufficiently to cause prepayments to increase  the company will again have write downs on certain of its single family structured securities 
the company has generated significant tax loss carryforwards from losses experienced over the last several years 
should the company s real estate acquisitions be successful  the company would be in a tax position to have the right  but not the obligation  to continue to use cash flows to rebuild its investment portfolio prior to resuming taxable dividend payments 
liquidity and capital resources the company uses its cash flow to provide working capital to pay its expenses and debt service  acquire other assets and  at the discretion of the board of directors  to pay dividends to its shareholders 
in the company s operations generated cash flow of  as compared to  in and  in at december  the company had outstanding short term borrowings with two investment banking firms under repurchase agreements totaling  at a weighted average interest rate of 
all of the borrowing had initial terms of one month  are renewed on a month to month basis and have a floating rate of interest which is tied to the one month libor rate 
at december  the company had outstanding borrowings with one investment banking firm under repurchase agreements totaling  the weighted average interest rate of these borrowings at that date was 
in addition  at december  the company had outstanding borrowings secured by multifamily real estate totaling  approximately of this debt has variable interest rates and is at fixed rates 
the weighted average interest rate at december  was 
the company intends to refinance approximately  of the notes payable on real estate during at more favorable terms and rates 
at december   the company had no other borrowings or committed lines of credit 
management of the company believes that the cash flow from operations and availability of repurchase agreements are sufficient to enable the company to meet its current and anticipated future liquidity requirements including required payment of dividends to its shareholders  which must equal at least of the company s taxable income in order for the company to qualify as a reit
