item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition impact of acquisitions the company was formed in july to acquire a hospital contract management business established in the mid s 
since that acquisition  the company has expanded the scope of its business by acquiring acute care hospitals  four facilities in fiscal and one of which has been divested  eleven facilities in fiscal ten of which were acquired in a single transaction five of which have been divested and two of which were exchanged for two other hospitals  three facilities in fiscal  two facilities in fiscal and two additional facilities during the two months ended august because of the financial impact of the company s recent acquisitions and divestitures  it is difficult to make meaningful comparisons between the company s financial statements for the fiscal years presented 
in addition  due to the current number of owned hospitals  each additional hospital acquisition can affect the overall operating margin of the company 
upon the acquisition of a hospital  the company has typically taken a number of immediate steps  including staffing adjustments  to lower operating costs 
the impact of such actions can be partially offset by cost increases to expand the hospitals services  strengthen its medical staff and improve its market position 
the benefits of these investments and of other activities to improve operating margins may not occur immediately 
consequently  the financial performance of an acquired hospital may adversely affect overall operating margins in the near term 
as the company makes additional hospital acquisitions  the company expects that this effect will be mitigated by the expanded financial base of existing hospitals

the results of operations for the year ended june  include a full year of operations for twelve hospitals and partial periods for two hospitals acquired and one hospital divested during the year
