liquidity and capital resources the company generally funds its working capital needs from operations and bank borrowings 
in the land development contracting business  the company must expend considerable amounts of funds for equipment  labor and supplies to meet the needs of particular projects 
the company s capital needs are greatest at the start of any new contract  since the company generally must complete to days of work before receiving the first progress payment 
in addition  as a project continues  a portion of the progress billing is usually withheld as retainage until all work is complete  further increasing the need for capital 
on occasion the company has provided long term financing to certain customers who have utilized its land development contracting services 
the company has also provided financing for other business ventures from time to time 
with respect to the company s concrete and related products division  accounts receivable are typically outstanding for a minimum of days and in some cases much longer 
the nature of the company s business requires a continuing investment in plant and equipment along with the related maintenance and upkeep costs of such equipment 
the company has funded many of these expenditures out of its current working capital 
however  notwithstanding the foregoing and after factoring in the company s obligations as set forth below  management believes that the company s cash flow from operations  existing working capital approximately million at december  and funds available from lines of credit will be adequate to meet the company s anticipated needs for operations during the next twelve months

the bank reacted favorably to the company s proposal although there is no assurance that the loan will be granted on terms acceptable to the company or even granted at all 
the loan proceeds of million would be used to repay and retire a million revolving line of credit which expires in may  two term loans totalling million  an equipment loan with a balance of  a term loan with a balance of million which is due in june  a line of credit with a balance of  which expires in june  another line of credit with a balance of  which expires in may and various other notes amounting to approximately  the balance of  would be used to provide additional working capital for the company 
the loan would be collateralized by various parcels of real property located in the united states virgin islands 
if the new credit facility is not obtained  the company will seek alternative financing or extensions of its existing facilities expiring in the company purchases equipment from time to time as needed for its ongoing business operations 
at present  management believes that the company s inventory of equipment is adequate for its current contractual commitments and operating activities  however  the acquisition of significant new construction contracts  depending on the nature of the contract  the job location and job duration  may require the company to make significant investments in heavy construction equipment 
during  the company sold equipment with an original cost basis of approximately million and net book value of  accordingly  except for the circumstances previously discussed  and normal equipment replacements and additions  management does not anticipate having to make a substantial investment in new equipment during the current year 
the company believes it has available or can obtain sufficient financing for all of its contemplated equipment replacements and additions 
historically  the company has used a number of lenders to finance machinery and equipment purchases  including its ocean going bulk cement vessel  on an individual asset basis 
at december  amounts outstanding to these lenders totalled million 
these loans are typically repaid over a three to six year term in monthly principal and interest installments

the company does not presently anticipate material increases in or accelerations of payments by the government of antigua 
the company expects that the notes will not be satisfied at maturity but the antiguan government has advised the company that the current payment stream will continue until the obligation is satisfied 
a portion of the payment received from antigua is derived from the lease proceeds the antiguan government receives from the united states department of defense for the rental of two military bases
