liquidity for the life insurance subsidiaries is measured by their ability to pay scheduled contractual benefits  pay operating expenses  and fund investment commitments 
sources of liquidity include scheduled and unscheduled principal and interest payments on investments  premium payments and deposits and the sale of liquid investments 
these sources of liquidity for the insurance subsidiaries significantly exceed scheduled uses 
liquidity is also affected by unscheduled benefit payments including death benefits  benefits under accident and health policies and interest sensitive policy surrenders and withdrawals 
the amount of surrenders and withdrawals is affected by a variety of factors such as credited interest rates for similar products  general economic conditions and events in the industry which affect policyholders confidence 
although the contractual terms of substantially all of the company s in force life insurance policies and annuities give the holders the right to surrender the policies and annuities  the company imposes penalties for early surrenders 
at december  the company held reserves that exceeded the underlying cash surrender values of its in force life insurance and annuities by more than million 
the insurance companies have not experienced any material changes in surrender and withdrawal activity over the past years 
changes in interest rates may affect the incidence of policy surrenders and withdrawals 
in addition to the potential impact on liquidity  unanticipated surrenders and withdrawals in a changed interest rate environment could adversely affect earnings if the company were required to sell investments at reduced values in order to meet liquidity demands 
the company manages the asset and liability portfolios in order to minimize the adverse earnings impact of changing market rates 
the company seeks to invest in assets which have duration and interest spread characteristics similar to the liabilities which they support 
the net yield on cash and invested assets declined from in  to in and to in these decreases came as a result of declining market interest rates in and  which caused higher yielding securities to be called or prepaid from the portfolio with the reinvestment of the proceeds at lower interest rates 
in addition  the company invested in shorter maturity investments to better match its policyholder liabilities and decrease its exposure to interest rate volatility 
a significant portion of these securities are held to support the liabilities for policyholder account balances  which liabilities are subject to periodic adjustments to their credited interest rates 
the credited interest rates of the interest sensitive policyholder account balances are determined by management based upon factors such as portfolio rates of return and prevailing market rates and typically follow the pattern of yields on the assets supporting these liabilities 
at december   the investment portfolios of the life insurance subsidiaries included cash and short term investments totaling  as well as fixed maturity securities that could readily be converted to cash with carrying values of and fair values of  the fair values of these liquid investments totalled more than  and constituted approximately of the company s investments at december  at december   all of the company investments were income producing and current in interest and principal payments except for one security with a carrying value of  in addition  the company has no investment in any derivative instruments or other hybrid securities that contain any off balance sheet risk or investments in other securities whose fair values and principal repayments would be highly volatile to changes in interest rates  except for gnma s  fnma s and investment grade corporate collateralized mortgage obligations

on april   worldnet purchased certain assets of hat and an affiliated corporation for can 
 approximately us  payable over five years

effects of accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement  accounting for certain debt and equity securities  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with earlier adoption permitted 
statement requires that debt and equity securities be classified into three categories and accounted for as follows o debt securities that the company has the positive intent and the ability to hold to maturity would be classified as held to maturity and reported at amortized cost 
o debt and equity securities that are held for current resale would be classified as trading securities and reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 
o debt and equity securities not classified as held to maturity or as trading securities would be classified as available for sale and reported at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses would not be reflected in earnings but would be reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
the company adopted statement on january   the effect of which increased its unrealized gains by  in november   the fasb issued a special report titled a guide to implementation of statement on accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  which report allows enterprises to reassess the appropriateness of the classifications of all securities held and account for any resulting reclassifications between the investment accounts 
this one time reassessment had to be made prior to december  and be appropriately disclosed in the financial statements 
in december   the company did reassess the appropriateness of the classifications of its securities and reclassified all of the securities contained in the held to maturity account to the available for sale account as they may be considered for sale prior to maturity as part of the asset liability management strategy 
the carrying value of the securities reclassed to available for sale amounted to  and the fair value amounted to  this transfer resulted in the company increasing its unrealized gains by  as changes in interest rates occur  the carrying value of the securities classified as available for sale  as well as any securities which may in the future be classified as held for maturity  will be impacted 
typically  as interest rates rise  the carrying value of these securities may decline 
conversely  if interest rates decline  the carrying value of these securities may increase 
management cannot predict the impact that changes in future interest rates will have on the company s financial statements 
in october   the fasb issued statement  accounting for stock based compensation which requires disclosure of new employee stock options in the form of a note to the financial statements based on the fair value at the date of the grant and is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december   with earlier adoption permitted 
companies also may base the recognition of compensation cost for new and modified options on these fair values 
the disclosures required in statement must include the pro forma effects on the company s net income resulting from the grant of these options and other stock awards 
the company will adopt statement in its financial statements and intends to disclose the impact in the footnotes to the financial statements rather than record these charges in its statement of operations
