item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview acclaim entertainment  inc acclaim  together with its subsidiaries acclaim and its subsidiaries are collectively hereinafter referred to as the company  is a mass market entertainment company whose principal business to date has been as a leading publisher of interactive entertainment software software for use with interactive entertainment hardware platforms entertainment platforms 
the company also engages in i the development and publication of comic books  which commenced in july through the acquisition of acclaim comics  inc  formerly voyager communications  inc 
acclaim comics  ii the distribution of software titles developed by other software publishers affiliated labels  which commenced in the first quarter of fiscal  iii the marketing of its motion capture technology and studio services  which commenced in the first quarter of fiscal  iv the distribution of coin operated  location based ticket redemption games  which commenced in august through the acquisition of acclaim redemption games  inc  formerly lazer tron corporation lazer tron  and v the distribution of coin operated video arcade games  which commenced in may the interactive entertainment industry is characterized by rapid technological change  resulting in hardware platform and related software product cycles 
no single entertainment platform or system has achieved long term dominance 
the company s strategy is to develop software for the hardware platforms that currently dominate the market and to develop software for the hardware platforms that the company perceives as having the potential to achieve mass market acceptance at such time as the company s software for such platform is to be released 
this generally requires the company to estimate the probable success of future hardware systems as much as to months prior to their introduction in order to allow sufficient lead time to develop software that will be available for such new systems at or near the time of their release 
if the company does not accurately predict the success of existing or future hardware systems due to  among other things  the long software development lead times involved  it could be in the position  as it was in fiscal  of marketing software i for new hardware systems that have not achieved significant market penetration and or ii for hardware systems that have become or are becoming obsolete due to the introduction or success of new hardware systems 
see business risk factors and results of operations 
no assurance can be given that the company will  in the future  correctly identify the systems with mass market potential or be successful in publishing software for the platforms that achieve significant installed bases 
the interactive entertainment industry is currently undergoing  and management anticipates that in both the short and long term future it will continue to undergo  significant changes due  in large part  to i the introduction of entertainment platforms incorporating more advanced processors and operating systems  ii the impact of technological changes embodied in personal computer compact disk multimedia systems pc cd systems and software therefor  iii the development of electronic and wireless delivery systems and iv the entry and participation of new companies in the industry 
there can be no assurance that any of the newly introduced or announced platforms will achieve market penetration similar to that achieved by the snes or genesis bit platforms 
the company s revenues have traditionally been derived from sales of software for the then dominant platforms 
accordingly  the company s revenues are subject to fluctuation and have been and  in the future  could be materially adversely affected during transition periods when new hardware platforms have been introduced but none has achieved a significant installed base 
most of the company s revenues in fiscal and the majority of the company s revenues in fiscal were derived from sales of software for bit entertainment platforms 
the company believes that full priced front line bit software sales peaked in calendar and have decreased substantially since that time 
due to the relatively longer time necessary to develop and manufacture and bit software  the company s strategic decisions in respect of the hardware systems it intended to support were required to be made in  approximately to months prior to the shipment of software for those platforms 
in deciding which hardware systems to support in calendar and and which titles to develop for shipment in those years  the company had to project  as early as  anticipated sales levels of and bit software in and based on information available in and based on its historical experience with respect to the transition from bit to bit platforms  the company believed that software sales for bit platforms would  although continuing to decrease overall  still dominate the interactive entertainment market in and that such sales would remain substantial through the holiday season 
accordingly  the company s strategy for christmas was to develop software for multiple hardware platforms bit  bit and pc cd systems and the company anticipated that substantially all of its revenues in fiscal would be derived from its bit software sales 
the company anticipated that its sales of bit and pc cd software in fiscal would grow as compared to fiscal but that the majority of its revenues in fiscal would still be derived from bit software sales 
however  the bit software market matured much more rapidly than anticipated by the company  the company s christmas bit software sales were substantially lower than anticipated and  by april  the company derived minimal profits from such software sales and made the decision to exit the bit and portable cartridge markets 
in connection with the company s decision to exit the bit and portable software markets in april  the company recorded a special cartridge video charge of approximately million in the second quarter of fiscal  consisting of provisions of approximately million and approximately million  respectively  to adjust accounts receivable and inventories at february  to their estimated net realizable values in conjunction with management s decision to exit the portable and bit cartridge market 
retail sales of the company s cartridge software during the second fiscal quarter generally fell short of the company s expectations 
such sales were adversely impacted by the continuing decline of the market for bit software and the related transition to and bit entertainment platforms 
as the bit software market continued to mature and shrink  the number of available titles continued to increase and  management believes  consumers became increasingly more discriminating about full price software purchases and the rates of sales of such software declined 
accordingly  as inventory levels of the company s software grew at retail  the company offered concessions in the form of discounts  returns and allowances to its retailers at higher than anticipated levels in order to manage inventory sell through 
however  the company did not generate profits from sales of its software when discounted to the mid priced and budget priced levels necessary to achieve retail sell through 
as a result of the foregoing  the company s revenues for the quarter ended february  were materially adversely affected and the company incurred a net loss from operations including the special cartridge video charge of million and a net loss on an after tax basis of million for the quarter ended february  see business risk factors and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
management believes that the previously discussed industry trends and factors which contributed to its decision in the second quarter of fiscal to exit the bit cartridge and portable market generally continued and accelerated in the second half of fiscal retail inventories were higher in this period than had been anticipated by management in april and sell through of the company s bit as well as other software was at lower than anticipated rates 
the company s bit and pc cd software sales in fiscal were materially insufficient to offset the decline in sales of bit software 
the acquisitions of the software studios materially increased the company s fixed development and general and administrative expenses in fiscal the decline in the bit market  the relatively slow growth of the bit market and increased fixed operating costs materially adversely affected the company s results of operations and liquidity in fiscal the company recorded a loss from operations of million for fiscal  which includes an additional charge related to bit and portable software of million  in the fourth quarter ended august  and a net loss on an after tax basis of million for fiscal the loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal of million reflects additional write offs of receivables  the establishment of additional receivables reserves  severance charges incurred in the fourth quarter in connection with the downsizing of the company and the reduction of certain deferred costs  as well as an operating loss for the period resulting primarily from price protection and similar concessions granted to retailers at greater than anticipated levels in connection with the company s bit software 
see business risk factors and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company is continuing to sell its existing bit and portable cartridge software inventory and has released  and may continue to release  bit and or portable software selectively to support its key brands and  if requested by a retailer  may produce additional units of particular title s on a special order basis 
the company is currently developing software for the sony playstation  the sega saturn  the nintendo n and various pc cd systems 
the and bit platforms have not achieved market penetration similar to that of the snes or genesis  accordingly  the number of units of each software title sold for those systems is significantly less than the number of units of a title generally sold during  and for the bit systems because of the smaller installed base of the and bit systems 
the company plans currently to release between and titles for the bit playstation and saturn platforms in calendar as the market penetration of these platforms increases  it is the company s intention to reduce the number of titles released by it 
the company plans to release between and pc cd software titles in fiscal  of which to titles will be released only for pc cd systems 
with respect to the nintendo n platform  the company intends to release between four and six software titles in calendar  one of which will be released in the spring of under the company s current n agreement with nintendo 
management anticipates that sales of the company s and bit and pc cd software will fall materially short of levels necessary to offset the continuing decline in bit software sales and that the company s revenues and operating profits from the sale of and bit and pc cd software in fiscal will be materially less than the company s revenues and operating profits in fiscal and accordingly  management anticipates incurring material losses for the first and second quarters of fiscal see business risk factors 
no assurance can be given of the company s results of operations and profitability in future periods 
see business risk factors 
as a result of the company s acquisitions of iguana  sculptured and probe in two of which were completed in fiscal  the company s fixed costs relating to the development of software and its general and administrative expenses were substantially higher in fiscal as compared to prior periods 
see business risk factors and operating expenses 
such expenses in the aggregate had a material adverse impact on the company s profitability in fiscal management plans to maintain or reduce the dollar level of research and development expenses in fiscal which expenses management anticipates will be offset  in part  by revenues derived from sales of software developed by the studios 
in august  the company down sized and reorganized some of its operations 
severance charges and other costs related to the down sizing of approximately million were incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal management anticipates that the company will realize operating expense reductions resulting therefrom commencing in fiscal the release of hit titles for hardware platforms with significant installed bases can significantly affect revenues 
historically  such hit titles such as the wwf titles have accounted for significant portions of the company s revenues during particular periods 
in fiscal  the nba jam tournament edition titles accounted for a significant portion of revenues  and in fiscal  the mortal kombat ii and nba jam titles each accounted for a significant portion of gross revenues 
see legal proceedings 
no single title accounted for a significant portion of the company s revenues in fiscal the lack of a hit title for a hardware platform with a significant installed base in fiscal contributed to the company s loss for the year 
see business risk factors 
the timing of the release of software can cause material quarterly revenue and earnings fluctuations 
a significant portion of the company s revenues in any quarter are generally derived from software first shipped in that quarter 
product development schedules are difficult to predict due  in large part  to the difficulty of scheduling accurately the creative process and  with respect to software for new hardware platforms  the use of new development tools and the learning process associated with development for new technologies 
software for the new entertainment platforms requires more development time and  accordingly  causes additional development and scheduling risk 
as a result  the company s quarterly results of operations are difficult to predict and the failure to meet product development schedules or even minor delays in product deliveries could cause a shortfall in shipments in any given quarter which in the past have caused  and in the future could cause  the company s results of operations and net income for such quarter to fall significantly below anticipated levels 
see business risk factors 
the company s ability to generate sales growth and profitability will be materially dependent on i the growth of the software market for and bit entertainment platforms and pc cd systems  ii the company s ability to identify  develop and publish hit software for hardware platforms with significant installed bases and iii the development of  and the generation of revenues from  its other entertainment operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain statements of consolidated operations data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated fiscal year ended august  domestic revenues foreign revenues net revenues cost of revenues gross loss profit selling  advertising  general and administrative expenses product development operating interest depreciation and amortization total operating expenses loss earnings from operations other income expense  net loss earnings before income taxes net loss earnings net revenues the company s gross revenues were derived from the following product categories portable software bit software bit software pc cd software other the numbers in this chart do not give effect to sales credits and allowances granted by the company in the periods covered since the company does not track such credits and allowances by product category 
such credits and allowances were material to the company s results of operations in fiscal accordingly  the numbers presented may vary materially from those that would be disclosed if the company were able to present such information as a percentage of net revenues 
the decrease in the company s net revenues from million for the year ended august  to million for the year ended august  was predominantly due to reduced unit sales of bit software  increased returns and allowances relating primarily to bit software and a reduction in average unit selling prices for bit software 
see overview 
management anticipates that sales of the company s bit  bit and pc cd software in fiscal will offset the reduction in revenues from sales of bit software and no assurance can be given with respect to the company s revenues in future periods 
in addition  to date  the company has not generated material revenues from any of its operations other than software publishing and no assurance can be given that the company will be able to generate such revenues in the future 
see business and overview 
the increase in the company s net revenues from million for the year ended august  to million for the year ended august  was predominantly due to increased sales of bit and pc cd software and increased foreign sales and  to a lesser extent  revenues of lazer tron which are included in the company s results of operations for the year and acclaim comics 
the company is substantially dependent on sony  sega and nintendo as the sole manufacturers of the hardware platforms marketed by them and as the sole licensors of the proprietary information and technology needed to develop software for those platforms 
in fiscal years  and  the company derived  and of its gross revenues  respectively  from sales of nintendo compatible software and in fiscal years  and  the company derived  and of its gross revenues  respectively  from sales of sega compatible software 
in addition  in fiscal  the company derived of its gross revenues from sales of software for the sony playstation 
gross profit excluding the impact of the special cartridge video charge  gross profit fluctuates as a result of six factors i the level of returns and allowances  ii the number of hit products and average unit selling prices  iii the percentage of sales of cd software  iv the level of manufacture by the company of its software  v the percentage of foreign sales  and vi the percentage of foreign sales to third party distributors 
the company s gross profit is adversely impacted by increases in the level of returns and allowances to retailers  which reduces the average unit price obtained for its software sales 
similarly  lack of hit titles or a low number of hit titles  resulting in lower average unit sales prices  adversely impacts the company s gross profits 
the company s margins on sales of cd software are higher than those on cartridge software as a result of significantly lower product costs 
the company arranges for the manufacture by subcontractors of its sega software under its agreement with sega 
see business license agreements 
the cost of software manufactured by the company  together with the royalties payable to sega for such manufacturing  is lower than the cost of the company s software products when manufactured by sega 
the royalty payable to sega for software manufactured by the company is included as an operating expense  rather than as part of cost of revenues and increased levels of manufacturing by the company result in higher gross profit as a percentage of net revenues 
software for the sony and nintendo platforms is manufactured by sony and nintendo  respectively 
royalties are payable to sony and nintendo as part of the product cost at the time of manufacture and such costs are included in the company s cost of revenues sold which results in lower gross profit as a percentage of net revenues when compared to gross profit on sales of sega software 
the company s margins on foreign cartridge software sales are typically lower than those on domestic sales due to higher prices charged by hardware licensors for software distributed by the company outside north america 
the company s margins on foreign cartridge software sales to third party distributors are approximately one third lower than those on sales that the company makes directly to foreign retailers 
gross profit decreased from million of net revenues for the year ended august  to a gross loss of million of net revenues for the year ended august  predominantly due to increased returns and allowances relating to bit software 
gross profit increased from million of net revenues for the year ended august  to million of net revenues for the year ended august  the dollar increase is predominantly attributable to increased sales volume 
the reduction in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues is primarily attributable to the lower percentage of sales of sega software all of which was manufactured by the company during fiscal  which was offset by increased sales of higher margin cd software in that year 
management anticipates that the company s future gross profit will be affected by i the percentage of returns  price protection and other similar concessions in respect of the company s software sales and ii the company s product mix ie  the percentage of cd software and sales related to the company s new businesses 
although gross margins on sales of cd software are  and are anticipated to continue to be  higher than those on sales of cartridge software  management believes that stock balancing programs for its pc cd software products will result in higher rates of returns of such product as compared to the historical rate of return of cartridge software 
as the percentage of sales of pc cd software products increases  management anticipates that its reserves for such returns will increase  thereby offsetting a portion of the higher gross margins generated from cd software sales 
the company purchases substantially all of its products at prices payable in united states dollars 
appreciation of the yen could result in increased prices charged by sony  sega or nintendo to the company although  to date  none of them has effected such a price increase  which the company may not be able to pass on to its customers and which could adversely affect its results of operations 
operating expenses selling  advertising  general and administrative expenses decreased from million of net revenues for fiscal to million of net revenues for fiscal the dollar decrease is primarily attributable to the decreased sales volume discussed above offset  in part  by increased overhead expenses relating to the operations of the studios in fiscal the percentage increase is attributable to reduced sales volume 
selling  advertising  general and administrative expenses increased from million of net revenues for fiscal to million of net revenues for fiscal the dollar increase is attributable to increased sales volume 
product development expenses increased from million of net revenues in fiscal to million of net revenues in fiscal to million of net revenues in fiscal due to the increase in software development resulting from the acquisition of the three software studios in calendar a substantial portion of such expenses were previously included as royalties paid to independent software studios 
operating interest expense was million of net revenues for fiscal  million of net revenues for fiscal and million of net revenues for fiscal the increase was primarily attributable  in fiscal  to increased sales volume and  in fiscal  to higher outstanding balances under the company s principal credit facility 
depreciation and amortization increased from million of net revenue for fiscal to million of net revenues for fiscal to million of net revenues for fiscal the increase in fiscal is primarily attributable to increased amortization of the excess of costs over net assets acquired arising from the acquisition of acclaim comics and iguana and depreciation relating to the acquisition of the company s corporate headquarters 
the increase in fiscal is primarily attributable to depreciation relating to the company s corporate headquarters and of fixed assets held by the studios 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  based on current conditions in the comic book industry  the company reduced the estimated remaining life of goodwill relating to acclaim comics from forty years to twenty years  which increased the related amortization expense by approximately  in the fourth quarter 
seasonality the company s business is seasonal  with higher revenues and operating income typically occurring during its first  second and fourth fiscal quarters which correspond to the christmas and post christmas selling season 
the timing of the delivery of software titles and the releases of new products cause materially fluctuations in the company s quarterly revenues and earnings 
liquidity and capital resources the company used net cash from operating activities of approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively  and derived approximately million of net cash from operating activities in fiscal the decrease in net cash from operations in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to a decrease in cash received from customers 
the decrease in cash received from customers is primarily attributable to lower sales resulting from the maturation of the bit market and the related transition to bit and bit platforms 
see overview 
the decrease in net cash from operations in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to relatively lower proceeds received from the company s customers and  to a lesser extent  higher payments of interest to the company s commercial lenders in connection with higher outstanding balances on the company s working capital loans and acquisition financing 
see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company derived net cash from investing activities of approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively  and used net cash in financing activities of approximately million in fiscal the decrease in net cash from investing activities in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily attributable to lower proceeds approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively derived from the sale of tci capital stock due to sales of a lower number of shares of such stock  offset by i higher cash associated with the acquisition of certain subsidiaries approximately million from sculptured and probe in fiscal as compared to million from lazer tron and iguana in fiscal  which reflects cash held by subsidiaries at the respective dates of acquisition  and ii lower cash expended on the acquisition of fixed assets in fiscal as compared to fiscal see notes   and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the increase in net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily attributable to i the sale of tci capital stock in fiscal  ii the million loan from midland bank plc in connection with the acquisition of acclaim comics in fiscal and iii higher cash expended on the acquisition of fixed assets in fiscal as compared to fiscal see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company derived net cash from financing activities of approximately million in fiscal  used net cash from financing activities of approximately million in fiscal and derived net cash from financing activities of approximately million in fiscal the increase in net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily attributable to i proceeds from mortgage financing of the company s headquarters in glen cove  ii the restructuring of the midland bank plc financing in fiscal  which required pre payment of a portion of such debt and iii an increase in proceeds from short term bank loans in fiscal see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the decrease from approximately million of net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal as compared to approximately million of net cash used in financing activities in fiscal is primarily attributable to the million loan from midland bank plc in fiscal in connection with the acquisition of acclaim comics 
the company generally purchases its inventory of nintendo and sega to the extent not manufactured by the company software by opening letters of credit when placing the purchase order 
at august   and  amounts outstanding under letters of credit were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
other than such letters of credit  the company does not currently have any material capital expenditure commitments 
the company has a revolving credit and security agreement with its principal domestic bank in the amount of million  which agreement expires on january  the credit agreement will be automatically renewed for another year by its terms  unless terminated upon days prior notice by either party 
the company draws down working capital advances and opens letters of credit against the facility in amounts determined on a formula based on factored receivables and inventory  which advances are secured by the company s assets 
this bank also acts as the company s factor for the majority of its north american receivables  which are assigned on a pre approved basis 
at august   the factoring charge was of the receivables assigned and the interest on advances was at the bank s prime rate minus one half of one percent 
effective november   interest is charged at the bank s prime rate plus one percent 
the company was at august  in default of its financial covenants under this agreement  which default has been waived  but remains in default of the prohibition on having a going concern paragraph in the audit report on its financial statements 
the company is current in its payment obligations 
in connection with obtaining such waiver  the interest rate on advances was increased as described above  the advance formula was significantly modified to restrict and reduce the eligible receivables and inventory against which advances would be made  the financial covenants were made more restrictive on the company and otherwise restructured to more accurately address the decrease in sales  profitability and cash flow of the company and anticipated operations in future periods  and certain additional events of default were added
