the company believes that anticipated cash flows from operations  available funds and borrowings available under the company s bank lines of credit  will be adequate to meet the company s cash requirements through at least fiscal there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the semiconductor and related industries 
the company has received notice from a third party alleging infringements of such party s patent rights by certain of the company s products 
the company s patent counsel are investigating the claim and the company believes the patents claimed may be invalid 
in the event of litigation with respect to this claim  the company is prepared to vigorously defend its position 
however  because patent litigation can be extremely expensive and time consuming  the company may seek to obtain a license to one or more of the disputed patents 
based upon information currently available to it  the company would only do so if license fees would not be material to the company s business 
there can be no assurance that the company would prevail in any litigation seeking damages or expenses from the company or to enjoin the company from selling its products on the basis of the alleged patent infringement  or that a license for any of the alleged infringed patents will be available to the company on reasonable terms  if at all 
currently  the company does not believe that it is probable that future events related to these threatened matters will have an adverse effect on the company s business  however  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
the company is currently unable to reasonably estimate any possible loss related to these matters 
new accounting pronouncement in october  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  which establishes a fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation plans 
the new standard allows companies to continue to apply the intrinsic value method based on apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  provided certain pro forma disclosures are made as if the fair value based method had been applied 
the company will be required to implement sfas in fiscal and intends to adopt this standard through the pro forma disclosure method 
factors that may affect future results from time to time  information provided by the company or statements made by its employees may contain forward looking information which involve risks and uncertainties 
in particular  statements contained in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations which are not historical facts including  but not limited to  statements concerning anticipated operating expense levels and the availability of funds to meet cash requirements may be forward looking statements 
the company s actual future results may differ significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below and the accuracy of the company s internal estimates of revenue and operating expense levels 
customer concentration relatively few customers account for a substantial portion of the company s revenues 
sales to the company s ten largest customers in fiscal  and accounted for  and of revenues  respectively 
in fiscal   and sales to lam research corporation  the company s largest customer in these periods accounted for approximately   and of the company s revenues  respectively 
the company expects that sales to lam will continue to represent a significant portion of the company s revenues for the foreseeable future 
the company s customers generally do not enter into long term agreements obligating them to purchase the company s products 
a reduction or delay in orders from lam or other significant customers  including reductions or delays due to market  economic or competitive conditions in the semiconductor or flat panel display industries  could have a material adverse effect on the company s future financial condition  revenues and operating results 
dependence on cyclical industries the company s business is significantly dependent on capital expenditures by manufacturers of semiconductors 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and historically has experienced periods of oversupply  resulting in significantly reduced demands for capital equipment  including the products manufactured and marketed by the company 
the company s future financial condition  revenues and operating results may be materially adversely affected by semiconductor industry downturns or slowdowns 
as a result of a recent broad decline in capital spending by the semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry  the company expects that its revenues for at least the first quarter of fiscal will be lower than the comparable period of fiscal there can be no assurance as to when  if ever  capital spending in the semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry will recover 
reliance on oem customers  lengthy sales cycle the company s products are principally sold to oems which incorporate the company s products into their equipment 
due to the significant capital commitments usually incurred by semiconductor and flat panel display manufacturers in their purchase of the oem s equipment  these manufacturers demand highly reliable products which require as long as several years for oems to develop 
the company s revenues are therefore primarily dependent upon the timing and effectiveness of the efforts of its oem customers in developing and marketing equipment incorporating the company s products 
there can be no assurance that any equipment incorporating the company s products will be marketed successfully by the company s customers

japanese market the japanese semiconductor and flat panel display process equipment markets are large and difficult for foreign companies to penetrate 
the company believes that increasing its penetration of the japanese market is important to its business  and that it is currently at a competitive disadvantage to japanese suppliers  many of which have long standing collaborative relationships with japanese semiconductor and flat panel display process equipment manufacturers 
moreover  the company s ability to compete effectively in the japanese market may be limited by the company s size and its geographic location 
although the company intends to expand its direct presence in japan  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve significant sales to  or compete successfully in  japan

highly competitive industry the markets for the company s products are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
many of the company s current and potential competitors have substantially greater resources than the company 
the company believes that its primary competition is from integrated oems that satisfy their semiconductor and flat panel display handling needs in house rather than by purchasing systems or modules from an independent supplier such as the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in selling its products to oems that currently satisfy their substrate handling needs in house  regardless of the performance or the price of the company s products 
moreover  there can be no assurance that these oems will not begin to commercialize their vacuum handling capabilities 
competitors may develop superior products or products of similar quality at the same or lower prices 
other technical innovations may impair the company s ability to market its products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully 
see business competition 
new products and technological change the semiconductor and flat panel display manufacturing industries have been characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry requirements and standards 
the company believes that these trends will continue into the foreseeable future 
the company s success will depend upon its ability to enhance its existing products and to develop new products to meet customer requirements and to achieve market acceptance 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in introducing products or product enhancements on a timely basis  if at all  or that the company will be able to market successfully these products and product enhancements once developed 
further  there can be no assurance that the company s products will not be rendered obsolete by new industry standards or changing technology

management of growth the company has recently gone through a period of rapid growth 
due to the level of technical and marketing expertise necessary to support its existing and new customers  the company must attract highly qualified and well trained personnel 
there can be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and it may become increasingly difficult for the company to hire such personnel 
the company s expansion may also significantly strain the company s management  manufacturing  financial and other resources 
there can be no assurance that the company s systems  procedures  controls and existing space will be adequate to support the company s operations 
failure to manage the company s growth properly could have a material adverse effect on the company s future financial condition  revenues and operating results 
quarterly fluctuations in operating results and market price of securities the company s quarterly operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on factors such as economic conditions in the semiconductor and flat panel display industries  the timing of significant orders and shipments of its products  changes and delays in product development  new product introductions by the company and its competitors  the mix of products sold by the company and competitive pricing pressures 
additionally  the company s vacuum central handling systems have high selling prices 
as a result  quarterly variations in systems sales will significantly affect the company s operating results 
moreover  customers may cancel or reschedule shipments and production difficulties could delay shipments 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s future financial condition  revenues and operating results 
the market price of the company s securities could also be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  and market conditions in the semiconductor industry  as well as general economic conditions and other factors external to the company
