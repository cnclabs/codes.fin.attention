during  the company launched its gold medal rooms program designed to strengthen the company s ability to gain additional market share and pricing advantage relative to its competitors 
the program is intended to improve the quality  functionality and value of guest rooms by enhancing the decor package  including fresh  new colors  rich wood furniture  contemporary bathrooms  built in closets  oversized desks  inch televisions and new draperies and bedspreads 
service enhancements include movies on demand  interactive video games from nintendo  dataport telephones for computer connections and greatly expanded free television channel choices 
as of january   a total of inns had either been completed or were undergoing construction related to the gold medal rooms program

the company does not adjust its available rooms or occupancy percentage for rooms unavailable due to construction as a result of this program 
the company acquired eleven inns during the year ended december  and six inns during the year ended december  for conversion to the la quinta brand 
in some cases acquisition and conversion of properties is more cost effective than new construction

during  the company approved the construction of ten inns which are expected to open between april and december on june   aew partners  lp aew notified the company that it would exercise  subject to certain conditions  its option to convert two thirds of its ownership interest in la quinta development partners  lp lqdp into  shares of the company s common stock 
aew also agreed to sell the remaining one third of its ownership interest in lqdp to the company for a negotiated price of million in cash collectively  the aew transaction 
the aew transaction was consummated on july  upon conversion of the partnership interest into la quinta common stock  the company issued  shares of the company s common stock having a fair market value of million based on the july  new york stock exchange closing price 
the conversion was accounted for by increasing shareholders equity by the million value of the option and recording a million non recurring  non cash adjustment entitled conversion of partner s interest into common stock below net earnings in the statement of operations 
there was therefore no net effect to shareholders equity as a result of this accounting treatment 
the sale to la quinta of aew s remaining one third interest in lqdp was accounted for as an acquisition of a minority interest and purchase accounting was applied 
on july   the company purchased nine inns which it managed and which were previously held in two unincorporated joint ventures with cigna investments  inc the cigna partnerships 
the company has continued to operate these properties as la quinta inns
