item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations focuses primarily on liquidity  capital resources and the results of the company s operations 
this item should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
the historical results of operations are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected from future performance 
the company has invested substantial equity and effort to evolve from a one product qemm provider to a more diversified software producer 
quarterdeck has recently commenced a substantial restructuring of its operations and has experienced  and anticipates further  substantial changes to its competitive environment 
elements of quarterdeck s strategy are to focus on the integration of the acquisitions that have been completed since june and to improve the speed of development and release of new products or enhanced versions of existing products to better compete in a rapidly changing marketplace 
partially as a result of the acquisitions and subsequent restructuring  the company believes it is now well positioned to provide a broad range of software products that enhance computing on desktop pc s  the internet and intranet 
in addition to an analysis of recent and historical financial results  the following discussion includes an analysis of certain of the company s business risks  including risks which are inherent to software development as well as specific trends and uncertainties relating to the competitive environment in which the company operates 
the company has sought to identify the most significant risks to its business 
however  the company cannot predict whether  or to what extent any of such risks may be realized nor can there be any assurance that the company has identified all possible issues which the company might face 
in particular  the company has recently completed a number of acquisitions and made investments in certain companies and is in the process of restructuring its operations in an attempt to maximize the benefit of such acquisitions 
there can be no guarantee that such acquisitions will ultimately be beneficial 
this form k contains forward looking statements which are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of within this form k  words such as believes  anticipates  plans  expects  intends  designed to and similar expressions reflecting something other than historical fact are intended to identify forward looking statements  but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements 
these forward looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties  including the timely development and market acceptance of products and technologies  sell through of products in the sales channel  successful integration of acquisitions  the ability to secure additional sources of financing  the ability to reduce operating expenses and other factors described throughout this form k and in the company s other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the actual results that the company achieves may differ materially from any forward looking statements due to such risks and uncertainties 
the company undertakes no obligations to revise or update any forward looking statements in order to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this report 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net revenues represented by certain data derived from the company s consolidated statements of operations year ended september  net revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative acquisition  restructuring and other charges litigation settlement total operating expenses operating income loss interest income  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss fiscal compared to fiscal net revenues net revenues for the fiscal year ended september  increased by or  over the fiscal year ended september  the increase in net revenues compared with the prior year period resulted primarily from broadening the company s product portfolio throughout fiscal through acquisitions and product development 
after adding back returns and allowances  gross revenues for the year were  representing a increase or  over the prior fiscal year 
the  difference between net and gross revenues for the fiscal year ended september  primarily represents returns and allowances charged to operations during the fiscal year with  remaining in the reserve for returns at fiscal year end versus  at the prior fiscal year end 
the increase in revenues is also the result of the company s efforts to broaden its distribution competency through expansion of its distribution network and acquisition of a direct sales organization 
however  the company experienced a significant decline in net revenues in the second half of fiscal as compared to the first half of the year primarily due to reduced demand for many of its products particularly memory management products 
this decline continued during the september quarter which resulted in the recording of  of additional return reserves for fiscal the company believes that the decline in sell through of memory management products is primarily attributed to the continuing decrease in the cost of memory dram  controversy surrounding the efficacy of a competitor s product softram  together with the fact that current versions of the company s memory management products are nearing the end of their product life cycle see page for further discussion 
the company released a new version of magnaram in september of and plans to release an updated version of qemm in the coming months 
the delayed release of procomm from fall to february  among other factors  led to unusually high initial sell through levels during the quarter ended march a return to normal sales levels during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal negatively impacted net revenue in the second half of fiscal the company released a new version of procomm for windows at the end of the fiscal year 
continued weakness in sales of the company s memory management and or communications products would have a material adverse effect on future revenues 
the reduction in sell through of the company s memory management and communication products resulted in higher channel inventory levels 
in order to bring inventory levels in line with current and anticipated sell through levels the company reduced shipments of these products during the second half of fiscal in addition to the revenue reductions resulting from the reduced shipment levels during the second half of fiscal  the company recorded an additional reserve for sales returns to provide for estimated returns as well as actual returns during the september quarter 
this additional reserve further reduced net revenues for the three months ended september  to approximately million 
consistent with prior years  the company establishes allowances for estimated returns and exchanges as a reserve against revenues 
once the company recognized that sell through was less than anticipated  additional reserves were recorded 
quarterdeck is taking steps to improve its ability to receive accurate  sell through information on a timely basis 
net revenues from european and other international distributors  dealers and end users outside of the united states amounted to  and  for the fiscal years ended september  and respectively 
due to the inherent uncertainties in software development and in the microcomputer software industry  the company is unable to predict whether the net revenue trends noted above will continue 
cost of revenues the company s cost of revenues includes product packaging  documentation and media  manufacturing expenses  amortization of capitalized software costs  technical support and production costs as well as translation costs and certain license fees paid to third parties 
cost of revenues amounted to  in fiscal and  in fiscal the cost of revenues increased from of net revenues in fiscal to of net revenues in fiscal this increase was primarily due to higher production and support costs as a result of slower than expected integration of acquired operations 
in addition  the company increased reserves for obsolete or slow moving inventory by  the increase primarily resulted from increased levels of product in inventory with respect to the company s memory management  communication and other utility products the company has and is continuing to release updates for  in addition to internet products the company no longer plans to actively market 
capitalized software development and purchased software costs are generally amortized over one to three year periods  commencing upon initial product release 
fluctuations in amortization expense between periods may arise depending on the amount of software costs incurred and capitalized for particular software products and their respective release dates 
amortization of capitalized software costs increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase in cost of revenues is also due to amortization acceleration or write off of  of capitalized third party software development costs relating to products that have experienced reductions in demand or internet products the company no longer plans to actively market 
see further discussion under research and development 
future cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues will depend  in addition to the amount of amortization of capitalized software  on the mix of sales by product  by domestic versus international  by single unit versus multiple license packages  and the mix of third party developed and licensed products versus internally developed products  among other things 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  cost of revenues includes certain expenses that do not vary directly with sales  therefore higher net revenues may produce a lower percentage of cost of revenues and vice versa 
the microcomputer software industry has experienced increased price competition in recent years 
the company anticipates that increased price competition will continue in the future and may result in reduced average unit selling prices and corresponding reduced margins 
operating expenses approximately  of fiscal expenses relating to certain acquisitions consummated during the year were treated as immaterial poolings 
consequently  prior year results of operations exclude comparable prior year expenses 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits and consulting fees to support product development  including product testing and documentation 
research and development expense increased by  from fiscal  while increasing as a percentage of net revenues from to 
the increase in research and development expense is due in part to increased research and development staffing levels and to increases in payments to third parties for contracted product development required to support the company s expanded product development efforts 
the increased expense as a percent of net revenues is also due to investment r d spending for internet products which did not have revenue in proportion to development spending as compared to more established utility products 
additionally  in fiscal  development resources continued to focus on products for which technological feasibility had not yet been established and therefore development costs were expensed  rather than capitalized 
the costs of software product development are capitalized once technological feasibility is achieved 
costs incurred prior to attaining technological feasibility are expensed in the period incurred as research and development expenses 
during fiscal and  the company did not capitalize any internal software development costs  since the majority of development efforts incurred during the period related to new products for which technological feasibility had not been established 
software development costs relating to products for which technological feasibility had been established during were immaterial 
in addition  the recoverability of the cost of new product development  including products in lines of business the company has not engaged in previously  is more uncertain than that for product upgrades resulting in expense rather than capitalization 
during fiscal and  the company purchased and capitalized software costs amounting to  and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to the addition of  of capitalized software relating to the pinnacle technology acquisition cleansweep and  relating to the limbex acquisition webcompass partially offset by write offs relating to restructuring  and acquisition related expenses and accelerated amortization due primarily to internet products which the company does not intend to actively market 
the company believes that to remain competitive it is necessary to continue to invest in software development efforts while at the same time considering the acquisition and or license of complementary software products 
the company anticipates that spending for software development and purchased software will continue as a significant expense in the future 
however  because of the inherent uncertainties of software development projects and the software market in general  there can be no assurance that software development efforts or additional purchased software will result in successful product introductions or increased sales 
sales and marketing  and general and administrative sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related costs of administrative  sales and marketing  customer service and support personnel as well as advertising  trade show and promotional expenses and facilities costs 
sales and marketing expenses increased by  from fiscal  while increasing as a percentage of net revenues from to 
market development funds  advertising and other variable sales and marketing expenses were budgeted based upon expected sales levels which did not occur and as a result such expenses significantly increased as a percentage of net revenues 
the company has since changed its practice such that variable sales and marketing expenses are based to a greater extent upon underlying sell through levels and to a lesser extent upon future sales estimates 
the increase in dollars primarily consists of increases in sales and marketing salaries of  relating in part to increases in telemarketing staff 
in addition  direct and channel marketing expenses increased by  over the prior year primarily relating to increased direct mail activities at the company s clearwater  florida telemarketing facility as well as the vertisoft acquisition which included a direct mail operation 
channel marketing increases are primarily due to increased spending relating to the launch of new products in the retail market as well as the outsourcing of the sales function for vertisoft products 
finally  marketing development funds  packaging and collateral related expenses increased by approximately  and  versus prior year respectively  which also contributed to the increase 
quarterdeck believes substantial sales and marketing efforts are essential to achieve revenue growth and to maintain and enhance the company s competitive position 
accordingly  with the continued expansion of its product lines and international operations  as well as the introduction of new and upgraded products  including products recently released and currently being developed for windows and windows nt  quarterdeck expects the expenses associated with these efforts to continue to constitute its most significant operating expense 
there can be no assurance that these sales and marketing efforts will be successful in achieving their intended results 
general and administrative expenses increased by  from fiscal and also increased as a percentage of net revenues from to 
general and administrative expenses were adversely impacted by redundancies relating to acquisitions which were not integrated as quickly as expected 
components of the increase include  relating to increased facilities costs including rent  depreciation amortization and associated costs   of increased corporate communications  public and investor relations costs   of increased salary expense primarily relating to finance and mis functions that were not integrated   of increased outside legal services and  of increased telephone  insurance and travel related spending 
primarily as a result of operations integration and overall spending reductions  general and administrative expenses may decrease during fiscal acquisition and other charges in connection with the various acquisitions completed in fiscal see above  and summary of significant accounting policies and note of notes to consolidated financial statements  significant acquisition costs were incurred 
through the first nine months of fiscal the company incurred acquisition charges of  related primarily to the acquisitions of inset  datastorm and future labs versus  as a result of the acquisitions 
during the fourth quarter the company incurred an additional  of acquisition charges related to vertisoft  limbex  interlink  and pinnacle technology 
of that amount   was incurred as a result of the write off of acquired in process research and development 
restructuring costs during september of the company began the implementation of a comprehensive corporate wide restructuring plan 
the plan is designed to focus the company s development and marketing efforts on those products and technologies with the most significant growth opportunities while optimizing profitability on certain of the company s products that have experienced lower demand and are at the end of their product life cycle 
the plan focuses on the reduction and elimination of development and marketing efforts in areas where the market has either not materialized  the product has become a commodity or a part of the operating system or browser 
in addition  the plan calls for the company to minimize redundancies resulting from the recent acquisitions through integration of the finance  administrative  sales  marketing and operations related functions 
the company recorded a charge of  for fiscal relating to restructuring 
restructuring charges include  of severance   of facility related costs to reserve for estimated lease obligations net of estimated sublease income or negotiated settlements as well as closing  consolidating or relocating offices and related costs including write offs of excess equipment  furniture  fixtures and leasehold improvements 
charges also include write offs of  of prepaid royalties and capitalized software costs relating to products the company no longer plans to actively market 
as part of the plan  the company reduced its work force by approximately  eliminating approximately positions 
the company believes the focusing of the development and marketing efforts combined with the cost structure reductions will improve its competitiveness and position the company to return to profitability 
income taxes at september   the company did not have a net deferred tax asset on the balance sheet due to a valuation allowance of of the net deferred tax asset of million 
see also note to the accompanying financial statements 
the net deferred tax asset of million before applying the valuation allowance is comprised of the estimated tax effect of expected future reversing temporary differences and tax net operating losses  relating in part to charges taken for book purposes that are not deductible for federal income tax purposes until the amounts are paid in the future 
management believes that in light of recent financial results it is not appropriate to record a deferred tax asset until such time that the company is able to establish that it becomes more likely than not that the company will realize some or all of the benefit of the net deferred tax asset 
fiscal compared to fiscal net revenues net revenues for the fiscal year ended september  increased by or  over the fiscal year ended september  the increase in net revenues compared with the prior year period results primarily from broadening the company s product portfolio throughout fiscal through product development and acquisitions 
the company has also broadened its distribution capabilities through expansion of its distribution network and acquisition of a direct sales organization 
the company released several new products during fiscal including a complete line of products for use on the internet and private distributed data networks 
the first of these products  quarterdeck webauthor  was released in march three other internet related applications  quarterdeck mosaic  quarterdeck internetsuite  and quarterdeck webserver  were released in june the company also released several new utility products during fiscal which included magnaram  cleansweep  winprobe  and gamerunner 
the company s largest subsidiary  datastorm  did not have any new releases during fiscal net revenues from european and other international distributors  dealers and end users outside of the united states amounted to  and  representing and of the company s total net revenues for the and fiscal years  respectively 
cost of revenues cost of revenues amounted to  in fiscal and  in fiscal the cost of revenues decreased from of net revenues in fiscal to of net revenues in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the amortization of capitalized software costs  as well as substantially higher revenues in fiscal over which indirect costs and expenses  including production and technical support costs  were spread 
capitalized software development and purchased software costs are generally amortized over one to three year periods  commencing upon initial product release 
fluctuations in amortization expense between periods may arise depending on the amount of software costs incurred and capitalized for particular software products and their respective release dates 
amortization of capitalized software costs decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the decrease in amortization of software development costs resulted primarily from the shift in the nature of product development from to see further discussion under research and development 
research and development research and development expense increased by  from fiscal  while increasing as a percentage of net revenues from to 
the increase in research and development expense is due in part to increases in research and development staffing levels and to increases in payments to third parties for contracted product development required to support the company s expanded product development efforts 
additionally  in fiscal  development resources were shifted to products for which technological feasibility had not been established and therefore more development costs were expensed  rather than capitalized  in the periods incurred 
the company capitalized  of internal software development and purchased software costs during fiscal during fiscal  the company did not capitalize any internal software development costs  since the majority of development efforts incurred during the period related to new products for which technological feasibility had not been established 
software development costs relating to new products for which technological feasibility had been established during fiscal are immaterial 
the development of new products requires significantly more resources to reach technological feasibility as compared to the development effort required to reach technological feasibility for upgraded products 
accordingly  the decrease in the amounts capitalized from to was attributable to the development during fiscal of a number of new products which had not yet reached technological feasibility as compared to prior year product development consisting primarily of upgrades to existing products 
in addition  the recoverability of the cost of new product development  including products in lines of business the company has not engaged in previously  is more uncertain than that for product upgrades 
during fiscal  the company purchased and capitalized software amounting to  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expense sales and marketing expenses increased by  from fiscal  while decreasing as a percentage of net revenues from to 
general and administrative expenses decreased by  from fiscal and also decreased as a percentage of net revenues from to  primarily resulting from the benefits realized in relating to the fiscal restructuring 
acquisition  restructuring and other charges in connection with the various acquisitions completed in fiscal see summary of significant accounting policies and note of notes to consolidated financial statements  significant acquisition costs were incurred 
in connection with the acquisition of landmark in june  acquisition costs amounting to  were recorded 
in connection with the acquisitions of starnine and internetware in september  acquisition costs amounting to  and  were recorded 
these expenses principally include fees for financial advisory  legal and accounting services  personnel severance and benefits  and other related expenses 
in connection with the acquisition of assets from prospero systems research  inc in september   of purchased  in process research and development was charged to acquisition  restructuring and other charges 
the results for fiscal included a pretax charge totaling  relating to restructuring activities and other non recurring charges 
the charges related to the reduction or elimination of non core product lines and related development efforts 
capitalized costs of  relating to the reductions and eliminations were written down or written off as restructuring and non recurring charges at september  other related restructuring costs of  included the estimated lease obligations for offices and facilities which were or planned to be closed  consolidated or relocated and the costs of closing as well as other related costs 
as part of the restructuring plan  the company reorganized its staff and reduced its workforce from approximately at june  to approximately at september  restructuring costs relating to the reduction in workforce amounted to  consisting of severance and termination payments and related costs 
the company also wrote off excess equipment and recorded other pretax charges amounting to  which resulted from the above restructuring activities 
income taxes at september   the company had a net deferred tax asset of  net of a valuation allowance of  this net deferred tax asset is comprised of the estimated tax effect of expected future reversing temporary differences  relating in part to charges taken for book purposes that are not deductible for federal income tax purposes until the amounts are paid in the future  net of the valuation allowance 
trends and uncertainties the computer software industry is subject to rapid technological changes often evidenced by new competing products and improvements in existing products 
quarterdeck depends on the successful development or acquisition and resulting sales of new products  including upgrades of existing products  to replace revenues from products introduced in prior periods that may have begun to experience reduced revenues 
if quarterdeck s current leading products become outdated and lose market share faster than those revenues are replaced by new products  or if new products or existing product upgrades are not introduced when planned or do not achieve the revenues anticipated by quarterdeck  quarterdeck s operating results could be materially adversely affected 
even with normal development cycles  the market environment can change so quickly that features in products can become outdated soon after market introduction 
these events may occur in the future and may have an adverse effect on future revenues and operating results 
while quarterdeck expects that memory management will continue to provide benefit to users of windows and legacy systems  the company has expanded its focus from a sole reliance on memory management to a broader base of desktop utilities 
in september  quarterdeck released the first of several new desktop utility products for windows  including winprobe a system and hardware diagnostic tool  cleansweep a disk management utility and magnaram a memory compression utility 
qemm  quarterdeck s leading memory management product  was upgraded to version with the inclusion of several new technologies and is targeted to provide solutions for windows as well as new enhanced support for windows and continued support for dos 
with the acquisition of datastorm technologies in march  the company acquired the procomm communications product line 
in july  quarterdeck released a new utility for windows with the release of fix it a software and hardware diagnostic conflict resolution tool 
also in july  the company released a new version of winprobe for windows with the acquisition of vertisoft in july  quarterdeck acquired additional utility products including zip it a drag and drop utility for creating and maintaining compressed files  name it a utility to allow windows long filenames in bit applications and remove it a windows uninstaller utility 
the combination of remove it and cleansweep give quarterdeck a leading position in the windows uninstaller market 
while quarterdeck has reduced its reliance on memory management with the acquisition of additional utility and communications products  there can be no assurance that any of these products and or technologies will continue to provide sufficient benefit to the user over and above what the base operating systems  applications and hardware can provide 
quarterdeck is devoting substantial efforts to the development of software products that are designed to operate on windows and windows nt 
microsoft corporation may incorporate advanced utilities or other features in windows or windows nt that may decrease the demand for certain of the company s products  including those under development 
if quarterdeck is not able to continue to successfully  and timely develop and market products that function under windows and windows nt  and offer value to windows and windows nt users beyond that which is offered in the base operating systems  future revenues would be adversely affected 
future competitive product releases may cause disruptions in orders for the company s products while users and the marketplace evaluate the competitive products 
the extent of the disruption in orders and the impact on future orders of the company s products will depend on various factors that are not fully known at this time 
among those factors are the level of functionality  performance and features included in the final release of competitive products and the market s evaluation of those products as compared to the then current functionality  performance and features of the company s products 
the company s internet related products compete with internet connectivity  search  information management  access  creation and server tools from a variety of companies  including microsoft corporation  netscape communications corporation and other connectivity  networking and internet software application developers  internet access providers and other on line service providers  as well as operating system vendors  including microsoft corporation and ibm 
certain competitors have also made versions of their internet connectivity  search  access  information management  creation and server products available on the internet for users to download at no charge or for extended evaluation 
in addition  the market for internet products has been adversely impacted as a result of pc hardware  pc operating system and browser vendors incorporating internet tools  functions or capabilities within their software or pc hardware and thereby reducing the market for stand alone internet products 
quarterdeck is dedicating substantial efforts on products and services for the communications and internet markets and expects that a significant portion of future revenues will come from these products and services 
the revenues from such new products and services may be less than quarterdeck anticipates due to various factors including the timing of release in relation to competitive products and services  and uncertainties surrounding the rate and extent of development of these new and emerging markets 
quarterdeck s internet related products and services are dependent on the viability and continued growth of the internet and world wide web  and its expanded use by businesses and individuals for networking and communications 
there are currently few laws or regulations directly applicable to access or to commerce on the internet 
however  due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet  it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the internet 
such laws and regulations may cover issues such as user privacy  pricing and characteristics and quality of products and services 
the telecommunications act of the act  which was recently enacted and the judicial interpretation of which is uncertain  imposes criminal penalties for transmission of or allowing access to certain obscene communications over the internet and other computer services and contains additional provisions intended to protect minors 
the enactment of the act  and of any similar laws or regulations in the future  may decrease the growth or use of the internet  which could in turn decrease the demand for the company s services and products and increase the company s cost of doing business or otherwise have an adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the acquisition of limbex  vertisoft  future labs  datastorm  inset  and other acquisitions completed during fiscal have broadened the company s product portfolio and sales distribution channels 
however  the acquisitions have resulted in the company competing with other companies and in markets where it has not previously competed 
the company has also made investments in certain companies and technologies 
there are significant business risks associated with acquisitions  including the successful integration of the companies in an efficient and timely manner  the coordination of research and development and sales efforts  the retention of key personnel  diversion of management s attention away from day to day matters and the integration of the acquired products 
additionally  there may be an adverse impact on revenues of acquired companies due to the transition of products sales and marketing and research and development activities 
the company s results for fiscal were negatively impacted by slower than anticipated integration and the company s future success will depend  in part  on its ability to integrate the operations of acquired companies and effectively utilize the acquired intellectual property 
the company s distributor and reseller customers also carry the products of microsoft corporation and other of the company s competitors  many of whom have substantially greater financial resources than the company 
the distributors and resellers have limited capital to invest in inventory and their decisions to purchase the company s products and in the case of resellers  to give them critical shelf space  is partly a function of pricing  terms and special promotions offered by the company s competitors  over which the company has no control and which it cannot predict 
there can be no assurance that the company will negotiate successfully with resellers to obtain shelf space and other terms needed to sell company s products at the levels currently anticipated 
the company s pattern of revenues and earnings were affected during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  and may be affected in the future  by the phenomenon known as channel fill 
channel fill occurs following the introduction of a new product or a new version of products as distributors buy significant quantities of the new product or version in anticipation of sales of such product or version 
following such purchases  the rate of distributors purchases often declines  depending on the rates of purchases by end users or sell through 
the phenomenon of channel fill may also occur in anticipation of price increases or in response to sales promotions or incentives  some of which may be designed to encourage customers to accelerate purchases that might otherwise occur in later periods 
channels may also become filled simply because the distributors are unable to  or do not  sell their inventories to retail distribution or end users as anticipated 
if sell through does not occur at a sufficient rate  distributors will delay purchases or cancel orders in later periods or return prior purchases in order to reduce their inventories 
consequently  there can be no assurance that existing inventories will not adversely impact the sales in future periods 
in addition  between the date the company announces a new version or new product and the date of release  distributors  dealers and end users often delay purchases  cancel orders or return products in anticipation of the availability of the new version or new product 
such order delays or cancellations may cause material fluctuations in revenues from one quarter to the next 
net revenues may be materially affected favorably or adversely by these effects 
the company operates with relatively little order backlog  therefore  if near term demand for the company s products weaken in a given quarter  there could be a material adverse effect on revenues and on the company s operating results 
like other manufacturers of packaged software products  quarterdeck is exposed to the risk of product returns from distributors  reseller and individual customers 
there can be no assurance that actual returns in excess of recorded allowances will not result in a material adverse effect on business  operating results and financial condition 
factors affecting quarterly results and stock price the company has in the past experienced wide fluctuations in its operating results and stock price  and the company s future operating results and stock price could be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
the company s revenues and quarterly operating results may experience significant fluctuations and be unpredictable as the result of a number of factors including  among others  introduction of new or enhanced products by the company or its competitors  rapid technological changes in the company s markets  seasonality of revenues  changes in operating expenses and general economic conditions 
any shortfalls in revenues or quarterly results could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock in any given period 
net income per share is calculated using the treasury stock method see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
increases in the price of quarterdeck s stock can have an adverse impact on the calculation of net income per share in that period as more outstanding instruments are included as common shares outstanding 
as a result of the foregoing factors and other factors that may arise in the future  the market price of the company s common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations over a short period of time 
these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to the company  to changes in analysts earnings estimates  or to factors affecting the computer industry or the securities markets in general 
liquidity and capital resources at september   cash and cash equivalents totaled  and had further declined to approximately  as of december  these amounts can be compared to  at september  working capital at september  amounted to a deficit of  a decrease of  as compared to  at september  during the year ended september  the company s total cash and short term investments has declined by the net amount of  the decrease in cash and short term investment balances resulted primarily from the company s losses for fiscal  including significant acquisition and restructuring costs  payment of distributions to stockholders of acquired companies prior to acquisition  approximately million of investments made by the company in strategic technologies  including the stock of certain companies possessing such technology  and million in capital investments  including million for the construction of a new facility in columbia  missouri 
on august   the company s datastorm subsidiary secured construction financing for its new facility the datastorm facility from a bank for up to million with an interest rate equal to the bank s commercial base rate  currently  secured by the datastorm facility 
the loan is guaranteed by quarterdeck and is believed to be sufficient to complete construction 
the principal amount outstanding as of september  was  the principal amount plus any unpaid interest is due february  it is the company s intention to extend the term of this loan and it has received a preliminary commitment from the lender to do so 
management is presently exploring the potential of a sale leaseback transaction and other long term financing options with respect to the datastorm facility 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining such long term financing with acceptable terms and conditions 
on september   the company issued  shares of series b convertible preferred stock  stated value per share the series b preferred stock  and a warrant the warrant to acquire shares of common stock for million in cash 
the securities were issued to an institutional investor in an overseas offering pursuant to regulation s of the securities act of  as amended 
the series b preferred stock became convertible into shares of common stock on november   and will automatically convert into common stock on september  to the extent any shares of series b preferred stock remain outstanding at that time 
each share of series b preferred stock is convertible into the number of shares of common stock equal to the quotient of i divided by ii the conversion price 
the conversion price is the lesser of i of the average of the daily volume weighted average prices of the common stock on the nasdaq national market system the market price during the trading day period ending two trading days before the date on which the company receives a notice of conversion from a holder of the series b preferred stock the conversion date  and ii of the average of the market price of the common stock during the first five trading days of the trading day period ending two trading days before the conversion date 
assuming a conversion price of based on of the average of the market price for the trading day periods ending on december   each share of series b preferred stock would be convertible into shares of common stock  or an aggregate of  shares of common stock upon conversion of all shares of series b preferred stock 
on march   the company issued million principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes  due  to a single institutional investor in a private placement pursuant to the terms of a note agreement  dated march  the note agreement 
the notes are convertible generally after april   at an initial conversion price of per share 
the conversion price is adjustable for certain below market equity issuances and the notes contain other customary anti dilution provisions 
the notes may be prepaid without penalty  subject to conversion  anytime between april and april if the company s common stock had been trading  for of the trading days preceding notice of prepayment  at approximately above the then current conversion price 
the note agreement limits the company s indebtedness for borrowed funds  other than the notes  to of consolidated net worth as defined in the note agreement 
in april  the company s datastorm subsidiary borrowed million from a bank to partially finance the completion of the datastorm facility 
the loan is secured by datastorm s equipment and bears interest at a rate of per annum 
the rate was subsidized  in part by the state of missouri in exchange for certain local employment targets 
as part of the company s restructuring the company has revised downward the level of personnel at this location 
in addition  as a result of the restructuring it has written off a significant portion of the equipment collateral 
the company and the lender have agreed to a repayment plan providing for the repayment of  between january and march with the balance payable by april  on december   the company s revolving credit facility with bank of america was amended  and the bank waived the company s non compliance with certain financial covenants therein for the quarter ended september  the company may borrow of eligible accounts receivable as defined in the credit agreement up to million 
as of september   the maximum borrowing the company was eligible for under this line was approximately million 
the line is secured by quarterdeck s domestic accounts receivable and inventory 
the current term of the line of credit matures june  the line can be used for general corporate purposes  including investments and acquisitions  and bears interest at the bank s reference prime interest rate plus 
the line is subject to the company complying with certain customary financial covenants and restrictions  including a compensating balance of million  a prohibition of the payment of dividends  other than those payable solely in capital stock  and a prohibition of any stock repurchase activity 
as of september   the company had borrowings of million outstanding under the line 
the company believes existing cash and cash equivalents  plus funds provided by operations  borrowing capacity under the line of credit and projected borrowing against  or sale of  the datastorm facility should be sufficient to fund operations for the coming twelve months 
nevertheless  the company is presently exploring various financing alternatives  including equipment financing  secured debt  convertible debt  additional sales of equity securities and the sale of certain of its prior investments in order to finance the core business of the company and help provide adequate working capital for operations 
in addition  the expense reductions resulting from the restructuring are anticipated to provide additional funds from operations in future quarters 
however  there is no assurance that increased sales will occur or that any such increase will result in adequate operating funds  or that such additional financing will be available  or if available  will be available on acceptable terms 
should product shipments be delayed or should the company experience significant shortfalls in planned revenues  or not achieve sufficient cost savings as a result of the restructuring  or experience unforeseen fixed expenses  the company believes it has the ability to make additional reductions to variable expenses to extend its capital 
any decision to obtain financing through debt or through equity investment will depend on various factors  including  among others  financial market conditions  strategic acquisition and investment opportunities  and developments in the company s markets 
the sale of additional equity securities or future conversion of any convertible debt would result in additional dilution to the company s stockholders 
the company conducts business in various foreign currencies and is therefore subject to the transaction exposures that arise from foreign exchange rate movements between the dates that foreign currency transactions are recorded and the date that they are consummated 
the company is also subject to certain exposures arising from the translation and consolidation of the financial results of its foreign subsidiaries 
there can be no assurance that actions taken to manage such exposures will be successful or that future changes in currency exchange rates will not have a material impact on the company s future operating results 
the company does not hedge either its translation risk or its economic risk
