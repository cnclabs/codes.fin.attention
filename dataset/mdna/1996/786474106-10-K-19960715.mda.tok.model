item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview due to the company s historical and anticipated growth  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this report 
automotive division 
the automotive division commenced operations as part of valentec in may product qualification and initial production began in july with the first significant sales occurring in october in march  the company signed a five year requirements contract with trw  contemplating increasing deliveries of airbags over the term of the contract 
in order to obtain the five year contract  the company had to position itself to meet trw s delivery schedules 
as a result  the company incurred significant start up costs in and and continues to incur start up costs as it expands its operations 
as a result of these costs  the operating results of the automotive division are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 
the company signed a two year agreement and commenced manufacturing of passenger side airbags in europe for trw in december and also received orders and commenced manufacturing driver side airbags in the us for trw in april as the company continues to expand worldwide  it will continue to experience variability in its operating results 
during fiscal year  the company operated a temporary facility in germany in order to meet trw europe s rapidly growing demand for airbags  which adversely affected the company s operating profits during that fiscal year 
the company currently subcontracts certain aspects of the manufacturing process for airbags in europe to two subcontractors in the czech republic 
the company expects to replace the functions of these subcontractors with its own facility currently under construction in the czech republic 
the automotive division s business is also subject to the seasonal characteristics of the automotive industry in which there are plant shutdowns in the third and fourth quarters of each calendar year  typically resulting in lower shipments of airbags during these quarters 
additionally  the company s operating results could be impacted by the timing of the introduction of new models of automobiles for which the company manufactures airbags  changes in consumer vehicle preferences and major labor disputes in the automobile industry 
defense division 
historically  the demand for the defense division s products has been driven primarily by the us government s purchase of small and medium caliber military ammunition 
in september  the company was awarded the systems contract 
under the systems contract  the company serves as the prime contractor coordinating the manufacture and assembly of the product components by various subcontractors 
the systems contract is accounted for on the percentage of completion basis 
accordingly  the company will experience variability in revenues from the systems contract because revenues are based upon the costs incurred in fulfilling this contract 
in december  the company submitted a bid for a million follow on order to the systems contract  which was unsuccessful 
while the company continues to bid on other systems contract opportunities  the company s failure to receive the award for the follow on order could adversely affect the level of sales in the company s defense division upon completion of the current systems contract 
results of operations year ended march  compared to year ended march  net sales 
net sales for the automotive division increased to  for the year ended march  from  for the same period in the prior year 
the automotive division s unit sales increased approximately over the prior year  while overall sales increased by 
the company s unit sales continued to increase reflecting higher sales of both passenger and driver side airbags 
sales were unfavorably impacted in the current period by the softening us automotive market and a changing product mix in europe  and to a lesser extent  decreases in material prices  delays on certain model year programs by certain original equipment manufacturers and the gm labor dispute in the fourth quarter of fiscal year net sales for the defense division increased to  for the year ended march  from  for the same period in the prior year 
sales increased period to period as a result of significantly higher revenues from the systems contract and  to a lesser extent  increased shipments of metal ordnance components 
due to certain delays in the systems contract  the company expects to experience variability quarter to quarter in fiscal year sales for the defense division are expected to be generally lower in fiscal year gross profit 
gross profit for the automotive division increased to  for the year ended march  from  for the prior year 
the improvement in gross profit resulted primarily from the increased sales volume  and to a lesser extent from greater efficiencies related to higher levels of production 
gross profit was unfavorably impacted in the current fiscal year by certain program delays and the gm labor dispute in the fourth fiscal quarter 
during the year ended march   the continued improvement in the gross profit of the automotive division s north american operations was partially offset by certain expenses related to the expansion of the automotive division s european operations 
specifically  during the year ended march   trw europe s accelerated demand for airbags in europe required the company to operate  on a temporary basis  a high cost facility in germany pending the transfer of certain manufacturing operations to two czech subcontractors 
margins in europe are expected to remain lower than in the us until the company transitions its european passenger airbag manufacturing to its facility in the czech republic currently under construction 
the company expects this transition to occur in fiscal certain costs relating to the launching of new programs in north america and europe have been capitalized and will be amortized over the estimated lives of such programs 
gross profit for the defense division increased to  for the year ended march  from  for the prior year

specifically  accelerated demand for airbags in europe by trw required the company during the year ended march   to operate  on a temporary basis  a high cost facility in germany pending the transfer of certain manufacturing operations to a czech subcontractor 
certain costs relating to the launching of new programs in north america and europe have been capitalized and will be amortized over the estimated lives of such programs 
gross profit for the defense division decreased to  for the year ended march  from  for the eleven months 
the gross profit declined as a result of lower margin sales from new defense and commercial programs and the phase out of several older  higher margin defense programs 
additionally  lower sales period to period at the galion facility impacted the division s fixed overhead absorption  further impacting gross profit 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the automotive division decreased to  for the year ended march  from  for the eleven months 
the decrease from period to period was due primarily to a  non recurring  non cash expense in the earlier period related to the issuance of shares of common stock to the champion holders see note to the company s consolidated financial statements  offset  to a large extent  by higher expenses in the current period related to the continued expansion of the company s businesses 
this expansion necessitated an increase in the number of support personnel  higher corporate overhead expenses as a result of being a public company and increased marketing expenses on higher sales volumes

the prior period also included a  non recurring  non cash expense related to the issuance of shares of common stock to the champion holders 
operating income for the defense division declined to  for the year ended march   compared to  for the eleven months

net income 
net income increased to  for the year ended march  from a loss of  for the eleven months as the higher net income of the automotive division exceeded the decline in the income of the defense division 
in addition  other income increased in the current period as a result of favorable foreign currency movements

gross profit loss of the automotive division for the four month period ended april  was  while there were no results of operations for the four month period ended april  cost of sales of the automotive division of  for the four month period ended april  exceeded net sales for such period as the company incurred significant start up costs including expenses incurred in qualifying the airbag products  hiring of management  installation of facilities and equipment in advance of customer orders and manufacturing start up costs 
gross profit for the defense division increased to  for the four month period ended april  from  for the four month period ended april  the increase in net sales was partially offset by higher material costs on certain products and an increase in overhead expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  for the automotive division for the four month period ended april   while there were no such expenses for the four month period ended april  these continued increases in selling  general and administrative expenses were due primarily to higher salary and benefit costs related to additional operational and administrative personnel hired to manage the expansion of the automotive division  and  to a lesser extent  higher commissions on higher sales volumes and increased corporate overhead allocations 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the defense division increased to  for the four month period ended april  from  for the four month period ended april  this increase is attributable primarily to a higher corporate overhead allocation 
operating income 
the company had an operating loss of  for the four month period ended april  compared to operating income of  for the four month period ended april  the operating loss in the later period is attributable to the automotive division s continued start up costs  offset in part by galion s operating income

on june   the company completed an additional equity offering which resulted in net proceeds to the company of approximately  including the underwriters exercise of the over allotment option 
the company has and will continue to use the net proceeds from this offering to expand and enhance its existing worldwide airbag manufacturing operations  to construct a new facility in the czech republic and enhance research and development and prototype capabilities

the company has received a proposal letter from a us bank to provide financing for the acquisition of phoenix in the form of a million term loan  amortizing over a period of four years 
the proposal does not constitute a commitment  which would be subject  among other conditions  to the completion of due diligence by the bank 
in connection with such term loan  the company would obtain a new million revolving credit facility replacing the existing credit facility and a non revolving stand by letter of credit facility to secure payment  if necessary  of the contingent purchase price for the acquisition of phoenix

new accounting pronouncement in march  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of fas 
fas requires the company to review long lived assets and certain intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in the event the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value is recorded 
fas also requires that long lived assets and certain intangible assets to be disposed of be recorded at the lower of carrying value or fair value less disposal costs 
management has deferred adoption of fas  which is effective for the company beginning in the fiscal year ending march  due to the complexities of the calculations that are required to implement fas  the effect on the company s consolidated financial statements of adopting this statement is not yet known nor reasonably estimable 
seasonality and inflation the automotive division s business is subject to the seasonal characteristics of the automotive industry in which there are seasonal plant shutdowns in the third and fourth calendar quarters of each year 
although the systems contract is not seasonal in nature  there will be variations in revenues from the systems contract based upon costs incurred by the company in fulfilling the systems contract in each quarter 
the majority of the defense division s ordnance manufacturing for us government and prime defense contractors occurs from january through september and there is generally a lower level of manufacturing and sales during the fourth calendar quarter 
the company does not believe that its operations to date have been materially affected by inflation
