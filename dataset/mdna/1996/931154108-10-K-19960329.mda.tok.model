item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations on july   the company  through certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries  acquired the fuel systems business of dyno industrier a 
s  oslo  norway dyno 
dyno supplies plastic fuel tanks to most european vehicle manufacturers through production facilities in belgium  france  germany  norway  spain and the united kingdom 
dyno s fuel systems business sales were approximately million in except as noted below  the results of operations for only include the results of dyno after july  compared to  compared to sales the company reported record sales in of million  an increase of 
excluding sales of million contributed by dyno  sales still reflected an increase of 
sales in were million compared to sales of million in  an increase of 
the million of additional sales in were divided primarily among the automotive market with a million increase and the small engine market with a million increase 
on a percentage basis  sales to the automotive market increased in increase without dyno sales compared to an increase in  while sales to the small engine market increased in compared to a increase in aftermarket sales were flat in compared to an increase of in sales of the company s original equipment automotive products were million in million without dyno  up from million in and million in in  the company was able to increase us based automotive product sales representing all automotive sales other than those of dyno by million or in spite of the us light vehicle market decline 
the us light vehicle market declined in to approximately million vehicles compared to approximately million in  a decrease 
us light vehicle sales increased by in and by in the company was able to record a sales increase of its us based automotive products in the face of a declining vehicle market due to increased sales of fuel modules up because of increased use of fuel modules in the light truck market and increased sales of fuel modules with higher dollar content 
light trucks which include minivans experienced moderate sales growth in the increase in fuel module sales was partially offset by the slower than scheduled start up of a customer s major new vehicle line with significant fuel module product content 
the company expects the growth in sales of fuel modules to continue as they are applied to more new models of passenger cars and light trucks 
fuel modules also continue to gain greater acceptance in the european and the south american markets 
sales of fuel pumps increased by and sales of fuel rails declined by in compared to because of the decline in us passenger car sales during plastic fuel tank sales in the us added million of revenue in compared to million in  as the company s us sales of plastic fuel tanks did not begin until the fourth quarter of production of plastic fuel tanks increased in the fourth quarter of for a second vehicle platform and production is expected to increase again in for a third vehicle platform 
sales of component parts in added million to us based automotive product sales compared to million in dyno sales added million to automotive product sales for the last five months of in  the company was able to increase automotive product sales by while the us light vehicle market grew by 
automotive product sales benefited from the overall market growth  from increased penetration of existing products and from the development of new products for new models in in addition  the company sold its first multi layer plastic fuel tanks in for  sales of fuel pumps increased modestly while sales of fuel rails increased by and sales of fuel modules increased by 
sales of the company s small engine products also hit a record level of million in  up from million in and million in overall sales growth of small engine products was in compared to during sales of diaphragm carburetors increased in compared to for  from million in to million in to million in part of the increase was caused by the comparison to depressed us diaphragm carburetor sales in the second half of because of delays in the emission certification by the california air resources board for customers engines during that period 
increases in us sales of diaphragm carburetors in the first half of combined with increases in europe and the far east during all of more than offset the second half decline in the us  resulting in the overall increase of for sales of float feed carburetors decreased in compared to a increase for  with million of sales in versus million in and million in during  float feed carburetor sales in the us declined as heavy rain in the spring and a drought during the summer caused lower sales of lawn and garden products and outdoor power equipment 
also during  the weak market for marine engines contributed to lower float feed carburetor sales 
the significant increase in float feed carburetor sales was primarily due to a increase in sales to the company s largest lawn and garden customer and a increase in sales of marine carburetors 
sales of small engine ignition systems added million to small engine sales in compared to million in and million in as customer demand has grown for this expanding family of products 
in addition  carburetor sales from the company s subsidiary in china  fujian hualong carburetor  which the company acquired in january   added million to small engine product sales in compared to million in management believes that ignition systems will play a more significant role in the future as small engines become subject to more stringent emissions regulations 
in the past  environmental regulations have created growth opportunities for the company through new product development 
for example  the company developed a new generation of carburetors to meet the first phase of the california exhaust emission standards which took effect in in addition  the us environmental protection agency has adopted similar emission standards which become effective in august  management believes that these and emission standards will not adversely affect its business because the company s products have been modified to meet these new standards 
a reduction of emissions required by the second phase of regulation is scheduled to be phased in beginning in for the us  except california  which requires a reduction of emissions in the second phase for california in a more stringent third phase of us regulation is expected sometime after it is expected that the second phase of us regulations can be met with more refined carburetors which are currently under development 
the california second phase could affect unit sales of existing products in california due to a shifting of the low cost segment of the portable power equipment market from internal combustion engines to electric motors 
management believes the california regulations and the phase three us regulations will require new levels of technology in engine management systems that meet the regulations within the tight cost constraints required by the small engine market 
however  management believes that the company has the capability to assist engine manufacturers by designing and producing ignition systems and fuel systems engine management systems capable of meeting reasonable emission standards within these constraints 
although certain of these regulations may have the effect of reducing unit sales  the more sophisticated products required by stringent emissions regulations are expected to command higher unit prices 
the company s aftermarket business for both automotive and small engine products is consolidated as a business unit within walbro engine management  but reported separately in this discussion 
aftermarket sales in were flat compared to for two significant reasons 
first  the aftermarket distribution center in cass city  michigan was struck by lightning in august   causing substantial smoke and water damage to the building and its contents 
aftermarket operations were shut down for three weeks in august as a result of the fire and subsequent order levels were lower because of the reduced inventory available to fill orders 
secondly  a major aftermarket customer competitor for fuel pumps chose to manufacture more of its requirements 
the increase in aftermarket sales was the result of the addition of several new aftermarket customers and the expansion of the product offering for aftermarket sales 
cost of sales the company s cost of sales is composed primarily of material  labor  and manufacturing and engineering overhead 
cost of sales was million in million without dyno compared to million in and million in cost of sales as a percent of sales was in without dyno compared to in and in cost of sales as a percent of sales for us based automotive products increased in because of lower volumes of fuel rails partially offset by higher volumes of fuel modules and plastic gas tanks 
the company s ligonier  indiana plant  which makes steel fuel rails  experienced significantly higher costs in the second half of because of lower volumes related to lower passenger car sales 
the company announced in february  that it plans to sell the steel fuel rail business at the ligonier  indiana plant 
this decision to exit the steel fuel rail market does not affect the company s growing business in plastic fuel rails which are manufactured at its facility in meriden  connecticut 
cost of sales as a percent of sales at dyno was for the last five months of the dyno gross margin was lower than anticipated because of higher raw material prices and lower volumes during the last five months of due to seasonally lower production schedules and because of a weaker european automotive market during this period 
also contributing to the higher cost of sales as a percent of sales were continuing startup costs at the company s ossian  indiana plastic fuel tank plant 
the cost of sales as a percent of sales increased because of the ossian plant startup costs and additional costs of expanding production capacity for fuel modules at the company s meriden  connecticut plant 
the startup costs at the company s ossian  indiana plant are expected to continue in the first half of as the production orders for multi layer plastic fuel tanks have not yet reached the break even level 
the additional costs of expanding production at the meriden  connecticut plant declined in but will increase in as the second plant comes on line 
cost of sales as a percent of sales for small engine products increased for because of lower volume of float feed carburetors in the us and lower gross margin at the company s singapore manufacturing facility due to lower production volumes and the stronger singapore dollar versus the us dollar 
these increased costs were partially offset by higher volume of diaphragm carburetors in japan and mexico and higher volume of float feed carburetors in china 
the cost of sales as a percent of sales increased primarily because of lower volume of diaphragm carburetors in the us during the second half of a secondary factor for this increased cost of sales as a percent of sales was the higher cost of manufacturing carburetors in japan and singapore as a result of the weaker us dollar during in december   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  employer s accounting for post retirement benefits other than pensions  and the company changed its method of accounting for these benefits in as required by sfas see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of the impact of this change 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative s a expenses were million in  an increase of increased without dyno compared to million in the s a expenses increased by compared to million in as a percent of sales  s a expenses were in without dyno  in and in in  s a expenses increased because of increased spending for research and development  for expansion of the company s automotive systems center in auburn hills  michigan and automotive testing center in caro  michigan and for general expenses related to adding manufacturing capacity in meriden  connecticut 
in  most s a expense categories increased to support the sales growth 
research and development spending increased by increased without dyno in and by in to support the new product development efforts required by emission regulations for both automotive and small engine products 
incentive compensation expense in the small engine business increased in and again in because of higher profitability 
reorganization charges in  the company recorded a million reorganization charge reflecting the company s actual and anticipated expenses from reorganization of the executive management team at walbro automotive 
million was paid in and the remaining million was paid in see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
loss on foreign exchange transactions foreign exchange contracts are used primarily to manage the exposure to foreign currency losses from operations in foreign countries  from investments in foreign joint ventures and from commitments in foreign currencies 
in  the company entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the company s foreign currency exposure related to a sales commitment to a foreign customer 
the loss on these contracts was treated as a hedge for accounting purposes and recorded as a deferred asset  which is being amortized as foreign currency exchange loss 
in and the company entered into foreign exchange contracts to hedge the company s foreign currency risk from foreign currency commitments which did not qualify for deferred accounting treatment and the losses were recorded as foreign currency exchange loss in and the foreign currency exchange loss in was million  million in and million in see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
net interest expense net interest expense was million in  an increase of million  compared to million in net interest expense increased by million compared to million in to finance the dyno acquisition in july  the company sold million in aggregate principal amount of its senior notes and obtained a new million secured credit facility 
borrowing levels were also higher in to support the higher level of capital expenditures for the facilities expansions 
general interest rates declined during but the additional borrowings and the shift to a higher percentage of long term fixed rate debt raised the average cost of capital and caused the higher interest expense 
the increased interest expense resulted from higher interest rates and increased borrowings for additional working capital and the full year effect of financing the company s ossian  indiana plant 
during october of  the company sold million of senior notes which contributed to the higher net interest expense 
the average cost of borrowing was in  in and in see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details of the borrowings 
income taxes the provision for income taxes was lower for compared to because of a research and development r d tax credit recorded in this tax credit resulted from a change by the internal revenue service in defining the r d activities which qualify for the tax credit 
the million credit results from r d activities at the company from through the r d tax credit resulted in an effective tax rate of for compared to for joint venture income the company s equity in income of joint ventures was million in  million in and a loss of  in the loss in was due primarily to first year losses of  in brazil and the significant income in and resulted from increased sales and profits in all the company s joint ventures 
as detailed below  the company has actively pursued joint venture opportunities as a means of expanding into new regions of the world market 
the joint venture structure allows the company to share the risks  capital requirements and early stage start up losses with a partner 
in november   the company signed an agreement to form a joint venture  mutual walbro p 
ltd  with mutual industries ltd  bombay  india to produce automotive fuel tank assemblies in india 
in november   the company formed a joint venture  korea automotive fuel systems ltd  with daewoo precision industries ltd 
of south korea to manufacture and market fuel sending units for the south korean automobile market 
in march   the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of walbro korea ltd  a joint venture with siemens ag of germany and daesung ltd 
of south korea 
this joint venture was originally formed to manufacture and market efi system components for the south korean automotive market 
in february   the company acquired a interest in marwal do brazil  a brazilian joint venture with magneti marelli spa of italy  to manufacture and market fuel sending units for the south american automotive market 
in january   the company sold its interest in orbital walbro corporation to its joint venture partner  orbital engine company ltd 
of australia  in exchange for million shares of orbital stock and million in cash 
net income and income per share net income for was million  a decrease of compared to million in income before cumulative effect of accounting change was million in with net income of million for the same period 
net income per share was for compared with for income per share before cumulative effect of accounting change was with net income per share of for all per share data is fully diluted 
net income as a percent of sales was in  in  and in income before accounting change as a percent of sales 
the decline in net income as a percent of sales in was related to the dyno acquisition which generated lower profit margins in and resulted in increased interest expense and because of higher s a expenses as explained above 
the decline in net income as a percent of sales during was the result of higher cost of sales  higher interest expense and foreign exchange losses as explained above 
inflation inflation potentially affects the company in two principal ways 
first  a portion of the company s debt is tied to prevailing short term interest rates which may change as a result of inflation rates  translating into changes in interest expense 
second  general inflation can impact material purchases  labor and other costs 
the company has limited ability to pass on inflation related cost increases to its customers on a short term basis 
in addition  the markets served by the company are competitive in nature  and competition limits the pass through of inflation related cost increases in many cases 
in the past three years  however  inflation has not been a significant factor for the company 
foreign currency transactions approximately of the company s sales during were derived from international manufacturing operations in europe  asia and latin america 
the financial position and the results of operations of the company s subsidiaries in europe of sales  and asia of sales are measured in local currency of the countries in which they operate and translated into us dollars 
the effects of foreign currency fluctuations in europe and asia  except singapore  are somewhat mitigated by the fact that expenses are generally incurred in the same currencies in which sales are generated and the reported income of these subsidiaries will be higher or lower depending on a weakening or strengthening of the us dollar 
for the company s subsidiaries in singapore and mexico of sales the expenses are generally incurred in the local currency  but sales are generated in us dollars  therefore  results of operations are more directly influenced by a weakening or strengthening of the local currency 
the acquisition of dyno in july  discussed below resulted in a significant increase in the foreign component of the company s operations 
specifically  giving effect to the dyno acquisition on a pro forma basis  approximately of the company s sales for would have been related to foreign operations 
approximately of the company s net assets at december   are based in its foreign operations and are translated into us dollars at foreign currency exchange rates in effect as of the end of each period 
accordingly  the company s consolidated shareholders equity will fluctuate depending upon the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar 
in addition  the company has equity investments in unconsolidated joint ventures in france  brazil  japan and korea 
the company s reported income from these joint ventures will be higher or lower depending upon a weakening or strengthening of the us dollar 
the company s strategy for management of currency risk relies primarily upon the use of forward currency exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations related to its operations in foreign countries  to manage its firm transaction commitments in foreign currencies and to hedge its equity investment in certain foreign joint ventures 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company had million outstanding in short term debt  including current portion of long term debt  and million in long term debt 
as of december   the approximate minimum principal payments required on the company s long term debt in each of the five fiscal years subsequent to december  are million in  million in  million in  million in  million in and million thereafter 
the net purchase price of the dyno acquisition was approximately million approximately million less approximately million in cash acquired by the company 
the company financed the acquisition through the combination of a private placement of million in aggregate principal amount of its senior notes due and a new million secured credit facility with a group of commercial banks 
at december   the company had available to it approximately million under the new credit facility 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the company s plans for capital expenditures for facilities  equipment and tooling total approximately million  of which approximately million represents expenditures to maintain and upgrade current facilities and million represents capital expenditures for expansion 
the expansion plan includes new plants in brazil and belgium  a second plant in meriden  connecticut  expansion of the ossian  indiana plant and a technical center in europe 
the company intends to finance the capital expenditures with cash from operations  supplemented by borrowings under the new credit facility and potential lease financing 
management believes that the company s long term cash needs will continue to be provided principally by operating activities supplemented  to the extent required  by borrowing under the company s existing and future credit facilities and by access to the capital markets 
management expects to replace these credit facilities as they expire with comparable facilities 
as of december   accounts receivable amounted to million  an increase of million  compared to million at december  the acquisition of dyno added million of accounts receivable 
the average collection period at december  was days or days without dyno  slightly lower than the average collection period during calendar the average collection period in calendar year was days compared to days in approximately of the accounts receivable increase in  without dyno accounts receivable  was due to increased sales in  while the remaining increase was due to longer collection periods 
as of december   inventories amounted to million  an increase of million  compared to million at december   and the dyno acquisition accounted for million of this increase
