liquidity net cash provided from operating activities in was  as compared to a deficit in of  and a surplus in of  the positive position was achieved due to a strong operating profit together with maintaining working capital levels approximating the cash operating deficit was largely due to the disposal of graham manufacturing limited 
the positive cash flow from operating activities was due to operating profit  inventory reduction programs  and income tax refunds

change in accounting principles the company adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
 disclosure about fair value of financial instruments in see notes to consolidated financial statements no 
for additional information including graham s use of derivatives 
effective january  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
 employer s accounting for postemployment benefits 
inflation increases in material costs have been offset by cost cutting measures and price increases absorbed in the marketplace 
graham will continue to monitor the impact of inflation in order to minimize its effects in future years through pricing and product mix strategies  productivity improvements  and cost reductions 
forward looking on balance was an excellent year 
in the first half of the year the company settled a major lawsuit and sold its subsidiary located in gloucester  england 
the expenses relating to these events were anticipated and substantially accounted for in in the second half of the year the company returned to profitability  posting one of its finest operating profits in several years 
the company enters with a consolidated backlog well in excess of recent past history 
no one can predict with certainty  demand for graham s products into the future  however  with guarded optimism the company does see opportunities in selected market niches in to what extent these potentially bright spots can offset other weakening market sectors and fierce global competition is difficult to comfortably predict
