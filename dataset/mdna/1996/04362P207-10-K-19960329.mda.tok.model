item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations selected elements of informix s financial statements are shown below for the last three years as a percentage of revenue and as a percentage change from year to year 
increase decrease percent of net revenue years ended december  compared compared to to licenses services net revenues cost and expenses cost of software distribution cost of services sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total costs and expenses operating income net income informix s operating margins have exceeded or equaled percent over the last several years 
however  informix s expenses are relatively fixed in the near term and unexpected variances in planned revenues  which are difficult to forecast  can result in variations in operating margins and cost ratios 
in the fourth quarter of  informix acquired stanford technology group stg  a company that develops and sells on line analytical processing olap technology  in exchange for approximately  shares of its common stock in a pooling of interests transaction 
in february  the company acquired illustra information technologies  inc illustra  a company that provides dynamic content management database software and tools for managing complex data in the internet  multimedia entertainment  financial services  earth sciences and other markets 
approximately million shares of informix common stock were issued to acquire all outstanding shares of illustra stock 
an additional million shares of informix common stock were reserved for issuance in connection with the assumption of illustra s outstanding options 
the transaction will be accounted for as a pooling of interests 
transaction fees of approximately million will be recorded in the first quarter of informix expects that its operating margins will be affected negatively in as stg and illustra are integrated with informix and the transaction fees for the illustra acquisition are expensed 
informix is investing in extensive training for sales  marketing  and customer service to educate employees of both the acquired companies and informix regarding the products of the combined companies and revisions to informix operations required to integrate the operations of the companies 
the company will be investing in the development of a database management system that will merge technology from both illustra and informix 
informix intends to exert marketing efforts to launch this product in in addition  both stg and illustra businesses are in developing technology markets 
informix does not expect either business to contribute percent operating margins in these integration and marketing expenses and the relatively low margins of the acquired companies may adversely affect informix s ability to achieve quarterly operating margins consistent with recent quarters 
earnings per share may also be diluted as a result of the issuance of informix common stock in connection with the stg and illustra acquisitions 
revenues the company derives revenues principally from licensing its software and providing technical product support and updates to customers 
license revenues may involve the shipment of product by the company or the granting of a license to a customer to manufacture products 
service revenue consists of customer telephone or direct support  update rights for new product versions  consulting  and training fees 
the company s products are sold directly to end user customers or through resellers  including original equipment manufacturers oem s  distributors  and application vendors 
the company s revenues have been increasingly derived from sales contracts directly with end users and less from the distributor or oem sales channels 
these end user sales contracts can be relatively large in size and are difficult to forecast both in timing and dollar value 
in addition  these revenue contracts have lower associated software distribution and selling costs 
from time to time  the company has recognized substantial net revenue from these large software license agreements 
these transactions  which are difficult to predict  have caused fluctuations in net revenues and net income because of the relatively high gross margin on such revenues 
the company expects that these sorts of transactions and the resulting fluctuations will continue 
the increase in service revenue  as a percentage of total revenue  in each of the years presented  was primarily attributable to the continued growth of the installed customer base  the renewal of maintenance contracts and increased consulting revenue 
the company continues to emphasize support services as a source of revenue 
the overall revenue growth in primarily reflects continued strong worldwide acceptance for the company s new and existing technology and products 
although the company expects revenues to grow in  there can be no assurance that quarterly revenue growth rates or geographical growth rates will be comparable with those achieved in as it has done from time to time in the past  informix restructured its sales organization effective in the first quarter of the reorganization includes new management in north america and the integration of illustra products and personnel 
the company s revenues  along with those of the relational database management system rdbms industry as a whole  have shown substantial growth over the last several years 
the industry has benefited from trends to downsize from large proprietary computer systems and market acceptance of unix r  windows tm  windows nt tm and other open operating environments 
the company has also developed and released connectivity products to allow access to other relational databases  both proprietary and open  and access to this data through various protocols such as ibm s drda tm 
the industry movement to new  open operating systems like windows nt  access through low end desktop machines  and access to data through the internet may cause downward pressure on prices of database and related products 
if such downward pressure on prices were to occur  margins would be adversely affected 
the license revenue growth in and reflects strong demand for the company s products  particularly for the company s flagship database server  informix online dynamic server tm 
the company has also started to see revenue growth in the tools area with the introduction of informix newera tm  a next generation client server application development tool which became available in the second half of in  the company introduced  on a limited basis  informix online extended parallel server tm xps  a new high performance  scalable database server based on the company s dynamic scalable architecture tm dsa and also introduced informix newera on the windows platform 
in february  the company announced the development of an enterprise capable  fully extensible database management system that can manage all information assets including numbers  images  maps  sound  video  web pages  and text  as well as other user defined rich data types 
this product will incorporate illustra s object relational technology into informix s core database technology 
it is scheduled to be commercially available in late or early over half of the company s net revenues are derived from its international operations 
in europe  asia pacific  and japan  most revenues and expenses are now denominated in local currencies 
the us dollar weakened in and against the major european and asia pacific currencies  which resulted in higher revenue and expenses recorded when translated into us dollars  compared with the prior year periods 
through  most revenues from asia pacific  canada  and latin america were denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  the translation of the revenues for these regions was less impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
the company has increased its direct sales presence in asia pacific by opening offices and acquiring its primary software distributors in malaysia in  and japan and korea in early this increased the proportion of direct sales denominated in local currency in these regions 
the company has also increased its direct presence in latin america  although a significant percentage of the revenue is still denominated in us dollars 
in the future  the company expects currency fluctuations in mexico  and to a lesser extent  other latin american countries  to continue 
the company s operating and pricing strategies take into account changes in exchange rates over time  however  the company s results of operations may be significantly affected in the short term by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
approximately percent  percent and percent of informix s net revenues were derived from sales to foreign customers in   and  respectively 
the increase in foreign revenues in absolute dollars is primarily attributable to the establishment of new subsidiaries and sales offices in europe  asia pacific  japan  and latin america  the acquisition of several foreign distributors  and continued international acceptance for informix s new and existing technology 
informix expects that foreign revenues will continue to provide a significant portion of total revenues 
however  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  the strength of local economies  and the general volatility of software markets may result in a higher or lower proportion of foreign revenues in the future 
the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts primarily to hedge the value of accounts receivable or accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies against fluctuations in exchange rates until such receivables are collected or payables are disbursed 
this program involves the use of forward foreign exchange contracts in the primary european and asian currencies 
the company has limited unhedged transaction exposures in certain secondary currencies in latin america  eastern europe  and asia pacific because there are limited forward currency exchange markets in these currencies 
the company does not attempt to hedge the translation to us dollars of foreign denominated revenues and expenses not yet earned or incurred 
informix s distribution markets were reorganized into three general markets at the beginning of the second quarter of north america  europe  middle east  and africa  and the intercontinental group  consisting of latin america  japan  and the asia pacific region 
these organizations contributed percent  percent and percent of informix s net revenues  respectively  in  compared to percent  percent  and percent  respectively  in and percent  percent and percent  respectively  in effective january   these sales organizations were reorganized into the following groups americas  including the north america and latin america regions  international  including the europe  middle east  africa  and asia pacific regions  and japan 
cost of software distribution dollars in millions change change manufactured cost of software distribution percentage of license revenue amortization of capitalized software percentage of license revenue cost of software distribution percentage of license revenue software distribution costs consist primarily of manufacturing and related costs such as media  documentation  product assembly and purchasing costs  freight  and third party royalties  and amortization of previously capitalized software development costs 
the increase in amortization of capitalized software in absolute dollars in and compared to the corresponding prior year periods was due to the release of several database server and application tool products in the latter half of continuing through the company expects that amortization of capitalized software in absolute dollars will continue to increase in the future as new products are released 
manufactured cost of software distribution in  as a percentage of license revenues  remained flat compared to and the cost of software distribution as a percentage of license revenue may vary depending upon whether the product is reproduced by the company or by its customers 
cost of services dollars in millions change change cost of services percentage of service revenue cost of services consists primarily of customer service  consulting and training expenses 
the increase in cost of services in in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues compared to is primarily due to the company s increased expenditures in developing consulting and support services 
the decrease in cost of services as a percentage of service revenue in compared to is primarily due to higher growth in maintenance revenues  derived from product update rights and technical support  than in maintenance expenses  primarily related to technical customer support 
in the future  the company expects that cost of services as a percentage of net revenues will approximate the rate in sales and marketing expenses dollars in millions change change sales and marketing percentage of net revenue the increase in sales and marketing expenses  in absolute dollars  in and compared to the corresponding prior year periods  is a result of increased sales personnel worldwide as informix expanded its investment in the worldwide direct sales organizations  opening of new subsidiaries  acquisition of several foreign distributors  higher commission expense associated with the increase in revenues  and increased marketing programs associated with new product launches 
with the continuing expansion throughout of worldwide operations  as well as increased sales and marketing expenditures aimed at positioning informix and its new and existing products in the marketplace  informix expects that sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute terms in research and development expenses informix accounts for its software development expenses in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
this statement requires that  once technological feasibility of a developing product has been established  all subsequent costs incurred in developing that product to a commercially acceptable level be capitalized and amortized ratably over the revenue life of the product 
the following table summarizes research and development costs for the prior three years dollars in millions change change incurred product development costs expenditures capitalized research and development expenses expenditures capitalized as a percent of incurred the increase in research and development expenditures in absolute dollars from year to year is attributed to an increase in staff working on new products and product extensions 
the higher capitalization in absolute dollars of product development expenditures from year to year resulted from an increase in the work involved in projects reaching technological feasibility as they neared their release dates 
the company expects the proportion of work on capitalized projects to remain relatively stable throughout major new programs currently under development include an enterprise capable  fully extensible database management system that can manage all information assets including numbers  images  maps  sound  video  web pages  and text  as well as other user defined rich datatypes  the expansion of the dsa family of servers and connectivity products  and subsequent versions of the company s graphical  object oriented tool  informix newera 
the company believes that research and development expenditures are essential to maintaining its competitive position in its primary markets and expects the expenditure levels to increase in absolute dollars 
general and administrative expenses dollars in millions change change general and administrative expenses percentage of net revenues general and administrative expenses in increased in absolute dollars compared to as a result of the continued expansion in international operations as well as the acquisition of several foreign distributors 
the slight increase in absolute dollars from to was primarily due to an increase in the costs of supporting informix s international operations as new subsidiaries and branch offices were established and existing subsidiaries were expanded 
informix will expense approximately million of transaction fees related to the illustra acquisition in the first quarter of informix expects that other general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues will remain similar to interest income dollars in millions change change interest income percentage of net revenues the increase in absolute dollars from to resulted from higher balances of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
interest income in remained flat compared with despite higher cash and investments as informix invested a large percentage of its cash and investments in lower nominal yield  tax exempt securities 
provision for income taxes dollars in millions change change provision for income taxes effective tax rate informix s effective tax rates for fiscal years   and are less than the combined federal and state statutory rates primarily due to the permanent reinvestment offshore of a portion of the earnings of informix s lower taxed irish operations and the federal research and development tax credit prior to its expiration in the amount considered permanently invested in the irish operations may vary from year to year and may affect informix s effective tax rate 
informix anticipates its fiscal effective tax rate to remain approximately the same as  however  this rate could change based on a change in the geographic mix of informix s earnings  the amount of permanent reinvestment offshore of a portion of the earnings of informix s lower taxed irish operations  and the reinstatement of the federal research and development tax credit 
impact of inflation the effect of inflation on the company s financial position has not been significant 
liquidity and capital resources dollars in millions cash  cash equivalents  and investments working capital cash provided by operations cash used in investment activities  excluding investments of excess cash cash provided by used in financing activities cash generated by operations provided sufficient resources to fund the company s headcount growth and capital asset needs in all periods presented 
the increase in net cash and cash equivalents provided by operations in compared with was primarily attributable to higher income before depreciation and amortization charges 
the increase in net cash and cash equivalents provided by operations in compared with was due mainly to higher income before depreciation and amortization charges  increased accounts payable and accrued expenses  and the litigation settlement in  all of which were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
accounts receivable increased by million in and by million in  principally as a result of higher sales  partially offset by strong collections and the use of third party financing programs 
days sales outstanding was approximately days at the end of the fourth quarter of compared with days and days at the end of the same periods in and commencing in late  the company instituted programs to have third party financial institutions provide financing for extended credit terms instead of such terms being provided by the company 
the days sales outstanding ratio is dependent on many factors  including the mix of contract based revenue with significant oems and large corporate and government end users versus revenue recognized on shipments to application vendors and distributors and the success of the company s financing programs 
although a large portion of the company s revenues is derived from resellers  the company s revenues since have shifted substantially from distributors to direct end users 
these end user sales contracts frequently bear extended payment terms which result in an increase in days sales outstanding ratios unless the contracts are financed 
the aforementioned shift in distributor channels is likely to continue as products and markets mature 
the company is using a variety of activities to reduce the days sales outstanding ratio 
in the future  the company expects this ratio to vary within the range which prevailed in the last several quarters  however  there is no assurance that it will do so 
excluding investments of excess cash  net cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities increased in compared with and levels 
in   and  the company acquired million  million  and million  respectively  of capital equipment consisting primarily of computer equipment  computer software  and office equipment 
the increase of capital equipment purchases in and resulted from the company s growing employee headcount and the investment in new capital equipment as well as new technology 
in the future  the company anticipates the actual level of capital spending will be dependent on a variety of factors  including the company s business requirements and general economic conditions 
in   and  the company made equity investments of million  million  and million  respectively  in companies of strategic interest to the company 
the company s investments in software costs were previously discussed under results of operations 
in the third quarter of  the company acquired two of its distributors  one in germany and the other in malaysia 
the transactions were accounted for as purchases 
the aggregate purchase price of these two distributors were approximately million  of which million has been allocated to intangible assets acquired 
in january  the company acquired a percent interest in the database division of ascii corporation  a distributor of its products in japan 
the company acquired the remaining percent interest in january the acquisition was recorded as a purchase 
the purchase price of ascii s database division was approximately million  of which approximately million has been allocated to intangible assets acquired

the company will acquire the remaining percent by january the acquisition was recorded as a purchase 
the initial purchase price of this business was approximately million  of which approximately million has been allocated to intangible assets acquired 
the operating results of these distributors subsequent to the acquisition dates  which were not significant in relation to those of informix  have been included in the consolidated results of operations since their acquisition dates 
in october  the company acquired stg  a us based company that provides on line analytical processing technology  in exchange for approximately  shares of its common stock 
the transaction has been accounted for as a pooling of interests 
however  since the operating results of stg are insignificant to the company  prior period annual and quarterly results have not been restated for this transaction 
in february  the company acquired illustra  a us based company that provides dynamic content management database software and tools for managing complex data in the internet  multimedia entertainment  financial services  earth sciences  and other markets 
approximately million shares of informix common stock were issued to acquire all outstanding shares of illustra stock 
an additional million shares of informix common stock were reserved for issuance in connection with the assumption of illustra s outstanding options 
the transaction will be accounted for as a pooling of interests

as of december   the company had repurchased  shares with an aggregate cost of approximately million on the open market 
during and  all repurchased shares were re issued to partially satisfy requirements under stock option and stock purchase plans 
the company expects current balances of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments will be sufficient to fund anticipated levels of operations at least through and may be used for investments and acquisitions to supplement internal revenue growth and for other corporate purposes 
business risks fluctuations in quarterly results 
the company s operating results can vary substantially from period to period 
the timing and amount of the company s license revenues are subject to a number of factors that make estimation of operating results prior to the end of a quarter extremely uncertain 
the company has operated historically with little or no backlog and  as a result  license revenues in any quarter are dependent on contracts entered into or orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
the company s operating margins have generally followed a historic pattern  with second half revenues and operating margins being higher than those of the preceding first half 
the company believes that this pattern has been primarily related to customers capital spending cycles at the end of a calendar year as well as to the company s selling efforts  influenced by annual sales incentive plans  at the end of the calendar year  which is the end of the company s fiscal year 
additionally  as is common in the industry  a disproportionate amount of the company s license revenues is derived from transactions that close in the last few weeks of a quarter 
the timing of closing large license agreements also increases the risks of quarter to quarter fluctuations and the uncertainty of estimating quarterly operating results 
the company s operating expenses are based on projected annual and quarterly revenue levels  which have been increasing at rates approaching the rate of total revenue growth and are incurred approximately ratably throughout each quarter 
as a result  if projected revenues are not realized in the expected period  the company s operating results for that period would be adversely affected as the operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
failure to achieve revenue  earnings and other operating and financial results as forecasted or anticipated by brokerage firm analysts or industry analysts could result in an immediate and adverse effect on the market price of the company s common stock 
further  the company may not learn of  or be able to confirm  revenue or earnings shortfall until the end of each quarter  which could result in an even more immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock 
volatility of informix stock prices 
the market for the company s common stock is highly volatile 
the trading price of the company s common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in operating and financial results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company or its competitors  changes in prices of the company s or its competitors products and services  changes in product mix  change in the company s revenue and revenue growth rates for the company as a whole or for individual geographic areas  business units  products or product categories  as well as other events or factors 
statements or changes in opinions  ratings  or earnings estimates made by brokerage firms or industry analysts relating to the market in which the company does business or relating to the company specifically have resulted  and could in the future result  in an immediate and adverse effect on the market price of the company s common stock 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations which have particularly affected the market price for the securities of many high technology companies and which often have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
competition 
the market for the company s software products and services is extremely competitive 
some of the company s current competitors and many potential competitors have greater financial  technical and marketing resources than the company 
to the extent that market acceptance for personal computer oriented technologies increases at the expense of unix or other non pc platforms  this could result in greater price pressure on certain of the company s database products and services 
the availability and market acceptance of microsoft corporation s windows nt operating system may increase the competition faced by the principal operating system platforms on which the company s products operate and may result in greater price pressure on certain of the company s database products and services 
also  new or enhanced products introduced by existing or future competitors could have an adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
existing and future competition or changes in the company s product or services pricing structure or product or service offerings could result in an immediate reduction in the prices of the company s products or services 
if this were to result in significant price declines the effects of which were not offset by any resulting increases in sales volume of the company s products or services the company s business  results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to compete successfully with its existing competitors or will be able to compete successfully with new competitors 
technological change and new products 
the market for the company s products and services is characterized by rapidly changing technology and frequent new product introductions 
the company s success will depend upon its ability to enhance its existing products and to introduce new products on a timely and cost effective basis that meet dynamic customer requirements 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing new products or enhancing its existing products or that such new or enhanced products will receive market acceptance or be delivered timely to the market 
the company has experienced product delays in the past and may have delays in the future 
delays in the scheduled availability or a lack of market acceptance of its products or failure to accurately anticipate customer demand and meet customer performance requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  products as complex as those offered by the company may contain undetected errors or bugs when first introduced or as new versions are released 
there can be no assurance that  despite testing  new products or new versions of existing products will not contain undetected errors or bugs that will delay the introduction or commercial acceptance of such products 
a key factor in determining the success of the company will continue to be the ability of the company s products to interoperate and perform well with existing and future leading  industry standard leading application software products intended to be used in connection with relational database management systems 
failure to meet existing or future interoperability and performance requirements of certain independent vendors marketing such applications in a timely manner could adversely affect the market for the company s products 
commercial acceptance of the company s products and services could also be adversely affected by critical or negative statements or reports by brokerage firms  industry and financial analysts and industry periodicals concerning the company  its products  business or competitors or by the advertising or marketing efforts of competitors  or other factors that could affect consumer perception 
international operations 
over half of the company s net revenues are derived from its international operations 
the company s operations and financial result could be significantly affected by factors associated with international operations could be significantly affected by factors associated with international operations such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates and uncertainties relative to regional economic circumstances  as well as by other risks associated with international activities 
most of the company s international revenue and expenses are denominated in local currencies 
although the company takes into account changes in exchange rates over time in its pricing strategy  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience fluctuations in international revenues 
integration of acquired companies 
the company has completed several acquisitions including the database division of ascii corporation in japan  distributors in germany  korea and malaysia  stg and  more recently  illustra in the united states 
the company may acquire other distributors  companies  products or technologies in the future 
there can be no assurance that these acquisitions can be effectively integrated  that such acquisitions will not result in costs and liabilities that could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition  or that the company will obtain the anticipated or desired benefits of such acquisitions 
infringement claims 
as the number of software products and software patents in the industry increases  the company believes that software developers may become increasingly subject to infringement claims 
there can be no assurance that a third party will not assert that its patents or other proprietary rights are violated by products offered by the company 
any such claims  with or without merit  can be time consuming and expensive to defend and could have an adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  financial position  and cash flows
