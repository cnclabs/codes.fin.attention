coinsured fha insured certificates under the hud coinsurance program  both hud and the coinsurance lender are responsible for paying a portion of the insurance benefits if a mortgagor defaults and the sale of the development collateralizing the mortgage produces insufficient net proceeds to repay the mortgage obligation 
in such cases  the coinsurance lender will be liable to the partnership for the first part of such loss in an amount up to of the outstanding principal balance of the mortgage as of the date foreclosure proceedings are instituted or the deed is acquired in lieu of foreclosure

as an ongoing hud approved coinsurance lender  and under the terms of the participation documents  the coinsurance lender is required to satisfy certain minimum net worth requirements as set forth by hud 
however  it is possible that the coinsurance lender s potential liability for loss on these developments  and others  could exceed its hud required minimum net worth 
in such case  the partnership would bear the risk of loss if the coinsurance lenders were unable to meet their coinsurance obligations

consequently  the size of the partnership s portfolio will decrease 
although the insured mortgages yield a fixed monthly mortgage payment once purchased  the cash distributions paid to the unitholders will vary during each quarter due to the fluctuating yields in the short term money market where the monthly mortgage payments received are temporarily invested prior to the payment of quarterly distributions  the reduction in the asset base and monthly mortgage payments due to monthly mortgage payments received or mortgage dispositions  variations in the cash flow attributable to the delinquency or default of insured mortgages and professional fees and foreclosure costs incurred in connection with those insured mortgages and variations in the partnership s operating expenses 
since the partnership is obligated to distribute the proceeds of mortgage prepayments  sales and insurance of insured mortgages as defined in the partnership agreement to its unitholders  the size of the partnership s portfolio will continue to decrease
