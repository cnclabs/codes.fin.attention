item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company was organized in october to become a holding company of matrix and petrotank 
the discussion and analysis presented below is of the consolidated financial statements of these companies and the company s other subsidiaries since the date of acquisition  including i tank supply  inc  ii after october   midwest  iii after june   san luis  iv after december   colt  v after june   heath  vi after april   brown  and vii after august   mayflower 
the company recognizes revenues from fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion accounting method which measures progress on an uncompleted contract based on the amount of costs incurred for such project compared with the total amount of costs expected to be incurred through the completion of the project 
revenues from cost plus fee contracts are recognized on the basis of costs incurred plus the estimated fee earned 
the company has experienced an increase in revenues during the last three fiscal years 
fiscal included a full year for heath and two months of brown 
for fiscal  mayflower was included for nine months 
all acquired companies were included for the full year for fiscal incremental revenues  gross profit and selling  general and administrative expenses attributable to the results of operations of acquired companies not included in the prior year are as follows in thousands year ended year ended may  may  revenues  gross profit  selling  general administrative expenses the company expects a continued demand for its services in the foreseeable future 
management believes that the percentage growth of its revenues for fiscal will be as strong as fiscal year  but not as strong as during the two previous fiscal years 
the limitation to growth for the last three fiscal years was due to decreased demand for the company s services 
limitations on growth capacity also reflect the seasonal nature of the company s refinery turnaround activities  which creates pressure to expand the supervisory staff during the turnaround seasons 
the company continues to recruit  hire and train additional project engineers and project managers  and the company s ability to continue to grow will depend  in part  on its ability to continue this process  and a stronger demand for the company s services 
the company s quarterly results may tend to fluctuate from period to period  due primarily to the timing of turnarounds performed by the company 
generally  the company performs a substantial percentage of its turnaround projects in two periods february through may and september through november 
historically  these are the time periods when most refiners temporarily shutdown certain operating units for maintenance  repair or modification prior to changing their product mix in anticipation of a seasonal shift in product demand 
consequently  the company s second quarter ending november and its fourth quarter ending may will typically include greater revenues from turnarounds than its first quarter or its third quarter 
results of operations the following table presents  for the periods indicated  the percentage relationship which certain items in the company s statement of operations bear to revenues  and the percentage increase or decrease in the dollar amount of such items 
the following data should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the company and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this form k

certain factors influencing results and accuracy of forward looking statements this annual report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of discussions containing such forward looking statements may be found in the material set forth under business and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as within the annual report generally 
in addition  when used in this annual report  the words believes and anticipates  expects and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
in the normal course of its business  the company  in an effort to help keep it shareholders and the public informed about the company s operations  may from time to time issue certain statements  either in writing or orally  that contain or may contain forward looking information 
generally  these statements relate to business plans or strategies  projected or anticipated benefits or other consequences of such plans or strategies  or projections involving anticipated revenues  earnings or other aspects of operating results 
such forward looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
as noted elsewhere in this annual report  all phases of the company s operations are subject to a number of uncertainties  risks and other influences  many of which are beyond the control of the company  and any one of which  or a combination of which  could materially affect the results of the company s operations and whether forward looking statements made by the company ultimately prove to be accurate 
the following discussion outlines certain factors that in the future could affect the company s consolidated results and cause them to differ materially from those that may be set forth in any forward looking statement made by or on behalf of the company 
the company cautions the reader  however  that this list of risk factors may not be exhaustive 
competition 
the company competes with numerous large and small companies  some of which have greater financial and other resources than the company 
competition within both the aboveground storage tank work and hydrocarbon process services is intense and is based on quality of service  price  safety considerations and availability of personnel 
see business other business matters competition 
market factors 
the company is dependent on the petroleum storage and refining operations of the petroleum industry  and a downturn in that industry could negatively affect its operations 
the company s hydrocarbon processing operations focus primarily on the refining industry 
the refining industry has undergone significant changes in the past decade with respect to product composition  costs of petroleum products  and refinery capacity and utilization 
although the company believes that these changes in the industry have positively affected its business  changes could occur that decrease the industry s dependence on the type of services the company provides 
see business aboveground storage tank operations hydrocarbon process services 
availability of supervisory personnel 
the company employs in their operations project supervisors with substantial experience and training 
the growth of the businesses will depend on  and may be restricted by  their ability to retain these personnel and to recruit and train additional supervisory employees 
the competition to recruit qualified supervisor staff is intense 
labor markets 
the operations of the company are labor intensive 
the company has employed up to workers for a single project  and many of the workers employed by the company are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
although the company has to date  been able to employ sufficient labor to complete their projects  changes in labor market conditions could restrict the availability of workers or increase the cost of such labor  either of which could adversely affect the company 
in addition  the operations of the company could be adversely affected by a strike or work stoppage 
see business other business matters employees 
fluctuations in quarterly results 
the operating results of hydrocarbon process services and  to a lesser degree  the aboveground storage tank operations  may be subject to significant quarterly fluctuations  affected primarily by the timing of planned maintenance projects at customers facilities 
generally  the company s turnaround projects are undertaken in two primary periods february through may and september through november when refineries typically shut down certain operating units to make changes to adjust to seasonal shifts in product demand 
as a result  the company s quarterly operating results can fluctuate materially 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the company 
environmental regulation 
the operations of the company have been affected positively by the promulgation of stricter environmental laws and more stringent enforcement of existing laws 
although the company s future business success is not dependent on increased environmental regulation  decreased regulation and enforcement could adversely affect the demand for the services provided by the company 
see business ast market and regulatory background other business matters 
potential liability and insurance 
the operations of the company involve the use of heavy equipment and exposure to construction hazards  with attendant significant risks of liability for personal injury and property damage 
while the company believes that it operates safely and prudently  there can be no assurance that accidents will not occur or that the company will not incur substantial liability in connection with the operation of its business 
in addition  recent accidents within the refining and petrochemical industries may result in additional regulation of independent contractors serving those industries 
see business other business matters regulation 
the company maintains workers compensation insurance  general liability insurance and auto liability insurance  but such insurance is subject to coverage limits of million per accident or occurrence 
the company also maintains an umbrella policy with coverage limits of million in the aggregate 
such insurance includes coverage for losses or liabilities relating to environmental damage orpollution 
although the company believes that they conduct their operations prudently and that they minimize their exposure to such risks  the company could be materially adversely affected by a claim that was not covered or only partially covered by insurance
