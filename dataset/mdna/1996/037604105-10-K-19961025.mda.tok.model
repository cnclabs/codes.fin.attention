while the company enrolls students throughout the year  second quarter december to february average enrollments and related revenues generally are lower than other quarters due to the holiday breaks in december and january 
second quarter costs and expenses historically increase as a percentage of net revenues as a result of certain fixed costs not significantly affected by the seasonal second quarter declines in net revenues 
the company experiences a seasonal increase in new enrollments in august of each year when most other colleges and universities begin their fall semesters 
because this buildup in enrollments occurs at the end of the quarter  revenues in the fourth quarter during the past two years were not significantly impacted 
however  instructional costs and services and selling and promotional expenses generally increase as a percentage of net revenues in the fourth quarter due to increased costs in preparation for the august peak enrollments 
the company anticipates that these seasonal trends in the second and fourth quarters will continue in the future 
liquidity and capital resources the company had million of working capital at august  as compared to million at august  the increase in working capital is due primarily to million in cash generated from operations during the year  offset in part by capital expenditures during the year 
at august   the company had no outstanding borrowings on its million unsecured line of credit  which bears interest at prime 
the line of credit is renewable annually and any amounts borrowed under the line are payable upon its termination in december net cash received from operating activities increased to million in from million in due primarily to the million increase in net income from to  offset in part by the timing of receipts from customers and payments to suppliers 
capital expenditures  including additions to educational program production costs  increased to million in from million in primarily due to the purchase of million of land to be used if and when the corporate headquarters is relocated see discussion below 
total purchases of property  equipment and land for the year ended august  are expected to total approximately million 
additions to educational program production costs are not expected to exceed million for the year ended august  start up costs are expected to increase from million in to million in due to recent and planned expansion into new geographic markets 
the lease on the company s corporate headquarters  which includes the uop phoenix main campus  was renewed in december for a five year term 
during  the company acquired land for a purchase price of million which it may use in the future for the possible relocation of its corporate headquarters 
such a facility is estimated to cost between to million 
the company currently has approximately million in commitments for capital expenditures in the company currently leases all of its educational and administrative facilities 
the company s net receivables as a percent of net revenues increased to in from in due primarily to a million increase in receivables from students who were awaiting financial aid loans 
financial aid applications in process were backlogged in the fourth quarter of due primarily to the substantial growth in new enrollments during that period 
a significant portion of the backlog was eliminated in september and it is anticipated to be at normal levels by the end of october bad debt expense as a percent of net revenues decreased to 
in from in due primarily to improved collection rates on delinquent accounts 
the doe requires that title iv program funds collected by an institution for unbilled tuition be kept in a separate cash or cash equivalent account until the students are billed for the portion of their program related to these title iv program funds 
in addition  all funds transferred to the company through electronic funds transfer programs are held in a separate cash account until certain conditions are satisfied 
as of august   the company had approximately million in these separate accounts  which are reflected as restricted cash  to comply with these requirements 
these funds generally remain in these separate accounts for an average of days from the date of collection 
these restrictions on cash have not significantly affected the company s ability to fund daily operations 
the regulations require all higher education institutions to meet an acid test ratio defined as the ratio of cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and current accounts receivable to total current liabilities of at least to  which is calculated at the end of the institution s fiscal year 
if an institution  including uop or wiu  fails to meet the acid test ratio  it may be deemed not financially responsible by the doe  which could result in a loss of its eligibility to participate in title iv programs 
uop s acid test ratio was to at august  and to at august  wiu s acid test ratio was to at august  and to on september  these requirements apply to the separate financial statements of uop  wiu and each of the respective ipd client institutions  but not to the company s consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s historical operations
