the improvement in net interest margin was driven by changes in asset mix  the reduction in non performing assets  and the benefit from higher interest rates on the company s earning assets which repriced upwards more than deposit liabilities 
the change in asset mix was achieved through both loan growth and refinements in loan mix  offset by a reduction in securities 
the following table sets forth the components of the company s net interest income and yields on average interest earning assets and interest bearing funds for each of the past three years

the level of net interest income is a function of volume  rates and mix of both earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income can be adversely affected by changes in interest rate levels as determined by the company s gap position  measured by the differences between the volume of assets and liabilities that are subject to repricing within different future time periods 
interest income total interest and dividend income increased  or  to million in from million in loan income increased  or  as a result of changes in loan mix  higher volume and higher yields 
the increase in the average loan yield resulted primarily from upward portfolio repricing due to higher interest rates  which affected new loan rates  the repricing of floating rate loans  and  to a lesser extent  a change in loan mix as the company increased its originations of prime based commercial loans 
average loans grew million  or  to million in as compared with interest and dividends from securities and federal funds decreased  or  in as a result of a lower volume despite a higher yield 
average securities declined million  or  to million in as a result of sales and principal payments

deposit expense increased  or  as a result of a basis point increase in the average cost of interest bearing deposits to from and an increase of million  or  in average interest bearing deposits 
the increase in deposit costs resulted from higher interest rates and a change in deposit mix resulting from transfers from money market and savings accounts into certificates of deposit 
the change in deposit mix was caused by an increased yield differential between money market accounts and certificates of deposit 
deposit growth was concentrated in certificates of deposit  now and demand deposit accounts

the company s borrowings are short term and rates generally follow the one month libor index 
provision and allowance for loan losses the company provided  for loan losses in  unchanged from the stable provision reflects the company s resolve to provide for modest loan growth and improve loan quality 
changes in the allowance for loan losses are as follows years ended june  dollars in thousands balance  beginning of year    provision for losses charge offs recoveries balance  end of year    ratio of allowance for loan losses to non performing loans to total gross loans loan loss provision to average loans net charge offs to average loans the company s allowance for loan losses is strong as compared against both total loans and non performing loans 
during the past year non performing loans decreased million  or 
as a result of this decrease the reserve coverage to non performing loans increased to 
past due performing loans accruing loans days past due have remained relatively stable throughout fiscal year  and averaged of gross loans for the year 
loan charge offs in included several losses that had been reserved for in prior years 
for a discussion of non performing loans see asset quality and portfolio risk 
the bank determines its allowance and provisions for loan losses based upon a detailed evaluation of the loan portfolio through a process which considers numerous factors  including estimated credit losses based upon internal and external portfolio reviews  delinquency levels and trends  estimates of the current value of underlying collateral  concentrations  portfolio volume and mix  changes in lending policy  historical loan loss experience  current economic conditions and examinations performed by regulatory authorities 
determining the level of the allowance at any given period is difficult  particularly during deteriorating or uncertain economic periods 
management must make estimates using assumptions and information which is often subjective and changing rapidly 
the review of the loan portfolio is a continuing event in the light of a changing economy and the dynamics of the banking and regulatory environment 
in management s judgement the allowance for loan losses at june   is adequate 
should the economic climate deteriorate  borrowers could experience difficulty and the level of non performing loans  charge offs and delinquencies could rise and require increased provisions 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies could require the company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgements of information available to them at the time of their examination 
the bank was examined by the federal deposit insurance corporation in april and no additions to the allowance were requested as a result of this examination

interest rate sensitivity the following table sets forth the company s interest rate sensitivity position at june   measured in terms of the volume of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities that are subject to repricing in future time periods 
for the purposes of this analysis  money market deposits have been presented in the within month category and savings and now deposits have been presented in the to months category  although the interest rate elasticity of money market  savings and now deposits cannot be tied to any one time category 
non accrual loans and overdrafts have been presented in the non interest bearing category 
significant variations may exist in the degree of interest rate sensitivity between individual asset and liability types within the repricing periods presented due to differences in their repricing elasticity relative to changes in the general level of interest rates 
june  within within non in thousands within after interest months months years years bearing total assets securities      federal funds sold   loans       other assets   total assets       source of funds deposits demand non interest bearing   now accounts   money market   savings and other   certificates of deposit     securities sold under repurchase agreements   other liabilities   stockholders equity   total sources of funds      cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap     percent of total assets the company maintains a relatively balanced position for managing interest rate risk and  at june   its one year cumulative gap was million  or of assets 
a liability sensitive gap implies that the company s net interest margin could be adversely affected by a sudden increase in interest rates 
during the past year the company s net interest margin increased basis points as compared with  driven in part by the benefit  over the past year  from higher interest rates on the company s adjustable rate assets which have repriced more quickly than deposit liabilities 
the company s deposit rates  in particular savings and money market rates  have not repriced over the past year and this together with the refinements in asset mix  has been a principal contributor to the increase in the company s net interest margin 
the company structures its loan and securities portfolios to provide for portfolio repricing consistent with its interest rate risk objectives 
a significant factor in determining the company s ability to maintain its net interest margin in a changing interest rate environment is its ability to manage its core deposit rates 
essentially all of the company s deposit base is composed of local retail deposit accounts which tend to be somewhat less sensitive to moderate interest fluctuations than other funding sources and  therefore  provide a reasonably stable and cost effective source of funds 
capital resources during shareholders equity decreased to million  as a result of the company s stock buy back program  while book value increased to  at june  the change in shareholders equity resulted primarily from the repurchase of of the company s shares of common stock and the payment of cash dividends of 
per share  a payout ratio  offset by earnings of  or per share   from the exercise of stock options and reissuance of treasury stock  and a  decrease in the adjustment to shareholders equity for net unrealized securities losses reported in shareholders equity 
shareholders equity at june  included an adjustment  net of taxes  for unrealized holding losses of  on securities transferred from available for sale to held to maturity and net unrealized holding losses of  on securities available for sale 
in october the company resumed dividend payments with the payment of a 
quarterly cash dividend  following a four year lapse 
in october the company increased its quarterly cash dividend to 
for total dividends of per share were declared and paid 
the company and the bank are subject to minimum capital requirements established  respectively  by the federal reserve board the frb and the fdic 
at june  the company s leverage capital ratio was and its tier i and total risk based capital ratios were and  respectively 
at june  the bank s leverage capital ratio was and its tier i and total risk based capital ratios were and  respectively 
the company and the bank are categorized as well capitalized 
a well capitalized institution  which is the highest capital category for an institution as defined by the prompt corrective action regulations issued by the fdic and the frb  is one which maintains a total risk based ratio of or above  a tier i risk based ratio of or above and a leverage ratio of or above  and is not subject to any written order  written agreement  capital directive  or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level 
dividend restrictions the company s ability to pay dividends is dependent on the bank s ability to pay dividends to the company 
there are certain restrictions on the payment of dividends by the bank to the company 
under connecticut law a bank is prohibited from declaring a cash dividend on its common stock except from its net earnings for the current year and retained net profits for the preceding two years 
consequently  the maximum amount of dividends payable by the bank to the company for the year ended june  is  in some instances  further restrictions on dividends may be imposed on the company by the frb 
the company believes that the payment of cash dividends to its shareholders is appropriate  provided that such payment considers the company s capital needs  asset quality  and overall financial condition and does not adversely affect the financial stability of the company or the bank 
the continued payment of cash dividends by the company will be dependent on the company s future core earnings  financial condition and capital needs  regulatory restrictions  and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors of the company

the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial condition or its results of operations 
impact of inflation and changing prices the company s financial statements have been prepared in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effect of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
notwithstanding this  inflation can directly affect the value of loan collateral  in particular real estate 
sharp decreases in real estate prices  as discussed previously  have resulted in significant loan losses and losses on real estate acquired 
inflation  or disinflation  could continue to significantly affect the company s earnings in future periods
