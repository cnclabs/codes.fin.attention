item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company participates in floor plan arrangements with several major third party lenders on behalf of its dealers  most of whom have financing arrangements with more than one lender 
except as described above or where it has a direct repurchase agreement with a dealer  the company is under no material obligation to repurchase boats from its dealers 
from time to time the company will voluntarily repurchase a boat for the convenience of the dealer or for another dealer who needs a particular model not readily available from the factory 
the marketing of boats to retail customers is primarily the responsibility of the dealer  whose efforts are supplemented by the company through advertising in boating magazines and participation in regional  national  and international boat shows 
additionally  in order to further promote its products  for fiscal and the company developed a racing program 
this entailed the construction of specially designed race boats which were entered in major national offshore boat races 
as of august   fountain race boats won of major races 
the result of this record of victories by a major manufacturer is that the company s products won a reputation for very fast and safe hull designs  durable construction  and mechanical reliability 
the company believes that the favorable publicity generated by its winning race boats has contributed significantly to its sales volume 
although the company curtailed its racing program for fiscal and sold all of its race boats  the fact that its racing program was so successful in fiscal and fiscal has  the company believes  significantly benefited its sales volume in subsequent years 
since fiscal  the company has limited its participation in racing to partial support of customer owned and driven fountain race boats 
these fountain race boats were  in general  very successful in the various racing circuits in which they competed 
as part of the marketing program for its new line of sport fishing boats  the company sponsored several outstanding sport fishermen in the southern kingfish association s king mackerel tournaments 
this competitive circuit is held throughout the southeast 
in fiscal  the company s boats and sponsored fishermen dominated the tournaments by winning four of the top five spots 
one fountain fisherman  clayton kirby  was named angler of the year and finished in first place 
again  in fiscal  first place was taken by a fountain fisherman 
fountain fishermen also won second place and of the top spots in fiscal since fiscal  the foutain fishing team has continued to place high in the final standings 
the southern kingfish association s tournaments are held weekly and attract from one hundred to one thousand entrants with prizes ranging up to  the winning participation by fountain sport fishing boats has given them favorable exposure to serious sport fishermen  in particular with respect to the superior performance of fountain s fishing boat line

competition within the power boat manufacturing industry is intense 
while the high performance sports boat market comprises only a small segment of all boats manufactured  the higher prices commanded by these boats make it a significant market in terms of total dollars spent 
the manufacturers that compete directly with the company in its market segment include wellcraft division of genmar industries  inc formula  a division of thunderbird products corporation cigarette racing team  inc baja boats  inc apache boats  inc the company believes that in its market segment  speed  performance  quality  and safety are the main competitive factors  with styling and price being somewhat lesser considerations

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
as described more fully below at business environment  approximately half of the company s shipments to dealers were financed through so called floor plan arrangements with third party lenders pursuant to which the company may be required to repurchase boats repossessed by the lenders if the dealer defaults under his credit arrangements 
the other half of shipments were cod or payment prior to shipment 
generally  the company recognizes a sale when a boat is shipped to a customer  legal title and all other incidents of ownership have passed from the company to the customer  and payment is received from the dealer s third party commercial lender or from the customer 
this is the method of sales recognition believed to be in use by most boat manufacturers 
the company has developed criteria for determining whether a shipment should be recorded as a sale or as a deferred sale a balance sheet liability 
the criteria for recording a sale are that the boat has been completed and shipped to a customer  that title and all other incidents of ownership have passed to the customer  and that there is no direct commitment to repurchase the boat or to pay floor plan interest beyond the normal sales program terms 
at june   the company estimated the balances in deferred sales to be  and in deferred cost of sales to be  as of june   the company estimated the balances in deferred sales to be  and in deferred cost of sales to be  the differences between the estimates for deferred sales and deferred cost of sales at june  and june  had the effect of decreasing the gross margin on sales and net income after taxes for the year by  per share 
the increase in deferred sales from  at june  to  at june  was because of an increase in the number of instances in which the company made commitments to dealers to pay the interest on floor plan financed boats in excess of the time period specified in its written sales program for the year and to an increase in the number of direct repurchase agreements the company had in effect with its dealers 
at june   the company estimated the balances in deferred sales to be  and in deferred cost of sales to be  the differences between the estimates for deferred sales and deferred cost of sales at june  and june  had the effect of increasing the gross margin on sales and net income after taxes for the year by  
per share 
at june   there were no commitments to dealers to pay the interest on floor plan financed boats in excess of the time period specified in the company s written sales program and there were no direct repurchase agreements 
this was because of much improved market conditions and strong ongoing consumer demand for boats 
therefore  there were no deferred sales or cost of sales estimated at june  the differences between the estimates for deferred sales and deferred cost of sales at june  and june  had the effect of increasing the gross margin on sales and net income after taxes for the year by  the company has a contingent liability to repurchase boats where it participates in the floor plan financing made available to its dealers by third party finance companies 
sales to participating dealers are approved by the respective finance companies 
if a participating dealer does not satisfy its obligation to the lender and the boat is subsequently repossessed by the lender  then the company can be required to repurchase the boat 
the company had a contingent liability of approximately  at june    at june   and  at june  for the shipment of boats which remained uncollected by the finance companies at those dates 
the lesser contingent liability at june  is due to fewer boats being floor planned by dealers with finance companies 
of the foregoing contingent liability amounts   is reflected as deferred sales in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of june  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  at june  and june   the company had recorded a  reserve for losses which may be reasonably expected to be incurred on boat repurchases in future years 
business environment 
sales for fiscal were  a increase from sales for fiscal improved sales volume for fiscal was in line with a general improvement in the overall recreational boating industry and the result of additional production capacity 
also  the company continued its highly effective advertising and marketing programs throughout fiscal sales for fiscal were  an increase from sales for fiscal sales for fiscal were  for the last five months of fiscal  the company was unable to obtain the high performance engines it needed 
the shortage of high performance engines seriously reduced the company s sales volume over the last five months of the year 
engine deliveries were resumed in july  in fiscal  the company continued to advertise and market aggressively 
management believes that the company s advertising  marketing  racing  and tournament fishing programs  as well as  its reputation as the builder of the highest quality  best performing  and safest high performance boats in the industry  all contributed to increased sales for fiscal typically  each dealer s floor plan credit facilities are secured by the dealer s inventory  and  perhaps  other personal and real property 
in connection with the dealers floor plan arrangements  the company as well as substantially all other major manufacturers has agreed in most instances to repurchase  under certain circumstances  any of its boats which a lender repossesses from a dealer and returns to the company 
in the event that a dealer defaults under a credit line  the lender may invoke the manufacturers repurchase agreements with respect to that dealer 
in that event  all repurchase agreements of all manufacturers supplying a defaulting dealer are generally invoked regardless of the boat or boats with respect to which the dealer has defaulted 
except where there is a direct repurchase agreement with the customer  the company is under no obligation to repurchase boats from its dealers  although it will on occasion voluntarily assist a dealer in selling a boat or repurchase a boat for the convenience of a dealer 
no boats were repurchased in fiscal and fiscal in connection with floor plan arrangements 
five boats were repurchased during fiscal in connection with floor plan arrangements 
at june   the company had recorded a  reserve for losses which may be reasonably expected to beincurred on boat repurchases in future years 
results of operations 
net income for fiscal was  or per share outstanding 
this compares to net income for fiscal of  or 
per share 
the net loss for fiscal was  or per share 
the improvement in earnings for fiscal was the result of greater sales volume  price increases  production efficiencies  and a favorable sales mix 
the mix of sales continued to be weighted with sales of the company s larger  higher margin sport boats 
income for the year also included a non recurring  discount earned for the early retirement of indebtedness to a vendor 
net income for fiscal was up primarily because of substantially improved sales volume 
sales were  or up by from the previous year 
price increases and production efficiencies also contributed to increased earnings for the year 
the loss for fiscal is primarily attributable to lesser sales volume 
sales for fiscal were  the sales mix for fiscal was unfavorable and overall sales volume through february  was less than anticipated 
fewer boats were sold and they were generally smaller and less profitable 
in fiscal  at the miami boat show in mid february  the new positive lift hull design was introduced 
this new hull design significantly increases speed  improves handling  and results in much better fuel economy 
subsequent to the introduction of this new design  the company received many orders for large  profitable sport boats having the new positive lift hull 
as the company s sales order volume improved  it began to greatly increase its level of purchases of high performance engines and other critical components 
unfortunately  the high perfomance engines and certain other critical components were not available on a timely basis 
this caused serious and prolonged delays in the company s boat production 
many costly inefficiencies were incurred in its manufacturing operations as a consequence of not having the necessary high performance engines and components on a timely basis 
by july   most of these supply problems had been resolved 
most of the sales orders that were not completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal because of delayed deliveries of critical components were completed in the first quarter of fiscal the company s gross profit margin as a percentage of sales increased to in fiscal from for fiscal the increase in the gross margin percentage was due to price increases and the sales mix of larger  higher margin sport boats 
greater sales volume and production efficiencies also contributed to an improved gross margin for fiscal the company s gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales increased to for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the increase in gross margin for fiscal was primarily due to increased volume 
price increases and production efficiencies also contributed to the improved margin 
depreciation expense was  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal depreciation expense by asset category was as follows fiscal fiscal fiscal land improvements    buildings    molds plugs    machinery equipment 
   furniture fixtures    transportation equip    the  decrease in depreciation expense for fiscal is due to an excess of molds becoming fully depreciated over new molds commencing to be depreciated during the year 
those particular molds which are now fully depreciated are still in active service 
following is a schedule of the net fixed asset additions during fiscal and fiscal fiscal fiscal buildings   molds and plugs   machinery equipment   furniture fixtures   transportation equipment  selling expenses were  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal the company continued to promote its products primarily by magazine advertising in fiscal advertising expense was  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal these advertising expenditures increased the company s visibility in the recreational marine industry and promoted its boat sales 
management believes that advertising is necessary in order to maintain the company s sales volume and dealer base 
additionally  in an effort to further promote its products  the company continued its offshore racing and tournament fishing programs 
these programs cost  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal as previously noted  the company curtailed its offshore racing program in fiscal and sold its last remaining race boat  but continued a limited racing program and its tournament fishing program 
the company believes that its highly successful racing and tournament fishing programs for fiscal and prior years will benefit future years as well 
selling expenses compared for the past three fiscal years were as follows fiscal fiscal fiscal offshore racing and tournament fishing    advertising    salaries commissions 
   boat shows    dealer incentives    other selling expenses 
   general and administrative expenses include the finance  accounting  legal  personnel  data processing  and administrative operating expenses of the company 
these expenses were  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal most of the increase for fiscal over fiscal was in executive compensation  travel expense  and attorneys fees 
interest expense was  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal the decrease in interest expense for fiscal is from lesser outstanding indebtedness 
during fiscal some trucks were sold yielding a gain of  during fiscal some miscellaneous fixed assets were sold yielding a loss amounting to  no fixed assets were sold in fiscal included in other income for fiscal is a non recurring  discount earned for the early retirement of indebtedness to a vendor 
included in other income for fiscal is the non recurring gain on the settlement of a state sales and use tax assessment amounting to  also included in other income for fiscal are  of technical consulting fees earned by mr

these consulting fees amounted to  for fiscal and to  for fiscal under the terms of his current consulting contract  mr 
fountain s consulting fees will be reduced by approximately for fiscal and will end entirely after fiscal liquidity and financial resources 
operations in fiscal provided  in cash 
net income plus depreciation expense provided cash amounting to  however  relatively large amounts were needed to finance increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
the ending cash balance was  operations for the prior fiscal year consumed  in cash 
net income plus depreciation expense provided cash amounting to  however  relatively large amounts were needed to finance an increase in accounts receivable  a decrease in accounts payable  and a reduction in customer deposits 
the ending cash balance was  for fiscal  operations provided  in cash 
this combined with the beginning cash balance of  was sufficient to meet the company s needs for the year 
the ending cash balance was  investing activities for fiscal required  including expenditures for addtional molds and plugs amounting to  and for other property  plant  and equipment amounting to  investing activities for the prior fiscal year required  including expenditures for additional molds and plugs amounting to  and for other property  plant  and equipment amounting to  for fiscal  investing activities required  including expenditures for additional molds and plugs amounting to  and for other property  plant  and equipment amounting to  financing activities for fiscal used  included in this amount is  of indebtedness to a vendor which was retired entirely during the year

fountain  jr  with the issuance of  additional common shares to mr 
fountain and to triangle finance ltd 
debt repayments amounted to  the net increase in cash for fiscal was  for fiscal  the company anticipates that the  beginning cash balance and the amounts expected to be provided from fiscal operations will be sufficient to meet most of the company s liquidity needs for the year 
however  planned capital expenditures for fiscal are substantially greater than for fiscal the company intends to increase its production capacity  principally for new products  in fiscal therefore  the company has arranged for a substanial asset leasing line of credit for new production equipment 
the company is also negotiating for other additional lines of credit 
effective december   the company refinanced its indebtedness to metlife capital corporation 
a  revolving loan was incorporated into the long term debt and the total amount was amortized over ten years with a call at the end of the fifth year 
the interest rate on the debt was fixed at 
the new monthly payment amounts very closely approximate what the principal and interest payment amounts were prior to the refinancing 
the indebtedness is secured by a first lien on all of the company s assets  except engines manufactured by mercury marine 
an additional  was borrowed in the transaction 
the total amount of the debt to metlife at december  was  after the refinancing 
the indebtedness to metlife was  at june  and  at june  the loan agreement with metlife was amended january   to revise certain financial ratio requirements that the company had previously not attained 
after  the revision of the financial ratio requirements and at june  and  the company was in compliance with all of the metlife financial ratio requirements 
in june of  the company arranged for a line of credit from deutsche financial services for engine purchases 
at june  the amount owed to deutsche was  at june  the amount owed was  and at june  the amount owed was  the maximum amount of the line of credit from deutsche is  the debt is secured by a first lien on all engine inventory and by a  irrevocable letter of credit 
in december   the company borrowed  from ge capital corporation for the purpose of retiring its indebtedness to a vendor 
this debt to ge capital corporation is scheduled for repayment over forty months at interest 
it is secured by various boat molds and product tooling and by an irrevocable bank letter of credit for  the unpaid balance at june  was  effects of inflation 
the company has not been materially affected by the moderate inflation of recent years 
since most of the company s plant and equipment are relatively new  expenditures for replacements are not expected to be a factor in the near term future 
when raw material costs increase because of inflation  the company attempts to minimize the effect of these increases by using alternative  less costly materials  or by finding less costly sources for the materials it uses 
when the foregoing measures are not possible  its selling prices are increased to recover the cost increases 
the company s products are targeted at that segment of the power boat market where retail purchasers are generally less significantly affected by price or other economic conditions 
consequently  management believes that the impact of inflation on sales and the results of operations will not be material
