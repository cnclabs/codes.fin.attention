the purchase price was  and included the real estate and certain items of furniture and fixtures 
the appraised value  as reported by rtc  of the acquired assets was  conveyance was effected july  balance sheet summary loans loans comprise the company s largest earning asset category and accordingly generate the greatest yield 
therefore  most other assets and liabilities are managed to accommodate fluctuations in the loan portfolio 
the average volume of loans  net of unearned interest  for was  this volume was a increase over the average of through continued emphasis on loan generation and because of improving local and national economic conditions  loans net of unearned interest rose from the december   total of  to the december   total of  the consolidation of ceebee  which had few loans by comparison to its volume of deposits and the acquisition of the altus deposits  caused the company s loan to deposit ratio to fall to in may of at december   the loan to deposit ratio was 
as a result of the loan growth  the company s loan to deposit ratio at december   was 
commercial and industrial loans reflected the largest segmental growth in the loan portfolio for  increasing from  at december  to  at december  this  growth was partially the result of several large loans extended to customers in the health care industry and timber industry

credit lines increased by  from  at december  to  at december  allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of the uncollectible loans within the company s loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is charged when it is determined that the prospects of payment of the principal of a loan have significantly diminished 
recoveries  if any  are credited back to the allowance 
through periodic reviews of the loan portfolio that includes an analysis of such factors as current and expected economic conditions  historical loss experience  levels of non accruing loans and delinquencies  the company s personnel determine the appropriate level at which to maintain the allowance for loan losses 
because the allowance is based on assumptions and subjective judgement  it is not necessarily indicative of the actual charge offs which may ultimately occur 
the company s allowance for loan losses totaled  at december  as compared to  at december  the resulting ratios of allowance to total loans net of unearned interest were and for and respectively 
the amount of loans determined by management that require special attention due to potential weaknesses grew from  at december  to  at december  non accruing loans  expressed as a percentage of total loans net of unearned interest  remained relatively stable at 
at december  as compared to 
at december  at its current level  the allowance for loan losses exceeds the regulatory minimum requirement 
management believes that the current allowance for loan losses remains adequate to absorb potential losses in the company s loan portfolio 
investments at december   the company s investment portfolio totaled  as compared to  at december  the decline of  was primarily the result of a strong loan demand allowing a shift in funds to the higher yielding loan portfolio 
the decline in the investment portfolio was partially offset by an increase in market values of the remaining investment portfolio

these investments are considered to be a valuable tool in managing the company s liquidity position 
in addition  the utilization of short term investments enhances interest income on funds that might otherwise not be invested 
management closely monitors the balances of short term investments and seeks alternative uses for these funds 
at december   the volume of short term investments amounted to  which was an increase of  over the december  total 
deposits the company relies primarily on its deposits to provide liquidity with which to fund loans and investments

the company actively manages both assets and liabilities to achieve its desired level of liquidity 
in the ordinary course of its business  the company s primary sources of cash are interest and fee income  in addition to loan repayments and the maturity or sales of other earning assets including investment securities 
approximately of the total investment securities portfolio matures within one year 
the entire investment portfolio at december  was classified as available for sale 
these securities are readily marketable  high quality  securities with a market value of  at december   liquid assets  consisting primarily of cash on hand and short term investments totaled  compared to  at december  the liability base provides liquidity through deposit growth  the rollover of maturing deposits and accessibility to external sources of funds 
the company is typically a seller of federal funds although  it may during occasional fluctuations in liquidity factors  purchase federal funds or borrow from the federal reserve bank or federal home loan bank to meet its temporary cash needs 
at december   borrowed funds for short term liquidity needs amounted to  compared to  at year end management considers the company s liquidity sources to be adequate to meet its current and projected needs 
stockholders equity stockholders equity  or capital  is a measure of the company s net worth  soundness and viability 
the company continues to exhibit a strong capital position while paying consistent dividends to its stockholders 
the capital base allows the company to take advantage of business opportunities and at the same time ensures that the necessary resources are available to absorb inherent business risk 
total stockholders equity amounted to  at december  as compared to  at december  net income for was  with cash dividends declared in the amount of  treasury stock was acquired for the sum of  in addition to the net increase provided by earnings less dividends and treasury stock acquisitions  capital was increased by the change in unrealized losses in investments of  risk based capital regulations adopted by the federal reserve board require all bank holding companies and banks to achieve and maintain specified ratios of capital to risk weighted assets 
the risk based capital rules weigh assets and off balance sheet obligations at   or  depending upon the risk classification of the asset or obligation 
all bank holding companies and banks must maintain a minimum total capital to total risk weighted assets ratio of  at least half of which must be in the form of core  or tier capital consisting of stockholders equity  less goodwill

interest rates on the loan portfolio increased from in to for total average earning assets increased from  in to an average of  in for an increase of in average earning assets 
interest income on the investment securities portfolio decreased from  in to  in the decrease in interest income is primarily attributable to a decline in average volume of investment securities offset by an by an increase in the interest rate on taxable investment securities from in to in interest income from federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell totaled  in as compared to  in the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the average yield on short term investments from in to in coupled with an increase in the average balance from  in to  in interest expense increased from  in to  in the increase is primarily due to a increase in the average balance of deposits and due to increases in rates during additionally  the company s deposit portfolio shifted from interest bearing demand deposits  consisting of now accounts and insured money market demand accounts  and savings accounts to time deposits which bear interest at higher rates 
management believes the shift from interest bearing demand deposits and savings accounts into time deposits indicates a strengthening of the economy with investors willing to make longer commitments for deposited funds 
as a result of the rising interest rates during and the shift in the deposit portfolio  the company s cost of funds rose to in from in net interest income for was  as compared to the total of  for an increase of 
versus interest income for totaled  as compared to  for the increase in interest income was due primarily to an increase in average earning assets during in  interest income on loans totaled  as compared to a total of  this increase was the result of growth in the loan portfolio during average loan totals grow from  for to  for this  increase in loan totals represents a growth of in the loan portfolio 
the change in volume increased loan income by  a higher average yield on loans also added to interest income on loans 
interest income from investment securities increased from  in to  in due to an increase of  in the average volume of securities during the growth in average volume was partially offset by a decline in average yield from to the decrease in yields was partially attributable to the amortization of the purchase premium paid for the ceebee securities portfolio 
interest earned in federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell totaled  in as compared to the total of  the  decrease was the result of a change in volume from  in to  in interest expense totaled  for as compared to  for the increase was the result of increased deposit totals brought about by the cee bee and altus acquisitions 
total interest bearing deposits grew from totals of  to  for an increase of  in average volume 
in addition to volume increases  the average cost of funds rose from for to for the resulting net interest income increased by  from totals of  to totals of  provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is an expense item to earnings which replaces reductions to the allowance for loan losses caused by actual net charge offs and establishes reserves for the growth of the loan portfolio 
the provision for loan losses in totaled  as compared to  in the provision was reduced from the provision of  due to management s assessment following a large recovery in actual charge offs and significant growth in the loan portfolio account for the increase in the provision for loan losses from to management continuously monitors the allowance for loan losses and adjusts charges to the provision for loan losses as it deems appropriate to maintain adequate reserves against future losses 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of allowance for loan losses 
non interest income additional fee income is generated for the company through the wide variety of financial services offered 
with continued pressure on net interest income  the company views the expansion of fee income and the development of new services as a major source of future earnings 
the company s primary sources of non interest income are fee based trust services  deposit service charges  credit life commissions  brokerage income  and commission income from the company s insurance subsidiary 
versus for  non interest income totaled  as compared to  for the increase of  is primarily attributable to an increase in deposit service charges 
for the year  deposit service charges amounted to  as compared to  for credit life commissions declined during by some  this decline was partially off set through increased commissions earned by the insurance subsidiary on other life insurance products 
versus in  non interest income totaled  compared to  for  an increase of  which was primarily attributable to an increased level of service charges on deposit accounts from the cee bee acquisition 
the increase in the volume of deposits resulted in a corresponding increase in deposit service charges 
for the year ended december   deposit service charges were  a  increase over the total of  net gains on the sale of investment securities for was  compared to  for during the last half of  the company initiated a new accounts receivable financing program which generated approximately  in income in in  the first full year that this service was offered  net fee income totaled  non interest expense versus the total non interest expense for was  as compared to a total of  for salaries and benefits comprise the largest segment of non interest expense 
during  the salaries and benefits totaled  as compared to  for the increase of  was the result of salary increases  additional employees and increased benefit cost 
increased pension cost accounted for  of the total 
pension expense was increased due to the down turn in the security markets during which impacted negatively on the value of pension plan assets at january  the valuation date for determination of annual pension cost 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of pension cost 
other expense categories such as automations and computer expense exceeded levels 
however  increased expenses were offset by a reduction in the total federal deposit insurance corporation fdic premiums paid for deposit insurance in as compared to fdic premiums expensed for amounted to  as compared to  for  resulting in a savings of  due to a reduction in fdic premiums 
additional savings were achieved in other areas such as stationery and supplies by closer attention to inventory levels and cost of supplies purchased 
versus the company s non interest expense for the year ended december  was  compared to  in salaries and employee benefits increased from  in to  in regular salary increases  coupled with higher overtime expense due to the acquisition and conversion of ceebee and the installation of new automation equipment  were the primary causes of the increased expense in primarily as the result of merging ceebee into the company  the establishment of local and wide area computer networks and the installation of state of the art image technology  automation expense  stationery and supplies expense and the expense of premises of fixed assets increased in renovations to the former ceebee buildings and the purchase and renovation of the selma branch altus building also contributed to a  or  increase in the expense of premises and fixed assets 
the growth in the volume of deposits caused fdic insurance premiums to increase  in to  provision for income tax versus income before the charge for income tax was  for as compared to  for  an increase of 
the provision for income tax which includes both federal and state taxes amounted to  for the effective tax rate for and was and respectively 
the company participates in multiple issues of low income housing credits which reduced federal income taxes by and for and  respectively 
versus income before taxes for totaled  as compared to  for the provision for federal and state income tax was  for and  in the resulting provision expressed as a percent of income before taxes was for and for the lower rate in was the result of an increase in tax exempt income brought about by the consolidation of ceebee during impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and therefore differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories 
however  inflation does have an important impact on the growth of total assets and creates the need to generate more equity capital in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
another significant effect of inflation is on non interest expenses  which tend to rise during periods of inflation 
the company s profitability  like that of most financial institutions  is dependent to a large extent upon its net interest income 
management believes  therefore  that changes in interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the price of goods and services  since such prices are affected by inflation 
whenever interest earning assets reprice to market interest rates at a different pace than interest bearing liabilities  net interest income performance will be affected favorably or unfavorably during periods of changes in general interest rates 
in a volatile interest rate environment  liquidity and the maturity structure of the company s assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels 
the company is unable to predict future changes in market rates of interest and their impact on the company s profitability 
management  however  attempts to maintain an essentially balanced position between rate sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations and believes that its current rate sensitivity position is well matched  indicating the assumption of minimal interest rate risk 
new accounting standards the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition disclosure  on january  under the new standards  a loan is considered impaired  based on current information and events  if it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
uncollateralized loans are measured for impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate  while all collateral dependent loans are measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral 
the adoption of sfas and resulted in no additional provision for credit loses at january  in march  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas no 

sfas no 
requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used by the entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized 
this statement also requires that long lived assets and certain intangibles to be disposed of be reported at the lower of carrying amount of fair value less cost to sell 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  management does not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on the company s financial statement 
the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas no 
in october this statement defines a fair value the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas no 
in october this statement defines a fair value based method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity instrument 
however  sfas no 
allows an entity to continue to measure compensation costs for those plans using the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
entities electing to remain with the accounting in opinion no 
must make proforma disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if the fair value based method of accounting defined in sfas no 
had been applied 
under the fair value based method  compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized over the service period  which is usually the vesting period 
under the intrinsic value based method  compensation cost is the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of the stock at the grant date or other measurement date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
most fixed stock option plans have no intrinsic value at grant date  and under opinion  no compensation cost is recognized for them 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning december  the company has elected to continue to measure compensation cost for their stock option plan under the provisions in apb opinion
