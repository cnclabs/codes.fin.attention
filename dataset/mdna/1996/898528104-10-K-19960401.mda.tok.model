see factors that may impact results 
results of operations revenues for were  a decrease from levels 
the decrease in revenues was due primarily to significantly lower shipments of the company s wi based products as these products reached maturation in a rapidly evolving personal computer marketplace 
sales of wi based products to one customer accounted for of revenues in this entity discontinued its wi based computer systems in the first quarter of higher sales of wp based products were not sufficient to offset lower unit shipments of the wi and lower selling prices on all of the company s graphics accelerator products 
the company introduced the first product of its third generation graphics and multimedia family  the et  at comdex in november this product family is not yet in full volume production 
due to short product design cycles in the computer industry as a whole  announced and anticipated new product introductions by competitors of the company  and anticipated design changes from major customers  the company expects pricing and competitive market pressures on existing products will continue to intensify and revenues and earnings will continue to be lower than levels unless and until the et becomes a commercially successful product 
in addition  because of the risks in bringing new technologies to market and market acceptance of new products  in the production process of semiconductor devices  in the availability and cost of materials from the company s suppliers and due to the competitive nature of the graphics and pc market  there can be no assurance that revenues and earnings from the et will be sufficient to return the company s operating results to historic levels 
revenues for and were  and  respectively 
while sales only increased between periods  the product mix comprising the sales changed significantly between years 
the company began a product transition late in the first quarter of when sales of the company s first generation graphics accelerator product the w began to contribute significantly to the company s revenues 
the w was the first in a family of products introduced by the company to enhance video performance  especially in microsoft windows and other graphical user interface gui applications 
the company also introduced its second generation accelerator products in and sales of the wi and wp contributed significantly to revenues late in the third and fourth quarters of  respectively  and continued into for the years ended december  and  sales of products of the full w family represented approximately and of total revenues  respectively 
in alone  sales of the second generation accelerator products wi and wp represented approximately of total revenues 
also contributing to revenues in was the company s new video accelerator  viper 
revenues based upon the newer technologies substantially replaced revenues based upon the company s older et and w based technology 
in addition to a change in the technology underlying the company s products  there was a change in product mix between years 
unit shipments of the company s vlsi graphics chips increased slightly in sales of board level enhancement products continue to decrease primarily due to lower cost alternatives available in other markets including the far eastern markets 
average selling price on vlsi graphics chips also increased slightly in as lower average selling prices on the et and w based technology in were offset by higher selling prices for the company s wi and wp based family of products as well as the new viper 
the company expects selling prices on existing technologies to continue to decrease as a result of the competitive nature of the graphics marketplace and the pc market as a whole 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was for  for and for the increase in cost of sales in and is due to the fact that the impact of cost reduction programs on the wi and wp graphics accelerator products has not been sufficient to offset lower selling prices on all of the company s products 
also contributing to the increase in was a one time reserve of  recorded by the company in the fourth quarter related to establishing a reserve for certain of its older technology based inventory 
in addition  because of the price competitive nature of the market  anticipated pricing pressures on mature products and the current volatility in the yen dollar exchange rate  the company expects increased pricing pressures impacting margins on its existing w product line 
in the future  the company s gross margin percentages may be affected by factors including but not limited to increased competition and related decreases in unit average selling price particularly with respect to mature products  timing of volume shipments of new products  the introduction of new products by competitors  the availability and cost of products from the company s suppliers and changes in the mix of products sold and customers 
research and development expense in was  a increase from research and development expense in was  a increase from the increase in both periods is due primarily to increased personnel and outside consulting costs to support development of its third generation graphics products  including the et  and due to the pursuit of new opportunities to expand the company s product line to address multimedia applications 
the company expects that its research and development expenditures will continue to increase in as the company attempts to develop products which respond to emerging markets in desktop pcs  home pcs and interactive communication markets 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  and of revenues in  and  respectively 
the increase in is due primarily to both the fixed nature of certain of the company s operating expenses and increased legal costs associated with the class action lawsuit referred to in note of the consolidated financial statements 
the company s effective income tax rates were  and for  and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate in is primarily due to estimated research and development credits representing a higher percentage of pretax income 
the increase in the effective tax rate in was primarily due to a higher effective state income tax 
inflation is not expected to have an adverse significant impact on the company s operations 
liquidity and capital resources the company s ability to generate cash adequate to meet its requirements results primarily from cash on hand  operating cash flow and the availability of bank borrowing 
the company believes that these sources are sufficient to fund the company s working capital requirements 
total working capital was  and  at december  and  respectively 
the company s cash and short term investments increased to  at december from  at december  the increase is due primarily to the excess of cash generated from operations over that required to fund its capital requirements  stock repurchases  and dividend program 
the company also has a bank line of credit providing total availability of  there were no borrowings on this line in or the company had capital expenditures of approximately  during  related primarily to the purchase of equipment and software utilized in the company s research and development activities 
the company expects its existing sources of liquidity to be sufficient to fund its working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
in order to obtain an adequate supply of wafers  especially wafers manufactured using advanced process technologies  the company has considered and will continue to consider various possible transactions  including the use of take or pay contracts which commit the company to purchase specified quantities of wafers over specified periods or the use of standby letters of credit to secure future capacity on a take or pay basis 
in addition  a number of the company s competitors have entered into various transactions to secure wafer capacity including equity investments in or advances to wafer foundries in exchange for guaranteed production  or the formation of joint ventures to own  construct or operate a wafer fabrication facility 
the company  to date  has not participated in advance funding or joint ventures and will continue to work to secure adequate capacity without such arrangements 
should the company be required to enter into any of the above manufacturing arrangements to secure foundry capacity  such arrangements may require substantial capital investment  which may require the company to seek additional equity or debt financing  and there can be no assurance that such additional financing  if required  will be available when needed or  if available  will be on satisfactory terms 
in addition  the company may  from time to time  as business conditions warrant  invest in or acquire businesses  technologies or products that complement the business of the company 
no such investments or acquisitions are being negotiated as of the date of this form k
