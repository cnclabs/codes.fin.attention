item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview 
fiscal year marked a year of significant change and accomplishment for sse telecom 
the company s financial results were impacted by some of these significant changes and the profitability from operations was disappointing as a result 
on january   the company acquired the business and assets of fairchild data  a leading manufacturer of satellite modems and related earth station products 
this acquisition is consistent with the company s strategy to leverage its satellite transceiver capabilities to other earth station equipment and to position itself as a significant satellite earth station equipment provider 
the business of fairchild data was continued as a new wholly owned subsidiary of the company  sse data  and the results of the operations of sse data are included for eight months of fiscal the acquisition consideration consisted of million of cash   shares of the company s common stock  and warrants to purchase  shares of the company s common stock 
an additional  shares may be issued based upon sse data operating results for the calendar year 
the fairchild data acquisition was accounted for as an asset purchase  and accordingly  the results of operations of sse data are included in the fiscal financial statements from the date of acquisition 
in connection with the acquisition  in the march quarter  the company recorded one time charges consisting of million related to the purchased in process research and development of fairchild data  and million for the write off of duplicative assets at sse technologies  including network software and several models of modem products 
these non recurring charges substantially impacted the company s financial results for the fiscal year 
on september   alcatel telspace  sa alcatel telspace  a unit of alcatel telecom  acquired a equity interest in the company 
the company received proceeds of million in exchange for  shares of common stock issued to alcatel telspace 
in a related transaction  the two companies also entered into agreements to jointly develop certain satellite communications equipment which will further expand the product portfolio of the company 
alcatel telspace  a customer of the company  is a major international satellite systems provider of satellite earth stations 
during the fiscal year the company repurchased approximately  shares of its own stock at various times and prices in the market 
the average price of treasury stock acquired in fiscal year was per share 
in connection with the company s sale of stock to alcatel telspace in september  the company sold  treasury shares which had been repurchased by the company under its stock repurchase program 
the company s operating profitability was significantly impacted in the last two quarters of  primarily as a result of the introduction of a new generation of satellite transceiver products to the marketplace 
the product introduction took longer and was more costly than had been planned 
competitive pricing pressure  higher costs and manufacturing inefficiencies associated with this product transition from the prior generation of transceiver products to the company s new star transceivers continued to negatively impact gross margins 
the transition to full commercial production is expected to be completed in total backlog was million  million and million at the end of fiscal years  and  respectively  representing an increase of for and an increase of for of the million backlog at september   million is attributable to the backlog of sse data 
results of operation revenue sales were million for fiscal as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing year to year increases of in and in the growth in fiscal was attributable to the inclusion of digital modem product lines acquired from fairchild data as well as increased sales of the company s transceiver products 
sse data sales were million in fiscal this growth reflects the continuing worldwide requirements for satellite products in the expanding satellite telecommunications markets 
the increase in fiscal was mainly attributable to the new tri band rack mounted converter product and sales increase in the european market 
gross margin gross margin was million or of sales in fiscal  compared to million or and million or of sales in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the gross margin dollar increase was due to higher worldwide unit volume each year 
the gross margin percentage decline in fiscal was caused by several factors competitive price reductions  product mix shifts toward lower power transceiver models that carry lower margins and the significantly higher manufacturing startup costs associated with the new star line of transceivers 
the decline in fiscal was primarily from competitive pricing pressure  lower than anticipated sales due to material shortages and higher material costs associated with the modular product line 
the company expects the gross margin percentage to remain at fiscal levels during the first half of fiscal and to improve during the second half when the star series of transceivers are in full production 
however  there can be no assurance that competitive pressure on average selling prices will not reduce gross margin in the future  that the product mix will continue at its current levels  or that full manufacturing efficiencies will be achieved upon reaching full production levels 
operating expenses research and development spending grew by to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal  and from million in fiscal research and development expenses as a percentage of sales were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in research and development expense relates to the company s continued development of advanced digital modem products  increased system content in various products and the development of the star product line 
the company plans to continue its commitment to research and development in fiscal and to jointly develop innovative products with alcatel telspace 
research and development expenses may increase in absolute dollars in future periods  and may vary as a percentage of sales 
marketing  general and administrative expenses were million or of sales in fiscal  compared to million or of sales in fiscal  and million or of sales in fiscal the increase in expense in both fiscal and fiscal  as compared with the prior fiscal year  was primarily related to the increased costs associated with large sales and sales support staffs  commission expenses resulting from higher sales levels  and sales and marketing programs to launch new products and to enter into new markets worldwide 
the company s investment in its marketing  general and administrative functions may vary as a percentage of sales in the future

in the fourth quarter of the company incurred a charge of  related to the issuance to echostar of warrants to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at per share 
the warrants were issued pursuant to an agreement between echostar and the company under which echostar waived its right of conversion in respect to any principal payments made by the company through december  on account of the company s outstanding convertible subordinated debentures 
the company repaid million of the debenture principal prior to fiscal year end  with proceeds from the alcatel telspace investment and sale of echostar shares 
the gain on the sale of investments is shown net of the value of the warrants in the financial statements 
net interest expense net interest expense was   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase during fiscal reflects a full year of interest expense on the company s convertible debenture and interest under the company s bank line of credit 
during fiscal   and the company had earned interest income on excess cash which lowered net interest expense 
provision for income taxes the company s effective income tax rate was  and in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively

net cash used in operating activities was million in compared to net cash provided from operating activities of million in and net cash used in operating activities of million in cash flow from operations was negative in principally due to the decrease in net income and the increases in accounts receivable and inventory 
the increase in accounts receivable in fiscal was due to the acquisition of sse data 
days sales outstanding dso in receivables were days at september  compared to days in and days in this decrease was the result of improved collection efforts and the impact of lower dso at sse data 
the increase in inventory from million in to million in was primarily attributable to increasing inventory levels to meet desired manufacturing lead times and anticipated demand for the new star series products  and million of inventory relating to the fairchild data acquisition 
inventory turnover was times in fiscal compared to times and times for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the company s investing activities provided million in fiscal as compared to using million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively

the company will seek to obtain waivers for future quarters  when necessary 
the operating and equipment lease lines of credit expire on may  and march  respectively 
the company intends to seek renewal of these lines of credit 
the company believes that its current cash position  funds generated from operations  funds available from its equity holdings in echostar common stock and its lines of credit will be adequate to meet its requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  debt services and external investment for the foreseeable future 
due to certain constraints on the ability to sell echostar shares and potential volatility of the value of the stock  there could be a significant reduction in funding available from the liquidation of echostar stock 
factors that may affect future financial results information contained in this annual report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  many of which can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as may  will  believe  expect  anticipate  estimate  plan  intend  or continue or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology 
there are a number of important factors with respect to such forward looking statements  including certain risks and uncertainties  that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in such forward looking statements 
numerous factors  such as economic and competitive conditions  incoming order levels  timing of product shipments  product margins  new product development  and reliance on key consumers in international sales could cause actual results to differ from those described in these statements and prospective investors and stockholders should carefully consider these factors in evaluating these forward looking statements 
particular factors that may affect future financial results are sales of the company s products are concentrated in a small number of customers 
for fiscal  the top five customers accounted for of sales 
the loss of any existing customer  a significant reduction in the level of sales to any existing customer  or the failure of the company to gain additional customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  a substantial portion of shipments may occur near the end of each quarter 
accordingly  the company s results are difficult to predict and delays in product delivery or closing of a sale can cause revenues and net income to fluctuate significantly from anticipated levels and from quarter to quarter 
the market for the company s products are very competitive and the company expects that competition will increase 
the company believes that its ability to compete successfully will depend on a number of factors both within and outside its control  including price  quality  delivery  product performance and features  timing of new product introductions by the company and its competitors  and customer service and support 
price pressure is expected to continue in the satellite transceiver and modem market in the foreseeable future 
as a result  the company expects to continue to experience declining average sales prices for its products 
the company s future gross margin is dependent upon its ability to reduce costs in line with or faster than declines in sales prices 
the company s manufacturing operations are highly dependent upon the delivery of materials by outside suppliers in a timely manner 
from time to time the company has experienced delivery delays from key suppliers which impacted sales 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience material supply problems or component or subsystem delays in the future
