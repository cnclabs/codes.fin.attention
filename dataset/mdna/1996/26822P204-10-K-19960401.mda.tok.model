the congress credit facility permits borrowings of up to  comprised of a revolving loan the revolving loan  a term loan the term loan and letters of credit collectively  the loans 
borrowings under the revolving loan may not exceed a specified borrowing base the borrowing base 
in addition  revolving loan advances are limited to  less the amounts outstanding under the term loan and letters of credit 
the borrowing base consists of the sum of of eligible accounts receivable  of certain raw material inventory  and of raw material inventory designated for a particular customer which amount   at december   was deleted from the borrowing base in january  
all advances and eligibility criteria under the congress credit facility are discretionary to the lender 
at december    was outstanding under the congress credit facility  which constituted the total availability of the borrowing base

the company intends to replace the above two credit facilities with a single facility to support the company s contract electronic manufacturing operations 
in addition to an increased limit as compared to the sum of the two existing credit facilities a single credit facility will provide a larger borrowing base as a result of calculating availability based on one facility limit versus separate facilities where receivables and inventory might potentially not be utilized for borrowing purposes as a result of having reached the maximum with respect to an individual facility reducing the impact of large customer account receivable concentrations and the resulting reduction in borrowing base
