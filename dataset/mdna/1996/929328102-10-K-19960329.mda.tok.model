during the s  the bank began restructuring its balance sheet to reduce sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations 
consequently  long term investment securities have gradually been reduced 
in  us government securities available for sale were sold  and an fhlb step up bond held to maturity was called 
the reduction of corporate and state and political subdivision bonds were due to maturities and calls 
in  an fhlb step up bond was purchased in the amount of million and us government securities were purchased in the amount of million 
during  the corporate and municipal bond portfolios were reduced primarily as a result of early redemptions or calls 
certain of the proceeds were reinvested into treasury securities and also into a fund which invests in adjustable rate mortgage backed securities issued by governmental agencies 
the following table sets forth the terms to maturity and related weighted average yields of investment securities and short term investments at december  substantially all of the related interest and dividends represent taxable income 
yields on tax exempt obligations are calculated on the basis of actual yields and not on a tax equivalent basis 
at december  amount yield dollars in thousands held to maturity corporate bonds within one year after one but within five years  after five but within ten years  after ten years  state and political subdivisions within one year after one but within five years  after ten years other total debt securities  held to maturity  available for sale us government and agencies within one year  state and political subdivisions after ten years total debt securities  available for sale  short term investments deposits with other banks  federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell  yields on state and political subdivisions are not calculated on a tax equivalent basis since substantially all bonds are taxable and pledged to a municipal bond unit trust 
in addition to the foregoing investment securities  the company has maintained an investment portfolio of mortgage backed securities 
the portfolio of cmo s decreased dramatically during as a result of the high rate of prepayments of the underlying mortgages 
certain of these proceeds were utilized to purchase approximately million of gnma mortgage backed securities with adjustable rates 
these securities were classified as held for sale at december  and subsequently reclassified to available for sale in in accordance with sfas no 
during  the reduction in the mortgage backed securities was due to principal repayments 
the following table sets forth the book values of mortgage backed securities and their related weighted average stated rates at the end of the last three fiscal years

however  as a result of various legislative and regulatory changes since  the commercial and consumer lending powers of the bank increased substantially 
consequently  the bank initiated a diversification strategy in fiscal year which included a significant increase in commercial real estate lending 
commercial real estate lending was discontinued in and only originations required by previous funding commitments were made 
in  however  the bank began to originate small business commercial real estate loans in its primary market area 
the bank s current lending activity is concentrated on lending to consumers and small businesses in the mid atlantic region of the united states  which has traditionally been the bank s principal market area 
the following table sets forth the composition of the corporation s loan portfolio by type of loan at each of the dates indicated 
other than as disclosed below  the company had no concentrations of loans exceeding of total loans at december  december  amount percent amount percent dollars in thousands residential real estate   commercial real estate commercial mortgage   construction   total commercial real estate   commercial   consumer   lease financings   gross loans   less unearned income   allowance for loan losses   net loans   december  amount percent amount percent amount percent dollars in thousands residential real estate    commercial real estate commercial mortgage    construction    total commercial real estate    commercial    consumer    lease financings    gross loans    less unearned income    allowance for loan losses    net loans    includes     and  of residential mortgage loans held for sale at december     and  respectively 
the following table sets forth information as of december  regarding the dollar amount of loans maturing in the company s loan portfolio  including scheduled repayments of principal  based on contractual terms to maturity 
in addition  the table sets forth the dollar amount of loans maturing during the indicated periods  based on whether the loan has a fixed or adjustable rate 
loans having no stated maturity or repayment schedule are reported in the one year or less category 
less than one to over one year five years five years total in thousands real estate loans     construction loans    commercial loans     consumer loans     lease financings    rate sensitivity fixed     adjustable     includes commercial mortgage loans 
the above schedule does not include any prepayment assumptions 
although prepayments tend to be highly dependent upon the current interest rate environment  management believes that the actual repricing and maturity of the loan portfolio is significantly shorter as a result of prepayments than is reflected in the above table 
residential real estate lending 
wsfs originates residential mortgage loans with loan to value ratios up to  however  the bank generally requires private mortgage insurance for up to of the mortgage amount on mortgage loans whose loan to value ratio exceeds 
the bank does not have any significant concentrations of such insurance with any one insurer 
on a limited basis  the bank originates loans with loan to value ratios exceeding without a private mortgage insurance requirement 
at december   the balance of all such loans was approximately million of which million related to lending intended to satisfy the requirements of the community reinvestment act 
generally  residential mortgage loans originated or purchased are underwritten and documented in accordance with standard underwriting criteria published by fnma and or fhlmc to assure maximum eligibility for subsequent sale in the secondary market  however  unless loans are specifically designated for sale  the company holds newly originated loans in portfolio for long term investment 
among other things  the institution requires title insurance  insuring the priority of its lien and fire and extended coverage casualty insurance for the properties securing the residential loans 
all properties securing residential loans made by the bank are appraised by independent appraisers selected by the bank and subject to review in accordance with bank standards 
the majority of adjustable rate loans currently originated have interest rates that adjust every year  with the change in rate limited to two percent at any adjustment date 
the adjustments are generally based upon a margin currently percent over the weekly average yield on us treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity  as published by the federal reserve board 
generally  the maximum rate on these loans is up to six percent above the initial interest rate 
the bank generally underwrites adjustable rate loans under standards consistent with private mortgage insurance and secondary market criteria 
the bank does not originate adjustable rate mortgages with payment limitations that could produce negative amortization 
consistent with industry practice in its market area  the bank has originated adjustable rate mortgage loans with initially discounted interest rates that generally adjust to the fully indexed rate at the first adjustment period 
all such loans are underwritten at the fully indexed rate 
the retention of adjustable rate mortgage loans in the bank s loan portfolio helps mitigate the bank s exposure to changes in interest rates 
however  there are unquantifiable credit risks resulting from potential increased costs to the borrower as a result of the repricing of adjustable rate mortgage loans 
it is possible that during periods of rising interest rates  the risk of default on adjustable rate mortgage loans may increase due to the upward adjustment of interest costs to the borrower 
further  although adjustable rate mortgage loans allow the bank to increase the sensitivity of its asset base to changes in interest rates  the extent of this interest sensitivity is limited by the periodic and lifetime interest rate adjustment limitations 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that yields on the bank s adjustable rate mortgages will adjust sufficiently to compensate for increases in the bank s cost of funds during periods of extreme interest rate increases 
the original contractual loan payment period for residential loans originated is normally to years 
because borrowers may refinance or prepay their loans without penalty  such loans normally remain outstanding for a substantially shorter period of time 
first mortgage loans customarily include due on sale clauses on adjustable and fixed rate loans  which are provisions giving the institutions the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event the borrower sells or otherwise disposes of the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid 
due on sale clauses are an important means of adjusting the rate on existing fixed rate mortgage loans to current market rates 
the bank enforces due on sale clauses through foreclosure and other legal proceedings to the extent available under applicable laws 
commercial real estate and commercial lending 
as a federal savings bank  the bank is permitted to invest up to of its consolidated capital in nonresidential real estate loans and up to of its assets in commercial loans 
prior to  the bank had been operating under a capital plan and was subject to the terms and conditions of a capital directive 
consequently  wsfs had discontinued the origination of commercial real estate loans other than renewal of performing loans or funding outstanding commitments 
beginning in  however  the bank began to originate small business commercial real estate loans in its primary market area 
wsfs has offered commercial real estate mortgage loans on multi family and other commercial real estate 
generally  loan to value ratios for such loans do not exceed of appraised value 
due to softening of the commercial real estate market in the early s  however  current loan to value ratios may effectively be in excess of 
prior to the restrictions noted above  the bank offered commercial construction loans to developers 
these loans were made as construction permanent loans  which provided for disbursement of loan funds during construction and automatic conversion to permanent loans upon completion of construction 
such construction loans were made on a short term basis  usually not exceeding two years  with interest rates indexed to the wsfs prime rate and adjusted periodically as the bank s prime rate changed 
the loan appraisal process includes the same criteria as required for permanent mortgage loans as well as completed plans  specifications  comparables and cost estimates 
these items are used  prior to approval of the credit  as a basis to determine the appraised value of the subject property when completed 
policy requires that all appraisals are to be reviewed independent of the commercial lending area 
generally  the loan to value ratio for construction loans does not exceed 
the initial interest rate on the permanent portion of the financing is determined based upon the prevailing market rate at the time of conversion to the permanent loan 
at december   million was committed for construction loans  of which million had been disbursed 
the bank s commercial lending  excluding real estate loans  includes loans for the purpose of financing equipment acquisitions  expansion  working capital and other business purposes 
these loans generally range in amounts up to approximately million  and their terms range from less than one year to ten years 
the loans generally carry variable interest rates indexed to the bank s prime rate at the time of closing 
the bank intends to continue originating commercial loans to small businesses in its primary market area 
commercial  commercial mortgages and construction lending entails significant risk as compared with residential mortgage lending 
these loans typically involve larger loan balances concentrated in single borrowers or groups of related borrowers 
in addition  the payment experience on loans secured by income producing properties is typically dependent on the successful operation of the related real estate project and thus may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the commercial real estate market or in the economy generally 
the majority of the bank s commercial and commercial real estate loans are concentrated in delaware and surrounding areas 
construction loans involve risks attributable to the fact that loan funds are advanced upon the security of the project under construction  which  due to various factors  is of uncertain value prior to the completion of construction 
moreover  because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs  delays arising from labor problems  material shortages and other unpredictable contingencies  it is relatively difficult to accurately estimate the total loan funds required to complete a project and or determine the related loan to value ratios 
federal law limits the extensions of credit to any one borrower to of unimpaired capital  or  if the additional incremental is secured by readily marketable collateral having a market value that can be determined by reliable and continually available pricing 
one large extension of credit by the bank is limited by this of capital restriction 
extensions of credit include outstanding loans as well as contractual commitments to advance funds  such as standby letters of credit  but do not include unfunded loan commitments 
at december   no borrower had collective outstandings exceeding the above limits  however  an existing loan that exceed these limits does not have to be terminated or divested since the legality of a loan is determined when it is made and is not affected by subsequent legislative events 
consumer lending 
consumer loans not including certain consumer loans such as home equity lines of credit and other residential real estate secured loans may be made in an amount up to of the bank s assets 
the company intends to emphasize consumer lending in the future as a means of enhancing portfolio yields and capitalizing on existing customer relationships 
the table below sets forth consumer loans by type and lease financings outstanding  in dollar amounts and percentages  at the dates indicated 
december  dollars in thousands amount percent amount percent equity secured installment loans   home equity lines of credit   automobile   unsecured lines of credit   other   lease financings   total consumer loans and lease financings   december  dollars in thousands amount percent amount percent amount percent equity secured installment loans    home equity lines of credit    automobile    unsecured lines of credit    other    lease financings    total consumer loans and lease financings    the primary consumer loan products of the company are equity secured installment loans and home equity lines of credit 
with a home equity line of credit the borrower is granted a line of credit up to of the appraised value net of any senior mortgages of the residence 
this line of credit is secured by a mortgage on the borrower s property and can be drawn upon at any time 
at december   the bank had extended a total of million in home equity lines of credit  of which million had been drawn at that date 
home equity lines of credit offer federal income tax advantages in certain circumstances  the interest paid on a home equity loan remains deductible and the convenience of their checkbook access and revolving credit features 
over the past few years  however  home equity lines of credit have decreased as low interest rates offered on mortgage loans have enabled consumers to refinance their mortgages and consolidate debt 
although home equity lines of credit expose the company to the risk that falling collateral values may leave it inadequately secured  the company has not had any adverse experience to date 
beginning in  the focus of wsfs credit corporation wcc  formerly star states leasing corporation  has been to originate finance type leases 
these leases are secured by motor vehicles and originated through automobile dealerships 
during  wcc originated more than  leases which approximated million in new assets 
such leases have been a growing component of the consumer loan portfolio 
loan originations  purchase and sales 
wsfs has traditionally engaged in lending activities primarily in delaware and contiguous areas of neighboring states although  as a federal savings bank  the bank may originate  purchase and sell loans throughout the united states 
wsfs has also purchased limited amounts of loans from outside its normal lending area when such purchases are deemed appropriate and consistent with the bank s overall policies 
the bank originates fixed and adjustable rate residential real estate loans through banking offices 
in addition  wsfs has established relationships with correspondent banks  mortgage brokers and real estate developers for loan referrals 
during  wsfs originated million of residential real estate loans compared to originations of million 
from time to time  the bank has purchased whole loans and loan participations in accordance with its ongoing asset and liability management objectives 
purchases of residential real estate loans from correspondents and brokers primarily in the northeast region of the united states totalled million and million while residential real estate loan sales totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
while the bank generally intends to hold loans for the foreseeable future  wsfs  beginning in  has undertaken to sell newly originated fixed rate mortgage loans in the secondary market to control the interest sensitivity of its balance sheet 
during the second half of the corporation began to hold for investment certain of its fixed rate mortgage loans  with terms under years  originated in accordance with current asset liability management strategies 
the bank serviced for others approximately million of residential loans at december  compared to million at december  the company also services residential loans for its portfolio totalling million and million at december  and the bank originates commercial real estate and commercial loans through the bank s commercial lending department 
commercial loans are made for the purpose of financing equipment acquisitions  expansion  working capital and other business purposes and also include business loans secured by nonresidential real estate 
during  the bank originated million of commercial and commercial real estate loans compared to million in these amounts represent gross contract amounts and do not reflect amounts outstanding on such loans 
also during  the bank purchased a million portfolio of discounted commercial loans and commercial mortgages 
the bank s consumer lending is conducted primarily through the branch offices and is supported by a consumer credit department credit investigation unit 
wsfs originates a variety of consumer credit products  including home improvement loans  home equity lines of credit  automobile loans  unsecured lines of credit and other secured and unsecured personal installment loans 
during  such consumer loan originations aggregated million compared to million in see consumer lending for discussion regarding consumer loan originations 
all loans to one borrower exceeding  in aggregate must be approved by a management loan committee 
minutes of the management loan committee meetings and individual loans exceeding million approved by the management loan committee are subsequently reviewed by the executive committee and board of directors of wsfs  with separate approval needed for all loans to any borrower who has direct or indirect outstanding commitments in excess of million or for any additional advances or extensions on loans previously classified by the bank s regulatory authorities or the bank s asset review department 
officers of the bank have authority to approve smaller loans in graduated amounts  depending upon their experience and management position 
fee income from lending activities 
the bank realizes interest and loan fee income from lending activities  including fees for originating loans and for servicing loans and loan participations sold 
the institutions also receive commitment fees for making commitments to originate construction  residential and commercial real estate loans 
additionally  each entity receives loan fees related to existing loans  which include prepayment charges  late charges and assumption fees 
the bank offers a range of loan commitments for which fees are charged depending on lengths of the commitment periods 
as part of the loan application  the borrower also pays the bank for out of pocket costs in reviewing the application  whether or not the loan is closed 
the interest rate charged on the mortgage loan is normally the prevailing rate at the time the loan application is approved 
loan fees that are considered adjustments of yield in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles are reflected in interest income and represented an immaterial amount of interest income during the three years ended december  loan fees other than those considered adjustments of yield are reported as loan fee income  a component of other income 
loan loss experience  problem assets and delinquencies the company s results of operations are negatively impacted by nonperforming assets  which include nonaccruing loans  nonperforming real estate investments and assets acquired through foreclosure 
nonaccruing loans are those on which the accrual of interest has ceased 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status immediately if  in the opinion of management  collection is doubtful  or when principal or interest is past due days or more and collateral is insufficient to cover principal and interest 
interest accrued  but not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  is reversed and charged against interest income 
in addition  the amortization of net deferred loan fees is suspended when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
subsequent cash receipts are applied either to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income  depending on management s assessment of ultimate collectibility of principal and interest 
the company endeavors to manage its loan portfolio to identify problem loans as promptly as possible and take actions immediately which will minimize losses 
to accomplish this  the bank s asset review department monitors the asset quality of the company s loan and investment in real estate portfolios and reports such information to the chief financial officer and the executive committee of the board of directors 
subsidiaries during the s  the company sought to expand its sources of noninterest income and its market area primarily through its investments in subsidiaries 
the company s policy was to exercise the bank s generally broad investment authority to invest in subsidiaries which were considered complementary to its traditional savings bank activities 
as a result of the bank s failure to comply with minimum regulatory capital requirements in  it became subject to restrictions on asset growth  lending and capital distributions  among other things 
consequently  the company consolidated and or divested of certain subsidiary operations  thereby restructuring its balance sheet and focusing on its core banking businesses

loans made by ccc are most often used by the borrower to consolidate debt  including an existing mortgage  or fund home improvements 
the type of borrower targeted by ccc has a credit history that may limit their access to credit  given the relatively rigid lending guidelines used by most financial institutions 
the first office of ccc was opened august in delaware

section i prohibits a depository institution from extending credit to or offering any other services  or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service  on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or certain of its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution  subject to certain exceptions  and ii prohibits extensions of credit to executive officers  directors  and greater than stockholders of a depository institution by any other institution which has a correspondent banking relationship with the institution  unless such extension of credit is on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and does not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features 
restrictions on acquisitions 
savings and loan holding companies are prohibited from acquiring  without prior approval of the director of ots  i control of any other savings association or savings and loan holding company or substantially all the assets thereof  or ii more than of the voting shares of a savings association or holding company thereof which is not a subsidiary 
under certain circumstances  a savings and loan holding company is permitted to acquire  with the approval of the director of ots  up to of the voting shares of an under capitalized savings association pursuant to a qualified stock issuance without that savings association being deemed controlled by the holding company 
except with the prior approval of the director of ots  no director or officer of a savings and loan holding company or person owning or controlling by proxy or otherwise more than of such company s stock  may also acquire control of any savings association  other than a subsidiary savings association  or of any other savings and loan holding company 
the director of ots may only approve acquisitions resulting in the formation of a multiple savings and loan holding company which controls savings associations in more than one state if i the multiple savings and loan holding company involved controls a savings institution which operated a home or branch office in the state of the association to be acquired as of march   ii the acquiror is authorized to acquire control of the savings association pursuant to the emergency acquisition provisions of the federal deposit insurance act  or iii the statutes of the state in which the association to be acquired is located specifically permit institutions to be acquired by state chartered associations or savings and loan holding companies located in the state where the acquiring entity is located or by a holding company that controls such state chartered savings institutions 
ots regulations permit federal associations to branch in any state or states of the united states and its territories 
except in supervisory cases or when interstate branching is otherwise permitted by state law or other statutory provision  a federal association may not establish an out of state branch unless i the federal association qualifies as a domestic building and loan association under ss 
a of the internal revenue code and the total assets attributable to all branches of the association in the state would qualify such branches taken as a whole for treatment as a domestic building and loan association and ii such branch would not result in the formation of a prohibited multi state multiple savings and loan holding company 
federal associations generally may not establish new branches unless the association meets or exceeds minimum regulatory capital requirements 
the ots will also consider the association s record of compliance with the community reinvestment act of in connection with any branch application 
the bank holding company act of has been amended to specifically authorize the federal reserve board to approve an application by a bank holding company to acquire control of any savings association 
pursuant to rules promulgated by the federal reserve board  owning  controlling or operating a savings association is a permissible activity for bank holding companies  if the savings association engages only in deposit taking activities and lending and other activities that are permissible for bank holding companies 
in approving such an application  the federal reserve board may not impose any restriction on transactions between the savings association and its holding company affiliates except as required by sections a and b of the federal reserve act 
a bank holding company that controls a savings association may merge or consolidate the assets and liabilities of the savings association with  or transfer assets and liabilities to  any subsidiary bank which is a bif member with the approval of the appropriate federal banking agency and the federal reserve board 
the resulting bank will be required to continue to pay assessments to the saif at the rates prescribed for saif members on the deposits attributable to the merged savings association plus an annual growth increment 
in addition  the transaction must comply with the restrictions on interstate acquisitions of commercial banks under the bank holding company act 
regulation of the bank general 
as a federally chartered savings institution  the bank is subject to extensive regulation by the ots 
the lending activities and other investments of the bank and the association must comply with various federal regulatory requirements 
the ots periodically examines the bank for compliance with regulatory requirements 
the fdic also has the authority to conduct special examinations of the bank as the insurer of deposits 
the bank must file reports with ots describing its activities and financial condition 
the bank is also subject to certain reserve requirements promulgated by the federal reserve board 
this supervision and regulation is intended primarily for the protection of depositors 
certain of these regulatory requirements are referred to below or appear elsewhere herein 
regulatory capital requirements 
under ots capital regulations  savings institutions must maintain tangible capital equal to of adjusted total assets  core capital equal to of adjusted total assets and total capital a combination of core and supplementary capital equal to of risk weighted assets 
in addition  the ots has recently adopted regulations which impose certain restrictions on savings associations that have a total risk based capital ratio that is less than  a ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets of less than or a ratio of tier capital to adjusted total assets of less than or if the institution is rated composite under the ots examination rating system 
for purposes of these regulations  tier capital has the same definition as core capital 
the ots capital rule defines core capital as common stockholders equity including retained earnings  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus  minority interests in the equity accounts of fully consolidated subsidiaries  certain nonwithdrawable accounts and pledged deposits and qualifying supervisory goodwill  less intangible assets other than certain qualifying supervisory goodwill and certain purchased mortgage servicing rights 
tangible capital is given the same definition as core capital but does not include qualifying supervisory goodwill and is reduced by the amount of all the savings institution s intangible assets except for certain purchased mortgage servicing rights 
the ots capital rule requires that core and tangible capital be reduced by an amount equal to a savings institution s debt and equity investments in subsidiaries engaged in activities not permissible to national banks  other than subsidiaries engaged in activities undertaken as agent for customers or in mortgage banking activities and subsidiary depository institutions or their holding companies nonincludable subsidiaries 
as of december   the bank had no investments in or extensions of credit to nonincludable subsidiaries 
adjusted total assets for purposes of the core and tangible capital requirements are a savings institution s total assets as determined under generally accepted accounting principles  increased by certain goodwill amounts and by a prorated portion of the assets of subsidiaries in which the savings institution holds a minority interest and which are not engaged in activities for which the capital rules require the savings institution to net its debt and equity investments in such subsidiaries against capital 
adjusted total assets are reduced by the amount of assets that have been deducted from capital  the portion of savings institution s investments in subsidiaries that must be netted against capital under the capital rules and  for purposes of the core capital requirement  qualifying supervisory goodwill 
at december   the bank s adjusted total assets for purposes of both the core and tangible capital requirements were  million 
in determining compliance with the risk based capital requirement  a savings institution is allowed to include both core capital and supplementary capital in its total capital  provided the amount of supplementary capital included does not exceed the savings institution s core capital 
supplementary capital is defined to include certain preferred stock issues  nonwithdrawable accounts and pledged deposits that do not qualify as core capital  certain approved subordinated debt  certain other capital instruments and a portion of the savings institution s general loan and lease loss allowances 
the risk based capital requirement is measured against risk weighted assets  which equal the sum of each on balance sheet asset and the credit equivalent amount of each off balance sheet item after being multiplied by an assigned risk weight 
under the ots risk weighting system  cash and securities backed by the full faith and credit of the us government are given a risk weight 
mortgage backed securities that qualify under the secondary mortgage enhancement act  including those issued  or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest  by the fnma or fhlmc  are assigned a risk weight 
single family first mortgages not more than days past due with loan to value ratios under  multi family mortgages maximum dwelling units with loan to value ratios under and average annual occupancy rates over  and certain qualifying loans for the construction of one to four family residences pre sold to home purchasers are assigned a risk weight of 
consumer loans  non qualifying residential construction loans and commercial real estate loans  repossessed assets and assets more than days past due  as well as all other assets not specifically categorized  are assigned a risk weight of 
the portion of equity investments not deducted from core or supplementary capital is assigned a risk weight 
ots capital regulations require savings institutions to maintain minimum total capital  consisting of core capital plus supplemental capital  equal to of risk weighted assets 
the bank was in compliance with all such standards as of december  the ots has recently adopted an amendment to its risk based capital requirements that will require savings institutions with more than a normal level of interest rate risk to maintain additional total capital 
a savings institution s interest rate risk will be measured in terms of the sensitivity of its net portfolio value to changes in interest rates 
the ots notified the bank in that this proposal has been delayed indefinitely 
the bank has determined that  on the basis of current financial data  it would not be deemed to have more than normal level of interest rate risk under the proposed rule and believes that it will not be required to increase its total capital as a result of the rule 
dividend restrictions 
ots regulations impose additional limitations on the payment of dividends and other capital distributions including stock repurchases and cash mergers by the bank 
under these regulations  a savings institution that  immediately prior to  and on a pro forma basis after giving effect to  a proposed capital distribution  has total capital as defined by ots regulation that is equal to or greater than the amount of its fully phased in capital requirements a tier association is generally permitted  after notice  to make capital distributions during a calendar year in the amount equal to the greater of a of its net income for the previous four quarters  or b up to of its net income to date during the calendar year plus an amount that would reduce by one half the amount by which its ratio of total capital to assets exceeded its fully phased in risk based capital ratio requirement at the beginning of the calendar year 
a savings institution with total capital in excess of current minimum capital ratio requirements but not in excess of the fully phased in requirements a tier association is permitted  after notice  to make capital distributions without ots approval of up to of its net income for the previous four quarters  less dividends already paid for such period 
a savings institution that fails to meet current minimum capital requirements a tier association is prohibited from making any capital distributions without the prior approval of the ots 
a tier association that has been notified by the ots that it is in need of more than normal supervision will be treated as either a tier or tier association 
at december   the bank and the association were tier associations 
despite the above authority  the ots may prohibit any savings institution from making a capital distribution that would otherwise be permitted by the regulation  if the ots determines that the distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice 
in response to the company s request  by letter dated december   the regional director of the northeast region of the ots approved the payment of dividends by the bank in support of the company s obligations under the notes  so long as  with respect to each such dividend i the bank would not be undercapitalized under the prompt corrective action provisions of the fdi act and would meet its minimum regulatory capital requirements after payment of such dividend  ii dividends are limited to an amount which  when taken together with other capital distributions  does not exceed the lesser of net income earned in the most recent four fiscal quarters or net income earned to date during the calendar year plus the amount that would reduce by one half its surplus capital ratio at the beginning of the calendar year  iii continued progress is made by the bank in the disposition and reduction of classified assets  and iv at least thirty days prior notice and such other notices as may be required by law or regulation of the declaration of such dividend is provided to the ots 
this letter also notes that the approval contained therein does not constrain the ots in the future from taking any appropriate action  including  without limitation  restricting future dividend payments based upon safety and soundness concerns 
deposit insurance 
the bank is charged an annual premium by the bif for federal insurance on its respective insurable deposit accounts up to applicable regulatory limits 
the fdic may establish an assessment rate for deposit insurance premiums which protects the insurance fund and considers the fund s operating expenses  case resolution expenditures  income and effect of the assessment rate on the earnings and capital of members 
the fdic has established a risk based assessment system for insured depository institutions which became effective january  the assessment rate for an insured depository institution depends on the assessment risk classification assigned to the institution by the fdic which is determined by the institution s capital level and supervisory evaluations 
based on the data reported to regulators for the date closest to the last day of the seventh month preceding the semi annual assessment period using the same percentage criteria as in the prompt corrective action regulations 
see prompt corrective action 
institutions are assigned to one of three capital groups well capitalized  adequately capitalized or undercapitalized 
undercapitalized institutions consist of institutions that do not qualify as either well capitalized or adequately capitalized 
within each capital group  institutions will be assigned to one of three subgroups on the basis of supervisory evaluations by the institution s primary supervisory authority and such other information as the fdic determines to be relevant to the institution s financial condition and the risk posed to the deposit insurance fund 
subgroup a consists of financially sound institutions with only a few minor weaknesses 
subgroup b consists of institutions that demonstrate weaknesses which  if not corrected  could result in significant deterioration of the institution and increased risk of loss to the deposit insurance fund 
subgroup c consists of institutions that pose a substantial probability of loss to the deposit insurance fund unless effective corrective action is taken 
current law prohibits the bif and saif insurance premiums from being lowered until their respective reserve ratios equal 
furthermore  current law prohibits saif members from converting to bif membership  and vice versa  until the saif has achieved its designated reserve ratio of 
in  the fdic reduced insurance premiums for members of bif  resulting in members of the saif paying premiums that are substantially higher than those charged to members of bif 
the fdic stated that a premium differential might reduce earnings and impair the ability to raise funds in the capital markets for members of saif 
it cannot be determined when or how long such increased premiums would continue 
the effect of such a reduction should be favorable to wsfs because its deposits are insured by bif 
in  congress began discussing various proposals designed to alleviate the insurance premium disparity between bif and saif 
included in these proposals is a one time charge for saif deposits which would bring the saif reserve levels to the levels at bif 
the effect of this legislation  if any  has not been determined  however  since wsfs is bif insured it is not expected to result in any material affect on results of operations 
prompt corrective action 
federal banking regulators are required to take prompt corrective action if an institution fails to satisfy certain minimum capital requirements  including a leverage limit  a risk based capital requirement  and any other measure deemed appropriate by the federal banking regulators for measuring the capital adequacy of an insured depository institution 
all institutions  regardless of their capital levels  are restricted from making any capital distribution or paying any management fees that would cause the institution to become undercapitalized 
an institution that fails to meet the minimum level for any relevant capital measure an undercapitalized institution generally is i subject to increased monitoring by the appropriate federal banking regulator  ii required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan within days  iii subject to asset growth limits  and iv required to obtain prior regulatory approval for acquisitions  branching and new lines of businesses 
the ots adopted regulations  effective december   implementing the prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia 
under the regulations  the ots measures a savings institution s capital adequacy on the basis of its total risk based capital ratio the ratio of its total capital to risk weighted assets  tier risk based capital ratio the ratio of its core capital to risk weighted assets and leverage ratio the ratio of its core capital to adjusted total assets 
a savings institution that is not subject to an order or written directive to meet or maintain a specific capital level is deemed well capitalized if it also has i a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  ii a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater  and iii a leverage ratio of or greater 
an adequately capitalized savings institution is a savings institution that does not meet the definition of well capitalized and has i a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  ii a tier capital risk based ratio of or greater  and iii a leverage ratio of or greater or or greater if the savings institution has a composite camel rating 
an undercapitalized institution is a savings institution that has i a total risk based capital ratio less than  or ii a tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or iii a leverage ratio of less than or if the institution has a composite camel rating 
a significantly undercapitalized institution is defined as a savings institution that has i a total risk based capital ratio of less than  or ii a tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or iii a leverage ratio of less than 
a critically undercapitalized savings institution is defined as a savings institution that has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets of less than 
proposed standards for safety and soundness 
each federal banking agency is required to establish non capital safety and soundness standards for institutions under its authority 
the federal banking agencies  including the ots  have established standards covering internal controls  information systems and internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  asset growth and compensation  fees  and benefits  and have proposed standards for asset quality and earnings sufficiency 
an institution which fails to meet any of these standards  would be required to develop a plan acceptable to the agency  specifying the steps that the institution will take to meet the standards 
failure to submit or implement such a plan may subject the institution to regulatory sanctions 
federal home loan bank system 
the bank is a member of the fhlb system  which consists of district fhlbs subject to supervision and regulation by the federal housing finance board fhfb 
the fhlbs provide a central credit facility primarily for member institutions 
as a member of the fhlb of pittsburgh  the bank is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the fhlb of pittsburgh in an amount at least equal to of the aggregate unpaid principal of its home mortgage loans  home purchase contracts  and similar obligations at the beginning of each year  or of its advances borrowings from the fhlb of pittsburgh  whichever is greater 
wsfs was in compliance with this requirement with an investment in fhlb of pittsburgh stock at december   of million 
the fhlb of pittsburgh offers advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the fhfb and the board of directors of the fhlb of pittsburgh 
long term advances may only be made for the purpose of providing funds for residential housing finance 
at december   the bank had advances outstanding from the fhlb of million 
liquidity requirements 
the bank is required to maintain average daily balances of liquid assets cash  certain time deposits  bankers acceptances  highly rated corporate debt and commercial paper  securities of certain mutual funds  and specified united states government  state or federal agency obligations equal to the monthly average of not less than a specified percentage currently of its net withdrawable savings deposits plus short term borrowings 
the bank is also required to maintain average daily balances of short term liquid assets at a specified percentage currently of the total of its net withdrawable savings accounts and borrowings payable in one year or less 
monetary penalties may be imposed for failure to meet liquidity requirements 
the bank was in compliance with applicable liquidity requirements at december  federal reserve system 
pursuant to regulations of the federal reserve board  a savings institution must maintain average daily reserves equal to on the first million of transaction accounts  plus on the remainder 
this percentage is subject to adjustment by the federal reserve board 
because required reserves must be maintained in the form of vault cash or in a non interest bearing account at a federal reserve bank  the effect of the reserve requirement is to reduce the amount of the institution s interest earning assets 
as of december   the bank met its reserve requirements 
taxation federal income taxation the company and its subsidiaries  as an affiliated group  file a consolidated corporate income tax return each year for federal income tax purposes 
among other things  a consolidated return allows the affiliated group to avoid or defer tax on certain intercompany distributions and transfers and  under certain circumstances  to reduce the taxable income of one member of the group using the loss generated by another member 
thrift institutions such as the bank are generally subject to the provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  in the same general manner as other corporations 
further  thrift institutions which satisfy certain conditions  including the asset composition test under section a of the code  may determine their bad debt deduction based upon an annual addition to a bad debt reserve the reserve method rather than upon the actual amount of worthless debts arising during the year the specific charge off method 
the bank maintained a bad debt reserve for tax purposes through but failed to satisfy the asset composition test in fiscal year and therefore could not continue to use the thrift bad debt reserve method 
moreover  because the bank at the time had total assets in excess of million  it could not use the reserve method available to commercial banks but instead was required to switch to the specific charge off method 
as a result of the change to the specific charge off method  the bank recaptured into income in the entire balance of its bad debt reserve 
for taxable years beginning after december   the code imposes an alternative minimum tax at a rate of 
the alternative minimum tax generally applies to a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences alternative minimum taxable income or amti and is payable to the extent such amti is in excess of an exemption amount 
the code provides that an item of tax preference is the excess of the bad debt deduction allowable for a taxable year pursuant to the percentage of taxable income method over the amount allowable under the experience method 
the other items of tax preference that constitute amti include a tax exempt interest on newly issued generally  issued on or after august  private activity bonds other than certain qualified bonds and b for taxable years beginning after  of the excess if any of i of adjusted current earnings as defined in the code  over ii amti determined without regard to this preference and prior to reduction by net operating losses 
net operating losses can offset no more than of amti 
certain payments of alternative minimum taxes may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years 
in addition  for taxable years after and before  corporations  including thrift institutions  are also subject to an environmental tax equal to of the excess of amti for the taxable year determined without regard to net operating losses and the deduction for the environmental tax over million 
as of december   the company had available net operating loss nol carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  which may be used to reduce future income taxes 
there are restrictions applicable to approximately million of the nol carryforwards attributable to providential home income plan  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of wsfs which may only be used to offset future taxable income generated on a separate return limitation year srly basis 
these srly losses are additionally limited to two separate changes in control of providential 
because the restrictions imposed under section of the code restrict the annual amount of nol carryforwards available for use  it could result in the loss of a substantial portion of providential s nol due to expiration

substantially  all of the corporation s assets are held by its subsidiary  wilmington savings fund society  fsb the bank or wsfs  the largest thrift institution headquartered in delaware and among the five largest financial institutions in the state on the basis of total deposits 
the corporation s market area is the mid atlantic region of the united states which is characterized by a diversified manufacturing and service economy 
the banking operations of wsfs are presently conducted from retail banking offices located in the wilmington and dover  delaware area 
the bank provides residential real estate  commercial real estate  commercial and consumer lending services and funds these activities primarily by attracting retail deposits and borrowings 
deposits are insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation 
additional subsidiaries of the bank include wsfs credit corporation wcc  which is engaged primarily in motor vehicle leasing  and investment group  inc formerly star states financial services  inc 
which markets various insurance products and mutual funds through the bank s branch system 
in june  the bank formed a consumer finance subsidiary  community credit corporation ccc which opened its first office in august ccc specializes in consumer loans secured by first and second mortgages 
in november  the bank acquired providential home income plan  inc providential  a san francisco  california based reverse mortgage lender 
an additional subsidiary  star states development company  is currently phasing down its real estate investments and developments 
the long term goal of the corporation is to be a high performing financial services company focused on its core savings bank business while developing unique niches in retail asset generation 
beginning in  the corporation focused its efforts on developing new businesses and avenues for asset growth which are expected to yield returns in the future 
toward that end  the corporation opened the consumer finance subsidiary  ccc  and acquired providential 
these retail investments  combined with the growth in the investment portfolios  have favorably impacted net interest income and earnings since and are expected to provide favorable returns on investments in the coming years 
such investments for the future were possible since the bank became well capitalized in the second quarter of this was largely due to continued operating earnings and the corporation s capital infusion of million of the proceeds of a million debt offering which was completed in december in the third quarter of  the bank recognized a gain of million  net of taxes and a supplemental contribution to the corporation s k plan  from the sale of deposits and certain real estate of four branches of its former bank subsidiary  fidelity federal savings and loan association the association  located in the northeast section of philadelphia  pennsylvania 
this transaction has allowed the corporation to focus on its primary market area while enhancing capital 
during the s  the corporation had pursued a business strategy of growth and diversification by engaging in such activities as real estate brokerage  vehicle and equipment leasing and real estate development 
this prior strategy combined with a recession in the us economy resulted in significant operating and asset quality problems 
these problems culminated in a record net operating loss of million in from through  the corporation had focused on restructuring its operations to achieve compliance with regulatory capital requirements while reducing nonperforming assets 
these efforts resulted in the bank achieving full regulatory capital compliance by completing the previously discussed debt offering as well as twelve consecutive quarters of earnings 
during  earnings continued to improve as the corporation recorded record earnings from operations of million 
during  the corporation has reported higher earnings and continued reductions in nonperforming assets 
these operating improvements are the result of earnings and operational strategies the corporation has undertaken over the last several years 
for these reasons  as well as the significant changes and ongoing consolidation in the financial services industry  the corporation s board of directors selected a financial advisor to assist the board in considering strategic alternatives  including a possible sale of the corporation 
on march   the board of directors announced its intention to operate the corporation as an independent financial institution 
the following discussion focuses on the major components of operations and presents an overview of the significant changes in the corporation s results of operations for the past three fiscal years and financial condition during the past two fiscal years 
this discussion should be reviewed in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented elsewhere in this annual report 
results of operations the corporation recorded earnings of million in of which million was from operations 
both amounts represent new record earning levels in the corporation s year history 
earnings for and were million and million  respectively 
the growth in net interest income during the three years ended december  was a significant factor contributing to the corporation s improved earnings performance 
earnings for were also significantly impacted by the sale of the association s deposits in the third quarter of which resulted in a gain of million after taxes and a supplemental contribution to the corporation s k plan 
in addition  reductions in nonperforming assets have favorably impacted earnings since net interest income 
net interest income is the most significant component of operating income to the corporation 
net interest income is reliant upon the levels of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the difference or spread between the respective yields earned and rates paid 
the interest rate spread is influenced by regulatory  economic and competitive factors that affect interest rates  loan demand and deposit outflows 
the level of nonperforming loans can also impact the interest rate spread by reducing the yield on the loan portfolio 
net interest income increased to million in compared with million and million in and  respectively 
during these three years  the growth in interest earning assets outpaced interest bearing liabilities and contributed to the rise in net interest income 
the implementation of an investment growth strategy in  the acquisition of a million portfolio of discounted commercial loans and commercial mortgages in july and the reduction in nonperforming assets  also contributed to the growth in net interest income 
net interest income can be analyzed in terms of the impact of changing rates and changing volumes of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding changes in net interest income attributable to changes in the volumes of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and changes in the rates for the periods indicated 
for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  information is provided on changes attributable to i changes in volume change in volume multiplied by prior year rate  ii changes in rates change in rate multiplied by prior year volume  and iii net change 
changes due to the combination of rate and volume changes changes in volume multiplied by changes in rate are allocated proportionately between changes in rate and changes in volume

the changes in volume and rate reflect the various events and transactions which have occurred between periods 
the increase in net interest income of million between and was primarily attributable to changes in rate of million offset in part by changes in volume of million

interest income and expense increased million and million  respectively  between and in general  the interest rate environment between periods  growth in interest earning assets and the continued reduction in the level of nonperforming assets were key factors contributing favorably to net interest income 
the increase in net interest income year over year was also attributable to the full year impact of the investment growth strategy which was implemented in phases throughout the first three quarters of in addition  the bank s acquisition of a million portfolio of discounted commercial loans and commercial mortgages in july contributed favorably to net interest income 
the weighted average yield on this acquired portfolio is approximately 
the above favorable items were partially offset by the association s deposit sale and an adjustment to the yield on the corporation s investment in reverse mortgages which occurred in the third quarter of the unfavorable impact of the deposit sale was the result of the higher level of liquidity maintained prior to the consummation of the transaction 
in addition  net interest income was unfavorably impacted as lower costing retail deposits were replaced with higher rate borrowings 
a million reduction in interest income on the corporation s investment in reverse mortgages was the result of reductions in the yield reflecting changes in the underlying assumptions regarding current and future real estate values 
between and  interest income and expense increased million and million  respectively 
these increases were due in part to the implementation of the investment growth strategy during and the issuance of the senior notes in december prevailing economic conditions greatly influence net interest income and the levels of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
management anticipates a moderate decline in interest rates in the early part of as economic growth stabilizes 
the projected interest rate environment in conjunction with current asset liability management strategies are anticipated to favorably impact net interest income 
provision for loan losses 
the corporation considers  among other things  identifiable and inherent risks in its loan portfolio in periodically establishing the amount of the provision for loan losses  and the amount of the allowance for loan losses 
such risks are determined based upon an ongoing review of the loan portfolio  which includes the identification and assessment of adverse situations that may affect borrowers debt servicing ability  an analysis of overall portfolio quality and prior loan loss experience as well as an appraisal of current and expected economic trends and conditions 
accordingly  the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level which management deems adequate to provide for potential losses 
the provision for loan losses decreased from million in to million in the million provision in was due to the effects of certain nonaccruing loans including the addition of one nonperforming asset totalling million 
the corporation s continued efforts to resolve and collect problem loans  including nonaccrual and restructured loans  during resulted in the lowest level of nonaccruing loans since the allowance for loan losses was million at december   an increase from the level reported at december  the loan loss allowance as a percentage of total loans remained level at versus in and  respectively 
during the third quarter of  a million allowance was established on a commercial commercial real estate portfolio purchased at discounted prices 
during  the corporation will continue to adjust the provision for loan losses periodically as necessary to maintain the allowance for loan losses at what is deemed to be an adequate level  based on the previously discussed criteria 
as the provision is primarily a function of credit quality  changes in the provision for loan losses are contingent upon the economic conditions of the corporation s market area and the economic prospects of borrowers 
other income 
other income grew million during to million 
this significant increase resulted predominantly from a pretax gain of million on the sale of the association s deposits during the third quarter of other income for was also favorably impacted by growth in loan servicing fees and services charges on deposits which increased  and  respectively 
other income declined  between and to million 
the most significant factor contributing to this decline was gains on the sales of mortgage loans which were  lower in this decline was attributable to the slowdown of loan originations in as compared to when a strong refinance market existed 
conversely  an increase in leasing activity during contributed to a rise in loan servicing fees of  other expenses 
other expenses increased million during to million 
significant increases occurred in salaries  employee benefits and the net costs of assets acquired through foreclosure 
these increases were partially offset by reductions in the deposit insurance premium  equipment and marketing expenses as well as professional fees 
salaries increased million during the rise in salaries is primarily attributable to an increase of million in incentive related compensation 
included in such compensation were higher expenses associated with stock appreciation rights  resulting from the significant rise in the corporation s stock price during employee benefits  which increased million during  included a supplemental contribution of  to the employee k plan related to the sale of the association s deposits 
during  salary levels were million higher than this increase was due to higher staffing levels and an incentive plan which was implemented in staffing increases in resulted from the corporation s investments in new businesses such as ccc and providential 
the increase of  in employee benefits during corresponds to the rise in salaries 
salaries and benefits are expected to remain somewhat level in equipment expenses decreased  in and  in the decrease between and reflect computer conversion costs which were fully amortized by the end of equipment expenses are expected to remain level through marketing expenses decreased  between and these cost reductions reflect savings from the association s deposit sale as well as management efforts to control costs 
the increase in marketing expenses between and were attributable to management s efforts to promote its retail banking operations 
marketing expenses are expected to decline in professional fees were reduced  during and  in these decreases are primarily the result of a steady reduction in nonperforming assets over the past several years 
as the level of professional fees are partially reliant upon the level of problem assets  future changes in these expenses are dependent upon the level of such assets 
federal deposit insurance premiums decreased million in and  in the decrease in reflects an approximately reduction in such premiums assessed by the fdic 
the decrease in reflects lower deposit levels between and since the bank is currently considered well capitalized by the ots  fdic premiums are expected to be nominal in the net costs of foreclosed assets increased  between and this increase was due entirely to the increase in the provision for losses on foreclosed assets which increased  in conversely  the provision for losses on foreclosed assets  which declined million between and was the primary factor contributing to the million reduction in the net costs of foreclosed assets during due to the reduction of nonperforming assets in  related expenses are expected to decline in income taxes 
the corporation recorded a million tax benefit for the year ended december  compared to tax benefits of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the provision benefit for income taxes includes federal  state and local income taxes currently payable and those deferred because of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the corporation analyzes its projections of taxable income on an ongoing basis and makes adjustments to its provision benefit for income taxes accordingly 
management expects that it will be fully taxable in as a result of fully utilizing its operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in fiscal year for additional information regarding the corporation s tax provision and net operating loss carryforwards see note to the consolidated financial statements 
financial condition consolidated assets grew million  or  during the year 
asset growth was primarily in commercial mortgage loans and was offset in part by reductions in investments and mortgage backed securities 
total liabilities decreased million during this decrease occurred primarily in deposits almost entirely offset by advances from the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh 
stockholders equity grew million to million at december mortgage backed securities 
during  mortgage backed securities decreased by million 
this decrease was due to principal repayments 
no purchase transactions occurred during the year 
investments 
federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell increased million and interest bearing deposits in other banks decreased million 
investment securities decreased million primarily as a result of the net sales of million of us government securities  the call of a million fhlb step up note and the maturities and calls on municipal and corporate bonds of  and million  respectively 
loans 
net loans grew million to million at december  this increase is primarily due to the acquisition of a million portfolio of discounted commercial loans and commercial mortgages 
growth of million in consumer loans  million in residential mortgages and million in leases also contributed to this increase 
deposits 
deposits decreased million during this decrease is largely attributable to the july sale of the association s million in deposits 
offsetting this decrease was the addition of million in brokered certificates of deposits and million in deposits from a branch acquisition in the first quarter of also  interest credited to deposits totalled million for a net increase in retail banking deposits of million 
the table below depicts the changes in net deposits over the last three years year ended december  in millions beginning balance interest credited deposits withdrawals  net deposits acquired sold  net ending balance borrowings 
total borrowings increased million during approximately million of fhlb advances were added to fund the sale of the association s deposits as discussed previously 
stockholders equity 
during  stockholders equity increased million to million 
included in this increase was net income of million and a million reduction in net unrealized losses on securities available for sale  net of tax 
at december   the bank was in compliance with all regulatory capital requirements and met the regulatory classification of a well capitalized institution 
tangible  core  tier risk based and risk based capital to assets ratios were   and  respectively 
asset liability management 
the primary asset liability management goal of the corporation is to manage and control its interest rate risk  thereby reducing its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  and achieving sustainable growth in the interest margins over the long term 
other objectives of asset liability management include ensuring adequate liquidity and funding  maintaining a strong capital base and maximizing net interest income opportunities 
in general  interest rate risk is mitigated by closely matching the maturities or repricing periods of interest sensitive assets and liabilities to ensure a favorable interest rate spread 
management regularly reviews the corporation s interest rate sensitivity  and uses a variety of strategies as needed to adjust that sensitivity within acceptable tolerance ranges established by management 
changing the relative proportions of fixed rate and adjustable rate assets and liabilities is one of the primary strategies utilized by the corporation to accomplish this objective 
the development of the corporation s portfolio of adjustable rate consumer loans in its primary market area as well as the continued reduction of nonperforming assets have been two of the key tactics used in conjunction with this strategy since with the improvement in the ratio of interest sensitive assets which mature or reprice within one year to interest sensitive liabilities with similar maturities interest sensitivity gap since  the corporation began to hold for investment certain of its originated fixed rate mortgage loans with terms less than years 
all other fixed rate residential mortgage loans originated by the corporation continue to be sold 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest sensitivity gap 
an interest sensitivity gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
generally  during a period of rising interests rates  a positive gap would result in an increase in net interest income while a negative gap would adversely affect net interest income 
the repricing and maturities of the corporation s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  are set forth in the following table 
less than one to over one year five years five years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets real estate loans     commercial loans     consumer loans     mortgage backed securities     loans held for sale   investment in reverse mortgages     investment securities     other investments   interest bearing liabilities money market and interest bearing demand deposits    savings deposits    time deposits     fhlb advances     senior notes   other borrowed funds    excess deficiency of interest earning assets over interest bearing liabilities interest sensitive gap     interest sensitive assets interest sensitive liabilities interest sensitive gap as a percent of total assets includes commercial mortgage loans 
to provide a more accurate one year gap position of the corporation  certain deposit classifications are based on the interest sensitive attributes and not on the repricing characteristics of these deposits 
management estimates  based on historical trends of the bank s deposit accounts  that of money market and interest bearing demand deposits are sensitive to interest rate changes and that of savings deposits are sensitive to interest rate changes 
however  deposit products with interest rates based on a particular index are classified according to the specific repricing characteristic of the index 
accordingly  the interest sensitive portion is classified in the less than one year category with the remainder in the over five years category 
deposit rates other than time deposit rates are variable  and changes in deposit rates are generally subject to management s discretion and not related to any particular index 
the corporation s positive interest sensitivity gap indicates that rising interest rates could favorably impact net interest income and falling interest rates could negatively impact net interest income 
however  the interest sensitivity table does not provide a comprehensive representation of the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income 
each category of assets or liabilities will not be affected equally or simultaneously by changes in the general level of interest rates 
even assets and liabilities which contractually reprice within the same period may not  in fact  reprice at the same price or the same time 
it is also important to consider that the table represents a specific point in time 
variations can occur daily as the bank adjusts its interest sensitivity throughout the year 
nonperforming assets the corporation s results of operations have been negatively affected by nonperforming assets  which include nonaccruing loans  nonperforming real estate investments and assets acquired through foreclosure 
nonaccruing loans are those on which the accrual of interest has ceased 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status immediately if  in the opinion of management  collection is doubtful  or when principal or interest is past due days or more and the value of the collateral is insufficient to cover principal and interest 
interest accrued  but not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  is reversed and charged against interest income 
in addition  the amortization of net deferred loan fees is suspended when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
subsequent cash receipts are applied either to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income  depending on management s assessment of the ultimate collectibility of principal and interest 
the following table sets forth the corporation s nonperforming assets  restructured loans and past due loans at the dates indicated 
past due loans are loans contractually past due days or more as to principal or interest payments but which remain in accrual status because they are considered well secured and in the process of collection

the applicable allowance represents general valuation allowances only 
total nonperforming assets decreased by million between and and by million between and in  collections of such assets were million and million in charge offs and write downs were recorded 
such decreases were offset by the addition of million of assets that were not previously classified as nonperforming assets 
the decrease in the levels of nonperforming assets since reflects management s efforts to identify and resolve problem assets and  to a lesser extent  an improving economy 
an analysis of the change in the balance of nonperforming assets during the last three fiscal years is presented below 
year ended december  in thousands beginning balance    additions    collections    transfers to accrual restructured status    charge offs write downs    ending balance    in  nonaccruing loan reductions of million and million in the commercial mortgage and residential mortgage categories  respectively  a million decrease in nonperforming investments in real estate and a million decrease in assets acquired through foreclosure comprised the majority of the reduction in total nonperforming assets 
during the first quarter  a million nonaccruing commercial mortgage loan was returned to accrual status and a million nonaccruing commercial mortgage loan was transferred to assets acquired through foreclosure after a  partial charge off was recorded to the allowance for loan losses 
this property was subsequently sold during the third quarter of the decrease in residential mortgages was the result of million of loans returning to accrual status and the transfer of other loans to assets acquired through foreclosure 
as of december  the corporation has significantly reduced the level of assets acquired through foreclosure through sales and collections of properties which totalled million  offset in part by additions of million 
the reduction in the nonaccruing loans to total loans ratio was due to the reductions noted above as well as charge offs and collection activity 
consequently  the nonperforming assets to total assets ratio also decreased significantly 
a million reduction in nonaccruing loans was the most notable factor contributing to the reduction in nonperforming assets between and this decrease was primarily due to the reclassification of several loans to assets acquired through foreclosure 
the most significant loan was a million commercial mortgage loan secured by a health care facility and unimproved land located in delaware which was transferred after a million charge off to the allowance for loan losses 
other nonaccruing commercial loan activity for the year ended december  includes three loans totalling million which were transferred to assets acquired through foreclosure 
one property for million was sold subsequent to its transfer 
in addition  a million nonaccruing construction loan was reclassified as accruing in august assets acquired through foreclosure increased million between december  and this was primarily due to four properties transferred from nonaccruing commercial mortgage loans  which totalled million after charge offs 
a million commercial mortgage was also transferred from restructured loans in december in addition  the corporation foreclosed on a restaurant facility located in delaware during the first quarter of which resulted in an increase of million 
the sale of two foreclosed office buildings totalling approximately million were two of the more significant transactions offsetting the above increases 
sales of other commercial properties and to a lesser extent residential and consumer collection activity also offset these increases 
at december   nonperforming assets with carrying values of million or more totalled approximately of the corporation s total nonperforming assets  as compared to at december  the following table reflects the stratification of such assets by size at december  and december  no 
of items balance no 
of items balance dollars in thousands million and over   million million   million million  under    total nonperforming assets   the reductions in the million million and million million categories were due exclusively to the million commercial mortgage returned to accrual status and sale of foreclosed assets previously discussed 
the timely identification of problem loans is a key element in the corporation s management of its loan portfolios 
timely identification enables the corporation to take appropriate action and  accordingly  minimize losses 
a loan review system  which was established to monitor the asset quality of the corporation s loans and investments in real estate portfolios  facilitates the identification of problem loans 
in general  this system utilizes the guidelines established by federal regulation  however  there can be no assurance that the levels or the categories of problem loans and assets established by the bank are the same as those which would result from a regulatory examination 
allowance for loan losses 
the corporation maintains an allowance for loan losses and charges losses on loans to this allowance when such losses are considered probable 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level which management considers adequate to provide for potential loan losses based upon an evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
management s evaluation is based upon a continuing review of the loan portfolio which includes factors such as identification of adverse situations which may affect the borrower s ability to repay  a review of overall portfolio quality  prior loan loss experience and an assessment of current and expected economic conditions 
changes in economic conditions and economic prospects of borrowers can occur quickly and  as a result  impact the estimates made by management 
additionally  management evaluates the collectibility of each loan in the nonperforming portfolio and the fair value of each asset in the assets acquired through foreclosure category quarterly 
the most frequent form of collateral for loans and foreclosed assets regardless of type are income producing properties  business owned real estate and personal residences 
the value of such collateral is frequently verified through the use of outside appraisals 
appraisals of collateral  together with the value of guarantees and the worth of other collateral  are combined to recognize current loan losses  write downs of foreclosed assets  and to reserve for potential future losses

the provision for loan losses decreased  between and the reduction is due in part to the decrease in nonperforming loans and management s continuing review of the loan portfolio 
during the third quarter of  a million allowance was established on a commercial loan and commercial real estate portfolio purchased at discounted prices 
the ratio of net charge offs to average gross loans outstanding net of unearned income was 
and 
for the years ending december  and  respectively 
this decrease reflects the reduction in net charge offs between the periods 
charge offs in and were due to the deterioration in the credit quality of certain commercial and commercial real estate loans 
during  the most significant charge off in the commercial real estate category was a million partial charge off of a nonaccruing commercial mortgage loan which was subsequently transferred to assets acquired through foreclosure 
the high levels of charge offs in were due to a variety of factors including the deterioration of the regional commercial real estate market and recessionary conditions 
the provision for loan losses during was increased primarily due to a million commercial real estate loan being placed on nonaccrual in the first quarter of when the borrower filed bankruptcy 
the decline in charge offs during versus is in large part attributable to reduced charge offs of commercial real estate loans including construction loans 
the consumer loan charge offs is the result of a charge off of a consumer loan portfolio that was subsequently sold 
the allowance for loan losses is allocated by major loan portfolio type 
as these portfolios have developed  they have become a source of historical data in projecting delinquencies and loss exposure

liquidity the corporation itself engages only in limited business operations independent of the bank and its subsidiaries and therefore  does not require a substantial amount of liquid assets 
the corporation is required  however  to maintain a reserve at december  of of the aggregate interest expense for full calendar months on million of the senior notes issued in december the corporation s principal asset is its investment in the capital stock of the bank and its primary source of liquidity is dividends from the bank 
under applicable federal regulations  the bank may pay dividends within certain limits and only after notice to the office of thrift supervision ots 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of dividend restrictions 
under the indenture for the senior notes  the corporation was required to maintain a reserve at december  of of the aggregate interest expense for full calendar months on million of the senior notes  issued in december at december   the corporation retained approximately million for the purpose of meeting this reserve requirement 
the corporation s ability to comply with this requirement is dependent upon its ability to obtain dividends from the bank 
as required by the ots  institutions under its supervision must maintain a minimum liquidity ratio of cash and qualified assets to net withdrawable deposits and borrowings due within one year 
the liquidity ratios of the bank were and at december  and  respectively 
management monitors liquidity daily and maintains funding sources to meet unforeseen changes in cash requirements 
it is the policy of the bank to maintain cash and investments slightly above required levels 
the corporation s primary financing sources are deposits  repayments of loans and investment securities  sales of loans and borrowings 
in addition  the corporation s liquidity requirements can be accomplished through the use of its borrowing capacity from the fhlb of pittsburgh  the sale of certain securities under agreement to repurchase and the pledging of certain loans for other lines of credit 
management believes these sources are sufficient to maintain the required levels of liquidity 
at december  and  the bank had outstanding fhlb advances of and million  respectively 
additionally in december  the bank secured a million fhlb revolving line of credit of which none was outstanding at december  other available funding sources included open ended secured lines of credit with three different brokerage firms and a million revolving line of credit with two lending institutions 
no balances were outstanding on any of these credit facilities at december  the corporation routinely enters into commitments requiring the future outlay of funds 
the bank entered into an agreement in  which was amended in and extended until december   whereby a facilities management company provides on site data processing services 
under the terms of this agreement  average minimum payments of approximately million have been committed for each of the next two years 
the above commitments  as well as loan commitments  are expected to be met through traditional funding sources  such as deposits  short term borrowings  advances from the fhlb and principal repayments on loans 
during  operating and financing activities provided cash and cash equivalents of and million  respectively  while investing activities used million 
the cash provided by financing activities resulted primarily from additional borrowings from the fhlb and the net increase in certificates of deposit and time deposits 
this cash was used to fund the sale of deposits as well as the repayment of other borrowings 
cash used for investment activities included a net increase in loans  offset in part by a net decrease in investment securities 
in  financing and operating activities provided and million of cash and cash equivalents  respectively  while investing activities used million 
the funds provided by financing activities reflect the additional fhlb advances and reverse repurchase agreements resulting from the investment growth strategy implemented during these funds  supplemented with existing liquidity  were utilized to purchase mortgage backed securities and were the major component of the cash and cash equivalents used for investment activities 
during  the primary source of cash and cash equivalents was investment activities 
the funds provided by investment activities resulted primarily from the net reduction in the loan portfolio and maturities  sales and dispositions of investment securities 
these cash flows were primarily used to fund deposit outflows and to a lesser extent repay borrowings 
the corporation derived million from investing activities in  while financing activities resulted in a use of cash of million 
capital resources federal laws among other things  requires ots to mandate uniformly applicable capital standards for all savings institutions 
these standards currently require institutions such as the bank to maintain a tangible capital ratio equal to of adjusted total assets  core or leverage capital equal to of adjusted total assets  tier capital equal to of risk weighted assets and risk based capital a combination of core and supplementary capital equal to of risk weighted assets 
regulations have been issued by the ots which incorporate an interest rate risk irr component into the risk based capital calculation 
implementation of this regulation  however  has been postponed until further notice 
the irr component is based on the lowest calculated interest rate capital component for the preceding three quarters 
the institution s actual measured irr is expressed as the change that occurs in its net portfolio value as a result of a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in interest rates  subject to an established floor 
an institution will be required to maintain one half of the difference between its measured irr and  multiplied by the present value of its assets 
based on the current composition of the bank s portfolio at december   management believes no additional capital would be required 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia  as well as other requirements  established five capital tiers well capitalized  adequately capitalized  under capitalized  significantly under capitalized and critically under capitalized 
a depository institution s capital tier depends upon its capital levels in relation to various relevant capital measures  which include leverage and risk based capital measures and certain other factors 
depository institutions that are not classified as well capitalized are subject to various restrictions regarding capital distributions  payment of management fees  acceptance of brokered deposits and other operating activities 
at december   the bank is classified as well capitalized and is in compliance with all regulatory capital requirements 
management anticipates that the bank will continue to be classified as well capitalized 
for additional information concerning the bank s regulatory capital compliance see note to the consolidated financial statements 
on march   the corporation s board of directors announced the authorization of a stock buyback program 
no shares had been purchased by the corporation prior to this date 
impact of inflation and changing prices the corporation s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration of the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased costs of the corporation s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all the assets and liabilities of the corporation are monetary 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the corporation s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services
