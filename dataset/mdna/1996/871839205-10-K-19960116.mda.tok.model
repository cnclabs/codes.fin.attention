quarterly results the following table contains selected unaudited consolidated financial results by quarter for and in management s opinion  this information reflects all adjustments which consisted only of normal recurring adjustments necessary to present the results fairly when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere herein 
fiscal fiscal quarter ended unaudited quarter ended unaudited january april july october january april july october in millions  except per share data revenues costs and expenses operating income non operating income expense  net income before income taxes and minority interest provision for income taxes income before minority interest minority interest net income earnings per share historically  the company s business  like many other companies in its industry  has experienced the highest revenues in the fourth quarter of each year and a subsequent revenue decline in the first quarter of the following year 
the company attributes the fourth quarter revenue peak to increased year end sales efforts and  in certain cases  to sales incentives  which come into effect late in the year 
the company expects these quarterly trends to continue  and that its operating results will peak in the fourth quarter of each year and decline from that level in the first quarter of the following year 
in addition  it is becoming increasingly difficult to predict and to rely on historical trends in the company s quarterly results given the effects of the demand for open systems products  the growing significance of major account sales  and the related uncertainty of the sales cycle 
the company operates with relatively little backlog and a substantial majority of its software license fee revenues in each quarter results from sales efforts culminated in that quarter 
as a result  if near term demand for the company s products weakens or if significant anticipated sales in any quarter do not close when expected  the company s revenues and earnings for that quarter would be adversely affected 
liquidity and capital resources the company s financial position remains strong 
cash and equivalents at the end of were million  down slightly from million at the end of due to increased working capital requirements to fund the company s growth and an increased level of business acquisitions and investments 
additionally  the company acquired several software products which were previously licensed 
net cash provided from operations was million in  million in  and million in net cash provided by operations in was exceeded by funds used for product development and enhancement  capital expenditures  acquisitions  payment of the company s annual dividend  and principal payments under long term obligations 
in june  the company increased its bank line of credit to million from million 
at october  and  no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit 
this added capacity is in line with the company s overall growth 
borrowings under this agreement would bear interest at either the prime rate or libor plus a margin  at the option of the company 
the company s business is not capital intensive 
the company primarily leases its premises 
in addition  the company has leasing facilities in place for certain computer equipment and automobiles 
capital expenditures relate primarily to smaller computers  leasehold improvements  office furniture and fixtures  and some automobiles 
currently  the company s commitments for capital expenditures are not significant 
management anticipates that cash generated from operations combined with current working capital and available credit lines will provide sufficient liquidity to meet ordinary capital requirements for the foreseeable future
