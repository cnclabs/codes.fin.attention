item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the steel industry is cyclical in nature 
the company s sales are primarily derived from products sold to the construction industry  which also has been cyclical and directly affected by  among other things  the level of consumer confidence and prevailing economic conditions 
substantially all of the company s revenues are comprised of rebar sales 
rebar is a commodity the price of which is determined by supply and demand 
supply  ie  rebar production capacity  is fairly constant 
demand is determined  in large part  by levels of activity in the construction industry 
the principal variable in production costs is the cost of scrap steel 
scrap is also a commodity the price of which is determined by supply and demand 
scrap supply is fairly constant and demand for scrap is influenced by the level of activity in the worldwide steel industry 
in conjunction with the modernization program  the company also negotiated a reduced long term electricity tariff with its electricity supplier and power rates are expected to remain fairly stable in the foreseeable future 
scrap steel is the principal raw material used in the company s products and accounted for approximately of the company s total cost of product sold in fiscal scrap demand  and therefore scrap prices  are affected by cyclical  seasonal and other market factors 
these fluctuations in scrap prices affect the company s revenues  costs and earnings 
the company began the modernization program in designed to increase its melt shop capacity and reduce operating costs 
the major elements of the modernization program include upgrading equipment  the installation of a new production technology known as the consteel process and a new continuous casting machine 
each of the elements of the modernization program have been completed with the exception of the installation of a new continuous casting machine  which is scheduled to be installed in the second quarter of fiscal management believes that the combination of the electric rate reductions and the installation of the consteel process will result in reduced power costs per ton of steel 
the manufacturer s specifications for the consteel process indicate a reduction in power consumption at production levels of tons per hour  the anticipated normal production level 
in addition  the manufacturer s specifications for the consteel process indicate a reduction in electrode usage 
the company also expects its maintenance costs  dust disposal costs  and other materials costs to be reduced 
management believes that the aggregate of these savings  assuming the consteel process performs up to expectations  should be approximately per ton of steel produced as compared to levels 
however  the company has not yet achieved consistent production levels of tons per hour using the consteel process 
production levels for fiscal averaged approximately tons per hour 
until such time as the company is able to realize production levels of around tons per hour  it will not fully achieve the cost savings anticipated from the installation of the consteel process  and may  depending on the actual production levels achieved  suffer an adverse impact on profitability 
the company is not aware of any material remediation contingencies associated with the real estate or industrial facilities owned and operated by it 
the sayreville mill operates pursuant to permits issued by various regulatory agencies  including the njdep 
should the respective regulatory agencies impose substantially more restrictive operating conditions on renewal of the permits  the company s operations could be substantially and adversely affected

cumulative effect of change in accounting for income taxes net earnings 
year ended november  compared to the year ended november  net sales for the fiscal year ended november   remained flat at  as compared to  for the fiscal year  reflecting a decline in shipment levels and a small increase in selling prices 
annual shipment levels for fiscal were  tons  as compared to  tons in fiscal while rebar prices remained flat year to year  overall pricing edged up slightly because of higher epoxy pricing and a higher mix of merchant bar 
rebar pricing remained strong during the first half of fiscal  but experienced a deep decline during the second half of the year 
this decline reflected aggressive price discounting by mills in response to high inventory levels at both mill and customer locations 
overall average selling prices rose to per ton in fiscal from per ton in fiscal gross profit margin decreased to in the fiscal year from in the decrease in gross profit margins in resulted from higher average scrap costs  higher other material costs and higher depreciation charges 
average scrap costs increased to per ton in fiscal from per ton in fiscal these negative factors were partially offset by the benefit of slightly higher selling prices in selling  general and administrative expense increased  to  in fiscal from  in this increase in was primarily the result of increased legal and consulting fees which were offset by decreases in other various expense categories 
total other income expense for the fiscal year decreased  to  of expense from  of income in fiscal this was primarily the result of an increase in interest expense of  and a decrease in rental income of  the company s equity in operations of investee contributed  to earnings for the fiscal year 
year ended november  compared to the year ended november  net sales for the fiscal year ended november  increased to  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended november  primarily as a result of higher rebar selling prices 
annual shipment levels for fiscal were  tons  consistent with fiscal shipment levels of  tons 
an increase in shipments to local domestic rebar markets  along with several rebar price increases in enabled the company to show a strong improvement in its average selling prices  which increased to per ton in fiscal from in fiscal gross profit margin increased to in the fiscal year from in this was primarily a result of a increase in average selling prices partially offset by average scrap costs increasing from per ton in fiscal to per ton in fiscal additionally  although the company showed continued improvement in its melt shop operations during the third and fourth quarters of  operating performance and costs in were negatively impacted while the melt shop continued to work through problems associated with the integration of new equipment and the implementation of the new consteel melting process 
as a result  operating costs were higher than selling  general and administrative expense decreased  in to  from  in this was primarily a result of a  charge to earnings in fiscal to reflect the write off of trade receivables relating to the bankruptcy of one of its customers  offset by increased professional fees related to the terminated merger agreement  increased bank fees related to the company s borrowings and increases in various sales department expenses 
total other income expense for the fiscal year  decreased  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this was primarily a result of a decrease in interest and rental income of  and  respectively from fiscal this decrease was partially offset by the lack of any other non operating income or expenses in fiscal also in fiscal  other income expense included a gain on an insurance settlement and expenses incurred in connection with the company s option to purchase property in pennsylvania which expired in the company adopted the financial accounting standards board s statement no

consequently  during this period  the company carried no debt and additionally  did not require any equity offerings 
the company s need to borrow began in fiscal in order to finance the modernization program 
until it began conserving cash in in anticipation of the modernization program  the company s liquidity needs were met from cash flows generated by operations 
a portion of the company s excess cash flow was distributed to stockholders as dividends through the year ended november  reflects reduced liquidity as compared to earlier periods 
this is primarily a result of utilizing cash on hand  cash generated by operations  and borrowings for the funding of capital expenditures primarily related to the modernization program 
capital expenditures during fiscal  and were   and  respectively 
in fiscal  the company expects capital expenditures to decline and believes that cash generated by operations and bank borrowings will be adequate to meet the anticipated liquidity needs of its business 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased  to  in fiscal as compared to  in primarily as a result of lower net earnings  and the fact that cash flows reflected a  decrease in inventories  as compared to november  a planned build up of billet inventories in contributed to the large decrease in inventories in also contributing to the decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities in is an increase in net receivables of  at november  as compared to as a result  working capital in decreased by  borrowings under long term arrangements mitigated the working capital decrease 
net cash used in investing activities decreased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal  reflecting a decrease in capital expenditures 
capital expenditures in fiscal were  capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be approximately  primarily for the completion of the modernization project 
there were no significant cash flows from investing activities other than capital expenditures in fiscal  and there were no significant cash flows from financing activities in fiscal in fiscal  cash flows from financing activities increased to  and in fiscal  cash flows from financing activities decreased  to  primarily from the company s bank borrowings to fund the modernization program

environmental the company s mill is classified  in the same manner as similar steel mills in the industry  as generating hazardous waste due to the production of dust that contains lead  cadmium and chromium 
see business environmental and regulatory matters above 
future trends commentary while the company has not yet fully realized all the anticipated savings from its modernization program  the company believes these savings are achievable 
much of the company s future profitability improvement will depend on the timing of achieving such savings and on the spread between scrap prices and the company s selling prices 
the company s ability to pass through scrap cost increases in its selling prices will be an important element in any improvement in the company s future profitability 
net operating loss carryforwards at november  the company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of  which expire in the years management believes that it is more likely than not that certain of its nol carryforwards will be utilized prior to their expiration 
this belief is based upon the factors discussed in the following paragraph 
in  the company continued and completed a major portion of its modernization program which included a new technology for making steel called the consteel process 
while to date the company has not achieved all anticipated efficiencies and savings with the new process  management is working with the new process in order to maximize efficiencies and achieve previously anticipated cost savings 
additionally  because of billet sales opportunities  the company expects to increase its sale of billets which will enable the melt shop to operate at higher production rates and reduced costs 
also  the company operates in a highly cyclical industry and consequently has a history of generating and subsequently utilizing significant amounts of nol carryforwards 
the tax reform act of contains provisions materially limiting the use  inter alia  of net operating loss carryforwards after an ownership change as defined 
in general  an ownership change will occur only if there has been a change in the stock ownership of a corporation of more than percentage points during a three year testing period  generally the three year period preceding the date of the change in stock ownership in question 
transactions involving stockholders individually holding less than of the voting stock generally are not taken into account  however  in determining whether there has been such a change 
transactions which may result in an ownership change can arise in any number of ways including sales or other transfers by existing stockholders  new issuances of shares  issuance of options  and redemptions 
see item security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management 
there can be no assurance that future transactions involving shares of stock in the company including  without limitation  issuances of certain types of preferred stock  will not result in a more than percentage point ownership change within the meaning of the internal revenue code which might therefore result in a material curtailment of the ability of the company to avail itself of its net operating loss carryforwards
