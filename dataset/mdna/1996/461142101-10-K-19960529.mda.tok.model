the company s exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is minimal as less than of total sales are denominated in foreign currencies 
prices for the company s products have remained stable  as measured by price per line shipped  during fiscal  and although the features and functions per line shipped have become more robust 
accordingly  the company s sales increases are largely the result of increased unit shipments 
cost of goods sold in the past  cost of goods sold has been affected by the mix of business between end users and distributors 
since fiscal  the mix of sales has become less a factor as the reduced costs associated with the lower customized software content of products sold to distributors has been offset by reductions in the cost of customizing software for end users 
the company anticipates that in fiscal its cost of goods sold will remain at a percentage of anticipated sales similar to fiscal research and development fiscal  and research and development expenses were approximately million  million and million  respectively

income from operations in order to understand the company s operating and net income over the last three fiscal years  it must be noted that the company purchased voiceplex corporation on august  for approximately million in cash and approximately  shares of the company s common stock 
the acquisition was effected by the merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of the company into voiceplex corporation 
substantially all the purchase price was allocated to in process research and development which resulted in a million charge to expense  with no related tax benefit  in fiscal adjusting for this write off  the company generated operating income of approximately million and net income of approximately million during fiscal operating income in fiscal increased versus fiscal adjusted operating income as a result of a increase in the company s total sales  improved gross margins due to an increased software content in the company s systems and productivity improvements from the company s sales  marketing and administrative staffs 
adjusted operating income in fiscal increased versus fiscal resulting from a increase in sales 
the increase in adjusted operating income during fiscal was at a lesser rate than the increase in sales due to the company s hiring and training of sales  service and support  and research and development personnel and the expansion of worldwide marketing and advertising programs 
operating income increased in fiscal versus the prior year 
this increase resulted primarily from a increase in sales and improved gross margins resulting from an increased software content in the company s systems  productivity improvements in the company s marketing and sales efforts  and the leveraging of the company s administrative overhead to support increased sales 
net income in fiscal increased versus fiscal adjusted net income 
fiscal net income grew at a slightly faster rate than operating income due to a favorable tax rate versus fiscal as a result of increased sales through the company s foreign sales corporation 
adjusted net income increased in fiscal from fiscal net income for fiscal grew at a lesser rate than operating income due to less tax free interest income as a result of the company s use of cash to repurchase stock  to acquire voiceplex corporation and to complete the expansion of its dallas facilities 
any anticipated increases in operating income and net income are expected to be at a rate generally commensurate with the percentage increase in anticipated sales 
liquidity and capital resources the company had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents at february   up from million at february  this increase is entirely attributable to the company s internally generated cash flow 
the company believes that its cash reserves and internally generated cash flow will be sufficient to meet its operating cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
in addition  the company has a million unsecured revolving line of credit with nationsbank  which expires july   which is available in its entirety 
the company reviews share repurchase and acquisition opportunities from time to time and repurchased  shares of its common stock during fiscal as market conditions made such shares of value to the company s shareholders 
the company believes it has or has access to the financial resources necessary to pursue attractive opportunities as they arise 
impact of inflation the company does not expect any significant short term impact of inflation on its financial condition 
technological advances should continue to reduce costs in the computer and communications industries 
further  the company presently is not bound by long term fixed price sales contracts and has no long term debt obligations  which should reduce the company s exposure to inflationary effects
