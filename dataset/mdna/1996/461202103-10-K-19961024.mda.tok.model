overview the company experienced significant growth during the twelve months ended july  fiscal net revenue increased to million as compared to million for the twelve months ended july  acquisitions occurring during the twelve months ended july  and and the ten months ended july  are described by transaction below 
due to the pending sale of intuit services corporation isc  as described below and in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the results for fiscal year have been adjusted to account for isc as discontinued operations 
with respect to quarterly results  it should be noted that the company s net revenue varies significantly by quarter due to seasonality in consumer buying patterns  particularly in sales of the personal and professional tax return preparation products  which mostly occur in the november through march time frame  as well as the timing of new and upgrade product releases 
the company s earnings and stock price have been and may continue to be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
the company has previously experienced shortfalls in revenue and earnings from levels expected by securities analysts  which has had an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock 
this may occur again in the future 
additionally  the company participates in a highly dynamic industry  which often results in significant volatility of the company s common stock price 
in particular  the impact of  and investors assessment of the impact of  the market s acceptance and adoption rate of electronic financial services  on the company s business may result in significant increases in the volatility of the company s stock price 
in addition  the trend towards internet based products and services could have a material adverse effect on sales of the company s products which may not be offset by sales of the company s software products 
in september  the company announced three internet related strategic initiatives designed to accelerate the adoption of electronic financial data exchange and communication by individuals  small businesses and their financial service providers 
first  the company announced plans to open the architecture of its software products to financial service providers so that such providers can connect directly through the internet to their customers who use intuit products 
second  the company announced that it would coordinate efforts with several third parties to develop a comprehensive framework for exchanging financial data over the internet in an integrated collection of specifications and protocols called openexchange 
thirdly  the company announced the signing of an agreement pursuant to which it plans to sell its banking and bill payment processing subsidiary  isc  to checkfree 
see business internet strategic initiatives and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
fiscal year change effective august   the company changed its fiscal year end from september to july in order to better align its financial reporting cycle with the business cycles of its tax and finance software products 
consequently  the company s audited consolidated financial statements included herein reflect the ten months ended july   and the twelve months ended july   and july  unaudited financial information for the twelve months ended july  is presented below under results of operations twelve months ended july  and for comparative purposes 
acquisitions and divestiture in december  the company completed its acquisition of chipsoft  which was treated as a purchase for accounting purposes 
the total purchase price of million in common stock  stock options  and acquisition costs million net of tangible assets acquired and approximately million relating to the tax effecting of identified intangibles were allocated as follows million to in process research and development  million to intangible assets  and million to goodwill 
in april  the company acquired certain assets of best s professional tax preparation business for an initial purchase price of million in cash 
the purchase agreement calls for a cash earnout payment based on the amount of revenue derived by the company from former best customers and the number of best customers who purchased the company s professional tax products by april the company is currently negotiating this payment with best and believes the obligation is insignificant 
of the purchase price  million was allocated to intangible assets 
in july  the company completed its acquisition of national payment clearinghouse  inc  which subsequently changed its name to isc  for consideration of million in common stock and cash 
isc currently provides electronic banking back end processing services  bill payment  stock quote retrieval services and access to intuit s web site for consumers via their modems and personal computers 
the acquisition was treated as a purchase for accounting purposes 
of the purchase price  million was allocated to in process research and development  million to intangible assets  and million to goodwill 
on september   the company announced plans to sell isc to checkfree corporation in exchange for million shares of checkfree common stock  approximately of the resulting million checkfree shares outstanding 
as of september   the checkfree stock to be exchanged in the transaction was valued at approximately million 
the company intends to account for its investment in checkfree using the cost method of accounting 
accordingly  the company plans to sell approximately two million shares of checkfree acquired in the transaction 
subject to regulatory and checkfree stockholder approval  as well as other conditions  the transaction is expected to be finalized by early calendar year isc s revenue accounted for less than of intuit s total net revenue in fiscal the company is accounting for the sale of isc as discontinued operations for fiscal year isc s results in and were immaterial 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in september  the company completed its acquisition of parsons  which was treated as a purchase for accounting purposes 
under the terms of the agreement  the company paid approximately million in cash and issued approximately  shares of the company s common stock to parsons stockholders at the date of the acquisition 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company paid an additional million in cash as deferred consideration 
the total purchase price of approximately million which  in addition to the above amounts  included  shares of common stock to be paid for certain non competition agreements  was allocated as follows million to in process research and development  million to intangible assets and million to goodwill 
in june  the company completed its acquisition of pni  a developer of technology to provide online investment research data 
the acquisition  which was accounted for as a purchase  had an aggregate purchase price of approximately million in common stock and acquisition costs 
of the purchase price  million was allocated to in process research and development   to identified intangible assets and  to goodwill 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to in process research and development was charged to the company s operations at the time of the acquisition 
in addition to the in process research and development charge  the company incurred acquisition related charges of million in fiscal related to the termination of a conflicting license agreement 
in june  the company acquired certain assets of mysterious pursuit for consideration of approximately million 
mysterious pursuit  an australian company  was the company s outside developer of tax software for the australian  german and united kingdom markets 
the purchase price of million was allocated to identified intangible assets 
mysterious pursuit s operations were discontinued during fiscal in january  the company completed its acquisition of milkyway  which was treated as a pooling of interests for accounting purposes 
milkyway is a provider of pc based financial software in japan 
in addition to the issuance of  shares of common stock  the company recorded acquisition related expenses of million for legal and other professional fees 
in june  the company completed its acquisition of iis  a developer of an internet based system designed to allow consumers to obtain personalized insurance information from national insurance carriers via the world wide web 
the acquisition  which was treated as a purchase for accounting purposes  had a purchase price of approximately million 
under the terms of the agreement  the company issued  shares of intuit common stock and  options to purchase intuit common stock to iis stockholders at the date of acquisition 
approximately million of in process research and development was expensed 
subsequent to year end  in september the company completed its acquisition of galt  a provider of mutual fund information on the internet 
the acquisition will be treated as a purchase for accounting purposes 
under the terms of the agreement  galt s stockholders received a combination of common stock and stock options valued at approximately million 
the purchase price of approximately million will be allocated to identified intangible assets and goodwill 
consistent with the company s test for internally developed software  for each of these acquisitions the company determined the amounts allocated to developed and in process research and development based on whether technological feasibility had been achieved and whether there was any alternative future use for the technology 
due to the absence of detailed program designs  evidence of technological feasibility was established through the existence of a completed working model at which point functions  features and technical performance requirements can be demonstrated 
as of the respective dates of the acquisitions  the company concluded that the in process research and development had no alternative future use after taking into consideration the potential for usage of the software in different products  resale of the software and internal usage 
acquisition related costs reduced net income by approximately million and million for the twelve months ended july  and july   respectively  including charges in these periods of million and million  respectively  for purchased research and development 
assuming no additional acquisitions  other than those discussed above  and no impairment of value causing an acceleration of amortization  the net income effect of future amortization  not including amortization related to the galt acquisition  is anticipated to be approximately million  million  million  and million for the years ended july  through  respectively 
because of the high levels of non cash amortization expense arising from the various acquisitions discussed above  the company may report losses in future periods including the fiscal year ending july  although the company believes the above transactions were in the best interests of the company and its stockholders  there are significant risks associated with these transactions 
the acquisitions have expanded the company s size  product lines  personnel and geographic locations 
the company s ability to integrate and organize these new businesses and successfully manage its growth will necessitate improvements in its operational  financial and management information systems 
although the company has taken steps to improve its internal processes  it has experienced significant operational difficulties in its order entry and shipping systems and in providing technical support to customers in the past  and there is no assurance that similar problems will not occur in the future or that they will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the divestiture of isc  if consummated  will result in the elimination of the company s direct participation in the online banking and bill payment processing business 
if the divestiture of isc to checkfree is concluded  the company s planned investment in the share of checkfree common stock to be issued to the company in that transaction could decrease in value due to market fluctuations and the success or failure of checkfree 
if such decline was determined to be other than temporary  charges to earnings would result 
there is also a risk that the company will be unable to divest the checkfree common stock shares quickly because of contractual and legal restrictions on the sale of such shares and the relatively large percentage of proposed ownership of checkfree common stock by the company 
results of operations management believes that a comparison of the twelve months ended july  to the ten months ended july  is not meaningful because of the difference in the length of reported periods 
therefore  this discussion and analysis of results of operations compares the audited twelve month period ended july  to the audited twelve month period ended july   and the audited twelve month period ended july  to the unaudited twelve month period ended july  due to the favorable timing of the acquisition of chipsoft  the results for the twelve months ended july  include substantially all of chipsoft s tax season revenue 
however  chipsoft s seasonally low revenue and high operating expenses for the period prior to december  are not reflected in the company s reported results for the entire twelve months and  thus  the period is not representative of business results anticipated for the company after the chipsoft acquisition 
results of operations include milkyway for all periods presented  but include other acquisitions only from their respective acquisition dates 
twelve months ended july  and set forth below are certain consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of revenue for the twelve months ended july  and twelve months ended july  dollars in thousands dollars of revenue dollars of revenue net revenue software   supplies   costs and expenses cost of goods sold product   amortization of purchased software and other 
  customer service and technical support   selling and marketing   research and development   general and administrative   charge for purchased research and development   other acquisition costs  including amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles   total costs and expenses   loss from operations   microsoft merger termination fee  net  interest and other income and expense  net   income loss from continuing operations before income taxes   provision for income taxes   loss from continuing operations   loss from operations of discontinued operations  net of income tax benefit of   net loss   net revenue increased approximately to million for the twelve months ended july   compared to million for the twelve months ended july  this increase resulted primarily from higher sales of both personal and professional versions of the company s tax preparation products and  to a lesser extent  the release of new and upgraded versions of small business finance products such as quickbooks  quickbooks pro and kobanto in japan  including deluxe and cd rom versions of certain products  which have higher average selling prices 
many of the company s protax customers have also upgraded to higher priced power tax products  which contributed to the increase in net revenue over the prior year 
in addition  net revenue from parsons operations increased to approximately million in fiscal from million in the period from september  date of acquisition to july  unit sales of personal finance products predominantly quicken increased in fiscal over fiscal  however  since the majority of this increase resulted from higher volumes of oem sales  which generate substantially lower per unit average selling prices  net revenue from these products remained flat in fiscal as compared to fiscal while the company receives little revenue from these oem sales in the short run  the company believes this channel is strategically important because it allows the company to acquire large numbers of new customers with the potential to generate future sales of software upgrades  electronic financial services and related software 
also contributing to the increase in net revenue for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was the introduction of additional international products  particularly in the uk  canada and france 
net revenue from european operations was million or of net revenue in fiscal  compared to million or of total net revenue in fiscal net revenue from asian operations milkyway was million or of net revenue in fiscal  compared to million or of net revenue in fiscal in april  milkyway released kobanto  its first small business accounting software product for windows 
although the company did experience significant growth in its international operations  its german subsidiary had difficulty executing two critical product launches in the second quarter of fiscal  resulting in late delivery of products to retail channels and excess inventory in the distribution channel 
because of this  net revenue generated by sales in germany for fiscal was significantly lower than anticipated by the company 
there can be no assurance that sales of new versions of personal and small business finance products or international products will continue at the rate experienced in the past or that other such product launch difficulties will not be encountered in the future 
software net revenue increased approximately to million for the twelve months ended july  from million in the prior year  principally due to the increased product volumes and new product introductions discussed above 
supplies net revenue increased by approximately to million for fiscal  as compared with million in the prior year  due to order increases in small business check  envelope and invoice products as the company s customer base continues to grow 
the gradual increase in upgrade sales as a percentage of total software revenue generally causes the growth of potential supplies customers to be slightly slower than the growth in software revenues 
in fiscal  supplies net revenue may be negatively impacted as some of the company s software users may shift to electronic bill payment services 
the company is unable to quantify the effect  if any  of this potential shift on future net revenue 
revenue is generally recognized at the time of shipment  net of allowances for estimated future returns and for excess quantities in distribution channels  provided that no significant vendor obligations exist and collections of accounts receivable are probable 
reserves are provided for quantities of current product versions that are considered excess  and for inventories of all previous versions of products at the time new product versions are introduced 
advance payments are recorded as deferred revenue until the products are shipped or services are provided 
rebate costs are provided at the time revenue is recognized 
the company provides warranty reserves at the time revenue is recognized for the estimated cost of replacing defective products 
there can be no assurance that the reserves established by the company will be sufficient to cover future returns of product  warranty  and rebate obligations 
the software industry  including the company  is selling increasingly through alternative channels  such as oem  or bundling products for a single low price 
while this strategy introduces new customers to products  it also significantly reduces average selling prices 
the software industry  including the company  has experienced significant platform shifts in the past  such as from dos to windows and  more recently  to windows there is increased competition on the windows and windows platforms  including lower priced products and free promotional products that compete with the company s software 
in order to respond to these competitive pressures  the company may use price reductions and or other promotional offers which would negatively impact net revenue and income from operations 
as platform shifts continue to occur  there are risks that competitors could introduce new products before the company s products are available on a particular platform or that customers may not accept a platform that the company has chosen or will choose to pursue 
further consolidation of the software industry or changes in the personal computer industry could lead to increased competition in innovation and pricing strategies 
the company cannot quantify how much these factors have affected or will affect its business 
in addition  a number of the company s competitors have greater financial resources than the company  potentially giving them a competitive advantage 
although the company believes there are opportunities in international markets  there can be no assurance that the company s products will be accepted in these markets 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the company s new or upgraded products will be accepted  will not be delayed or canceled  or will not contain errors or bugs that could affect the performance of the product or cause damage to a user s data 
if any of these events occurs  the company may experience reduced net revenue  loss of market share  increased maintenance release costs and higher technical support costs 
cost of goods sold decreased to approximately of net revenue for the year ended july  versus for the prior year 
decreased amortization of purchased software resulting from the company s acquisitions accounted for the majority of this decline 
excluding acquisition related amortization costs  cost of goods sold would have been of net revenue for fiscal and for fiscal software cost of goods sold  excluding acquisition related amortization costs  was approximately of software net revenue for the year ended july  versus for the previous twelve month period 
supplies cost of goods sold was approximately of supplies net revenue for the year ended july  compared to for the year ended july  the company has negotiated a long term contract on the pricing of checks and plans to continually take actions to reduce the materials cost of all of its supplies products 
however  there can be no assurance that margin improvements will be achieved or that current margins will be sustained 
in march  the company announced the identification of some calculation errors in certain circumstances in the consumer versions of the turbotax and macintax products 
during the quarter ended january  the company recorded an expense of million to cover the estimated cost of the free revisions and other associated costs 
during the quarter ended january   a different set of less serious calculation errors were identified  and actions were taken during the quarter to notify users and provide fixes  resulting in approximately million in warranty and related costs 
there can be no assurance that such bugs will be identified prior to shipment of products in the future 
such bugs could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
operating expenses 
during fiscal  the company experienced significant operational problems as a result of inadequacies in certain of its systems  procedures and controls 
for example  during the quarter ended january  and the weeks following  the company s direct order entry systems were unable to process all of the orders received by the company on a timely basis  which resulted in a number of problems including adverse publicity  lost business and customer dissatisfaction 
these operational problems affected technical support and customer service expenses  selling and marketing expenses  and cost of goods sold in fiscal as described above  the company identified calculation errors in some of its and tax products 
the company has guaranteed calculations in its tax products and will pay any penalties and interest due the irs as a result of the calculation errors 
as of july   claims made for such errors have been insignificant  however  additional claims may be received in the future 
the company is unable to quantify the effect  if any  on future revenues of the adverse publicity the company received regarding its operational problems or the identification of bugs 
the company has taken steps to correct and mitigate these problems  however  there can be no assurance that these or other problems will not occur in the future 
customer service and technical support costs were approximately and of net revenue  respectively  for the years ended july  and customer service and technical support costs were higher during the year ended july   as compared to the prior year  partially due to a growing number of quickbooks small business customers placing greater demands on customer support  and a significant increase in capacity  staffing  and training to improve service levels to address the problems encountered in fiscal discussed above 
in addition  the company has significantly increased spending in building customer and technical support capabilities to provide higher quality service to its electronic financial services customer base 
during the second and third quarters of fiscal  the company invested in correcting operational problems that were causing its online service customers difficulty in connecting to network services 
in addition  the year ended july  included technical support costs for parsons for the full year  while the previous year included such costs for parsons only from the acquisition date of september  post contract customer support costs are accrued at the time revenue is recognized  are included in customer service and technical support expenses and are not included in cost of goods sold 
the company incurs a fixed base of support costs  which is augmented by seasonal staffing and third party services during periods of seasonally higher sales 
the company previously offered customer service and technical support without charge 
however  during fiscal the company began charging quickbooks customers for support 
the company will evaluate its decision to implement support fees and will consider adjusting its policies if there is significant unfavorable customer reaction 
there can be no assurance that these policies will not have a material adverse effect on customer relations 
see business customer service and support for a discussion of risks associated with charging customers for support 
as discussed above  the company received a large volume of customer calls in the period from january through march regarding shipping delays and calculation errors experienced in that period 
many customers called to inquire about their orders  resulting in overloaded phone lines and long hold times 
the company has significantly increased its capacity in this area  which has resulted in higher costs 
however  even with the increased capacity  there can be no assurance that such delays and hold times will not occur in the future 
selling and marketing expenses remained constant at approximately of net revenue for the years ended july  and selling and marketing costs increased in absolute dollars primarily as a result of new product launches  concentrated marketing efforts to support business initiatives for electronic financial services  and continued efforts to expand international market penetration  particularly in the united kingdom  germany  canada  japan  and france 
the year ended july  included parsons sales and marketing costs for the full year while the year ended july   included such costs for parsons only from the acquisition date of september  the company expects selling and marketing expenses to continue to increase in the future as the company releases and promotes new products and expands internationally  however  there can be no assurance that increased marketing spending will result in increased net revenue 
research and development expenses remained constant at approximately of net revenue for the years ended july  and however  these expenses increased in absolute dollars in fiscal as the company incurred significant research and development costs related to integration of internet access  and quicken financial network into its products 
the company expects to experience significant growth of research and development expenses for development efforts related to new and existing products and services  including foreign versions of its products 
because online financial services is an emerging market with different competitors than the company s core product offerings  there can be no assurance that the company s products and services will be accepted in the market  will not be delayed or will compete effectively with competitors products and services 
general and administrative expenses were of net revenue for each of the years ended july  and general and administrative expenses increased in absolute dollars by million in fiscal due to merger expenses related to milkyway and additional personnel and infrastructure to support the company s growth 
in addition  bad debt expense increased by approximately million  primarily resulting from the increase in net revenue and higher collections risks 
microsoft termination fee 
on may   the company announced that its merger agreement with microsoft had been terminated 
the proposed merger had been opposed in a lawsuit brought by the us department of justice  and the two companies were unable to agree to pursue the litigation 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company received a million termination fee from microsoft million net of related expenses 
the after tax benefit to the company of this termination payment was approximately million 
interest and other income and expense  net was approximately million and million for the years ended july  and  respectively 
the increase in net interest income in fiscal was primarily due to net proceeds of million resulting from the company s follow on public offering and the microsoft termination fee of million  both of which were received in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and to the increase in interest rates during fiscal as compared to fiscal interest expense increased by  in the year ended july   as compared to the prior year  as a result of a loan entered into in fiscal for a new support facility built by the company in rio rancho  new mexico 
income taxes 
for the year ended july   the company recorded an income tax provision of million for continued operations on pre tax income of million and a tax benefit of million for discontinued operations on a pre tax loss of million 
the tax provision on the total loss arose because of the non deductible status of both the in process research and development charges and the amortization of goodwill 
there was no valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets of million at july   based on management s assessment that current levels of anticipated taxable income will be sufficient to realize the net deferred tax assets 
twelve months ended july  and set forth below are certain consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of revenue for the twelve months ended july  and twelve months ended july  unaudited dollars in thousands dollars of revenue dollars of revenue net revenue software   supplies   costs and expenses cost of goods sold product   amortization of purchased software and other 
  customer service and technical support   selling and marketing   research and development   general and administrative   charge for purchased research and development   other acquisition costs  including amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles   total costs and expenses   loss from operations   microsoft merger termination fee  net  interest and other income and expense  net   loss before income taxes   provision for income taxes   net loss   net revenue increased approximately to million for the twelve months ended july   compared to million for the twelve months ended july  the increase resulted in part from the inclusion of approximately million in net revenue from parsons operations subsequent to september   and net revenue from chipsoft s operations which increased to million for the twelve months ended july   compared to million from the date of the chipsoft acquisition to july  net revenue from european operations was and of total net revenue in and  respectively 
net revenue from asian operations was and of total net revenue in and  respectively 
asian operations were the result of the milkyway merger in january this was accounted for as a pooling of interests and  therefore  all reported periods have been restated to include milkyway 
software net revenue increased approximately to million for the twelve months ended july  from million in the same period of the prior year  principally due to increased volumes  new product introductions and acquisitions 
the release of new and upgraded finance products  including deluxe and cd rom versions of certain products  resulted in greater unit sales 
increases in average selling prices from deluxe products were partially offset by lower average selling prices on certain products sold through the oem channel and a greater proportion of upgrade sales as compared with new product sales as the company s core product lines mature 
supplies net revenue increased approximately to million for the fiscal period as compared with million in the prior year due to order increases in small business check  envelope and invoice products as the company s customer base continued to grow 
cost of goods sold decreased to approximately of net revenue for the twelve months ended july  versus for the prior twelve month period 
decreased amortization of purchased software resulting from the company s acquisitions accounted for the majority of this decline 
excluding acquisition related amortization costs  cost of goods sold would have been approximately of net revenue for both of the twelve month periods ended july  and software cost of goods sold  excluding acquisition related amortization costs  increased to approximately of software net revenue for the twelve months ended july   as compared to approximately in the twelve months ended july  margin declines resulted from product and freight costs associated with expediting delayed orders and maintenance releases for consumer tax products and upgrade revenues 
in addition  parsons lower priced product offerings included for the period after september  had higher cost to net revenue ratios than other intuit products 
the company achieved supplies margin improvements from a shift in product mix to business supplies and a reduction in materials costs  including a one time price concession on previously purchased materials in the first quarter of fiscal operating expenses 
as previously discussed  during fiscal  the company experienced significant operational problems as a result of inadequacies in certain of its systems  procedures and controls 
these operational problems affected technical support and customer service expenses  selling and marketing expenses  and cost of goods sold in fiscal customer service and technical support costs were approximately and of net revenue  respectively  for the twelve month periods ended july  and customer service and technical support costs were higher during the twelve months ended july   as compared to the prior twelve month period  primarily as a result of increased customer calls regarding both the shipping delays in january  discussed above  and tax product calculation errors 
in addition  due to the favorable timing of the chipsoft acquisition  chipsoft s seasonally low revenues and high costs of operations from august through december  are not reflected in the company s results for the twelve months ended july  during fiscal  the company substantially completed the relocation of certain support functions to lower cost locations  however  there can be no assurance that future cost savings will be achieved 
post contract customer support costs are accrued at the time revenue is recognized  are included in customer service and technical support expenses and are not included in cost of goods sold 
selling and marketing expenses increased to approximately of net revenue in fiscal compared to approximately in fiscal selling and marketing costs increased both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenue primarily as a result of the inclusion of parsons operations from september   new product launches and continued efforts to expand international market penetration 
in addition  because of the seasonality of the tax business and the timing of the chipsoft acquisition  the company experienced increased costs during the first four months of fiscal without a corresponding increase in net revenue during that period 
research and development expenses increased to of net revenue for the twelve months ended july  from of net revenue in the twelve months ended july  the significant increase  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue  was due to development efforts on new and existing products  including international versions of products  and investment in electronic banking service features 
in addition  research and development expenses include parsons operations from september  and chipsoft s operations from december  because of the seasonality of the chipsoft business  expenses are typically higher in the october quarter without corresponding net revenue during the same period 
because of the timing of the chipsoft acquisition  the twelve months ended july  included the seasonally high net revenue of chipsoft  but did not include its operating expenses prior to december  general and administrative expenses were of net revenue during each of the twelve month periods ended july  and however  general and administrative expenses increased in absolute dollars by million in fiscal because of the inclusion of parsons and chipsoft s operations from the dates of their respective acquisitions  as well as additional senior management personnel and infrastructure to support revenue growth 
in particular  the company significantly increased administrative support in its international offices  and increased its in house legal and finance departments domestically 
in addition  bad debt expense increased by approximately million in relation to the increase in net revenue 
interest and other income and expense  net was million and million for the twelve months ended july  and  respectively 
the increase in net interest income was the result of higher cash balances arising from net proceeds of million from a follow on public offering of  shares of the company s common stock in june  the receipt of a million million net of related expenses and income taxes merger termination fee from microsoft corporation in may and cash generated from operations  partially offset by million in cash paid for parsons in september interest expense increased by  in the twelve months ended july  as a result of a loan entered into in fiscal for a new support facility built by the company 
income taxes 
for the year ended july   the company recorded an income tax provision of million on a pretax loss of million 
the tax provision on the operating loss arose because of the non deductible status of both the in process research and development charges and goodwill amortization 
there was no valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets of million at july  based on management s assessment that current levels of taxable income would be sufficient to realize the net deferred tax assets 
certain factors that may affect future results the company s business has experienced  and is expected to continue to experience  substantial seasonality  due principally to the timing of the tax return preparation season  timing of production launches for new or updated versions of products and  to a lesser extent  consumer software buying patterns 
sales of the company s tax products are concentrated in the period from november  when certain professional tax products are released  through march  when consumers purchase the products in advance of the april tax return filing deadline 
sales of the company s quicken products are typically strongest during the year end holiday buying season 
as a result of these seasonal patterns  the company generated significant income from operations before acquisition related charges during its fiscal quarter ended january   with the quarter ended april  following as the second largest revenue generating quarter of the fiscal year 
because of these seasonal factors and a significantly increased level of operating expenses to support the company s expanded infrastructure and development efforts  the company incurred significant losses from operations before acquisition related charges during its fiscal quarters ended july  and october  the company expects to continue to report seasonal losses before acquisition related costs and amortization in the july and october quarters of future fiscal years 
the company s quarterly operating results have varied in the past  and are likely to vary in the future  significantly based upon a number of factors 
in addition to seasonal factors  the company s quarterly operating results can be affected significantly by the number and timing of new product or version releases by the company  as well as a number of other factors including the timing of product announcements or introductions by the company s competitors  discretionary marketing and promotional expenditures  research and development expenditures and a variety of non recurring events such as acquisitions 
products are generally shipped as orders are received and  consequently  quarterly sales and operating results depend primarily on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter  which are difficult to forecast 
a significant portion of the company s operating expenses are relatively fixed and planned expenditures are based on sales forecasts 
thus  if net revenue levels are below expectations  operating results are likely to be materially adversely affected 
in particular  net income  if any  may be disproportionately affected because only a small portion of the company s expenses vary with revenue in the short term 
in response to competition  the company may also choose to reduce prices or increase spending  which may adversely affect the company s operating results and financial condition
