item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations firstar acquired two banking organizations in under pooling of interests accounting procedures 
consequently  all financial information for prior years has been restated to include the results of operations of these companies 
this discussion includes forecasts concerning revenues  expenses and other business results which are based upon estimates 
there are numerous factors such as changes in economic conditions that could adversely affect actual results 
therefore  there will be differences between these forecasts and actual results and no assurance can be given that these forecasts will be realized

return on average assets for was compared with in and in earnings have been relatively level during the past two years due to unusual expenses in both and a merger and restructuring charge of million pre tax was taken in in connection with four bank acquisitions which reduced net income by 
per common share 
these charges included increased loan loss provisions  losses on the sale of securities  employee severance costs and other related expenses 
during a million pre tax charge was recorded for a check kiting fraud 
this loss reduced net income by

net interest revenue net interest revenue  which comprises interest and loan related fees less interest expense  is the principal source of earnings for firstar 
net interest revenue is affected by a number of factors including the level  pricing and maturity of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  interest rate fluctuations and asset quality 
net interest margin is net interest revenue expressed as a percentage of average earning assets

impact of interest free funds 




net interest margin 

during  net interest revenue increased to million 
this follows a increase in the growth in both years benefited from higher average earning asset balances  driven principally by continued strong loan growth 
this positive impact was somewhat offset by a reduction in the net interest margin in both years 
the net interest margin for was compared with in and in the margin has been compressed during the past two years by the rising cost of funds which has not been fully offset by increased yield on earning assets 
interest rates increased dramatically during with the prime rate rising from at the beginning of the year to at the end of the year 
during the prime rate remained within a narrow band between to rates paid on fund sources increased by or basis points  in reflecting the run up of interest rates in which effect is more fully seen in the average rates paid 
on the asset side  rate increases of only basis points were achieved 
the impact of interest free funds supporting earning assets benefited net interest margin by basis points in reflecting the increased volume of these deposits in a higher rate environment 
the basis point decline in net interest margin in resulted principally from a basis point increase in the cost of funds 
firstar expects its net interest margin to remain in the same range as experienced in foregone interest on nonperforming loans and foreclosed assets reduced net interest revenue by million in  million in and million in this resulted in corresponding reductions in net interest margin of 
in and 
in and 
in this nominal impact is a reflection of firstar s continued low level of nonperforming assets 
table shows the components of interest revenue and expense along with changes related to volumes and rates 
total interest revenue increased by to billion in this resulted from higher average earning assets  up  and the increased yield on earning assets 
interest income on loans rose by due to both loan growth and higher rates 
securities income increased with the higher average balance levels 
during  total interest revenue increased by to billion 
this increase was nearly entirely average balance driven  with earning assets rising by 
interest income on commercial loans rose by due to both higher balances and interest rates 
consumer loan interest  while up  was impacted by a lower net interest rate which was basis points less than this reduced rate on consumer loans reflects the refinancing activity and general lower rates available in securities income declined in as higher rate investments matured and were replaced with securities with then currently lower market yields

interest expense on deposits increased as interest rates were increased to remain competitive in the market 
interest cost for short term borrowed funds nearly doubled as increased reliance was placed upon this higher cost funding source 
total interest expense increased by during to a level of million 
this was principally due to the increased cost of short term borrowed funds 
both higher usage of this funding source and its associated increased interest rate were factors 
other operating revenue total other operating revenue  excluding securities gains and losses  increased by to a level of million in this compares with a decline in attributable to reduced mortgage banking activities 
firstar continues to emphasize growth in fee revenue

an industry measure of fee revenue prominence is the ratio of this revenue to average assets 
during this ratio was compared to in and in while fee revenue has increased  the effect of the larger growth in average assets in is shown in the reduction of this ratio 
firstar continues to remain in the top quartile of its peer group by this measure of fee revenue 
trust and investment management fees are the single largest source of fee revenue  contributing million  or one third of other operating revenue 
this level represents a growth in revenue in which in turn followed a growth recorded in the general rise in the market value of assets contributed to the growth achieved in in addition  expanded services are being offered through firstar s banking network and additional marketing efforts are also being directed to institutional investors beyond the midwest 
trust assets under management increased by during to a level of billion at the end of the year 
assets held in custody accounts were billion at year end  a increase from last year 
revenue from service charges on deposit accounts declined by in both of the last two years and currently is at a level of million 
this reduction was primarily due to higher rate credits given to business customers for services  thus reducing the level of cash payments necessary 
credit card service revenues are the third largest source of fee revenue 
a significant growth rate of was achieved during  increasing revenue to million 
this follows a smaller increase of in the introduction of new credit card products  increased merchant fee revenues and the repricing of service charges have all contributed to this revenue growth

this customer base  which covers the upper midwest and includes wisconsin  iowa  illinois  minnesota  upper michigan  nebraska and the dakotas  provides a market for the sale and expansion of other financial products 
revenue from mortgage banking activities has fluctuated during the last three years as a result of general market driven factors 
revenue from mortgage originations reached million in  during which period the record low interest rates drove up refinancing volumes 
mortgage origination revenues in were million reflecting reduced volumes

firstar capitalized million in originated service rights in further information on mortgage servicing rights activities is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
data processing fee income declined in and in a shrinking customer base due to continuing bank consolidations through mergers or acquisitions and conversions by smaller community banks to in house data processing systems have acted to reduce revenues 
intense price competition has also occurred due to the shrinking market for sales and has affected revenue levels through pricing changes and some loss of customers 
brokerage services increased by during this followed a market driven decline of in securities losses of million and million were realized in and  respectively 
these losses were generated by the partial liquidation of merged banks portfolios to bring them in line with firstar s investment policies

the fdic is considering further changes to the rate structure in of both bank insured bif and savings and loan insured saif deposits 
firstar has billion of saif deposits acquired in acquisitions of savings institutions 
these deposits may be subject to either higher insurance rates or a one time assessment to fully fund the saif pool 
the one time assessment could exceed million 
the amortization of intangibles includes amounts associated with goodwill  core deposit intangibles and mortgage loan servicing rights

cash payments during have reduced the restructuring accrual to approximately million 
a million check kiting loss that was recorded in involved two affiliated commercial customers who conducted fraudulent check transactions 
a measure of the success in managing operating expense is expressed in the ratio of expense to revenue and is referred to as the efficiency ratio 
the objective is to reduce this ratio through revenue growth  cost control or a combination of both 
excluding the restructuring charges and check kiting loss  this ratio was in  in and in in january  firstar announced plans to simplify and streamline its operations with a goal to improve its efficiency and customer service 
once fully implemented by mid  these improvements are expected to add million in annualized pre tax earnings and result in an efficiency ratio of or less for a restructuring charge of million after tax will be taken in the first quarter of to cover costs associated with this project 
provisions for loan losses the provision for loan losses is used to cover actual loan losses and to adjust the size of the reserve relative to the amount and quality of loans 
in determining the adequacy of the reserve  management considers the financial strength of borrowers  loan collateral  current and anticipated economic conditions and other factors

continued reliance on these alternative funding sources will be necessary 
credit risk management since the mid s  credit management has been refined through procedural and personnel changes 
emphasis on credit quality standards and diversification of risk have been key strategies 
the benefits of this program are seen in the significant reductions in nonperforming assets and overall credit quality achieved during the past several years 
during this period nonperforming assets as a percentage of loans and foreclosed assets have declined from in to

this is reflective of the overall consistent financial strength of firstar s commercial borrowers 
nonperforming consumer loans have increased by million to million at the end of this represented

while consumer nonperforming loans remain at a very minimal level  the increase from year to year reflects the impact of consumers taking on increased debt burdens in the past two years 
loans ninety days or more past due on december   totaled million  compared with million a year earlier 
these loans are on a full accrual basis and are judged by management to be collectible in full 
in addition  firstar had million of loans at december   on which interest is accruing  but  because of existing economic conditions or circumstances of the borrower  doubt exists as to the ability of the borrower to comply with the present loan terms 
while these loans are identified as requiring additional monitoring  they do not necessarily represent future nonperforming assets 
additional indicators of asset quality can be found in the geographic distribution  industry diversification and type of lending represented in the loan portfolio 
credit policies have been changed over the past several years to reduce vulnerability to potential adverse economic trends 
marketing efforts have been directed to firstar s primary market segments which are consumer  small business and middle market customers in communities where firstar banks are located

current charge off levels in this area are consistent with the overall charge off level of other commercial lending areas 
consumer lending includes loans to individuals in communities served by firstar s banks

consumer delinquency rates have increased over the past several quarters as the economic cycle progresses 
increased consumer charge offs may continue as evidenced by the higher level of consumer nonaccrual and past due loans at december  liquidity and interest rate risk management two objectives of firstar s asset and liability management strategy include the maintenance of appropriate liquidity and management of interest rate risk 
liquidity management aligns sources and uses of funds to meet the cash flow requirements of customers and firstar 
interest rate risk management seeks to generate growth in net interest revenue and manage exposure to risks associated with interest rate movements and provide for acceptable and predictable results 
although conceptually distinct  liquidity and interest rate sensitivity must be managed together since action taken with respect to one often influences the other 
asset liquidity is generally provided by short term investments such as interest bearing deposits with other banks  federal funds sold and repurchase agreements 
these investments totaled million at december  securities that have been designated as available for sale were billion at the end of and can be sold to meet liquidity needs

stable core deposits do not require significant amounts of liquidity to meet the net withdrawal demands of customers on a short or intermediate term basis 
other sources of liquidity are short term borrowed funds  federal home loan bank borrowings and time deposits which totaled billion at the end of firstar s ability to refinance maturing amounts and  when necessary  increase this funding base is a significant factor in its liquidity management 
additionally  firstar has access to capital markets through the issuance of debt or commercial paper 
long term debt was increased in with the issuance of million of five year notes 
firstar also has in place a million line of credit at the end of and further intends to increase this line of credit to a level of million 
these funds will be used to repurchase common stock  repay outstanding indebtedness and for other corporate purposes 
the absolute level and volatility of interest rates can have a significant impact on earnings 
the objective of interest rate risk management is to identify and manage the sensitivity of net interest revenue to changing interest rates 
firstar uses computer simulation modeling as its primary method of quantifying and evaluating interest rate risk 
simulation modeling is performed at least quarterly and is used to quantify the impact on net interest revenue of various assumptions about interest rate and balance sheet changes and the use of off balance sheet derivatives and financial instruments 
the use of simulation modeling also enables firstar to develop and test alternative asset and liability management strategies 
interest rate risk and the results of the simulation modeling is reviewed quarterly by bank  regional and corporate committees who assess the interest rate risk position and approve corresponding strategies 
the objective of firstar s asset liability management policy is to maintain adequate capital and liquidity and manage interest rate risk to produce an acceptable level of net interest revenue 
firstar s guideline is to employ an asset liability management strategy which limits the potential impact of projected interest rate changes to of net income over the subsequent four quarters 
in the most recent simulation  net interest revenue was forecast for under four interest rate scenarios 
first  if current rates continued unchanged with a prime rate of  and then under most likely  high and low interest rate scenarios in which prime rate changes to  and respectively  by the fourth quarter of compared to  under these four scenarios net interest revenue in is simulated to increase by million if rates in the fourth quarter of remained throughout under the most likely and low scenarios  net interest revenue in is simulated to increase by million and million  respectively  compared to under the high scenario  net interest revenue is simulated to decline by million compared to the simulation model is supplemented with a tool used in the banking industry for measurement of interest rate risk known as the gap analysis 
this measures the difference between assets and liabilities repricing or maturing within specified time periods 
the gap analysis does  however  have limitations such as not reflecting the magnitude with which assets or liabilities may reprice within a given interest rate scenario 
a positive gap indicates that there are more rate sensitive assets than rate sensitive liabilities repricing within a given time frame 
a positive gap would generally imply a favorable impact on net income in periods of rising rates
