item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
results of operations  and production and yields production and yield data for the seven orchards are summarized below expressed in wet in shell pounds at moisture average yield per acre orchard acreage production keaau a      keaau c     keaau d     ka u a     ka u b     ka u c     mauna kea c     totals except yields      a orchards acquired in june b orchard acquired in december c orchards acquired in october d orchard acquired in september keaau orchard yields have been affected since by the significant number of trees removed as a result of macadamia quick decline mqd damage 
replacement trees have been planted but it will take several years before those replacement trees begin bearing nuts and several additional years for them to reach peak production 
the and yields were lower than in due to wet conditions in january and february which induced flower fungal diseases and limited pollination and the unusually dry conditions in early which affected flowering for the crop year 
rainfall has been good so far in nearly forty inches through mid march and the orchards are now past the critical january february phytopthora period with negligible adverse effect on the crop 
the yields from the ka u orchards partly reflected crop timing  as the early nut drop for the crop year accelerated some production from to  which reduced calendar year yields 
the drought conditions experienced in the first six months of and the first four months of also affected production in the crop year and the crop years 
ka u flowering for the crop year was also affected by extremely dry weather in with fewer than thirty inches of rainfall for the full year  which reduced crop year yields  particularly for the older ka u trees 
as a result  the fall ka u crop was below normal and the spring ka u crop is expected to be below normal 
rainfall has been excellent so far in with thirty one inches of rainfall through mid march versus only three inches for the same period in and the current outlook for the ka u crop is promising 
the ka u orchards acquired in december and october and the mauna kea orchard acquired in october are not yet fully mature 
as a result  the yields from these orchards are expected to be lower on average over the next few years than for the partnership s mature orchards 
at full maturity under favorable growing conditions  a macadamia orchard can produce between  and  wis pounds of macadamia nuts per acre each year at ka u and between  and  wis pounds of macadamia nuts per acre each year at keaau 
no trees have reached full maturity in the mauna kea area  but we expect that production at maturity at mauna kea orchard will approximate keaau levels 
revenues macadamia nut revenues depend on the number of producing acres  yields per acre and the nut purchase price 
the impact of these three factors is summarized below over over tree acres harvested    average yield wis lbs 
acre    nuts harvested s wis lbs 
   nut price wis lbs 
gross nut sales s    less portion reported on the balance sheet s net nut revenues s    all of the partnership nut production is sold under long term contracts to mauna loa macadamia nut corporation mauna loa 
the price for these nuts is based on the two year trailing average of usda published macadamia nut prices and on a net back component 
that net back component is determined by subtracting from mauna loa s gross revenues from the sale of macadamia products i allocable pro cessing  packaging  marketing  selling and advertising costs and ii a capital charge on the difference between those aggregate gross revenues and aggregate allo cable costs 
the following table sets forth the manner in which the nut purchase price per pound was determined for  and in lb usda price two years prior a usda price one year prior a usda price two year trailing average gross revenues less allocable processing  packaging  marketing  sales and advertising costs less capital charge net back component usda price two year trailing average net back component average of usda two year trailing average price and net back component plus hawaii general excise tax nut purchase price b a because mauna loa s own purchases comprise a substantial portion of nut purchases reported to the usda  the usda price component of the purchase price is  to a substantial degree  the average price that mauna loa has paid to purchase macadamia nuts from the partnership and from third parties during the previous two years 
b the nut purchase contract covering nut production from the acre keaau orchard acquired in september interprets the two year trailing average provision slightly differently and thus results in a slightly different nut price cent 
for spring and cent 
for fall 
because this orchard accounts for less than of the partnership s nut production  this difference in interpretation has only a minimal effect on partnership revenues 
the usda published price for the crop year was cent 
per pound at moisture  which is higher than in and higher than in the usda has estimated that the crop year price will increase by to cent 
per pound at moisture 
the two year trailing average usda component of the partnership s nut price formula will increase by to cent 
per pound 
the final nut price of cent 
per pound was cent 
higher than in as a result of an improved net back component 
that improvement primarily resulted from higher factory throughput  labor cost savings from factory capital improvements and from a higher value sales mix 
the final nut price of cent 
per pound was cent 
lower than in as a result of both a lower usda two year trailing average price and a lower net back component 
the lower usda two year trailing average reflects the significant decline in macadamia nut prices during the period from through  while the lower net back component was primarily the result of lower factory throughput and lower processing recoveries during cost of goods sold agricultural unit costs depend on the operating expenses required to maintain orchards and to harvest the crop as well as on the quantity of nuts actually harvested 
the partnership s unit costs expressed in dollars per wet in shell pound at moisture  which are calculated by dividing all agricultural costs for each orchard by the number of pounds of macadamia nuts produced by that orchard  are summarized below orchard keaau a keaau c keaau d ka u a ka u b ka u c mauna kea c all orchards e all orchards f a orchards acquired in june b orchard acquired in december c orchards acquired in october d orchard acquired in september e includes capitalized costs charged to the balance sheet 
f excludes capitalized costs charged to the balance sheet 
total production costs charged to the income statement decreased by million in despite the inclusion of production costs for the full year for the partnership s mauna kea orchard  which was placed in service on july  reduced workers compensation costs together with reduced equipment repair and maintenance costs accounted for most of that improvement 
total production costs charged to the income statement increased by million in due primarily to the inclusion of production costs for the second half of the year for the partnership s mauna kea orchard  which was placed in service on july  all costs and related nut sales receipts for this orchard had previously been capitalized to the balance sheet as a developing orchard in accordance with standard industry practice 
notwithstanding that increase in total production costs expensed in  unit production costs declined as higher production volume more than offset those higher costs 
general and administrative costs total general and administrative costs decreased by  in primarily due to the absence of a management fee for for  a management fee of  had been earned by the managing general partner 
total general and administrative costs increased by  in primarily due to changes in the timing of year end investor tax reporting work 
interest income and expense the partnership funds its working capital needs through short term borrowings  generating interest expense in the process 
net interest expense therefore is partly a function of any balances carried over from the prior year  the amounts and timing of cash generated and distributions paid to investors in the current year as well as the current level of interest rates 
net interest expense decreased in and again in as the partnership generated more cash than it paid out in distributions those two years 
seasonality  capital resources and liquidity macadamia nut farming is seasonal  with production peaking in the late fall 
however  farming operations continue throughout the year 
the partnership meets its working capital needs through short term borrowings under a million revolving line of credit which is extendible for one year intervals subject to the consent of the lender by paying an extension fee 
management extended the line of credit in june and again in june and expects to extend the line of credit again in june the outstanding balance on the line of credit normally peaks in the third quarter due to the seasonality of macadamia nut production 
at the end of and  the line carried million and million balances  respectively 
because of the heavy early nut drop in and the strong third quarter harvest  the line of credit had a zero balance outstanding as of the end of except for orchard acquisitions  the partnership has made no major capital expenditures since inception 
in  the partnership acquired a acre macadamia orchard which it financed by a  eight year mortgage note 
the remaining balance on that note was paid off in february in the second quarter of  the partnership plans to resurface acres of orchards at ka u to enable them to be harvested mechanically 
the estimated cost of this project is  the cash flow warranty agreement signed pursuant to the acquisition of orchards provided roughly one half of the partnership s net cash flow until its completion in mid with macadamia nut prices currently well below the levels seen in when this acquisition had been made  cash flow from the new orchards has been insufficient to fully offset the absence of warranty payments since mid for  the partnership generated net cash flow of per class a unit without receiving warranty payments 
the related orchards are still five to eight years short of full maturity and their production should increase over the next several years assuming normal weather and other conditions 
at full maturity  production at the young ka u orchards should approximate the level of the partnership s mature ka u orchard while production at the young mauna kea orchard should approximate the level of the partnership s mature keaau orchards before adjusting for unusable nuts 
given its current absence of debt and the presence of a million line of credit  it is the opinion of the managing partner that the partnership has adequate borrowing capacity available to meet anticipated working capital needs 
inflation and taxes in general  prices paid to macadamia nut farmers fluctuate independently of inflation 
macadamia nut prices are influenced strongly by prices for finished macadamia nut products which  in turn  depend on competition and consumer acceptance 
farming costs  particularly labor and materials  do generally reflect inflationary trends  as do general and administrative costs 
the omnibus budget reconciliation act of obra provided that some publicly traded limited partnerships  including the partnership  are to be taxed as corporations beginning in if this provision is not modified and if the partnership does not modify its operating structure prior to  the amount of cash available for distributions could be reduced materially 
impairment in march  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the provisions of the statement are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the partnership is not currently in a position to accurately assess the impact of this accounting pronouncement on its financial statements 
however  the future adoption of this pronouncement is not expected to have a material effect on the partnership s financial position or results of operations
