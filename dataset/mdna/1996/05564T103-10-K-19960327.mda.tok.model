item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for discussion of restaurant sales trends 
business strategy building upon the acquisition of its four apartment communities and btvc  the company intends to continue to acquire high quality apartment properties 
the company currently has no plans to add to or dispose of its restaurant properties and will not seek additional third party management contracts except as part of a plan to acquire additional properties 
the company believes that its strategy of combining the restaurant properties with increasing investment in apartment communities will provide for growth in ffo and enhance shareholder value 
the company will seek to acquire multi family properties located primarily in the states of north carolina  south carolina and virginia from unaffiliated third parties and as well as some or all of the affiliated properties it currently manages 
the company will also selectively consider opportunities for development of new apartment communities 
the company s management has developed apartment units and believes that its development experience will enable it to build additional apartment communities at such time as economic conditions and available capital make development attractive 
in evaluating potential properties for acquisition  the company will consider such factors as the current and anticipated cash flow of the property and its adequacy to meet operational needs and other obligations and to facilitate the company s ability to pay dividends  the geographic area and demographic profile  the location  construction quality  condition and design of the property generally properties will be or have the potential to become class a apartment communities  the potential for increasing cash flow by means of increasing rental rates and reducing operating expenses  the potential for capital appreciation  the growth  tax and regulatory environment of the community in which the property is located  occupancy and demand for the property  and prospects for eventual sale or refinancing 
generally  an apartment property will be acquired only where the operating history indicates that the property will contribute immediately to the cash flow of the company and there is a strong likelihood of increasing cash flow 
prior to acquiring its first apartment community  the company s capital requirements were minimal as all capital expenses related to the restaurants were borne by bne under the terms of the master lease 
in order to acquire paces commons  oakbrook  btvc  latitudes and harris hill  the company has incurred additional debt and issued additional common stock 
the additional debt consists of first mortgages secured by the acquired apartment communities and draws against the company s credit lines 
in order for the company to continue to acquire apartment properties  it is essential that it obtain additional equity capital 
the company is actively exploring available sources of equity capital 
it is likely that the company will incur additional long term debt as part of any apartment acquisitions 
while short term variable rate debt may be used to facilitate an acquisition  the preferred permanent financing will be long term  fixed rate  and self amortizing 
the company is committed to reducing its exposure to variable rate debt 
the company converted million and million of variable rate debt to fixed rates during and  respectively 
the company has elected and expects to be taxed as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
as such the company generally will not be subject to federal or state income taxes on net income 
reits are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that they currently distribute percent of their ordinary taxable income as dividends 
the company intends to pay dividends quarterly  expects that these dividends will substantially exceed the percent taxable income test  and anticipates that all dividends will be paid from current funds from operations 
in addition to the percent taxable income test  the company is subject to a non qualifying income test which requires that no more than percent of total revenue come from sources deemed to be non qualifying 
failure to comply with this requirement may result in the loss of the company s reit status 
revenue from third party property management contracts assumed at the acquisition of btvc in is considered to be non qualifying income 
as a result  the company  in  had non qualifying income of approximately percent of total revenue 
to ensure that non qualifying income does not exceed percent of its total revenue  in may the company transferred the third party management contracts to a newly formed unconsolidated management subsidiary  bnp management  inc  which is subject to federal and state income taxes 
this structure is currently being used by a number of other reits 
the company expects to meet its short term liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations and utilization of credit facilities 
the company believes that its net cash provided by operations will be adequate and anticipates that it will continue to be adequate to meet both operating requirements and payment of dividends by the company in accordance with reit requirements in both the short and the long term 
the company anticipates funding its acquisition activities  if any  primarily by using short term credit facilities or secured debt 
the company expects to meet certain of its long term liquidity requirements  such as scheduled debt maturities and repayment of short term financing of possible property acquisitions  through long term secured and unsecured borrowings and the issuance of debt securities or additional equity securities of the company 
the company believes that it has sufficient resources to meet its short and long term liquidity requirements

results of operations revenues 
the company s revenues come from two primary sources restaurant rental income and apartment rental income 
prior to the company s primary source of revenue was restaurant rental income 
in june  the company acquired paces commons apartments  which generated apartment rental income of million in seven months 
revenues in were million  an increase of percent over  primarily attributable to the impact of acquisitions of btvc property management operations and three apartment communities during oakbrook apartments june  latitudes apartments october  and harris hill apartments december and full year operations of paces commons apartments 
for the year  revenues increased percent to million  again primarily attributable to the impact of acquisitions of and continued improvements in operations at the company s four apartment communities 
apartment rental income accounts for percent of total revenues in compared to percent in and percent in  indicative of the company s focus on growth in apartment operations 
increases in revenues attributable to the company s apartment operations were offset somewhat by declines in restaurant rental income in and and the creation of a property management subsidiary in may revenues from company owned apartments increased percent and percent in and  respectively 
while this increase is primarily attributable to acquisitions  apartment operations reflect continued improvement 
occupancy remained consistently high at an average of approximately percent since the first apartment acquisition in mid average monthly revenue per occupied unit grew from in january to in december see discussion of apartment properties included in item of this report 
restaurant rental income payments are comprised of the greater of minimum or percentage rent based on food sales of restaurants under a single master lease 
until  restaurant rental income had remained generally consistent since the inception of the company in in  restaurant rental income increased by percent over  primarily attributable to the introduction by boddie noell enterprises  inc bne  the lessee  of fried chicken at the company s properties 
restaurant rental income subsequently declined by percent in and percent in the decline reflected the return to a more normal sales level following the increase occasioned by introduction of new products  while the decline was attributed primarily to closing of seven restaurants at various times during the year for remodeling 
the company continued to experience negative comparisons for restaurant rental income in  with an percent decline from same store restaurant sales for locations open for the full periods in both years declined by percent for the year 
the difference in trends for rental income and same store sales can be attributed to closings for scheduled remodeling all stores were open throughout 
widespread price discounting in the quick service restaurant industry and the lack of a strong hamburger product on the hardee s menu appear to be the principal reasons for the decline in restaurant sales volume and related rental income 
bne and hardee s food systems  the restaurant franchisor  are taking aggressive steps to improve restaurant sales 
this includes a new advertising campaign  introduction of several new food items  and a return to the charbroil cooking method for hamburger products 
while it is too early to judge the impact of these steps  management is cautiously optimistic that  by the end of  the company will begin to see improving restaurant sales 
effective december   the company and bne entered into a modified and restated master lease which increases the required minimum rent from million per year to million per year and extends the primary term from may to december the percentage rent remains set at percent of gross food sales 
the modified master lease effectively limits the impact of any further decline in restaurant sales to a maximum further decline of approximately  or percent  in restaurant rental income 
as part of the acquisition of btvc in october  the company received third party property management contracts for ten apartment communities and three shopping centers 
in may  the company established bnp management  inc the management company  a subsidiary in which the company owns a percent economic interest and a percent voting interest 
as of october   the company has transferred all third party management contracts to this subsidiary  and all third party management activities are now conducted by the management company 
on november   one of the managed apartment properties was sold  and the management contract was terminated 
in february  one of the managed shopping centers was sold  and that management contract was likewise terminated 
as the company expects to receive significantly all net income of the subsidiary  management does not expect the formation or operation of the management subsidiary to have a significant effect on the financial position or operating results of the company 
management fees totaled  in three months of and  in nine months of equity in the income of the management company totaled approximately  in the company accounts for its investment in the management company using the equity method of accounting  therefore  percent of the net income of the management company flows through to the company s financial statements as a single line item 
expenses 
for the years through  total expenses remained relatively constant at approximately million per year 
in  total expenses increased to million  primarily attributable to acquisition of paces commons 
for  total expenses were million  an increase of percent over  due to the inclusion of paces commons for the entire period and the acquisition of btvc and oakbrook  latitudes and harris hill apartments 
total expenses were million in  reflecting a full year s operations of all four apartment communities and administrative functions 
increases in depreciation and amortization over the three year period are directly attributable to the impact of acquisitions of apartment properties in and and an intangible asset recorded in conjunction with acquisition of management operations in october restaurant rental property million and related depreciation charges approximately  per year were unchanged throughout the three year period  while apartment rental property grew from none at the end of to over million by the end of  with related depreciation of approximately million 
amortization of the intangible related to management operations totaled  in and  in  the balance of amortization expense relates to loan costs 
operating expenses at the company s apartment properties were generally in line with management s expectations 
increases in apartment operations expenses of percent in and percent in reflect full year s operations of paces commons acquired june and acquisitions of oakbrook june  latitudes october  and harris hill december 
operating expenses relating to restaurant properties are insignificant because of the restaurant properties triple net lease arrangement 
increases in administrative expenses of percent in and percent in are due primarily to implementation of directors and officers insurance coverage effective october and assumption of management activities in october these costs declined in the last half of  during the last six months compared to  during the first six months  a trend that management expects will continue in  as expenses related to third party property management operations were transferred to the management company 
throughout and through third quarter of  the company paid property management fees percent of rental revenues collected to btvc for management of its apartment properties and advisory fees percent of net cash available for distribution as defined by the advisory agreement to bne advisory group 
with the acquisition of btvc  the company terminated its advisory contract and became self advised and self managed  thereby eliminating future property management and advisory fees 
increases in interest expense are primarily attributable to increases in outstanding indebtedness incurred in connection with acquisitions of paces commons in million and btvc s management operations  oakbrook  latitudes  and harris hill in million and the impact of higher variable interest rates in during fourth quarter of and second quarter of the company refinanced all variable rate debt related to apartment properties to fixed rate loans  and in december  the company refinanced its variable rate credit facility to a fixed rate loan 
see further discussion below included in discussion of liquidity and capital resources 
during the fourth quarters of   and  the company recorded write offs of   and  related to deferred acquisition costs 
significantly all of these costs arose in and in conjunction with the roll up transaction the company began in and ultimately abandoned in december all deferred costs related to the roll up transaction have now been expensed 
see discussion of history and development of boddie noell properties  inc included in item of this report 
summary results of operations 
funds from operations ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
in nareit provided additional guidance for interpretation of this definition which specifies that only depreciation and amortization of real estate assets should be added back to net income in calculating ffo 
at december   the company has adopted this interpretation and restated ffo amounts previously reported 
the company considers ffo in evaluating property acquisitions and its operating performance and believes that ffo should be considered along with  but not as an alternative to  net income and cash flows as a measure of the company s operating performance and liquidity 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
a reconciliation of net income  funds from operations  and net cash provided by operating activities is as follows all amounts in thousands net income    depreciation   amortization of management intangible write off deferred loan costs at refinancing write off deferred acquisition costs funds from operations    equity in income of management company amortization of deferred financing costs changes in operating assets and liabilities net cash provided by operating activities    to a large extent  the addition of apartment properties and improvement in apartment operations have offset the decline in restaurant rental income  producing increases in ffo of percent in and percent in as expected  net income declined percent in and percent in  reflecting the effect of non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of assets related to apartment property acquisitions in and changes in operating assets and liabilities reflect timing of rent receipts and payments for trade payables  taxes  and escrow funds  etc 
dividends 
the company paid dividends of per share in   and the company s dividend payout ratio the ratio of dividends paid to ffo on a per share basis was percent in  percent in  and percent in liquidity and capital resources capitalization 
prior to acquiring its first apartment community  the company s capital requirements were minimal as all capital expenses related to the restaurants were borne by bne under the terms of the master lease 
in order to acquire paces commons  oakbrook  btvc  latitudes and harris hill  the company incurred additional debt and issued additional common stock 
the additional debt consists of first mortgages secured by the acquired apartment communities and draws against the company s credit lines 
as the company continues to acquire apartment properties  it is likely that the company will incur additional long term debt and seek additional equity capital 
at december   the company s total book capitalization was million  comprised of million of shareholders equity and million of debt 
at december   the company s total book capitalization was million  comprised of million of shareholders equity and million of debt 
at december   the company had  shares of common stock outstanding 
on october   an additional  shares were issued in conjunction with the acquisition of btvc 
in march  april and july  the company issued a total of  shares of common stock to the former btvc shareholders in conjunction with an earn out provision of that acquisition agreement 
under the terms of the acquisition agreement  the former btvc shareholders are due additional consideration totaling  as of december  the company may  at its election  make this payment in cash or up to  shares of common stock 
at december   assuming the full contingent purchase price is earned and paid in common stock  it is anticipated that the company could issue approximately  additional shares of common stock in conjunction with the acquisition 
consistent with management s plan to reduce the company s exposure to variable rate debt  during fourth quarter of and second quarter of  the company refinanced million in variable rate debt related to apartment properties to fixed rate loans with maturities in through on december   the company established a credit line with southtrust bank of alabama in the amount of million at a fixed rate of percent for a term of three years 
the company used an initial draw of million to retire its existing short term variable rate credit facility 
the balance of the credit line will be available for general corporate purposes 
with the implementation of the new credit facility the company s only exposure to variable rate loans is two term notes payable to affiliates totaling  which are capped at an interest rate of percent and due in full may  as of december   the company has no loans which mature in less than three years or which are subject to material interest rate adjustments in less than two years 
a summary of long term debt as of december  and has been included in the notes to the financial statements included in item of this report 
at december   the weighted average interest rate on debt outstanding was percent 
a percent increase in variable interest rates would impact the company by increasing interest expense by approximately  on an annual basis  conversely  a percent decrease in variable interest rates would impact the company by decreasing interest expense by approximately  on an annual basis 
in addition to the credit facility  the company had an unsecured revolving line of credit of million with bne 
draws totaling million were made and repaid in full during in conjunction with modification of the master lease agreement  this line of credit was terminated in december cash flow and liquidity requirements 
for the years through  cash flow from operating activities was generally consistent  at approximately million in all years except  in which cash flow from operating activities was approximately million 
in each of those years the company utilized its cash flow principally to fund dividend payments 
during  the company generated million of net cash provided by operating activities  an increase of percent over the increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of paces commons apartments in june net cash provided by operating activities increased by percent to million in the increase was attributable to paces commons having been included for the entire period and cash flow from the properties acquired in btvc and oakbrook  latitudes and harris hill apartments which more than offset a  decrease in restaurant rental income 
in the company was able to maintain million in net cash provided by operating activities despite a  decline in restaurant rental income  again attributable to favorable performance of apartment properties 
the company applied cash generated by operating activities to pay dividends of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
dividends paid per share remained stable at 
as discussed above  during and the company issued  shares of common stock under the earn out provision of the btvc acquisition agreement 
also in the company applied  to advances to the management company subsidiary formed mid year 
during  the company applied million net proceeds of financing transactions to million in apartment acquisition activity 
in  the company applied million net proceeds of financing transactions to million of acquisition activity and additions to apartment properties 
payments for acquisition activities and additions to apartment properties totaled  in  with cash payments for debt reduction and financing costs exceeding net proceeds by  subsequent to december   the company entered into an agreement to purchase an additional apartment community 
the company has placed a  at risk binder in an escrow account held by a title insurance company 
the company is currently exploring various financing options 
the company has elected and expects to be taxed as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
as such the company generally will not be subject to federal or state income taxes on net income 
reits are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that they currently distribute percent of their ordinary taxable income as dividends 
the company intends to pay dividends quarterly  expects that these dividends will substantially exceed the percent taxable income test and anticipates that all dividends will be paid from current ffo 
the company continues to produce sufficient cash flow to fund its regular dividend and has positioned itself for future growth 
the company expects to meet its short term liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations and utilization of credit facilities 
the company believes that its net cash provided by operations will be adequate and anticipates that it will continue to be adequate to meet both operating requirements and payment of dividends by the company in accordance with reit requirements in both the short and the long term 
the company anticipates funding its acquisition activities  if any  primarily by using short term credit facilities or secured debt 
the company expects to meet certain of its long term liquidity requirements  such as scheduled debt maturities and repayment of short term financing of possible property acquisitions  through long term secured and unsecured borrowings and the issuance of debt securities or additional equity securities of the company 
the company believes that it has sufficient resources to meet its short and long term liquidity requirements 
approximately percent of the company s revenue was derived from bne s payment of rent for the use of the company s restaurant properties 
in addition  bne is responsible for all of the cost associated with the maintenance and operations of these properties 
as a result  the financial well being of the company is  to a large extent  dependent on bne s ability to meet its obligations under the terms of the master lease 
the ability of bne to satisfy the requirements of the master lease depend on its liquidity and capital resources 
historically  bne has been able to meet its liquidity needs through cash flow generated from operations and through reliance on its credit facility 
bne s principal line of business is the operation of approximately hardee s restaurants  of which are owned by the company 
the continued decline in restaurant sales see revenues above has had a material impact on bne s operating cash flow 
management has reviewed bne s unaudited financial statements  cash flow analysis  restaurant contribution analysis  sales trend analysis and projections and believes that with the refinance of its credit facility discussed below bne will have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet its obligations under the master lease and credit facility as well as its general corporate operating needs 
the principal debt facility on which bne has relied has been a million credit agreement 
this facility matured on december   but has been temporarily extended pending renewal 
bne has received and executed a commitment from the bank group issuing the facility specifying the terms and conditions of a renewal  and bne is currently assembling the required documentation 
both bne and representatives of the bank group have indicated that they expect the facility to be renewed and that a final closing of the renewal will occur in the near future
