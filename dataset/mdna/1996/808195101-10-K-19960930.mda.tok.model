item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s business is cyclical and seasonal and is influenced by many of the same national and regional economic and demographic factors that affect the united states housing market generally 
during fiscal  the company benefitted from continued strength in the manufactured housing industry which allowed us to produce record sales of million for fiscal  a increase from fiscal the driving force behind that increase was demand from the fastest growing segment of the population  retirees and empty nesters 
the baby boomers born during the years following world war ii are beginning to reach years of age  a time when people make major housing decisions 
in addition  multi unit housing starts remained weak during limited housing options  and our ability to offer superior quality and greater locational flexibility helped maintain strong demand throughout fiscal and will continue to do so in fiscal consolidated financial summary fiscal vs

results of operations and three year review net sales for fiscal were the highest in the company s history 
net sales for fiscal were million  which represented an increase of million over fiscal this increase was due to an increase in total sections sold during fiscal to  sections  a  section increase 
fiscal net sales of million increased million over fiscal this increase was due to two factors an increase in total sections sold during fiscal to  sections  an increase of sections  which contributed million of the increase  and a increase in the average selling price per section  which added million to net sales 
modular home sales accounted for million of fiscal net sales  this compares to million of fiscal net sales and million of fiscal sales 
the trend toward increased sales of multi section homes reversed  with these units representing of the homes sold during fiscal as compared to of the homes sold during fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in sales of multi section homes was due to the entry of a single section product in the texas market  which was particularly well received 
the company is uncertain whether the increased proportional sales of single section homes will continue because it is subject to regional preferences and economic conditions 
the cost of goods sold was million in fiscal  a increase over fiscal the cost of goods sold was million in fiscal  an increase over fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in the gross profit as a percentage of sales from fiscal to fiscal was directly due to decreased material costs as a result of a new centralized purchasing system 
this system enabled us to take advantage of quantity discounts on lumber and to take advantage of regional price differences to a greater extent than ever before 
the decrease in gross profit percentage of sales from fiscal to fiscal was directly attributable to increased labor costs 
the two main reasons for this increase in labor costs were costs related to the additional capacity added in the middle of fiscal to the navasota  texas facility requiring the addition of new employees  the largest group of new employees ever hired at one time  and labor costs related to the new facility in etna green  indiana  which was added in late fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were million  as compared to million in fiscal  a increase 
selling  general and administrative expenses represented of net sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the fiscal and fiscal increases in selling  general and administrative expenses were directly related to increased warranty costs 
the company made a decision in fiscal to decrease warranty response times 
due to this decrease in response time  warranty costs continued to be unusually high during fiscal operating income increased million to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal operating income as a percentage of net sales was for fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal pre tax income for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal net income for fiscal was million or per common share  compared to million or per common share for fiscal  and million or per common share for fiscal balance sheet review as of the end of fiscal  current assets increased to million from million a year earlier  a increase 
this million increase in current assets was primarily due to increases in cash and accounts receivable  related to our sales growth 
current liabilities were up million to million from million a year earlier  primarily due to a million increase in accrued liabilities which is related to our sales growth 
long term debt at the end of fiscal was million  down million from the prior year  as a result of debt repayments  including the elimination of all borrowings under the company s line of credit 
fiscal capital expenditures  net of retirements  totaled million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal fiscal and fiscal capital expenditures mainly related to our continued equipment replacement and improvement program 
the company added a third manufacturing plant in indiana in fiscal  and expanded the navasota  texas and plainville  kansas facilities 
shareholders equity totaled million  or per common share  at the end of fiscal compared to million  or per common share  at the end of fiscal outlook and risk factors the outlook for schult homes remains very positive 
it is evident from industry statistics that the upturn in the manufactured housing industry that began more than four years ago has maintained its momentum 
industry shipments during were up by following a increase in and a increase in  according to statistics published by the manufactured housing institute 
the manufactured housing institute also reported that industry shipments during the first six months of were up by 
management expects this trend of increased shipments to continue at least through fiscal to meet customer demand  we began a major expansion program in which was largely completed in fiscal this million investment added approximately million of production capability 
our annual sales capacity now stands at about million  which is more than twice the capacity existing in and more than greater than the million sales level achieved in fiscal management s outlook assumes only modest changes in interest rates and continued growth of the us economy 
although dealers orders can be canceled before production begins without penalty  and unfilled orders are not necessarily an indication of future business  the company s backlog of orders for manufactured homes was approximately million as of august   compared to approximately million  a increase from one year earlier 
this backlog represents approximately weeks of production time 
for the long term  industry growth will be affected by  among other factors  the availability and cost of financing  the relative cost of manufactured housing versus other forms of housing  including rental housing  general economic trends and changes in demographics including new household formations and the number of americans on fixed incomes 
while the company believes that long term demand for affordable manufactured housing will continue to grow due to favorable demographic trends and financing factors  changes in regional markets and the us economy as a whole will continue to affect overall housing industry cycles 
fiscal results were negatively impacted by increased warranty costs 
the combination of increased production of all drywall units and more new employees last year saw a corresponding increase in warranty costs 
the backlog of warranty work reached a high level during fiscal the company made it a priority to reduce that level during fiscal and fiscal and some progress has been registered 
the company expects these higher than historical warranty costs to continue to a lesser extent during fiscal liquidity and capital resources as of the end of fiscal  the company had working capital of million as compared to million at the end of fiscal and a negative million at the end of fiscal capital expenditures  net of retirements  amounted to million in fiscal the company has a bank commitment for an unsecured credit facility which provides for both revolving and term loans at the company s option 
the facility permits borrowings of up to an aggregate of the lower of million  or a borrowing base computed by applying certain factors to the value of the company s receivables and inventories 
as of the end of fiscal  the company had no borrowings under the bank commitment 
management believes that cash flow from operations  combined with funds under its unsecured credit facility  will be adequate to support its general operations  capital expenditure needs  required debt amortization  and the payment of a regular quarterly dividend 
management expects to continue to make regular quarterly dividend payments 
however  the payment of future cash dividends will depend upon the company s financial condition  capital requirements  results of operations and other factors deemed relevant by the company 
the company s preliminary fiscal capital expenditures are estimated at million  comprised of million for an expansion project at buckeye  arizona  million in normal equipment replacements and improvements  and million for a vehicle replacement program 
in fiscal  depreciation is expected to be approximately million 
we expect to fund our capital expenditures through normal operating profit
