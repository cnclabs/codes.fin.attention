during and  the company received orders for over of its model cz crystal growing system  which grows millimeter diameter silicon ingots 
increases in the production of capital equipment by oem s in the semiconductor industry has driven the demand for our component seals and sealing subsystems resulting in a increase in consolidated revenues from the components segment 
distributed products  which principally serves the thin film deposition industry  showed a modest revenue increase in total sales from the company s european operations  ap t  which includes the sale of the company s components and fluid products in europe  as well as comprising the distributed products segment  increased to  in as compared to  in fiscal sales by the company s japanese operation  fjc  totaled  up from  in during  fjc experienced a significant increase in its sales order activity for both components products and crystal growing systems 
total foreign sales increased over to  in from  in due primarily to the shipment of crystal growing systems to large scale wafer fabrication facilities in korea and taiwan 
bookings in increased to  from  in the prior year

order backlog at june  totaled  as compared to  at june  the company  in consultation with its primary customers  has rescheduled approximately one half of the shipments of crystal pullers initially scheduled for fiscal into fiscal however  the company also expects that these delays will be partially offset during fiscal by anticipated increases in shipments to four leading international silicon wafer manufacturers 
the major impact of the rescheduling is expected to occur in the first two quarters of fiscal there are certain factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements made above 
these include  but are not limited to  further rescheduling of existing crystal puller orders  additional crystal puller orders from existing or new customers  including those mentioned above  lack of new crystal puller orders from existing or new customers  increased revenues in the company s other business  and a material change in the market conditions within the semiconductor industry
