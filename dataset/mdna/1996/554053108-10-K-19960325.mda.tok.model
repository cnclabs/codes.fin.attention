the three principal types of construction services performed by the company are electric utility line construction  commercial and industrial electrical construction and mechanical construction 
myers  harlan and sturgeon are involved in the construction and maintenance of electric transmission lines  substations  distribution systems and lighting systems for electric utilities and industrial users of similar systems 
these services are frequently referred to as outside or line electrical construction service 
the company generally serves the electric utility industry as a prime construction contractor 
designs and specifications for a project are usually prepared by the clients or their agents 
the company supplies the management  labor  equipment and tools necessary to construct the project 
construction materials are generally supplied by the clients although the company occasionally may be required to procure and supply the construction materials 
most contracts undertaken by the company are completed within twelve months  although certain contracts may extend for longer periods 
the company  through sturgeon and harlan provide electric construction and maintenance services to the commercial and industrial marketplace and construction services to the telecommunication market 
these services are typically referred to as inside electrical construction 
the company s work in the commercial and industrial electric construction market place is most often performed as a subcontractor to a general contractor  however  the company does perform certain commercial and industrial construction services as a prime contractor 
commercial and industrial electrical maintenance services are frequently performed by the company as a prime contractor 
the company generally provides the materials to be installed as a part of the scope of these contracts which vary greatly in size and duration 
the company provides such construction services on many varied types of projects including airports  hospitals  hotels and casinos  arenas and convention centers  and manufacturing and process facilities 
on occasion  a subsidiary of the company will enter into a joint venture with another contractor to perform a specific project 
typically in these cases the subsidiary and the other contractor will share in the profits or losses on the project in the percentage determined by the joint venture agreement 
the joint venture agreement will define the obligations of the subsidiary and the other contractor with respect to the project and the management of the venture 
the company  through power piping  also provides mechanical construction and maintenance services for the steel industry  electric utility industry  chemical industry and other industrial customers located in the eastern half of the united states 
these services are provided by the company both as a prime contractor and as a subcontractor 
the company s construction and maintenance crews are active year round in all geographic areas in which the company operates 
winter weather in some northern areas and summer weather in some southern areas can adversely impact work schedules 
the company is subject to the authority of state and municipal regulatory bodies concerned with the licensing of contractors 
the company has experienced no material difficulty in complying with the requirements imposed on it by such regulatory bodies 
the company s operations are currently conducted exclusively in the united states 
customers electric utilities  in the aggregate  represent the largest customer base of the company 
during the last five years  the company s ten largest customers accounted for approximately of its consolidated contract revenues and its single largest customer accounted for approximately of such revenue 
as a result of the merger  the percentage of the company s consolidated revenues derived from the electric utility industry has been reduced from prior years 
general contractors  as a group  constitute a significant group of customers for the company s commercial and industrial work 
municipal or other government funded large projects provide the company with significant revenues when it is awarded all or a substantial part of the electrical construction work on such projects 
in the company s ten largest customers accounted for approximately of annual revenues 
the company s single largest customer during was detroit edison company  an electrical utility in michigan  accounting for approximately of such revenue 
contracts the company enters into contracts principally on the basis of competitive bids 
although there is considerable variation in the terms of the contracts undertaken by the company  they will usually be either lump sum or unit price contracts pursuant to which the company agrees to do the work for a fixed amount for the entire project or for the particular units of work performed 
on occasion  the company does obtain cost plus contracts which provide for reimbursement of costs incurred by the company  often within stated limits  plus the payment of a fee in a fixed amount or equal to a percentage of reimbursable cost 
on occasion these cost plus contracts require the company to include a guaranteed not to exceed maximum price 
lump sum or unit price contracts have accounted for the larger portion of the company s contract revenues in recent years 
such contracts typically place greater risks on the company than do contracts of the cost plus type 
a portion of the work performed by the company requires performance and payment bonds at the time of execution of the contract 
contracts generally include payment provisions pursuant to which a to retainage is withheld from each progress payment until the contract work has been completed 
the company s backlog was  at december   compared to  at december  the varying magnitude and duration of projects undertaken by the company may result in substantial fluctuations in its backlog from time to time

revenue on such construction contracts is recorded on the percentage of completion accounting method determined by the ratio of cost incurred to date on the contracts to management s estimates of total contract costs 
projected losses are provided for in their entirety without reference to percentage of completion 
some projects give rise to claims by the company against its customers for additional compensation based upon such matters as scheduling changes  delays and interruptions or improper or revised specifications 
the resolution of such claims often extends over several years 
management s judgment as to the possible outcome of such claims pending at the end of a financial reporting period is reflected in the company s results of operations for such period and is revised in subsequent periods if and as required by developments with respect to such claims see note to the financial statements 
competition the company s business is highly competitive 
competition is primarily based on the price of the construction services rendered and upon the reputation for quality and reliability of the contractor rendering them 
the competition encountered by the company varies depending upon the type of construction services which it renders 
the construction and maintenance service provided to electric utilities and industrial owners of similar systems often requires larger amounts of capital and more specialized equipment than the requirements for commercial construction 
larger electric utility projects require increased numbers of heavy duty equipment as well as stronger financial resources to meet the cash flow requirements of these projects 
these factors reduces the number of potential competitors on these projects to the larger competitors 
the number of firms which generally compete for any electric utility project varies greatly depending on a number of factors including  the size of the project  its location and the bidder qualification requirements imposed upon contractors by the customer 
many of the competitors the company encounters restrict their operations to one geographic area while a few operate nationally  as does the company 
competition for the electrical construction services provided by the company to the commercial and industrial customers varies greatly 
again  size and location of the project will impact which competitors and the number of competitors the company will encounter on any particular project 
the individual relationships with general contractors developed over several years by particular contractors based upon prior projects worked together will impact the company s and its competitors opportunities to bid on certain projects 
the equipment requirements for this type of work are not as significant as for the electric utility construction 
since commercial construction typically involves the purchase of materials by the contractor the financial resources to meet these requirements on particular projects may impact the competition the company encounters 
the company has principally performed such construction services in the western half of the united states 
certain of the company s competitors for this type of work operate nationally  however  the preponderance of the company s competition operates regionally 
the company s mechanical construction and maintenance service have been performed principally in the eastern half of the united states 
the company s competitors for this type of work operate regionally 
the company s competition includes entities which operate solely as union contractors  solely as non union contractors  or in certain cases  through related companies having both union and non union contractors 
in essentially all cases involving maintenance services provided by the company  the company s customers will also perform some or all of these types of services as well
