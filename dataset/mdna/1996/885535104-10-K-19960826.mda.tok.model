in addition  there are trends and factors beyond the company s control which affect its operations 
in accordance with the provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  the cautionary statements set forth below identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward looking statements which may be contained in this report 
such trends and factors include  but are not limited to  adverse changes in general economic conditions or conditions in the specific markets for the company s products  governmental regulation or intervention affecting communications or data networking  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  and other factors  including those listed below 
the company participates in a highly volatile and rapidly growing industry which is characterized by vigorous competition for market share 
this could result in aggressive pricing practices  growing competition both from start up companies and from well capitalized computer systems and communications companies  and rapid technological development carried out amidst uncertainty over adoption of industry standards and protection of proprietary intellectual property rights 
the company s ability to compete in this environment depends upon a number of competitive and market factors and is subject to the risks set forth in this report 
the market for the company s products is characterized by rapidly changing technology 
the company s success depends  in substantial part  on the timely and successful introduction of new products 
an unexpected change in one or more of the technologies affecting data networking or in market demand for products based on a particular technology could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results if the company does not respond timely and effectively to such changes 
the company is engaged in research and development activities in certain emerging lan and wan highspeed technologies  such as atm  isdn  fast ethernet  gigabit ethernet and data over cable 
as the industry standardizes on high speed technologies  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to respond promptly and cost effectively to compete in the marketplace 
some key components of the company s products are currently available only from single sources 
there can be no assurance that in the future the company s suppliers will be able to meet the company s demand for components in a timely and cost effective manner 
the company s operating results and customer relationships could be adversely affected by either an increase in prices for  or an interruption or reduction in supply of  any key components 
the company distributes a significant portion of its products through third party distributors and resellers 
due to the consolidation in the distribution and reseller channels and the company s increased volume of sales into these channels  the company has experienced an increased concentration of credit risk 
while the company continuously monitors and manages this risk  financial difficulties on the part of one or more of the company s resellers may have a material adverse effect on the company 
likewise  the company s expansion into certain emerging geographic markets  characterized by economic and political instability and currency fluctuations  may subject the company s resellers to financial difficulties which may have an adverse impact on the company 
the company will continue to invest during fiscal in expanding its sales  marketing  service  logistics and manufacturing operations worldwide 
the achievement of continued sales and earnings growth will depend upon the success ful implementation of several projects  including the continued expansion of the company s direct sales force and the establishment of a new manufacturing and distribution facility in the asia pacific region 
acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies  including technologies and products under development  are an active part of the company s overall business strategy 
certain of the company s major competitors have also been engaged in merger and acquisition transactions 
such consolidations by competitors are likely to create entities with increased market share  customer base  technology and marketing expertise  sales force size  or proprietary technology in segments in which the company competes  which may adversely affect the company s ability to compete in such segments 
in fiscal  the company consummated acquisitions of axon  chipcom and primary access 
there can be no assurance that products  technologies  distribution channels  key personnel and businesses of acquired companies will be effectively assimilated into the company s business or product offerings  or that such integration will not adversely affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the difficulties of such integration may be increased by the size and number of such acquisitions and the requirements of coordinating geographically separated organizations 
there can be no assurance that any acquired products  technologies or businesses will contribute at anticipated levels to the company s sales or earnings  that the sales and earnings from acquired businesses will not be adversely affected by the integration process or other general factors 
the acquisition of chipcom is the largest acquisition the company has undertaken  and the factors identified above are therefore more significant to the company s business following the chipcom acquisition than for prior transactions 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be able to identify and consummate suitable acquisition transactions in the future 
the company s business is characterized by the continuous introduction of new products and the management of the transition of those products from prior generations of technology or product platforms 
in each product transition cycle  the company faces the challenge of managing the inventory of its older products  including materials  work in process  and products held by resellers 
if com is not successful in managing these transitions  there could be an adverse impact on the financial results of the company 
the company s products are covered by product warranties and the company may be subject to contractual commitments concerning product features or performance 
if unexpected circumstances arise such that the product does not perform as intended and the company is not successful in resolving product quality or performance issues  there could be an adverse impact on sales and earnings 
the market price of the company s common stock has been  and may continue to be  extremely volatile 
factors such as new product announcements by the company or its competitors  quarterly fluctuations in the company s operating results  challenges associated with integration of businesses and general conditions in the data networking market may have a significant impact on the market price of the company s common stock 
these conditions  as well as factors which generally affect the market for stocks of high technology companies  could cause the price of the company s stock to fluctuate substantially over short periods 
notwithstanding the company s increased geographical diversification  the company s corporate headquarters and a large portion of its research and development activities and other critical business operations are located near major earthquake faults 
the company s business  financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake 
because of the foregoing factors  as well as other factors affecting the company s operating results  past trends and performance should not be presumed by investors to be an accurate indicator of future results or trends

the company commenced occupancy of the facility in the first quarter of fiscal  and payments on the lease started in the second quarter of fiscal the company amended the lease agreement on february  to add  square feet of office and manufacturing space and a parking garage phase ii to be built on adjacent land 
the amended lease expires in five years and provides the company with an option to purchase both phase i and ii properties or arrange for the sale of the properties to a third party with a guaranteed residual value of up to million to the seller of the property

the company is required to adopt sfas for the fiscal year beginning june  this statement establishes accounting and disclosure requirements using a fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation plans 
under sfas the company may either adopt the new fair value based accounting method or continue the intrinsic value based method and provide pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if the accounting provisions of this statement had been adopted 
the company plans to adopt only the disclosure requirements of sfas  therefore such adoption will have no effect on the company s financial position or results of operations
