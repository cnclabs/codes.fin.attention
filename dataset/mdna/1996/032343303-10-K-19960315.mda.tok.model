item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company specializes in the sale of deferred annuity products as a retirement savings vehicle for individuals 
during each of the past three years  sales of deferred annuities have accounted for at least of the company s premiums received  while sales of spias and fpuls have accounted for virtually all remaining premiums received 
the company s operating earnings are derived primarily from its investment results  including realized gains losses  less interest credited to annuity contracts and expenses 
under gaap  premiums received on deferred annuities  spias without life contingencies and fpuls are not recognized as revenue at the time of sale 
similarly  policy acquisition costs principally commissions related to such sales are not recognized as expenses but are capitalized as deferred acquisition costs  or dac 
as a result of this deferral of costs and the lack of revenue recognition for premiums received  no profit or loss is realized on these contracts at the time of sale 
premiums received on deferred annuities  spias without life contingencies and fpuls are reflected on the company s balance sheet by an increase in assets equal to the premiums received and by a corresponding increase in future policy liabilities 
the company s earnings depend  in significant part  upon the persistency of its annuities 
over the life of the annuity  net investment income  net investment gains and policy charges are realized as revenue  and dac is amortized as an expense 
the timing of dacamortization is based on the projected realization of profits including realized gains losses for each type of annuity contract and is periodically adjusted for actual experience 
if a policy is terminated prior to its expected maturity  any remaining related dac is expensed in the current period 
most of american s annuity policies in force have surrender charges which are designed to discourage and mitigate the effect of premature withdrawals 
as a result  the impact on earnings from surrenders will depend upon the extent to which available surrender charges offset the associated amortization of dac 
for the years ended  and  the company s weighted average expected surrender levels were  and  compared to the weighted average actual surrenders of  and 
historically the negative impact on earnings of any difference between the actual surrender levels and expected surrender levels has been more than offset by the realization of gains on the sale of securities and the change in future expected gross profits as the result of the company s reduction in credited rates 
recent periods of low interest rates have reduced the company s investment yields 
as a result of the lower investment yields  the company elected to reduce credited interest rates on certain of its annuity products 
certain annuities issued by the company include a bailout feature 
this feature generally allows policyowners to withdraw their entire account balance without surrender charge for a period of to days following the initial determination of a renewal crediting rate below a predetermined level 
if a policyowner elects not to withdraw funds during this period  surrender charges are reinstated 
on policies including a bailout feature  the company announces its renewal crediting rates on january of each year 
in january and  the company deemed it advisable  due to the general decline in interest rates and the yield on its investment portfolio  to reduce credited interest rates on certain annuity contracts below the bailout level 
the aggregate account values of annuity contracts on which the crediting rate was reduced below the bailout level totalled million and million during and  respectively 
as a result  million  or  and million  or  of such policies were surrendered during and  respectively 
the company was able to offset the negative impact of bailout surrenders on its earnings through the realization of gains on the sale of its securities 
excluding surrenders from bailout products  american s annuity withdrawal rates were for  and for although  as of december   approximately million  or of annuity account values contained a bailout provision  the current credited rates on these policies are above the bailout rate 
the bailout rate on million of this amount is or less 
if the company reduces credited rate below the bailout rates on policies containing bailout provisions in the future  it intends to pay any resulting surrenders from cash provided by operations and premiums received 
in the event such sources are not sufficient to pay surrenders  the company would have to sell securities at the then current market prices 
american expects that withdrawals on its annuity contracts will increase as such contracts approach maturity 
the company may not be able to realize investment gains in the future to offset the adverse impact on earnings  should future bailout surrenders were to occur 
margin analysis the company s earnings are impacted by realized investment gains and losses and by the associated amortization of dac 
the actual timing and pattern of such amortization is determined by the actual profitability to date which includes realized investment gains and losses and the expected future profitability on a particular annuity contract 
to the extent investment income is accelerated through realization of investment gains  the corresponding amortization of dac is also accelerated as the stream of profitability on the underlying annuities is effectively accelerated 
when investment losses are realized  the corresponding amortization of dac is reduced as stream of profitability on the underlying annuities is effectively reduced

net investment income is presented net of investment expense 
results of operations years ended december   and insurance premiums and policy charges increased million or  to million from million in  due to an increase in surrender charges assessed on the surrender of annuity policies 
this follows a decrease of 
million or  to million in from million in this decrease reflects a 
million decrease in spia sales which was partially offset by a 
million increase in surrender charges assessed on the surrender of annuity policies 
surrender benefits increased million to million in from million in the amount of million represents a decrease of million from million in the increase in surrenders realized in reflects both the increased number of policies no longer covered by a surrender charge and the returns available on alternative investments as annuity rates decline 
the decrease realized in reflects the reduction in surrenders from bailout products to million in from million in net investment income increased million  or  to million from million in this increase resulted from both an increase in average invested assets from  million in to  million in and an increase in the average yield on invested assets from in to in net investment income increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase resulted from an increase in average invested assets from  million in to  million in  offset in part by a reduction in the average yield on invested assets from in to in the yield was impacted by losses generated by an investment in investment partnerships 
these partnerships form a fund of funds totalling million on december   which is structured in an attempt to consistently provide returns in excess of the standard poor s s p over time without regard to the general direction of financial markets 
this fund genera ted income of million in compared with a loss of million in and income of million in net trading losses of 
million in primarily result from a program designed to create capital losses for tax purposes which can be carried back against capital gains realized in to accomplish this  the company utilized a preferred stock dividend roll program  buying the stock at prices which included the dividend  collecting the dividend and then selling the stock at prices excluding the dividend 
the net effect of this program was to generate dividend income of million  included in net investment income  and capital losses of million 
the company had no trading activity in either or net investment gains increased 
million  or  to million in from 
million in this follows a decrease of million  or  to 
million in from million in the gain reflects the release of the allowance for credit losses that was first established in the release of this reserve increased investment gains by million 
gains and losses may be realized upon securities which are disposed of for various reasons 
the gains realized in are the result of general portfolio management while those taken in were to reduce the effects of the statutory losses resulting from surrenders following the reduction of interest crediting rates on certain annuity policies below the bailout rate 
the decision to realize gains or losses lies to a great degree in management s discretion 
unrealized gains losses in the company s bond portfolio were million  million and million as of december   and respectively 
other revenue increased 
million  or  to million in from 
million in this increase resulted from a gain of 
million recognized on the sale of omni tech medical inc  and a 
million increase in omni tech sales 
other revenue increased 
million to 
million in from 
million in this increase is due to an increase in omni tech sales 
benefits  claims and interest credited to policyholders increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase results primarily from an increase in the average interest rate credited on the company s annuity liabilities  from as of december  to as of december   along with an increase in annuity liabilities to  million on december  from  million on december  in  this expense decreased million  to million from million in this decrease resulted primarily from a reduction in the average interest rate credited on annuity liabilities  from as of december  to as of december  this decrease was partially offset by an increase in annuity liabilities to  million on december  from  million on december  amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs increased million  or  to million in from million in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs dac associated with gross interest margin increased million to million in from million in amortization of dacassociated with investment gains was unchanged at an expense of 
million on gains of million in and an expense of 
million on gains of 
million in the increase in amortization associated with gross interest margin reflects the increased surrenders realized during amortization of dacdecreased 
million  to million in from million in amortization of dac associated with gross interest margins increased million  to million in  from million in amortization of dacassociated with investment gains decreased million  to 
million in  from million in the amortization amounts reflect the lowering of interest crediting rates and the resulting increase in the estimates of future expected gross profits and the realization of million of investment gains 
acquisition costs incurred in and deferred into future policy periods were million  compared with million in and million in general insurance expenses increased 
million  or  to million in from million in management believes this increase can be attributed to increases in business activity and assets under management 
this follows a decrease of million to million in from million in this decrease is primarily attributable to the deferral of additional expenses related to the acquisition of annuity contracts in premium and other taxes  licenses and fees increased 
million  or  to million in from million in following a decrease of million in from million in the above amounts include charges of approximately million  
million and million for the years  and  respectively  for nonrecoverable guaranty fund assessments resulting from the significant number of insolvencies that have occurred in recent years 
interest expense increased 
million in as a result of million of borrowing under the company s credit agreement 
the proceeds of this borrowing were contributed to the surplus of american 
interest expense decreased million in following the repayment of all debt in november   with proceeds from the company s common stock offering 
income tax expense increased million to million in from million in this follows a million decrease in from million in taxes were provided at an effective rate of  and in  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources the company is an insurance holding company whose principal asset is the common stock of american 
the company s primary cash requirements are to pay operating expenses 
as a holding company  the company relies on funds received from american to meet its cash requirements at the holding company level 
the company receives funds from american in the form of commissions paid to american sales  fees paid to aig  rent  administrative  printing and data processing charges and dividends 
the insurance laws of kansas generally limit the ability of american to pay cash dividends in excess of certain amounts without prior regulatory approval and also require that certain agreements relating to the payment of fees and charges to the company by american be approved by the kansas insurance commissioner 
the liquidity requirements of american are met by premiums received from annuity sales  net investment income received  and proceeds from investments upon maturity  sale or redemption 
the primary uses of funds by american are the payment of surrenders  policy benefits  operating expenses and commissions  as well as the purchase of assets for investment 
for purposes of the company s consolidated statements of cash flows  financing activities include premiums received from sales of deferred annuities  surrenders and death benefits paid  and surrender and policy charges collected on these contracts 
the net cash provided by used in these particular financing activities for the years ended december   and  was million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in net cash provided by annuity contracts without life contingencies in resulted primarily from a million increase in surrender and death benefits paid from million approximately of beginning reserves for future policy benefits to million approximately of beginning reserves for future policy benefits along with a million increase in premiums received from million to million 
the increase in net cash provided by annuity contracts without life contingencies in resulted primarily from a million decrease in surrender and death benefits paid from million approximately of beginning reserves for future policy benefits to million  approximately of beginning reserves for future policy benefits along with a million increase in premiums received from million to million 
net cash provided by the company s operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cash provided by financing and operating activities and by the sale and maturity of portfolio investments is used primarily to purchase portfolio investments and for the payment of acquisition costs commissions and expenses associated with the sale and issuance of policies 
to meet its anticipated liquidity requirements  the company purchases investments taking into account the anticipated future cash flow requirements of its underlying liabilities 
in addition  the company invests a portion of its assets in short term investments and maturities of less than one year  and as of december   and  respectively 
the weighted average duration of the company s bond portfolio was years as of december  the company continually assesses its capital requirements in light of business developments and various capital and surplus adequacy ratios which affect insurance companies 
the company has met its capital needs and those of american through several different sources including bank borrowing and the sale of both preferred and common stock 
on december   the company issued  shares of its series b convertible preferred stock with a total stated value of million 
the preferred stock was convertible at per share into  shares of the company s common stock 
on december   the company issued and sold  shares of common stock at per share to the company s leveraged employee stock ownership plan lesop 
this purchase was financed with the proceeds of a million loan from american 
for additional information regarding the lesop  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in  the company raised million through the sale of  shares of common stock 
in december   the company entered into a credit agreement with the first national bank of chicago and boatmen s first national bank of kansas city  as lenders 
under the terms of this agreement  the lenders have committed to lend up to  in the form of a year reducing credit facility  of which  had been borrowed at december  for additional information regarding this credit agreement  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of december   the company owned bonds of issuers in amounts exceeding of stockholders equity 
the carrying value of such bonds was million which represented of the company s invested assets 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
a default by any one of these issuers could materially adversely affect the results of operations and financial condition of the company 
recent regulatory actions against certain large life insurers encountering financial difficulty have prompted the various state guaranty associations to begin assessing life insurance companies for the resulting losses 
for further information regarding the effects of guaranty fund assessments  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
reinsurance 
the company had amounts receivable under reinsurance agreements of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
of the amounts  million and million  respectively  were associated with a single insurer  erc 
in  the company entered into a coinsurance agreement which ceded of the risk on the company s block of spwl written prior to to erc 
the agreement provides that erc assumes of all risks associated with each policy in the block 
under the terms of the contract the company continues to administer the policies and is reimbursed for all payments made under the terms of those policies 
additionally  the company receives a fee from the reinsurer for administering such policies 
cash settlements under the contract are made with erc on a monthly basis 
if erc were to become insolvent  american would remain responsible for the payment of all policy liabilities 
in addition  the company is a party to two assumption reinsurance agreements with other reinsurers 
see item c l business done and intended to be done other insurance products 
effect of inflation and changes in interest rates 
the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its consolidated results of operations during the past three years 
the company seeks to manage its investment portfolio in part to reduce its exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
in general  the market value of the company s fixed income securities increases or decreases directly with interest rate changes 
for example  if interest rates decline as was the case in and  the company s fixed income investments generally will increase in market value  while net investment income will decrease 
conversely  if interest rates rise as was the case in  fixed income investments generally will decrease in market value  while net investment income will increase 
in a rising interest rate environment  such as that experienced in  the company s average cost of funds would increase over time as it prices its new and renewing annuities to maintain a generally competitive market rate 
during such a rise in interest rates  new funds would be invested in bonds with higher yields than the liabilities assumed 
in a declining interest rate environment  the company s cost of funds would decrease over time  reflecting lower interest crediting rates on its fixed annuities 
in addition to the increase in the company s average cost of funds caused by a rising interest rate environment  surrenders of annuities that are no longer protected by surrender charges increase 
while the company experienced a decrease in total surrenders during  the decrease was primarily due to the large number of bailout surrenders in throughout  the company saw an increase in surrenders of policies which no longer were covered by surrender charges 
management believes the increased surrenders experienced in were due to the increasing interest rates throughout this trend has continued into management believes that surrenders are lower during periods of declining interest rates 
bond portfolio restructuring 
during  the quoted market values of many non investment grade bonds substantially decreased 
in response to this decrease  the company substantially increased the allowance for credit losses during the third quarter of that year  and completed a significant restructuring of its bond portfolio during during  and  the company disposed of bonds with book values of  and million for net gains losses of  
and million  respectively 
in  the company reduced credited interest rates below the bailout rates on certain annuity policies and the related surrenders experienced during the bailout period resulted in losses on a statutory basis 
the company sold securities at gains to restore the statutory surplus lost

in managing the relationship between its assets and liabilities  the company utilizes models which determine the cash flows necessary to meet the expected cash needs on the underlying liabilities under various interest rate scenarios 
the company also utilizes these models to determine the dollar value of securities that would need to be sold under each interest rate scenario so as to determine what portion of its investment portfolio needs to be carried on its balance sheet as available for sale 
in addition  certain conditions specific to an individual security such as deterioration in credit quality may result in a security being carried as available for sale

 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the book value  estimated market value  unrealized gains  and unrealized losses in non investment grade bonds owned as of december   and december   were million and million  respectively  million and million  respectively  million and 
million  respectively  and million and million  respectively 
the market values of corporate debt securities rated below investment grade and comparable unrated securities tend to be more sensitive to issuer specific developments and changes in economic conditions than higher rated securities 
issuers of these securities are often highly leveraged  so that their ability to service their debt obligations during an economic downturn or during sustained periods of rising interest rates may be impaired 
in addition  such issuers may not have other methods of financing available to them  and may be unable to repay debt at maturity by refinancing 
the risk of loss due to default in payment of interest or principal by such issuers is significantly greater than with investment grade issuers for the previously mentioned reasons and because such securities frequently are subordinated to the prior payment of senior indebtedness 
as of december   the carrying value of the company s five largest investments in securities rated non investment grade by both standard poor s corporation s p and moody s investors service  inc moody s aggregated million  with an approximate market value of million  none of which individually exceed million
