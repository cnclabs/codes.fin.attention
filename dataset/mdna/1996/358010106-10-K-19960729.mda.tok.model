item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the table below sets forth for the fiscal years ended april the percentage of consolidated net sales represented by certain items in the company s consolidated statements of operations net sales us government commercial cost of sales selling and administrative expenses research and development expenses operating income loss other income expense net provision benefit for income taxes income loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net income loss operating income operating income for the year ended april   improved by million over the year ended april  and by million over fiscal year this result was achieved through increased sales to non us government contract customers coupled with significant improvement in gross margins due to cost cutting efforts and the conclusion of certain unprofitable contracts initiated by the company s former west coast operations 
reduced selling and administrative expenses and more focused research and development costs  as discussed below  further enhanced the operating results for the current fiscal year 
net sales net sales in fiscal increased by over million over fiscal but were lower than fiscal by million 
as illustrated in the table above  commercial sales have become a much more significant portion of the company s business 
sales to such customers for the fiscal year ended april  increased by million over fiscal and by million over fiscal sales to non us government contract customers are expected to become the dominant source of revenues in subsequent fiscal years 
the company will continue to engage in contracts for which the end user is the us government but such sales are not expected to increase significantly in absolute sales dollars due mainly to the overall decline in us government principally dod and nasa spending 
sales in fiscal were higher than in both and as a result of the completion of two significant programs that year which were effectively not replaced in subsequent periods 
on one of these projects  the customer decided not to exercise certain contract options 
also  as noted above  reductions in dod and nasa programs have had a negative impact on revenues 
included in fiscal commercial sales is approximately million of revenues related to parts procurement and screening services on behalf of the globalstar satellite program 
the company expects to recognize an additional million in incentive revenues in fiscal and intends to actively promote its procurement services on other satellite programs 
fiscal commercial revenues also benefited from a combined million increase in sales of the company s commercial rubidium product line and the trw mimic mmic product lines  sales of which were not significant in fiscal sales of these product lines are expected to continue to grow  particularly for commercial rubidium  as the company further advances its products into the marketplace 
gross margins gross margins for the fiscal year ended april   showed continued improvement over fiscal years and  increasing to from and  respectively 
these results have been obtained through meaningful cost reductions primarily in the areas of personnel and compensation coupled with operational efficiencies and product mix 
fiscal gross margins were negatively impacted by higher than anticipated technical development costs incurred during the engineering  design  and production stages of certain projects 
the impact of these items was greatly reduced in fiscal and in addition  fiscal years and incurred costs associated with the restructuring and consolidation of the company s former west coast facility 
the assets and activities of that entity were relocated to the company s headquarters location during fiscal gross margin in fiscal was negatively impacted by the establishment of reserves for certain slow moving or obsolete inventory items and accruals for employee bonuses 
without these charges to earnings  the gross margin would have been approximately 
while the company cannot reasonably predict the need for future inventory reserves or the possibility of cost overruns on existing or future contracts  the company anticipates that future gross margins will be comparable to that experienced during fiscal selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative costs declined by million or for the year ended april   over fiscal and by million or over fiscal the principal cause of these decreases was a reduced level of activity in related to the company s defense of the ongoing litigation with the government and related actions 
related legal fees were million less in than in and million less than in offsetting such reduced legal expenses in fiscal  was the increased provision for certain uncollectible accounts receivable and accrued officers and employee bonuses 
bad debt expense for fiscal was approximately  compared to nominal bad debt expense in fiscal years and without regard to bad debt expenses  bonuses and the legal fees related to the government litigation  selling and administrative costs in fiscal were  lower than in and  lower than in this result was achieved through a reduction in the number of personnel  reduced insurance costs and improved operating efficiencies 
as sales increase  the ratio of selling and administrative expenses  excluding legal costs  to net sales is expected to decrease 
the company is unable to predict the future level of legal costs for any specific period as this is dependent on factors outside of its immediate control 
research and development expenses company funded research and development costs in the year ended april   decreased by  and  from the levels of spending in fiscal and  respectively 
the decreases in company funded costs are the result of an effort to focus research and development activities on a narrower band of commercial projects which will provide the best return on investment 
research and development spending in fiscal was higher than in principally due to an intense effort to develop the two vsat product lines 
in fiscal  spending on these product lines continued but at a lower level as development of one line was completed and development on the other line is nearing the preproduction stage 
for fiscal  the company expects to continue to invest in research and development at approximately the same rate as it did for fiscal other income and expense for the year ended april   other income expense net decreased by  from fiscal and increased by  over fiscal during fiscal year  the company realized a gain of approximately million on the sale of certain marketable securities 
excluding that one time gain  other income expense net were significantly improved over both the fiscal and results 
in particular  interest income increased by  and  over fiscal and  respectively  as the result of both higher interest rates and a notable increase in interest earning assets in fiscal interest income in fiscal included interest earned on federal income tax refunds which did not recur to the same extent in fiscal or excluding such interest  interest income in fiscal and increased by and  respectively  over the comparable levels 
on the other hand  interest expense in fiscal decreased by  and  respectively  from fiscal and levels 
this was the result of declining long term debt balances as the company makes scheduled principal payments  offset by increased interest rates during although the company is unable to predict the future levels of interest rates  at current rates the company anticipates that interest income will continue to increase and interest expense will continue to decrease when compared to earlier fiscal years 
other income  net  which consists principally of rental income under the long term direct finance lease with lab corporation of america  should continue at moderately increasing levels over the year term of the lease 
as noted above  in fiscal  the company also realized a one time gain on the sale of certain marketable securities which was recorded in this line item of the statement of operations 
liquidity and capital resources the company s balance sheet continues to reflect a strong working capital position of million and million at april  and  respectively 
included in working capital at april  is million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments which are readily convertible to cash should the need arise 
the company s current ratio at april  is to compared to a to ratio at april  the decline in the current ratio is due principally to an increase in trade accounts payable as a consequence of the parts procurement and screening services for the globalstar satellite program and to the accrual of certain year end incentive bonuses as the result of the profitable year experienced by the company 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended april   was almost million compared to million for fiscal this significant increase in cash inflow is the result of the return to profitability in with net income of million  certain noncash charges of an additional million and the net change in assets and liabilities of million 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended april   was million 
of this amount  million was provided by the conversion of certain us government and agency securities to short term money market investments 
the company may continue to convert short term investments to cash equivalents or invest cash equivalents in longer term securities as dictated by its investment strategies 
an additional  was received upon the sale of the building owned by the company s former west coast operation 
in addition to cash  the company received a promissory note in the amount of million for the balance of the sale price 
the promissory note for the building sale will be repaid in monthly installments over a period of years with a balloon payment at the end 
during fiscal  the company acquired new computer software to manage its financial and operational systems 
installation of the software will occur in the early part of fiscal the total capitalized cost of the software and installation costs is expected to be less than  the company has no other material commitments for capital expenditures 
total fixed asset purchases in fiscal approximated  including the capitalized software costs 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended april   was million compared to million in fiscal of this amount   was used to make regularly scheduled long term debt payments and  was used to acquire  shares of common stock to be held in treasury 
the company may continue to purchase shares for its treasury whenever appropriate opportunities arise but it has neither a formal repurchase plan nor commitments to purchase additional shares in the future 
the company will continue to expend its resources and efforts to develop hardware for commercial satellite programs and commercial ground communication and navigation systems which management believes will result in future growth and continued profitability 
internally generated cash will be adequate to fund development efforts in these markets 
at april   the company s backlog amounted to approximately million of which approximately million is funded 
this is compared to the approximately million backlog at april  the april   backlog consists of approximately million for commercial and foreign customers and million for us government contracts
