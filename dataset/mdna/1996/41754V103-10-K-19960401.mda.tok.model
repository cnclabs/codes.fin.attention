international operations the company s costs of operations in venezuela and russia in  and include certain fixed or minimum office  administrative  legal and personnel related costs and certain start up costs  including short term facilities rentals  organizational costs  contract services and consultants 
such costs are expected to grow over time as operations increase 
in the last two years such costs have become less significant on a unit of production basis  but such costs can be expected to fluctuate in the future based upon a number of factors 
in venezuela  for the year ended december   the operating costs and general and administrative expenses were and per bbl  respectively 
for the year ended december  the operating costs and general and administrative expenses for venezuela decreased to and per bbl  respectively 
the company s venezuelan operations grew considerably during and  and are expected to continue to grow  and its operating costs and general and administrative expenses are expected to increase both in the aggregate and on a per unit basis 
in russia  for the year ended december   the operating costs and general and administrative expenses were and per bbl  respectively  decreasing to and per bbl  respectively  for the year ended december  the company s russian operations grew less significantly than the venezuelan operations during and capital expenditures through in both venezuela and russia focused on start up infrastructure items such as roads  pipelines  and facilities rather than drilling 
beginning in  a higher proportion of capital expenditures have been and will continue to be spent on drilling and production activities 
see item business south monagas unit  venezuela drilling and development activity and north gubkinskoye  russia drilling and development activity 
as a private contractor  benton vinccler is subject to a statutory income tax rate of 
however  benton vinccler reported significantly lower effective tax rates for and due to significant non cash tax deductible expenses resulting from devaluations in venezuela when benton vinccler had net monetary liabilities in us dollars 
the company cannot predict the timing or impact of future devaluations in venezuela 
any company operations related to delta centro will be subject to oil and gas industry taxation  which currently provides for royalties of and income taxes of 
see item business delta centro block  venezuela 
geoilbent is subject to a statutory income tax rate of 
geoilbent has also been subject to various other tax burdens  including an oil export tariff 
the export tariff was ecu s per ton through  although geoilbent obtained an exemption from such tariff for the tariff was reduced to ecu s per ton in january  and russia has recently announced that effective july  oil export tariffs will be terminated 
the company anticipates that the tariff on oil exporters may be replaced by an excise or other duty levied on all oil producers  but it is currently unclear how such other tax rates and regimes will be set and administered 
effects of changing prices  foreign exchange rates and inflation the company s results of operations and cash flow are affected by changing oil and gas prices 
however  the company s venezuelan revenues are based on a fee adjusted quarterly by the percentage change of a basket of crude oil prices instead of by absolute dollar changes  which dampens both any upward and downward effects of changing prices on the company s venezuelan revenues and cash flows 
if the price of oil and gas increases  there could be an increase in the cost to the company for drilling and related services because of increased demand  as well as an increase in revenues 
fluctuations in oil and gas prices may affect the company s total planned development activities and capital expenditure program 
effective may   the company entered into a commodity hedge agreement with morgan guaranty designed to reduce a portion of the company s risk from oil price movements 
pursuant to the hedge agreement  with respect to the period from may  through the end of  the company will receive from morgan guaranty per bbl and the company will pay to morgan guaranty the average price per bbl of west texas intermediate light sweet crude oil wti determined in the manner set forth in the hedge agreement 
such payments will be made with respect to production of  bbl of oil per day for   bbl of oil per day for  and  bbl of oil per day for during the quarter ended december   the average price per bbl of wti was and the company s net exposure for the quarter was million 
the company s total exposure for the year ended december   under the hedge agreement was million 
the company s oil production is not materially affected by seasonality 
the returns under the hedge agreement are affected by world wide crude oil prices  which are subject to wide fluctuation in response to a variety of factors that are beyond the control of the company 
there are presently no restrictions in either venezuela or russia that restrict converting us dollars into local currency 
however  during  venezuela implemented exchange controls which significantly limit the ability to convert local currency into us dollars 
because payments made to benton vinccler are made in us dollars into its united states bank account  and benton vinccler is not subject to regulations requiring the conversion or repatriation of those dollars back into the country  the exchange controls have not had to date a material adverse effect on benton vinccler or the company 
currently  there are no exchange controls in russia that restrict conversion of local currency into us dollars 
within the united states  inflation has had a minimal effect on the company  but is potentially an important factor in results of operations in venezuela and russia 
with respect to benton vinccler and geoilbent  substantially all of the sources of funds  including the proceeds from oil sales  the company s contributions and credit financings  are denominated in us dollars  while local transactions in russia and venezuela are conducted in local currency 
if the exchange controls described above continue in venezuela  then inflation could be expected to have an adverse effect on benton vinccler 
during the year ended december   the company realized net foreign exchange gains  primarily as a result of the decline in the value of the venezuelan bolivar and the russian rouble during periods when benton vinccler and geoilbent had substantial net monetary liabilities denominated in bolivares and roubles 
during the year ended december   the company s net foreign exchange gains attributable to its venezuelan operations were million and net foreign exchange losses attributable to its russian operations were million 
however  there are many factors affecting foreign exchange rates and resulting exchange gains and losses  many of which are beyond the influence of the company 
the company has recognized significant exchange gains and losses in the past  resulting from fluctuations in the relationship of the venezuelan and russian currencies to the us dollar 
it is not possible to predict the extent to which the company may be affected by future changes in exchange rates and exchange controls 
capital resources and liquidity the oil and gas industry is a highly capital intensive business 
the company requires capital principally to fund the following costs i drilling and completion costs of wells and the cost of production and transportation facilities  ii geological  geophysical and seismic costs  and iii acquisition of interests in oil and gas properties 
the amount of available capital will affect the scope of the company s operations and the rate of its growth
