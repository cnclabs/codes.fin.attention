item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto contained elsewhere within this document 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal revenues and gross margin the company s two business units are medical systems and healthcare information systems hcis 
medical systems 
the medical systems business unit includes nuclear medicine  radiation therapy planning rtp and  to a lesser extent  digital systems angiography dsa products  as well as customer service related to those products 
summary information related to medical systems product and service revenues and gross margins is as follows fiscal year increase decrease product revenues volume    product mix nuclear medicine rtp dsa geographical mix north america europe other gross margin service revenues    gross margin medical systems product revenues increased in nuclear medicine due to continued customer acceptance of the company s nuclear medicine product family  including new product introductions  and enhancement options 
rtp s product revenues also increased due to the fda s clearance of pinnacle tm 
dsa s product revenues continued to decline as that product continued to mature 
medical systems revenues increased in dollar volume in all of the company s geographical markets  while the growth rate was the highest in the north american market 
product gross margins for medical systems primarily increased due to reductions in product cost 
medical systems service revenues increased as a result of an increase in the company s installed customer base  and service gross margins increased primarily from an increase in the company s installed customer base and increased product reliability 
healthcare information systems hcis 
hcis includes products comprising the hardware  software and related implementations of systems designed to manage information within the laboratory and radiology departments of healthcare organizations  as well as service related to those products 
summary information related to hcis product and service revenues and gross margins is as follows fiscal year increase decrease product revenues volume    product mix laboratory radiology geographical mix north america gross margin service revenues    gross margin increases in hcis product revenues are attributable the company s quadris radiology and labstat laboratory information systems acquired in or developed subsequent to the company s acquisition of chc 
the company acquired chc in july hcis product revenues grew in both laboratory and radiology product families  and product mix shifted more towards laboratory compared to the prior year as that product family increased the volume of installations after introduction of the labstat product in early fiscal the increase in hcis product gross margins is primarily attributable to efficiency gains by increased shipments and installation of both the laboratory and radiology product families compared with the infrastructure required to deliver such products 
hcis service revenues increased due to the increased installed base of both the laboratory and radiology product families at customer sites 
the increase in hcis service gross margins is also attributable to efficiency gains in the infrastructure required to support the installed customer base 
operating and other expenses as a percentage of total revenue the company s operating and other expenses are as follows fiscal year operating costs and expenses marketing and sales research and development  net of software capitalization general and administrative goodwill amortization other expense  net marketing and sales expenses as a percentage of revenue declined primarily due to support costs of a semi variable nature being spread over a greater revenue dollar volume 
research and development expenditures represent continued investment in new product development and product enhancement 
total research and development expenditures as a percent of revenue increased  as a result of increased expenditures for internally developed software components meeting technological feasibility related to new product introductions and product enhancements throughout the business  while research and development exependitures  net  decreased slightly 
capitalized software costs for fiscal and were  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenditures as a percentage of revenue increased primarily due to overall increased infrastructure resulting from general and administrative functions related to the fiscal and late fiscal acquisitions of jd technical  a refurbisher of nuclear medicine imaging equipment  and chc  respectively  both of which have costs of a semi variable nature being spread over a lower revenue base relative to those areas of business 
goodwill amortization relates to the acquisition of chc in late fiscal other expense  net  primarily consists of interest expense  which increased due to the company s increased level of bank borrowings during fiscal over fiscal foreign currency transaction gains and losses are also included in other expense  net 
income taxes fiscal s effective tax rate as a percentage of pretax income was versus in fiscal this increase was primarily a result of a prospective reinstatement of the research and development tax credit and full utilization of net operating losses in certain of the company s european tax jurisdictions 
segment information segment and foreign operations information is contained in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its revenues or results of operations 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues and gross margin medical systems 
summary information related to medical systems product and service revenues and gross margins is as follows fiscal year increase decrease product revenues volume    product mix nuclear medicine rtp dsa geographical mix north america europe other gross margin fiscal year increase decrease service revenues    gross margin medical systems product revenues increase was primarily due to a or  increase in nuclear medicine product sales  which was offset by a  decrease in dsa product sales as that product matured 
medical systems product gross margins decreased primarily due to the continued industry wide pricing pressures first experienced during the last half of fiscal as the overall market for nuclear medicine products in the united states declined 
medical systems service revenues increased primarily as a result of the continued increase in the installed product base 
service gross margins for medical systems increased as the installed customer base increased  product reliability increased and overall costs were reduced 
healthcare information systems 
summary information related to hcis product and service revenues and gross margins is as follows fiscal year increase decrease product revenues volume    product mix laboratory radiology geographical mix north america gross margin service revenues    gross margin although hcis product orders remained constant for both and  product revenues declined 
the decline in hcis product revenues resulted from reduced sales of maturing radiology products that were not yet fully offset by sales of newer radiology products under development 
the acquired chc business contributed in product revenue during product margins for hcis declined as proprietary third party hardware platforms were replaced with non proprietary open systems hardware platforms with lower margins 
in addition  laboratory product margins were lower during the initial stages of new product introduction 
the acquired chc business contributed  of service revenue during hcis service margins increased primarily due to obtaining a relatively large installed base of laboratory product customers when the company acquired chc 
operating and other expenses as a percentage of total revenue  operating costs and expenses and other expenses  net  are as follows fiscal year operating costs and expenses marketing and sales research and development  net of software capitalization general and administrative goodwill amortization subtotal  before restructuring charges restructuring charges total operating costs and expenses other expense  net operating costs and expenses before restructuring charges decreased as a percentage of revenue 
this reduction was a result of the company s continued cost reduction efforts started during the second half of concurrent with the restructuring 
as a percentage of revenue  marketing and sales expenses decreased and research and development expenses decreased 
research and development expenses represent continued investment in new product development and are net of software capitalization 
software capitalized during fiscal and was  and  respectively 
the general and administrative expense increase was mostly attributable to the acquired chc business 
during the third quarter of  the company implemented a restructuring plan to eliminate functions and positions dedicated to rework and non critical activities  consolidate certain job functions  redesign and streamline manufacturing systems and processes  and undertake a major program of proactive and preventive maintenance of the company s installed base of equipment to further enhance the equipment s reliability 
as a result  the company recorded a restructuring charge of  for these costs 
other expense  net  excluding s litigation defense costs and related settlement  increased as a result of the company carrying short term bank borrowings during to fund loans made to chc prior to the company s acquisition of such company and  subsequently  to fund the acquisition of chc 
fiscal s other expense includes  in litigation defense costs and  in settlement costs related to the elscint litigation as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
excluding the litigation defense costs  fiscal s other expense  net  was income taxes fiscal s effective tax rate was  which is approximately equal to the company s statutory federal tax rate after utilization of business tax credits 
in fiscal  the company recorded a tax benefit resulting from the release of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets related to federal net operating loss carryforwards 
effective october   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
on adoption of sfas no 
 management established a valuation allowance for the entire balance of its net deferred tax asset due to uncertainty with regard to the outcome of the elscint litigation summarized in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  and concerns over healthcare reform legislation 
following the settlement of this litigation in september the end of fiscal  combined with new legislative developments in healthcare reform  the valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset was no longer deemed appropriate in the fourth quarter and therefore was released in the period 
this resulted in a gross income tax benefit of  for a net income tax benefit for the year of  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
segment information segment and foreign operations information is contained in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources summary information regarding the company s cash flows  liquidity  and capital resources is as follows fiscal net cash and equivalents generated used in operating activities  investing activities  financing activities  subtotal  effect of exchange rates on cash  net cash and equivalents generated used  cash and equivalents at year end  bank lines of credit at year end  fiscal s net uses of cash in operations were primarily due to increases in accounts receivable resulting primarily from increased sales volume  increases in prepaid expenses related to a higher level of prepayments to inventory vendors along with new prepaid royalty arrangements related to new product and product enhancements  increased inventory levels to meet anticipated higher future sales levels  and an increased level of service parts to service the increased customer installed base 
these increases were partially offset by a continued decrease in deferred income tax assets as the company utilized its tax basis net operating losses 
net cash used in investing activities during fiscal primarily related to capital expenditures and increases in capitalized software expenditures 
fiscal s net cash from investing activities included the acquisition of chc 
fiscal s cash generated by financing activities mostly resulted from increased short term bank borrowings and proceeds from the issuance of common stock  primarily from the exercise of stock options and dividend reinvestments 
offsetting these items were the payment of dividends 
in october  the company s board of directors decided to discontinue the payment of its quarterly cash dividend in order to reinvest the funds in the company to further its growth and enhance shareholder value 
net cash and equivalents also decreased during fiscal as a result of a strengthening dollar in relation to other currencies  the company s european operations functional currencies are their local currencies 
primarily as a result of the above noted operating  financing and investing activities  and the effect of exchange rates on cash  cash and cash equivalents decreased on an overall basis during fiscal borrowings outstanding under the lines of credit at the end of fiscal were  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that its cash  cash equivalents  cash flows from operating activities and  if necessary  remaining lines of credit will be sufficient to fund the company s operating cash flow requirements for the next fiscal year 
however  the company may need to increase its sources of capital through additional borrowings or the sale of securities in response to business conditions or to pursue new business opportunities 
there can be no assurance that such additional sources of capital will be available and or on terms favorable to the company 
recent accounting pronouncements information regarding the issuance of recent accounting pronouncements and their expected effect on the company s financial position and results of operations is contained in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
business considerations from time to time  the company may disclose  through press releases  filings with the sec or otherwise  certain matters that constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
such statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected  including without limitation those set forth below 
the company expressly disclaims any obligation to update any forward looking statements 
competition the medical systems and health care information system markets are characterized by rapidly evolving technology  intense competition and pricing pressure 
there are a number of companies that currently offer  or are in the process of developing  products that compete with products offered by the company 
some of these competitors have substantially greater capital  engineering  manufacturing and other resources than the company 
these competitors could develop technologies and products that are more effective than those currently used or produced by the company or that could render the company s products obsolete or noncompetitive 
in addition  as the company enters new markets  such as the laboratory information systems market  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to penetrate such markets successfully 
dependence on development and commercialization of new products adac s success is dependent upon the successful development  introduction and commercialization of new products and the development of enhancements to existing products 
because the nuclear medicine market is relatively mature  and from time to time in recent years has experienced a decline  the company must continue to develop innovative new products and product enhancements such as mcd in order to pursue its growth strategy 
the development of new products and product enhancements entails considerable time and expense  including research and development costs  and the time  expense and uncertainty involved in clinical trials and in obtaining any necessary regulatory clearances 
the success of some medical systems products depends on receipt of appropriate regulatory approvals for and the commercial availability of specific radiopharmaceuticals 
for example  mcd requires the use of positron emitting isotopes 
at this time  the infrastructure for the commercial supply of such isotopes is not well developed  certain applicable regulatory approvals for such isotopes have not yet been obtained  and reimbursement for the use of such isotopes in connection with mcd is uncertain 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to commercialize its existing products or any new products or enhancements successfully 
future operating results the company s future operating results may vary substantially from period to period 
the timing and amount of revenues are subject to a number of factors that make estimation of revenues and operating results prior to the end of the quarter very uncertain 
the timing of revenues can be affected by delays in product introductions  shipments and installations  as well as general economic and industry conditions 
furthermore  of the orders received by the company in any fiscal quarter  a disproportionately large percentage has typically been received and shipped toward the end of that quarter 
accordingly  results for a given quarter can be adversely affected if there is a substantial order shortfall late in that quarter 
in addition  although both the company s bookings and revenue have increased steadily in recent periods  bookings cannot necessarily be relied upon as an accurate predictor of future revenues 
health care reform  reimbursement and pricing pressure there is significant concern today about the availability and rising cost of healthcare in the united states 
cost containment initiatives  market pressures and proposed changes in applicable laws and regulations may have a dramatic effect on pricing or potential demand for medical devices  the relative costs associated with doing business and the amount of reimbursement by both government and third party payors  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
government regulation there has been a trend in recent years  both in the united states and abroad  toward more stringent regulation and enforcement of requirements applicable to medical device manufacturers 
the continuing trend of more stringent regulatory oversight in product clearance and enforcement activities has caused medical device manufacturers to experience longer approval cycles  more uncertainty  greater risk  and higher expenses 
there can be no assurance that any necessary clearance or approval will be granted the company or that fda review will not involve delays adversely affecting the company 
the company is also subject to numerous federal  state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions  manufacturing practices  environmental protection and disposal of hazardous substances 
changes in existing requirements  adoption of new requirements or failure to comply with applicable requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company 
intellectual property rights the company s success depends in part on its continued ability to obtain patents  to preserve its trade secrets and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties 
there can be no assurance that pending patent applications will mature into issued patents  that third parties will not make claims of infringement against the company s products or technologies or will not be issued patents that may require payment of license fees by the company or prevent the sale of certain products by the company 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements regarding the company s settlement of certain patent infringement claims in september reliance on suppliers certain components used by the company to manufacture its products  such as the sun workstations and the sodium iodide crystals used in the company s nuclear medicine systems  are presently available from only one supplier 
the company also relies on several significant vendors for hardware and software components for its healthcare information systems products 
the loss of any of these suppliers  including any single source supplier  would require obtaining one or more replacement suppliers as well as potentially requiring a significant level of hardware and software development to incorporate the new parts into the company s products 
although the company has obtained insurance to protect against loss due to business interruption from these and other sources  there can be no assurance that such coverage would be adequate 
product liability although the company maintains product liability insurance coverage in an amount that it deems sufficient for its business  there can be no assurance that such coverage will ultimately prove to be adequate or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable terms  if at all 
volatility of stock price the market price of the company s common stock is and is expected to continue to be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in anticipated or actual operating results  market speculation  announcements of new products or technology by the company or its competitors  changes in earnings estimates by the company s analysts  trends in the health care industry in general and other factors  many of which are beyond the control of the company 
in addition  broad market fluctuations as well as general economic or political conditions or initiatives  such as health care reform  may adversely impact the market price of the common stock regardless of the company s operating results
