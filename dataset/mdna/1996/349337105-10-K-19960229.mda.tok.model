per share  an increase of over third quarter and 
over fourth quarter the major components of the company s operating results are summarized in the comparative earnings analysis table 
net interest income increased 
in over and 
in over these modest increases are indicative of the continued pressure on the company s net interest margin 
net overhead  which is the amount by which noninterest expense exceeds noninterest income  increased in from and in over the provision for possible loan losses charged to earnings decreased in from after reflecting a decrease in from applicable income taxes decreased by  or following a increase in over net interest income 
net interest income  which is the difference between interest and fees earned on assets and the interest paid on deposits and other funding sources  is the primary source of earnings for the company 
this component represented over of the company s net revenues in a detailed analysis highlighting the changes in net interest income is provided in the analysis of changes in interest differential table 
interest earned on tax exempt loans and investments is adjusted for comparative purposes to a taxable equivalent basis using the federal tax rate of  resulting in a fully taxable equivalent fte net interest income 
net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis totaled million in compared to million in and million in interest rate changes had a significant impact on net interest income  as total interest income increased by million for due to rate movements while total interest expense increased almost million 
the resulting decrease in net interest income of million was offset by the million increase in net interest income due to volume increases 
this continues the trend which occurred in where the million increase in net interest income due to volume increases offset the million decrease due to rate movements 
average earning assets increased by million or for as average loans  net of unearned income  increased by million or 
average total interest bearing liabilities increased million or for more important than the increase in average total interest bearing liabilities was the shift in interest bearing deposits that occurred during  and as interest rates began to soften in  depositors were unwilling to invest in longer term investment products 
as a result  the company s depositors shifted funds out of time deposits and into savings and other deposit products with shorter maturities 
average time deposits decreased by million from to while average savings deposits increased by million and average interest bearing demand deposits increased by million 
in  this trend reversed 
average time deposits increased by million from to while average savings deposits decreased by million 
the company introduced a deposit product called the anydayeveryday deposit in the anydayeveryday account  which is included in the time deposits category  is priced to yield a return which is above the average money market rate 
this new product has been very successful in generating deposits for the company and contributed to the increase in time deposits in average interest bearing demand deposits decreased by million during this period 
the company s net interest margin measured on a fully taxable equivalent basis decreased to in from in and in with the current shape of the yield curve being somewhat inverted  the company is continuing to experience significant pressure on net interest income 
the net interest margin for the fourth quarter of was compared to in the third quarter of and in the fourth quarter of the company continues to operate in an extremely competitive marketplace 
two major regional bank holding companies entered the company s market in by acquiring two previously independent financial institutions 
their desire to grow in the area resulted in each offering higher deposit rates in this market than in many of their other markets 
in addition  competition for quality loans continues to be intense  resulting in smaller margins in the overall loan portfolio 
provision and allowance for possible loan losses 
the allowance for possible loan losses represents management s estimate of potential credit losses associated with the loan portfolio  including all off balance sheet lending commitments 
while the balance is only an estimate  management does perform a systematic analysis in determining the adequacy of the allowance for possible loan losses and  consequently  the annual provision charged to earnings 
beginning in  the company adopted statement  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
under the new standard  the allowance for possible loan losses related to loans that are identified for evaluation in accordance with statement is based on discounted cash flows using the loan s initial effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans 
prior to  the allowance for possible loan losses related to these loans was based on undiscounted cash flows or the fair value of the collateral for collateral dependent loans 
the allowance for possible loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb estimated probable loan losses 
to facilitate the periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for possible loan losses  the company utilizes a loan grading system that helps identify  monitor and address asset quality problems  should they arise  in an accurate and timely manner 
credits of a significant nature are reviewed on an individual basis and a specific allocation of the allowance for possible loan losses may be made if so warranted 
management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on the company s past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay including the timing of future payments  the estimated value of any underlying collateral  composition of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions  and other relevant factors including changes in policies and procedures  including underwriting standards and collection  charge off  and recovery practices  changes in the experience  ability  and depth of the lending management  the identification of any concentrations of credit  and changes in the level of such concentrations  and the effect of external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change 
in addition  each of the company s affiliate banks is subject  at a minimum  to annual reviews  as applicable  by the federal reserve bank system  the office of the comptroller of the currency  the indiana department of financial institutions  and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
during these reviews  the regulators identify loans for classification as loss  doubtful  substandard  or special mention 
other than those loans included in the nonperforming loan table  and related footnote thereto  no other loans which management is closely monitoring  or which have been classified by bank regulators  resulted from trends or uncertainties which management reasonably expects will materially impact future operating results  liquidity  or capital resources 
as of december   the company s nonperforming loans including nonaccrual loans  accruing loans past due days or more  and restructured loans amounted to million compared to million at year end and million at year end nonperforming loans represented of total loans outstanding at december  compared to one year ago and at the end of during the fourth quarter of  an million loan was restructured and included in the restructured classification as of december  this loan demonstrated sufficient performance under the new terms to be classified as performing at the end of the second quarter of during the fourth quarter  however  the borrower voluntarily decided to liquidate its operations 
at that time the company placed a total of million of loans to this borrower on nonaccrual status 
other real estate owned  which consists primarily of real estate acquired in foreclosure  is another category of nonperforming assets many financial institutions have recorded on their balance sheet 
other real estate owned totaled only  at year end  the lowest level in the past five years 
although accruing loans past due days or more are considered nonperforming  a more appropriate grouping of nonperforming would include nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned along with restructured loans 
this grouping represents 
of total assets  comparable to the company s peers 
at december   the company s allowance for possible loan losses of over million exceeded its level of nonperforming loans 
the ratio of the allowance for possible loan losses to nonperforming loans of for compares to at the end of and at december  as a percentage of total loans outstanding  the allowance for possible loan losses was 
this is a decrease from in and in this ratio compares to the peers ratio of 
net charge offs amounted to million or 
of average loans outstanding 
this ratio is consistent with the company s peer ratio of 
historically  the company has outperformed its peers in this category 
over the past five years  the company s net charge offs have averaged 
of average loans outstanding compared to approximately 
for its peers 
the company s net charge offs in were million as compared to million in and  in however  a significant portion of the charge offs taken in and represented amounts that had been specifically allocated to the related credits during the company s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for possible loan losses in prior years 
of the total charge offs in  million related to the charge off of a loan that had been in the nonaccrual category at the end of in connection with this charge off  the company agreed to fund certain operating expenses related to the loan collateral on behalf of the borrower 
the payment of these expenses was required to be recognized as part of the company s operating expenses 
however  since such anticipated expenses had previously been provided for through the allowance for possible loan losses  the company reduced the provision and related allowance for possible loan losses in the second quarter of by the amount of the expenses  that were recognized as part of other operating expense 
during the third and fourth quarters of  an additional  was charged to other operating expense 
noninterest income and expense analysis increase decrease amount amount dollars in thousands noninterest income fiduciary fees    service charges on deposit accounts    other service charges     net securities gains  other income     total noninterest income    noninterest expense salaries and wages     employee benefits    net occupancy expense    equipment expense    fdic assessment     other expense     total noninterest expense     noninterest income and expense 
a ratio often used to evaluate the noninterest income and expense performance of banking organizations is the efficiency ratio 
this ratio is calculated by dividing total noninterest expense by the total of net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis and noninterest income 
the lower the ratio  the more efficient the organization is at generating income in relation to the expenses incurred to obtain that income 
the company has historically outperformed its peers with efficiency ratios of  and  respectively in  and compared to peer ratios of  and  respectively for the same periods 
during  fiduciary fees increased from following the increase in from the company s trust division is the largest in northern indiana and is continually increasing its customer base 
service charges on deposits grew in  consistent with the level of growth in average deposits 
in service charges on deposits grew from slightly less than half of the increase can be attributed to a deposit product software conversion at the lead bank in july prior to the conversion  certain fee income had been classified as interest and fees on loans 
subsequent to the conversion  this same income was combined with service charges on deposits 
in addition  during the company expanded its consumer deposit base 
the company made great strides in developing a concept referred to as relationship banking 
various advertising campaigns stressed the relationship concept and generated a great deal of growth in both consumer deposits and loans 
as indicated in our annual report to shareholders  s level of increased service charges on deposits was not to be expected in future years 
however  the company continues to realize an improvement in its collection of deposit fees and  through offering new and improved deposit products to its customers  has been able to expand this source of income 
other service charges decreased by million in from in the company eliminated intracompany charges for data processing services 
as a result  data processing fees for were  below in addition  the company has seen a  reduction in the amount of income generated from referrals on annuity prospects 
other income reflected a  or increase in from following the million or decrease in from in as a result of declining mortgage loan interest rates  the company s affiliate banks saw heavy mortgage loan refinancing 
in an effort to meet customer demand  yet not assume additional interest rate risk  the company originated these mortgages and sold many of the new fixed rate mortgages in the secondary market 
selling these mortgages generated gains in excess of million in however  as mortgage rates increased quickly in the first part of  the company generated losses of  on the sale of mortgage loans 
mortgage refinancing and other new mortgage loan demand slowed significantly during the later part of and into the company recognized net gains of  in from the sale of loans 
securities transactions amounted to a net gain of  in compared to  in and  in the slight gains for the company in and were the result of certain issues being called and the sale of million and million of investments prior to maturity in and  respectively 
during  many bond issues were called as a result of the lower interest rates at which the bonds could be reissued or refinanced 
total noninterest expense increased in over and in over the most significant change to noninterest expense for occurred in the fdic insurance expense category which decreased by million or 
the fdic insurance fund met its federally mandated level of of insured deposits during the second quarter of therefore  the company s fdic insurance expense was reduced from the prior rate of 
per of insured deposits to 
per of insured deposits 
the fdic has set a current rate of zero percent and assuming no further changes  the company expects to realize a decrease in fdic insurance of approximately million in salaries and wages reflected a million or increase in following the  or increase in over of the increase in salaries and wages in over   was due to a decrease in the deferral of salary expense allocated to generating new loans 
statement requires entities to defer an estimated portion of salary expense for each new loan that is made 
this expense is then amortized against the fees on these loans 
in  deferred salaries and wages exceeded the amount for by  in addition  staffing levels have increased moderately to support new products and services and increased loan and deposit volumes 
employee benefits reflected only a minor increase in from after increasing by  or in over due to favorable claim experience  the company s health insurance premium rates were the same in as in as mentioned in last year s discussion  the company anticipated an increase in employee benefit expense in the use of a lower discount rate in determining the funding cost of pensions in prior years had the effect of increasing the obligation at the balance sheet date and increased the interest cost in on that projected obligation by  in addition  the expense of the company s benefit restoration plan increased by  in the benefit restoration plan is a nonqualified plan that restores certain benefits to employees whose benefits are limited by the revenue reconciliation act of these employees would otherwise be entitled to these benefits under the company s qualified plans 
net occupancy expense increased just  or in following the  or increase in over during  the company renegotiated its long term lease on its main office facilities 
a cumulative adjustment increasing expense by approximately  relating to the renegotiation was recorded in the second quarter of excluding this adjustment  net occupancy expense would have increased by  or in over as the company has assumed additional space in its main office headquarters to expand the loan and trust divisions 
equipment expense increased by  or in over and  or in over as the company continues to invest in computer hardware and upgrade its software 
other expense increased by million or in over of this increase   was the result of funding certain operating expenses related to loan collateral for a charged off loan as discussed under the caption provision and allowance for possible loan losses above 
in addition  the company incurred expenses totaling  to upgrade trust management information software utilized by the trust departments of the company s affiliate banks and incurred start up expenses related to a conversion in processing services for the company s credit card products 
other expense for reflected a decrease of  or from during the third quarter of  the company incurred expenses totaling  for the settlement of a pending claim 
during the fourth quarter of  a loss of approximately  was sustained on the disposal of other real estate property acquired through a foreclosure 
income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes differs from the statutory marginal federal and state tax rates 
this is attributable principally to the tax exempt income that is earned on various earning assets and the disallowance of a tax deduction on certain recorded expenses 
the company uses the liability method for recording income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
these differences are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
applicable income taxes for decreased  or compared to this is the result of a decrease in the company s taxable income along with a change in estimate in connection with the calculation of the company s overall income tax accruals 
during  the company s ongoing state franchise tax dispute with the state of indiana was resolved 
in  the state tax court rendered a decision that was favorable to the company 
that decision was appealed to the indiana supreme court which overruled the tax court s decision and ruled in favor of the state of indiana 
while the company appealed the indiana supreme court s decision to the united states supreme court  the higher court declined to review the decision 
this matter is now effectively closed and the company has made payment to the state of indiana for all state franchise tax amounts previously withheld 
analysis of financial condition although competition continued to be intense in the company s marketplace  the company s outstanding loans increased by and outstanding deposits increased at year end compared to year end in addition  the market share of total bank deposits outstanding in the fort wayne market for the company s lead bank has increased from an average of in to in and in loans 
all categories of lending with the exception of installment loans increased during commercial lending increased by million or to million 
real estate loans  including real estate construction  increased by million from year end and totaled nearly million 
real estate lending continues to be the major component of the company s loan portfolio 
as can be seen in the real estate loan analysis table  the majority of real estate holdings are family residential loans which account for of total real estate holdings as of december  the majority of the company s real estate lending is concentrated in the company s trading area of northeastern indiana 
commercial and residential real estate values in this area have not experienced the volatility which affected other markets in recent decades 
in addition  the company s underwriting policy for family residential loans follows that of industry standards and meets the criteria for sale in the secondary market 
the growth in real estate lending came even as the company sold million of residential mortgages during investments 
total investment securities increased million or from december  on average during  investment securities decreased million or 
this follows a decrease of million or in from the decrease in average securities is attributed to average loans growing at a faster pace than total average funding sources 
average short term investments  including federal funds sold and time deposits with other banks  increased million or from after decreasing million or in at december   the company s investment securities  except for investments in marketable securities held by the parent company  were stated at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts 
the company had no securities identified as being held for sale 
in may  the financial accounting standards board issued statement  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
under the new rules  debt securities that the company has both the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost 
debt securities that the company does not have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity and all marketable equity securities are classified as available for sale or trading and carried at fair value 
unrealized holding gains and losses on securities classified as available for sale are carried as a separate component of shareholders equity  net of tax 
unrealized holding gains and losses on securities classified as trading are reported in earnings 
because of statement  the company reevaluated its investment policies and  as a result  classified all investment securities held as of december  as available for sale as of january  application of the new rules resulted in an increase of million to shareholders equity as of january   representing the recognition in shareholders equity of unrealized appreciation  net of taxes  for the company s investment in debt and equity securities determined to be available for sale that previously had been carried at amortized cost or lower of cost or market 
in addition  all investment securities purchased during and the majority of securities purchased in were classified as available for sale 
the net unrealized holding gains and losses on securities designated as available for sale fluctuate as market interest rates rise and fall 
the adjustment to the carrying value of investment securities was a net unrealized gain of million at december  and a net unrealized loss of million at december  the result on shareholders equity  net of taxes  was an increase of million and a decrease of million at december  and  respectively 
the federal reserve board and the office of the comptroller of currency  however  have determined that this component of shareholders equity will not be used in determining capital adequacy or impact the calculations of fdic premiums 
during  the company purchased approximately million of securities designated as trading and sold trading securities with a carrying value of million  realizing a gain of  the carrying value of securities held for trading purposes at december  was million including a recognized unrealized gain of  the company s investment portfolio continues to be of high quality as evidenced by us government and other federal agencies representing approximately two thirds of the total outstanding in each of the past three years 
the company s holdings of states and other political subdivisions has also increased slightly to of the total portfolio compared to in and in other investments represented of the total portfolio at december   consistent with the percentages for and deposits 
the primary source of funds for the company comes from the acceptance of demand and time deposits generated at the affiliate banks 
the company was pleased to realize an improvement in its deposits this year as many financial institutions were realizing decreasing deposit levels 
competition for deposits has been intense over the last several years as more and more entities offered mutual funds  annuities  and other investment alternatives for customers 
the pressure for individuals to move bank deposits into these products has been great 
the company began to realize more significant growth in deposits in the later part of and into as interest rates on bank deposits increased 
as more and more customers look for a more stable and risk free investment  the company hopes to again reflect increased deposit levels 
total deposits as of december  increased million or over the totals achieved at the end of as depicted in the deposits table  total average deposits increased by million or 
however  as was realized in and  the company experienced a shift in the mix of the different deposit categories 
in and much of depositors did not perceive a sufficient premium to extend maturities during the comparatively lower interest rate environment 
as a result  customers allowed maturing deposits to roll into shorter term instruments 
average demand deposits  including both interest bearing and noninterest bearing  increased in over average savings deposits  which include traditional savings and money market deposits  grew in from much of this growth came from other time deposits as this category decreased million or in from late in and into  however  the mix in the company s deposit portfolio began to shift back 
for  average demand deposits  including both interest bearing and noninterest bearing  decreased by million 
in addition  average savings deposits decreased million or in these decreases were more than offset however  by the million or increase in average time deposits which includes the company s highly successful anydayeveryday account 
the combination of a greater percentage of average total deposits in the time deposits category along with the higher rates being paid on those deposits has placed significant pressure on the company s net interest earnings and net interest margin 
short term borrowings and long term debt 
federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase consist primarily of repurchase arrangements the company s affiliate banks commercial customers utilize for cash management services 
in  average federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased million or  considerably more than the million or growth realized in over the other category of short term funding available to the company is notes payable to the us treasury 
as indicated in the short term borrowings table  this category can fluctuate significantly during the year 
this is a result of the timing of tax deposits made by customers and the call for these funds made by the government 
this category  however  has been a relatively small source of funds for the company 
long term debt  which totaled million at the end of  decreased  from as a result of scheduled principal payments 
the company issued no new debt during the past year  nor did it refinance any of its existing obligations 
for a further discussion of the company s long term debt obligations  maturities  and related dividend and other restrictions  refer to notes and in the company s accompanying consolidated financial statements 
capital resources 
capital adequacy is one of the main measurements used by bank regulators to determine the strength of a financial institution 
a strong capital position will enable the company to access capital markets under more favorable terms 
in addition  a strong capital base encourages depositor and investor confidence in the institution 
the federal reserve board governs the activities of bank holding companies and requires the company to maintain an amount of capital based on risk adjusted assets  so that categories of assets with potentially higher credit risk require more capital backing than assets with lower risk 
banks and bank holding companies are also required to maintain capital to support  on a risk adjusted basis  certain off balance sheet activities such as loan commitments 
also  section of the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of requires bank holding companies to maintain additional capital for interest rate risk inherent in the balance sheet 
the federal reserve board standards classify capital into two tiers  referred to as tier i and tier ii 
tier i capital consists of common shareholders equity  noncumulative and cumulative perpetual preferred stock  and minority interest less certain intangibles 
tier ii capital consists of the allowance for loan losses  hybrid capital instruments  term subordinated debt  and intermediate term preferred stock 
the minimum required tier i and tier ii capital ratio is with at least a tier i capital ratio 
the company s tier i capital ratio at december  was compared to in and in combined tier i and tier ii capital of at december  compared to in and in both of these ratios are substantially in excess of the required due to the high degree of quality in the loan and investment portfolios 
risk based capital the following table summarizes the company s risk based capital calculations for the periods indicated 
december dollars in thousands equity capital      less net unrealized gain loss on available for sale securities   disallowed intangibles      tier i capital      qualifying allowance for loan losses and other debt      total tier i and tier ii capital      total assets      risk weighted assets      tier i capital ratio tier i and tier ii capital ratio leverage ratio dividends declared totalled million  an increase from million in this reflects the company s trend of increasing dividends annually 
the company s current annual dividend is  up from the 
declared in the dividend payout ratio for was  an increase over the for on april   the company s shareholders approved an increase from  to  in the total authorized shares of common stock  enabling the company to effect the three for two stock split that was declared by the board of directors on january  this split was paid on may  to shareholders of record on april  in addition  during the board of directors approved the repurchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock 
during  the company repurchased  shares at a total cost of million 
liquidity and rate sensitivity management management meets regularly through its asset liability committee to review both the liquidity and rate sensitivity position of the company 
effective asset and liability management insures the company s ability to monitor the cash flow requirements of depositors along with the demands of borrowers 
while maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet these needs  the company also attempts to maximize net interest income through sensitivity analysis of its assets and liabilities 
liquidity 
the affiliate banks maintain a stable base of core deposits provided by long standing customer relationships with consumers and local businesses 
these deposits are the principal source of liquidity for the company 
these sources are complemented with short term borrowings through correspondent bank relationships  in addition to other corporate customers  through the use of repurchase agreements 
the company closely monitors these sources to avoid any unwarranted market or customer concentrations 
liquidity is also provided through the sales and maturities of various assets  including short term investments  securities  and loans 
the greatest source of asset liquidity lies in the company s marketable securities 
the investment portfolio is highly liquid and has no securities in default 
this is evidenced by the fact that the taxable portfolio maintains a composite rating of a or better on of outstandings 
in an effort to maintain an adequate liquidity position  the company s investment strategy calls for laddering the maturities of investments purchased 
scheduled maturities of investment securities within the next twelve months amount to million or of the entire portfolio 
in addition  with the adoption of statement  the entire portfolio has been identified as available for sale or trading and could be liquidated should a liquidity crisis occur 
interest rate sensitivity analysis the following table presents an analysis of the rate sensitivity of the company s earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december  total over one five months months year years years total dollars in thousands earning assets net loans       investment securities       other earning assets    total       interest bearing liabilities interest bearing deposits       short term borrowings    long term notes    hedged interest bearing liabilities     total       periodic rate sensitivity gap      cumulative rate sensitivity gap    periodic rate sensitivity gap ratio 

cumulative rate sensitivity gap ratio 


interest sensitivity 
the degree by which net interest income may fluctuate due to changes in interest rates is monitored through interest sensitivity management 
when the repricing opportunities of assets and liabilities are not properly aligned  net interest income may be impacted when interest rates change 
forecasting various interest rate scenarios and measuring the results of the possible outcomes determine the exposure of interest rate risk inherent in the company s balance sheet 
management s goal through the asset liability committee is to manage imbalanced positions that arise when the total amount of assets maturing or repricing in a given period differs from that of the supporting liabilities 
the theory behind managing the difference between repricing assets and liabilities is to have more liabilities reprice when interest rates are declining and when interest rates are rising to have more assets reprice 
as of december   the company had a negative gap or a net liability sensitive position of 
this indicates that the total amount of assets repricing within one year represents of the total amount of liabilities repricing in the same time frame and compares to a net liability sensitive position of 
one year ago 
these figures represent one day s position  and changing market conditions may create significant fluctuations 
however  there are certain tools available to management to reduce or minimize these conditions 
among them are specific investment decisions  pricing structures of deposit funds  and financial futures and options used to hedge specific asset or liability positions 
the company uses exchange traded financial instruments such as futures and options to hedge against interest rate risk 
the company has established policies  guidelines and internal control procedures for the use of these instruments 
for a further discussion of the company s use of financial futures and options  refer to note in the company s accompanying consolidated financial statements 
inflation and changing prices reported earnings are affected by inflation  indirectly through changing interest rates  and directly by increased operating expenses 
however  the effects of general price level inflation have not had a material effect on the information presented herein 
industry outlook and regulatory changes in  many industry observers predicted that would be a quiet year for consumer regulation 
they were wrong 
the regulatory burden for most banks has not been reduced significantly  although some regulations have been simplified or improved through amendments 
many of the changes made in become effective in in addition  regulators and legislators will be addressing other significant compliance issues in some of the more significant changes enacted in that had a direct impact on the company included revisions to the real estate settlement procedures act respa  the home mortgage disclosure act hmda and the community reinvestment act cra 
respa was amended to include the department of housing and urban development s final rule on escrow accounting procedures which establishes a nationwide standard accounting method known as aggregate accounting 
this new procedure is a change for the company and will require an update to the loan accounting software currently being used 
in february  the federal reserve board the fed issued final rulings amending the hmda reporting requirements on refinanced loans to allow all refinancings to be reported for hmda purposes as long as the loan is secured by a dwelling 
these changes will help simplify the reporting process for these types of loans 
in april  the fed approved the final version of the cra regulation 
the new version makes changes in the way examiners will evaluate a bank s cra performance and places more emphasis on rating a bank s cra performance rather than a bank s cra process 
the company and its subsidiary banks take the community reinvestment act seriously and are pleased to see that regulators will be focusing on results rather than procedures 
among the regulatory and compliance issues that are in the works for are changes to the bank secrecy act bsa 
in an attempt to plug perceived holes in bsa regulations  the fed and the financial crimes enforcement network issued a joint and final rule in january on new record keeping requirements for certain wire transfers and transmittal orders by financial institutions 
the new rules  which are effective in april of  include information gathering and retention procedures which differ for established and non established customers and set forth parameters on how banks must be able to retrieve information about wire transfer payment orders 
the new rules will certainly add to the record keeping burden 
one of the biggest changes in will be the way banks are examined for compliance with the bsa 
banks will have to demonstrate to examiners that they have an effective system for detecting and preventing money laundering 
the fed will require banks to establish sound know your customer policies and procedures which must be able to detect changes in activity of established customers and ensure that information on the general business of new customers is obtained 
certainly regulations affecting the financial services industry will continue to change 
in the past  the company has demonstrated its ability to react to change 
as part of the process of managing change  the company has increased its emphasis on strategic planning and its role in the financial services industry 
we believe the strength of the company lies in its organizational structure of allowing all affiliate banks to manage their institutions according to their own marketplace demands 
providing the tools for the affiliates to do this should come from a consolidation of behind the scenes activities including accounting  data processing  and investments 
in addition the company is currently in the process of standardizing all of its products to improve operating efficiency and marketing efforts 
during  the company completed much of the groundwork for this consolidation 
all of the company s affiliate banks have already been converted to the same data processing software for loans  deposits  and investments  and all of the company s affiliate banks are now using the same processor for their credit card activities 
consolidating these functions  and removing the burden of the operations from the affiliate banks  permits our employees to further develop customer relationships 
developing these relationships will allow the company to increase deposits and loans  while enhancing shareholder returns 
it has been several years since the company was active in the merger and acquisitions arena  instead concentrating on upgrading the internal infrastructure of the company 
the company is now poised to move forward in the marketplace and on november  the company entered into an agreement and plan of merger with valley financial services  inc vfs 
subject to required approvals by regulators and the shareholders of vfs  consummation of the merger is anticipated to occur during the second quarter of based upon december  data  the company s combined post merger total assets will exceed billion  total loans will exceed billion and total deposits will exceed billion 
the proposed acquisition is a strategic move in the company s goal to extend operations throughout northeastern and north central indiana
