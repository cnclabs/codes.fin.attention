the company s million loan portfolio consists primarily of mortgage loans on residential real estate

the company originated and purchased million in loans during fiscal offset by sales of million and cash repayments of million 
deposits increased million  or  to million at september  collateralized mortgage obligations decreased million  or  to million at september   due to payments and prepayments of the mortgage backed securities held as collateral for the bonds 
borrowings decreased by million which was offset by a corresponding decrease in interest bearing deposits of million 
stockholders equity increased million to million at september  the increase was due to earnings of million  proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the related tax benefit of million  and the repayment of the esop loan of million 
on october   the company declared a stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend and issued  shares 
asset liability management the company manages its exposure to interest rate risk by emphasizing the origination and purchase of adjustable rate mortgage arm loans 
management believes that by investing in arm loans  short term profits are possibly sacrificed compared to yields obtainable through investment in fixed rate loans  however  the company s exposure to the risk of interest rate fluctuations is reduced  thereby enhancing long term profitability 
the fixed rate mortgage loans the bank originates are securitized and sold into the secondary market  with servicing retained  as part of its operation and interest rate risk management strategy 
the bank seeks to lengthen the maturities of its deposits by emphasizing savings certificates with maturities of three months or more 
at september   savings certificates with original maturities of three months or more totaled million  or  of total deposits 
the bank seeks to reduce its risk of early withdrawals from its longer term savings certificates by requiring early withdrawal penalties on all certificates 
the bank does not actively solicit high rate jumbo certificates of deposit or brokered funds 
matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is to be considered interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets anticipated  based upon certain assumptions  to mature or reprice within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities anticipated  based upon certain assumptions  to mature or reprice within that time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
the company s one year interest sensitivity gap as a percent of total assets was a negative at september  the company anticipates that its gap position  in fiscal  will not exceed the current percentage 
the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at september   which are anticipated by the company to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
except as stated below  the amounts of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were based upon the contractual terms of the asset or liability or certain assumptions concerning the amortization and prepayment of such assets and liabilities 
regular savings accounts  now accounts and money market accounts  which collectively totaled million at september   were assumed to be withdrawn at annual percentage rates of  and  respectively 
the collateralized mortgage obligations were assumed to prepay at the same rate used for the mortgage backed securities collateralizing these obligations 
management believes that these assumptions approximate actual experience and considers them reasonable  although the actual amortization and repayment of assets and liabilities may vary substantially 
at september  more than more than year year years more than dollars in thousands or less to years to years years total interest earning assets mortgage loans      equity lines of credit   consumer loans    mortgage backed securities     interest bearing deposits   investment securities   total interest earning assets      interest bearing liabilities regular savings accounts      now interest bearing accounts      money market accounts      certificate accounts     borrowed funds     collateralized mortgage obligations   total interest bearing liabilities      interest sensitivity gap      cumulative interest sensitivity gap     cumulative interest sensitivity gap as a percentage of total assets cumulative net interest earning assets as a percentage of interest sensitive liabilities for purposes of the gap analysis  mortgage loans  equity lines of credit and consumer loans are not reduced by the allowance for loan losses and are reduced for non performing loans 
mortgage backed and investment securities do not reflect unrealized gains losses resulting from the adoption of fasb no 
see accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as arm loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
liquidity the company s primary sources of funds are deposits  borrowings  proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans and mortgage backed securities and the sale of securitized loans 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and mortgage backed securities are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by interest rate cycles and economic conditions 
the bank is required by regulation to maintain specific minimum levels of liquid investments 
regulations currently in effect require the bank to maintain liquid assets at least equal to of the sum of its average daily balance of net withdrawable accounts and short term borrowed funds 
this regulatory requirement may be changed from time to time by the ots to reflect current economic conditions and deposit flows 
the bank s liquidity ratios were and at september  and  respectively 
the company s most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents  which include investments in highly liquid  short term investments and interest bearing deposits 
the levels of these assets are dependent on the company s operating  financing  lending  and investing activities during any given period 
at september  and  cash and cash equivalents totaled million and million  respectively 
liquidity management for the company is both a daily and long term function of the company s management strategy 
excess funds are generally invested in short term investments such as federal funds and interest bearing deposits 
in the event that the company should require funds beyond its ability to generate them internally  additional sources of funds are available through the use of fhlb advances 
the company s cash flows are comprised of three classifications cash flows from operating activities  cash flows from investing activities  and cash flows from financing activities 
net cash related to operating activities  consisting primarily of interest and dividends received less interest paid on deposits  and the origination and sale of loans  provided million for the year ended september  and provided million for the year ended september  net cash related to investing activities  consisting primarily of principal collections on loans and mortgage backed securities and proceeds from the sale or maturity of loans  mortgage backed securities  and investment securities  offset by disbursements for loans originated for investment  purchases of loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities  provided million and utilized million for the years ended september  and  respectively 
net cash related to financing activities  consisting primarily of net activity in deposit and escrow accounts  proceeds from fhlb advances  and the repayment of collateralized mortgage obligations  utilized million and provided million for the years ended september  and  respectively 
at september   the company had outstanding commitments to originate and purchase million loans 
the company anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan commitments 
certificates of deposit which are scheduled to mature in one year or less from september   totaled million 
management believes that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with the company 
capital compliance the bank s tangible capital ratio at september   is 
this exceeds the tangible capital requirement of of adjusted assets by million 
the bank s leverage capital ratio at september   is 
this exceeds the leverage capital requirement of of adjusted assets by million 
the bank s risk based capital ratio is at september  the bank currently exceeds the risk based capital requirement of of risk weighted assets by million 
the office of thrift supervision ots issued a final rule on august  that adds an interest rate risk component to the risk based capital requirement for savings institutions 
savings institutions with a greater than normal interest rate exposure must take a deduction from the total capital available to meet their risk based capital requirement 
the deduction is equal to one half of the difference between the institution s actual measured exposure and the normal level of exposure 
the institution s actual measured interest rate risk is expressed as the change that occurs in its net portfolio value npv as a result of a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in interest rates whichever leads to the lower npv divided by the estimated economic value of its assets 
an above normal decline in npv is one that exceeds two percent of an institution s assets expressed in terms of economic value 
the regulation became effective january  subsequent to the issuance of the final rule on august   the ots issued a postponement of the interest rate risk requirement 
however  if the rule were to be in effect at september   the bank s capital requirement would have increased by  under the formula for calculating an interest rate risk component as described above 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes therein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services 
lending activities general the company s loan portfolio  which totaled million at september   consists primarily of first mortgage loans secured by owner occupied one to four family residences 
at september   of total loans receivable consisted of owner occupied  one to four family residential loans  of which were adjustable rate mortgage loans arms

the bank generally follows federal national mortgage association fnma and federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc underwriting guidelines for all one to four family residential mortgage loans 
the bank s primary source of loan originations is through preferred

they obtain loan referrals from realtors  builders  past customers  as well as through mass media marketing 
the bank has utilized other local wholesale mortgage brokers 
the bank purchases mortgage loans from these brokers at the time of loan closing 
the bank will only purchase residential first mortgage loans that meet the bank s underwriting standards  which generally follow fnma and fhlmc guidelines 
for the year ended september   one to four family mortgage loan originations and purchases totaled million 
the interest rates at which the bank offers to grant a mortgage are determined by the secondary market pricing for comparable mortgage backed securities  local mortgage competition  and the bank s yield requirements 
upon receipt of a completed loan application from a prospective borrower for a loan secured by one to four family residential real estate  a credit report is ordered  income and certain other information is verified and  if necessary  additional financial information is requested 
a current appraisal of the real estate intended to secure the proposed loan is required 
it is the bank s policy to obtain title insurance on all real estate first mortgage loans 
borrowers must also provide a hazard insurance policy at or before closing 
generally  the borrower s monthly mortgage payment will include  in addition to the normal principal and interest payment  escrow funds for the payment of real estate taxes and if required  private mortgage insurance and or flood insurance 
most mortgage loans originated include due on sale clauses  which provide the bank with the contractual right to deem the loan immediately due and payable in the event that the borrower transfers ownership of the property without the bank s consent 
it is the bank s policy to enforce due on sale provisions 
the bank originates or purchases one to four family residential mortgage loans in amounts up to of the appraised value of the secured property 
in cases where the loan to value ratio exceeds  the bank requires private mortgage insurance on the loan 
all one to four family mortgage loans are reviewed by the board of directors loan committee  and all loans in excess of  are individually reviewed by the board of directors prior to issuance of a commitment 
all one to four family mortgage loans between  and  require review and approval by the senior management credit review committee 
in addition to and year fixed rate mortgage loans which qualify for sale to fnma or fhlmc  the bank offers a balloon mortgage which also qualifies for sale to fnma 
this loan carries a fixed rate for years and a provision allowing for a conversion to a year fixed rate loan at the end of the initial year term at the then current interest rate 
the bank also offers fixed rate jumbo loans which are originated to be sold directly to alternative conduits 
the rates quoted for these loans and the underwriting procedures are designed to meet specific investor requirements 
as previously stated  most arm loans originated or purchased by the bank are underwritten according to fnma standards and held in portfolio 
the arm loans offered include loans that have a first payment adjustment after one  three  or five years 
the arm interest rates offered are determined by secondary market pricing  competitive conditions and the bank s yield requirements 
one year arms are underwritten based on the initial rate  as well as the fully indexed rate after the first adjustment period in order to minimize default risk 
generally  the one year arms have an annual interest rate cap of and a maximum increase of over the life of the loan 
these adjustments are based on the one year treasury index 
the three and five year arms are underwritten based upon the initial rate which approximates a fully indexed rate 
the three and five year arms carry a fixed rate for the first three or five years and adjusts annually thereafter in the same manner as the one year arm 
the bank also offers a three three arm which adjusts every three years based upon the three year treasury index and has a maximum rate adjustment and a maximum rate increase over the life of the loan 
as compared to fixed rate loans  arm loans generally pose different risks 
in a rising interest rate environment  the underlying loan payment rises  which increases the potential for default by the borrower 
at the same time  the marketability of the underlying property may be adversely affected by higher interest rates 
in a decreasing rate environment  mortgagors tend to refinance into fixed rate loans 
mortgage banking program the mortgage banking activities of the bank are performed in conjunction with the origination and purchase of conforming fixed rate mortgage loans which are securitized through fnma for sale into the secondary market  generally with servicing retained 
the servicing fee income is generally 
of the total loan balances serviced 
the bank s interest rate risk management policy specifies the use of certain hedging activities in an attempt to reduce exposure to changes in loan market prices from the time of commitment until securitization 
the bank engages in hedging transactions as a method of reducing its exposure to interest rate risk present in the secondary market 
the bank s hedging transactions are generally forward commitments to sell fixed rate mortgage backed securities at a specified price and at a specified future date 
the loans securitized through fnma are generally used to satisfy these forward commitments 
the sale of fixed rate mortgage backed securities for future delivery presents a risk to the bank that  if the bank is not able to deliver the mortgage backed securities on the specified delivery date  it may be required to repurchase the forward commitment to sell at the then current market price 
the mortgage banking activities of preferred consist of originating mortgage loans for correspondent lenders 
preferred presents loan applications to these lenders to be underwritten and accepted by issuing a funding commitment

equity lines of credit and consumer loans the bank originates home equity loans secured by one to four family residences in its primary market area

environmental issues the company encounters certain environmental risks in its lending activities 
under federal and state environmental laws  lenders may become liable for the costs of cleaning up hazardous materials found on security property 
although environmental risks are usually associated with industrial and commercial loans  risks may be substantial for residential lenders like the company if environmental contamination makes security property unsuitable for use 
this could also have an effect on nearby property values 
in accordance with fnma and fhlmc guidelines  appraisals for single family residences on which the company lends include comment on environmental influences 
the company attempts to control risk by training its appraisers and underwriters to be cognizant of signs indicative of environmental hazards

procedures taken with respect to delinquent loans differ depending on whether the loan is serviced by the bank or serviced by others 
the bank s collection procedures with respect to loans serviced by the bank include sending a past due notice to the borrower on the seventeenth day of nonpayment  making telephone contact with the borrower  sending a second late notice on the twenty third day of nonpayment and a letter on the last day of the month 
a notice of intent to foreclose is sent on the forty fifth day of delinquency 
when the borrower is contacted  the bank attempts to obtain full payment of the amount past due 
however  the bank generally will seek to reach agreement with the borrower on a forbearance plan to avoid foreclosure 
with respect to loans serviced by others  of which the bank had million at september   the bank obtains monthly reports from the loan servicers 
the bank contacts the servicer with respect to any loan that becomes delinquent days or more to review collection efforts 
the bank reviews the servicer s recommendation regarding foreclosure when a loan is between and days delinquent and instructs the servicer to proceed in accordance with the bank s instructions

accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan and sfas no 
accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures effective october  these statements apply to all loans that are identified for evaluation except for large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment

an asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the paying capacity and net worth of the obligor or the collateral pledged  if any 
substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard  with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full  highly questionable and improbable  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values 
assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted 
assets which do not currently expose the insured institution to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses are required to be designated special mention by management 
when an insured institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful  it is required to establish general allowances for losses in an amount deemed prudent by management 
general allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities  but which  unlike specific allowances  have not been allocated to particular problem assets 
when an insured institution classifies problem assets as loss  it is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to of the amount of the asset so classified or to charge off such amount 
an institution s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the ots  which can require the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances 
the bank regularly reviews the assets in its portfolio to determine whether any assets require classification in accordance with applicable regulations 
as of september   the bank had total classified assets of  all of which were classified substandard  and consisted of foreclosed single family residential loans real estate owned 
allowance for loan losses management employs a systematic methodology to conduct its periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance based upon the bank s past loss loan experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and current and prospective economic conditions 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for losses on loans receivable

subject to various restrictions  federally chartered savings institutions may also invest a proportion of their assets in commercial paper  corporate debt securities and asset backed securities 
the company s current policy does not allow the institution to engage in interest rate swaps or joint ventures or to invest in non investment grade bonds or high risk mortgage derivatives 
the company s investment policy does  however  allow for the use of mortgage backed security short sales in hedging the amount of loans in the bank s mortgage pipeline

regulation and supervision general the company  as a savings and loan holding company  is required to file certain reports with  and otherwise comply with the rules and regulations of the ots under the home owners loan act  as amended the hola 
in addition  the activities of savings institutions  such as the bank  are governed by the hola and the federal deposit insurance act fdi act 
the bank is subject to extensive regulation  examination and supervision by the ots  as its primary federal regulator  and the fdic  as the deposit insurer 
the bank is a member of the federal home loan bank fhlb system and its deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the savings association insurance fund saif managed by the fdic 
the bank must file reports with the ots and the fdic concerning its activities and financial condition in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions such as mergers with  or acquisitions of  other savings institutions 
the ots and or the fdic conduct periodic examinations to test the bank s compliance with various regulatory requirements 
this regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors 
the regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies  including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes 
any change in such regulation  whether by the fdic  ots  or congress  could have a material adverse impact on the company  the bank and their operations 
certain of the regulatory requirements applicable to the bank and the company are referred to below or elsewhere herein 
the description of statutory provisions and regulations applicable to savings institutions and their holding companies set forth in this form k does not purport to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on the bank and the company 
holding company regulation the company is a nondiversified unitary savings and loan holding company within the meaning of the hola 
as a unitary savings and loan holding company  the company generally will not be restricted under existing laws as to the types of business activities in which it may engage  provided that the bank continues to be a qualified thrift lender qtl 
upon any non supervisory acquisition by the company of another savings institution or savings bank that meets the qtl test and is deemed to be a savings institution by the ots  the company would become a multiple savings and loan holding company if the acquired institution is held as a separate subsidiary and would be subject to extensive limitations on the types of business activities in which it could engage 
the hola limits the activities of a multiple savings and loan holding company and its non insured institution subsidiaries primarily to activities permissible for bank holding companies under section c of the bank holding company act bhc act  subject to the prior approval of the ots  and activities authorized by ots regulation 
the hola prohibits a savings and loan holding company  directly or indirectly  or through one or more subsidiaries  from acquiring more than of the voting stock of another savings institution or holding company thereof  without prior written approval of the ots  acquiring or retaining  with certain exceptions  more than of a nonsubsidiary company engaged in activities other than those permitted by the hola  or acquiring or retaining control of a depository institution that is not insured by the fdic 
in evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions  the ots must consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and institution involved  the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the insurance funds  the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors 
the ots is prohibited from approving any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings institutions in more than one state  subject to two exceptions i the approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies and ii the acquisition of a savings institution in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings institution specifically permit such acquisitions 
the states vary in the extent to which they permit interstate savings and loan holding company acquisitions 
although savings and loan holding companies are not subject to specific capital requirements or specific restrictions on the payment of dividends or other capital distributions  hola does prescribe such restrictions on subsidiary savings institutions  as described below 
the bank must notify the ots days before declaring any dividend to the company 
in addition  the financial impact of a holding company on its subsidiary institution is a matter that is evaluated by the ots and the agency has authority to order cessation of activities or divestiture of subsidiaries deemed to pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the institution 
federal savings institution regulation capital requirements the ots capital regulations require savings institutions to meet three minimum capital standards a tangible capital ratio  a leverage core capital ratio and an risk based capital ratio 
in addition  the prompt corrective action standards discussed below also establish  in effect  a minimum tangible capital standard  a leverage core capital ratio for institutions receiving the highest rating on the camel financial institution rating system  and  together with a risk based capital standard itself  a tier i risk based capital standard 
core capital is defined as common stockholders equity including retained earnings  certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus  and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less intangibles other than certain purchased mortgage servicing rights and credit card relationships 
the ots regulations also require that  in meeting the leverage ratio  tangible and risk based capital standards  institutions must generally deduct investments in and loans to subsidiaries engaged in activities not permissible for a national bank 
the risk based capital standard for savings institutions requires the maintenance of tier i core and total capital which is defined as core capital and supplementary capital to risk weighted assets of and  respectively 
in determining the amount of risk weighted assets  all assets  including certain off balance sheet assets  are multiplied by a risk weight of to  as assigned by the ots capital regulation based on the risks ots believes are inherent in the type of asset 
the components of tier i core capital are equivalent to those discussed earlier 
the components of supplementary capital currently include cumulative preferred stock  long term perpetual preferred stock  mandatory convertible securities  subordinated debt and intermediate preferred stock and the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of of risk weighted assets 
overall  the amount of supplementary capital included as part of total capital cannot exceed of core capital 
the ots regulatory capital requirements also incorporate an interest rate risk component 
savings institutions with above normal interest rate risk exposure are subject to a deduction from total capital for purposes of calculating their risk based capital requirements 
a savings institution s interest rate risk is measured by the decline in the net portfolio value of its assets ie  the difference between incoming and outgoing discounted cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts that would result from a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates divided by the estimated economic value of the institution s assets 
in calculating its total capital under the risk based capital rule  a savings institution whose measured interest rate risk exposure exceeds must deduct an amount equal to one half of the difference between the institution s measured interest rate risk and  multiplied by the estimated economic value of the institution s assets 
the director of the ots may waive or defer a savings institution s interest rate risk component on a case by case basis 
a savings institution with assets of less than million and risk based capital ratios in excess of is not subject to the interest rate risk component  unless the ots determines otherwise 
for the present time  the ots has deferred implementation of the interest rate risk component 
if the bank had been subject to an interest rate risk capital component as of september   the bank s capital requirement would have increased by  under the formula for calculating an interest rate risk component as described above 
prompt corrective action regulation under the ots prompt corrective action regulations  the ots is required to take certain supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions  the severity of which depends upon the institution s degree of undercapitalization 
generally  a savings institution is considered well capitalized if its ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets is at least  its ratio of tier i core capital to risk weighted assets is at least  its ratio of core capital to total assets is at least  and it is not subject to any order or directive by the ots to meet a specific capital level 
a savings institution generally is considered adequately capitalized if its ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets is at least  its ratio of tier i core capital to risk weighted assets is at least  and its ratio of core capital to total assets is at least if the institution receives the highest camel rating 
a savings institution that has a ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets of less than  a ratio of tier i core capital to risk weighted assets of less than or a ratio of core capital to total assets of less than or less for institutions with the highest examination rating is considered to be undercapitalized 
a savings institution that has a total risk based capital ratio less than  a tier i risk based capital ratio of less than or a leverage ratio that is less than is considered to be significantly undercapitalized and a savings institution that has a tangible capital to assets ratio equal to or less than is deemed to be critically undercapitalized 
subject to a narrow exception  the banking regulator is required to appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized 
the regulation also provides that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the ots within days of the date a savings institution receives notice that it is undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized 
compliance with the plan must be guaranteed by the parent holding company 
in addition  numerous mandatory supervisory actions become immediately applicable to an undercapitalized institution  including  but not limited to  increased monitoring by regulators and restrictions on growth  capital distributions and expansion 
the ots could also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions  including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors 
insurance of deposit accounts the fdic has adopted a risk based deposit insurance system that assesses deposit insurance premiums according to the level of risk involved in an institution s activities 
an institution s risk category is based upon whether the institution is classified as well capitalized  adequately capitalized or undercapitalized and one of three supervisory subcategories within each capital group 
the supervisory subgroup to which an institution is assigned is based on a supervisory evaluation and information which the fdic determines to be relevant to the institution s financial condition and the risk posed to the deposit insurance fund 
based on its capital and supervisory subgroups  each saif member institution is assigned an annual fdic assessment rate between basis points for an institution in the highest category ie  well capitalized and healthy and basis points for an institution in the lowest category ie  undercapitalized and posing substantial supervisory concern 
the fdic has authority to further raise premiums if deemed necessary 
if such action is taken  it could have an adverse effect on the earnings of the bank 
on september   the president signed into law the deposit insurance funds act of the funds act which  among other things  imposed a special one time assessment on saif member institutions  including the bank  to recapitalize the saif 
as required by the funds act  the fdic imposed a special assessment of basis points on saif assessable deposits held as of march   payable november  a special assessment of million was recognized by the bank as an expense in the fourth quarter 
the special assessment is tax deductible  which led to an after tax charge of million  or per share 
the funds act also spreads the obligations for payment of the financing corporation fico bonds across all saif and bif members 
beginning on january   bif deposits will be assessed for fico payments at a rate of of the rate assessed on saif deposits 
based on current estimates by the fdic  bif deposits will be assessed a fico payment of basis points  while saif deposits will be assessed an estimated basis points 
full pro rata sharing of the fico payments between bif and saif members will occur on the earlier of january  or the date the bif and saif are merged 
the funds act specifies that the bif and saif will be merged on january   provided no savings associations remain as of that time 
as a result of the funds act  the fdic recently proposed to lower saif assessments to to basis points effective january   a range comparable to that of bif members 
however  saif members will continue to make higher fico payments described above 
management cannot predict the level of fdic insurance assessments on an on going basis  whether the savings association charter will be eliminated  or whether the bif and saif will eventually be merged 
under the fdi act  insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices  is an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law  regulation  rule  order or condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance 
loans to one borrower under hola  savings institutions are generally subject to the limits on loans to one borrower applicable to national banks 
generally  savings institutions may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of of its unimpaired capital and surplus 
an additional amount may be lent  equal to of unimpaired capital and surplus  if such loan is secured by readily marketable collateral  which is defined to include certain financial instruments and bullion 
at september   the bank s limit on loans to one borrower was million 
at september   the bank s largest aggregate outstanding balance of loans to one borrower consisted of two loans totaling million 
qtl test the hola requires savings institutions to meet a qtl test 
under the qtl test  a savings and loan association is required to maintain at least of its portfolio assets total assets less i specified liquid assets up to of total assets  ii intangibles  including goodwill  and iii the value of property used to conduct business in certain qualified thrift investments primarily residential mortgages and related investments  including certain mortgage backed securities in at least months out of each month period 
a savings institution that fails the qtl test is subject to certain operating restrictions and may be required to convert to a bank charter 
as of september   the bank maintained of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments and  therefore  met the qtl test 
limitations on capital distributions ots regulations impose limitations on all capital distributions by savings institutions 
capital distributions include cash dividends  payments to repurchase or otherwise acquire the savings association s shares  payments to stockholders of another institution in a cash out merger and other distributions charged against capital 
the rule establishes three tiers of institutions  which are based primarily on an institution s capital level 
an institution that exceeds all fully phased in capital requirements before and after a proposed capital distribution tier bank and has not been advised by the ots that it is in need of more than normal supervision  could  after prior notice but without obtaining approval of the ots  make capital distributions during a calendar year up to i of its net earnings to date during the calendar year plus the amount that would reduce by one half its surplus capital ratio the excess capital over its fully phased in capital requirements at the beginning of the calendar year or ii of its net income for the previous four quarters 
any additional capital distributions would require prior regulatory approval 
in the event the bank s capital fell below its regulatory requirements or the ots notified it that it was in need of more than normal supervision  the bank s ability to make capital distributions could be restricted 
in addition  the ots could prohibit a proposed capital distribution by any institution  which would otherwise be permitted by the regulation  if the ots determines that such distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice 
in december  the ots proposed amendments to its capital distribution regulation that would generally authorize the payment of capital distributions without ots approval provided the payment does not make the institution undercapitalized within the meaning of the prompt corrective action regulation 
however  institutions in a holding company structure would still have a prior notice requirement 
at september   the bank is a tier bank 
liquidity federally insured savings associations are required to maintain an average daily balance of liquid assets equal to a certain percentage of the sum of average daily balances of net withdrawable deposit accounts and borrowings payable in one year or less 
the liquidity requirement may vary from time to time between and depending upon economic conditions and savings flows of all savings associations 
at the present time  the required liquid asset ratio is 
for purposes of this ratio  liquid assets include specified short term assets such as cash  certain time deposits  certain bankers acceptances and short term united states treasury obligations  and long term assets such as united states treasury obligations of more than one and less than five years and federal agency obligations with a minimum term of months 
the regulations governing liquidity requirements include as liquid assets debt securities hedged with forward commitments obtained from dealers in united states government securities or associations whose accounts are insured by the fdic  debt securities directly hedged with a short financial futures position  and debt securities that provide the holder with a right to redeem the security at par value  regardless of the stated maturities of such securities 
the ots has also designated as liquid assets certain mortgage related securities and certain mortgage loans qualifying as backing for certain mortgage backed securities with less than one year to maturity 
short term liquid assets currently must constitute at least of an association s average daily balance of net withdrawable deposit accounts and current borrowings 
penalties may be imposed upon associations for violations of the liquidity requirements 
the monthly average liquidity ratio of the bank for september was and exceeded the then applicable requirement of 
assessments savings institutions are required to pay assessments to the ots to fund the agency s operations 
the general assessment  paid on a semi annual basis  is computed upon the savings institution s total assets  including consolidated subsidiaries  as reported in the bank s latest quarterly thrift financial report 
the assessment paid by the bank for the fiscal year ended september  totaled  branching ots regulations permit nationwide branching by federally chartered savings institutions to the extent allowed by federal statute 
this permits federal savings institutions to establish interstate networks and to geographically diversify their loan portfolios and lines of business 
the ots authority preempts any state law purporting to regulate branching by federal savings institutions 
transactions with related parties section of hola provides that transactions between an insured subsidiary of a holding company and an affiliate thereof will be subject to the restrictions that apply to transactions between banks that are members of the federal reserve system and their affiliates pursuant to sections a and b of the federal reserve act fra 
generally  sections a and b i limit the extent to which a financial institution or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with an affiliate  to an amount equal to of the institution s capital and surplus  and limit all covered transactions in the aggregate with all affiliates to an amount equal to of such capital and surplus  and ii require that all transactions with an affiliate  whether or not covered transactions  be on terms substantially the same  or at least as favorable to the institution or subsidiary as those provided to a non affiliate 
the term covered transaction includes the making of loans  purchase of assets  issuance of a guarantee and similar types of transactions 
management believes that the bank is in compliance with the requirements of sections a and b 
in addition to the restrictions that apply to financial institutions generally under sections a and b  section of the hola places three other restrictions on savings associations  including those that are part of a holding company organization 
first  savings associations may not make any loan or extension of credit to an affiliate unless that affiliate is engaged only in activities permissible for bank holding companies 
second  savings associations may not purchase or invest in affiliate securities except for those of a subsidiary 
finally  the director is granted authority to impose more stringent restrictions when justifiable for reasons of safety and soundness 
extensions of credit by the bank to executive officers  directors  and principal stockholders and related interests of such persons are subject to sections g and h of the fra and subpart a of the federal reserve board s regulation o 
these rules prohibit loans to any such individual where the aggregate amount exceeds an amount equal to of an institution s unimpaired capital and surplus plus an additional of unimpaired capital and surplus in the case of loans that are fully secured by readily marketable collateral  and or when the aggregate amount outstanding to all such individuals exceeds the institution s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus 
these rules also provide that no institution shall make any loan or extension of credit in any manner to any of its executive officers or directors  or to any person who directly or indirectly  or acting through or in concert with one or more persons  owns  controls  or has the power to vote more than of any class of voting securities of such institution principal stockholder  or to a related interest ie  any company controlled by such executive officer  director  or principal stockholder  or to any political or campaign committee the funds or services of which will benefit such executive officer  director  or principal stockholder or which is controlled by such executive officer  director  or principal stockholder  unless such loan or extension of credit is made on substantially the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons  does not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features  and the institution follows underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than those applicable to comparable transactions by the institution with persons who are not executive officers  directors  principal stockholders  or employees of the institution 
a savings association is therefore prohibited from making any new loans or extensions or credit to the savings association s executive officers  directors  and stockholders at different rates or terms than those offered to the general public 
the rules identify limited circumstances in which an institution is permitted to extend credit to executive officers 
management believes that the bank is in compliance with sections g and h of the fra and subpart a of the federal reserve board s regulation o 
enforcement under the fdi act  the ots has primary enforcement responsibility over savings institutions and has the authority to bring actions against the institution and all institution affiliated parties  including stockholders  and any attorneys  appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on an insured institution 
formal enforcement action may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers and or directors to institution of proceedings for receivership  conservatorship or termination of deposit insurance 
civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and an amount to  per day  or even million per day in especially egregious cases 
under the fdi act  the fdic has the authority to recommend to the director of the ots enforcement action to be taken with respect to a particular savings institution 
if action is not taken by the director  the fdic has authority to take such action under certain circumstances 
federal law also establishes criminal penalties for certain violations 
standards for safety and soundness the federal banking agencies have adopted interagency guidelines prescribing standards for safety and soundness guidelines and a final rule to implement safety and soundness standards required under the fdi act 
the guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired 
the standards set forth in the guidelines address internal controls and information systems  internal audit system  credit underwriting  loan documentation  interest rate risk exposure  asset growth  and compensation  fees and benefits 
federal home loan bank system the bank is a member of the federal home loan bank fhlb of chicago  which is one of the regional fhlbs 
as a member of the fhlb  the bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the fhlb of chicago in an amount equal to the greater of of its aggregate unpaid residential mortgage loans  home purchase contracts or similar obligations at the beginning of each year  or or such greater fraction as established by the fhlb of outstanding fhlb advances 
at september  the bank had million in fhlb of chicago stock  which was in compliance with this requirement 
fhlb advances must be secured by specific types of collateral and may be obtained primarily for the purpose of providing funds for residential housing finance 
the fhlbs are required to provide funds to cover certain obligations on bonds issued to fund the resolution of insolvent thrifts and to contribute funds for affordable housing programs 
these requirements could reduce the amount of dividends that the fhlbs pay to their members and could also result in the fhlbs imposing a higher rate of interest on advances to their members 
for the years ended september   and  dividends from the fhlb chicago to the bank amounted to   and  respectively 
if dividends were reduced  or interest on future fhlb advances increased  the bank s net interest income might also be reduced 
federal reserve system federal reserve board regulations require all depository institutions to maintain non interest earning reserves against their transaction accounts primarily now checking accounts and non personal time deposits 
reserves of must be maintained against total transaction accounts of million or less after a million exemption  and an initial reserve of subject to adjustment by the federal reserve board to a level between and must be maintained against that portion of total transaction accounts in excess of such amount 
at september   the bank was in compliance with these reserve requirements 
the balances maintained to meet the reserve requirements imposed by the federal reserve board may be used to satisfy liquidity requirements that may be imposed by the ots 
recent and proposed changes in accounting rules in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
provides guidance for the recognition and measurement of impairment of long lived assets  certain identifiable intangibles  and goodwill related both to assets to be held and used and assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
requires entities to perform separate calculations for assets to be held and used to determine whether recognition of an impairment loss is required and  if so  to measure the impairment 
sfas no 
requires long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be disposed of to be reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
the company does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on its consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
is effective for the company in fiscal this statement applies to all transactions in which an entity acquires goods or services by issuing equity instruments or by incurring liabilities where the payment amounts are based on the entity s common stock price  except for employee stock ownership plans esops 
a new method of accounting for stock based compensation arrangements with employees is established by the statement 
the new method is a fair value based method rather than the intrinsic value based method that is contained in apb opinion no 
however  the statement does not require an entity to adopt the new fair value based method for purposes of preparing its financial statements 
entities are allowed to continue to use the opinion no 
method or adopt the sfas no 
fair value based method 
the fair value based method will result in higher compensation cost than the opinion no 
intrinsic value based method for fixed stock option compensation plans and will result in a different compensation cost for variable stock option compensation plans 
for entities not adopting sfas no 
fair value based method  the statement requires those entities to display in the footnotes pro forma net income and earnings per share information as if the fair value based method had been adopted 
the company does not intend to elect the fair value based method of expense recognition for stock based compensation as contemplated by sfas no 
 rather will adopt the pro forma disclosure alternative provided in sfas no 
 and continue to account for stock based compensation under apb opinion no 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
this statement  among other things  applies a financial components approach that focuses on control  whereby an entity recognizes the financial and servicing assets it controls and the liabilities it has incurred  derecognizes assets when control has been surrendered  and derecognizes liabilities when extinguished 
sfas no 
provides consistent standards for distinguishing transfers of financial assets that are sales from transfers that are secured borrowings 
sfas no 
is effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after december  the company does not expect this pronouncement to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
the foregoing does not constitute a comprehensive summary of all material changes or developments affecting the manner in which the company keeps its books and records and performs its financial accounting responsibilities 
it is intended only as a summary of some of the recent pronouncements made by the fasb which are of particular interest to financial institutions
