item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s strategy is concentrated on three components of its business loan production  loan servicing and businesses ancillary to mortgage lending 
see business mortgage banking operations 
the company intends to continue its efforts to increase its market share of  and realize increased income from  its loan production 
in addition  the company is engaged in building its loan servicing portfolio because of the returns it can earn from such investment 
a strong production capability and a growing servicing portfolio are the primary means used by the company to reduce the sensitivity of its earnings to changes in interest rates because loan production income characteristics are countercyclical to the effect of interest rate changes on servicing income 
finally  the company is involved in business activities complementary to its mortgage banking business  such as acting as agent in the sale of homeowners  fire  flood  earthquake  mortgage life and disability insurance to its mortgagors  providing various title insurance and escrow services in the capacity of an agent rather than an underwriter  brokering servicing contracts and trading mortgage backed securities mbs and other mortgage related assets 
the company s results of operations historically have been primarily influenced by i the level of demand for mortgage credit  which is affected by such external factors as the level of interest rates  the strength of the various segments of the economy and the demographics of the company s lending markets  ii the direction of interest rates and iii the relationship between mortgage interest rates and the cost of funds 
the company s performance during the fiscal year ended february  fiscal set new operating records 
in calendar year  the company became the nation s largest servicer of single family mortgages and at february  had a servicing portfolio of billion  an increase of over the portfolio at the end of fiscal this servicing portfolio growth was accomplished through increased loan production volume of low coupon mortgages 
in addition  the company acquired bulk servicing rights with an aggregate principal balance of billion 
in fiscal  the company also maintained its position as the nation s leader in originations of single family mortgages for the second consecutive year 
this performance was due to i continued implementation of the company s production expansion strategy designed to penetrate new markets and expand in existing markets  particularly outside california  and to further increase market share  ii a continued decline in average mortgage interest rates that prevailed during most of and iii introduction of new technologies that improved productivity 
in fiscal  the company s market share increased to approximately of the estimated trillion single family mortgage origination market  up from approximately of the estimated billion market in fiscal the fiscal year ended february  fiscal was a period of transition from a mortgage market dominated by refinances resulting from historically low interest rates to an extremely competitive and smaller mortgage market in which refinances declined to a relatively small percentage of total fundings and customer preference for adjustable rate mortgages increased 
in this transition  which resulted from the increase in interest rates during the year  intense price competition developed that resulted in the company experiencing negative production margins in fiscal at the same time  the increase in interest rates caused a decline in the prepayment rate in the servicing portfolio which  combined with a decline in the rate of expected future prepayments  caused a reduction in amortization of the capitalized servicing fees receivable and purchased servicing rights servicing assets 
this decrease in amortization contributed to improved earnings from the company s servicing activities 
the company addressed the challenges of the year by i expanding its share of the home purchase market  ii reducing costs to maintain its production infrastructure in line with reduced production levels and iii accelerating the growth of its servicing portfolio by aggressively acquiring servicing contracts through bulk purchases 
these strategies produced the following results i home purchase production increased from billion  or of total fundings  in fiscal to billion  or of total fundings  in fiscal  helping the company maintain its position as the nation s leader in originations of single family mortgages for the third consecutive year  ii the number of staff engaged in production activities declined from approximately  at the end of fiscal to approximately  at the end of fiscal  iii production related and overhead costs declined from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and iv bulk servicing purchases increased to billion in fiscal from billion in fiscal these bulk servicing acquisitions  combined with slower prepayments caused by increased mortgage interest rates  helped the company maintain its position as the nation s largest servicer of single family mortgages for the second consecutive year 
in fiscal  the company s market share decreased to approximately of the estimated billion single family mortgage origination market 
the fiscal year ended february  fiscal was a record year in profits for the company 
loan production increased to billion from billion in fiscal the company attributes the increase to i a decline in mortgage interest rates during most of the year  ii the implementation of a national advertising campaign aimed at developing a brand identity for countrywide and reaching the consumer directly and iii the opening of two telemarketing centers which  through the use of proprietary systems  provide product information specific to the potential borrower s needs and allow a telemarketer to take an application and pass it to a branch office for processing 
for calendar  the company ranked second in amount of single family mortgage originations nationwide 
in fiscal  the company s market share increased to approximately of the estimated billion single family mortgage origination market  up from approximately of the estimated billion market in fiscal the interest rate environment that prevailed during fiscal was favorable for fixed rate mortgages 
additionally  the percentage of loan production attributable to refinances increased from in fiscal to in fiscal  as borrowers took advantage of declining interest rates 
during fiscal  the company s loan servicing portfolio grew to billion from billion at the end of fiscal this growth resulted from the company s loan production during the year and bulk servicing acquisitions amounting to billion  partially offset by prepayments  partial prepayments and scheduled amortization of billion 
the prepayment rate in the servicing portfolio was  up from the prior year due to the decreasing mortgage interest rate environment in fiscal however  this rate was lower than the prepayment rate in fiscal because a substantial number of loans in the servicing portfolio were produced in fiscal and bear interest at rates lower than the lowest interest rate level reached during fiscal results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal revenues for fiscal increased to million from million for fiscal net earnings increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal effective march   the company adopted sfas no 
sfas no 
amended sfas no 
 accounting for certain mortgage banking activities 
since sfas no 
prohibits retroactive application  historical accounting results have not been restated and  accordingly  the accounting results for fiscal are not directly comparable with fiscal the overall impact on the company s financial statements of adopting sfas no 
was an increase in net earnings for fiscal of million  or per share 
in addition to the accounting change  the increase in revenues and net earnings for fiscal compared to fiscal was attributable to an increase in the size of the company s servicing portfolio and improved pricing margins  partially offset by the non recurring gain on sale of servicing in fiscal which gain was offset  in part  by a non recurring write off of the servicing hedge during the same prior period 
the total volume of loans produced increased to billion for fiscal from billion for fiscal refinancings totaled billion  or of total fundings  for fiscal  as compared to billion  or of total fundings  for fiscal fixed rate mortgage loan production totaled billion  or of total fundings  for fiscal  as compared to billion  or of total fundings  for fiscal production in the company s consumer markets division increased to billion for fiscal compared to billion for fiscal production in the company s wholesale division decreased to billion for fiscal from billion for fiscal the company s correspondent division purchased billion in mortgage loans for fiscal compared to billion for fiscal the factors which affect the relative volume of production among the company s three divisions include pricing decisions and the relative competitiveness of such pricing  the level of real estate and mortgage lending activity in each division s markets  and the success of each division s sales and marketing efforts 
at february  and  the company s pipeline of loans in process was billion and billion  respectively 
in addition  at february   the company has committed to make loans in the amount of billion  subject to property identification and approval of the loans lock n shop r pipeline 
at february   the lock n shop r pipeline was billion 
historically  approximately to of the pipeline of loans in process has funded 
in fiscal and fiscal  the company received  and  new loan applications  respectively  at an average daily rate of million and million  respectively 
the following actions were taken during fiscal on the total applications received during that year  loans of total applications received were funded and  applications of total applications received were either rejected by the company or withdrawn by the applicant 
the following actions were taken during fiscal on the total applications received during that year  loans of total applications received were funded and  applications of total applications received were either rejected by the company or withdrawn by the applicant 
the factors that affect the percentage of applications received and funded during a given time period include the movement and direction of interest rates  the average length of loan commitments issued  the creditworthiness of applicants  the production divisions loan processing efficiency and loan pricing decisions 
loan origination fees decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily because production by the correspondent division which  due to lower cost structures  charges lower origination fees per dollar loaned comprised a greater percentage of total production in fiscal than in fiscal gain loss on sale of loans improved in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to improved pricing margins and the impact of adopting sfas no 
sfas no 
requires recognition of originated mortgage servicing rights omsrs  as well as purchased mortgage servicing rights pmsrs  as assets by allocating total costs incurred between the loan and the servicing rights based on their relative fair values 
this accounting methodology  in turn  increases the gain or reduces the loss on sale of loans as compared to the accounting results obtained from sfas no 
 the previously applicable standard 
under sfas no 
 the cost of omsrs was not recognized as an asset and was included in the gain or loss recorded when the related loans were sold 
the separate impact of recognizing omsrs as assets in the company s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
for fiscal was an increase in gain on sale of loans of million 
with respect to pmsrs  sfas no 
has a different cost allocation methodology than sfas no 
in contrast to a cost allocation based on relative market value as set forth in sfas no 
 the prior requirement was to allocate the costs incurred in excess of the market value of the loans without the servicing rights to pmsrs 
in fiscal  the separate impact of the application of sfas no 
cost allocation method  along with the effect of changes in market conditions  was to reduce pmsr capitalization  and therefore negatively impact gain loss on sale of loans  by million 
in general  loan origination fees and gain loss on sale of loans are affected by numerous factors including loan pricing decisions  interest rate volatility  the general direction of interest rates and the volume and mix of loans produced 
net interest income interest earned net of interest charges decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal net interest income is principally a function of i net interest income earned from the company s mortgage loan warehouse million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  ii interest expense related to the company s investment in servicing rights million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively and iii interest income earned from the custodial balances associated with the company s servicing portfolio million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the company earns interest on  and incurs interest expense to carry  mortgage loans held in its warehouse 
the decrease in net interest income from the mortgage loan warehouse was primarily attributable to a lower net earnings rate 
the increase in interest expense on the investment in servicing rights resulted primarily from a larger servicing portfolio and an increase in the payments of interest to certain investors pursuant to customary servicing arrangements with regard to paid off loans in excess of the interest earned on these loans through their respective payoff dates interest costs incurred on payoffs 
the increase in net interest income earned from the custodial balances was related to an increase in the earnings rate and an increase in the average custodial balances caused by growth of the servicing portfolio and an increase in prepayments from fiscal to fiscal during fiscal  loan administration income was positively affected by the continued growth of the loan servicing portfolio 
at february   the company serviced billion of loans including billion of loans subserviced for others compared to billion including billion of loans subserviced for others at february   a increase 
the growth in the company s servicing portfolio during fiscal was the result of loan production volume and the acquisition of bulk servicing rights  partially offset by prepayments  partial prepayments and scheduled amortization of mortgage loans 
the weighted average interest rate of the mortgage loans in the company s servicing portfolio at february   was compared to at february  generally  it is the company s strategy to build and retain its servicing portfolio because of the returns the company can earn from such investment and because the company believes that servicing income is countercyclical to loan production income 
see prospective trends market factors 
during fiscal  the prepayment rate of the company s servicing portfolio was  as compared to for fiscal in general  the prepayment rate is affected by the relative level of mortgage interest rates  activity in the home purchase market and the relative level of home prices in a particular market 
the increase in the prepayment rate is primarily attributable to increased refinance activity caused by decreased mortgage interest rates in fiscal from fiscal the primary means used by the company to reduce the sensitivity of its earnings to changes in interest rates is through a strong production capability and a growing servicing portfolio 
to mitigate the effect on earnings of higher amortization and impairment which are deducted from loan servicing income resulting from increased prepayment activity  the company acquires financial instruments  including derivative contracts  that increase in value when interest rates decline the servicing hedge 
these financial instruments include call options on interest rate futures and mbs  interest rate floors  interest rate swaps with the company s maximum payment capped swap caps  principal only p o swaps and certain tranches of collateralized mortgage obligations cmos 
in the interest rate swap caps contracts  the company receives and pays interest on a specified notional amount 
the rate received is fixed  and the rate paid is adjustable  is indexed to the london interbank offered rates for us dollar deposits libor and has a specified maximum  or cap 
the p o swaps are derivative contracts  the value of which is determined by changes in the value of a referenced p o security 
the payments received by the company under the p o swaps relate to the cash flows of the referenced p o security 
the payments made by the company are based upon a notional amount tied to the remaining balance of the referenced p o security multiplied by a floating rate indexed to libor 
the cmos  which consist primarily of p o securities  have been purchased at deep discounts to their par values 
as interest rates decline  prepayments on the collateral underlying the cmos should increase 
these changes should result in a decline in the average lives of the p o securities and an increase in the present values of their cash flows 
the servicing hedge instruments utilized by the company are designed to protect the value of the investment in servicing rights from the effects of increased prepayment activity that generally results from declining interest rates 
to the extent that interest rates increase  the value of the servicing rights increases while the value of the hedge instruments declines 
with respect to the options  floors and cmos  the company is not exposed to loss beyond its initial outlay to acquire the hedge instruments 
with respect to the swap caps contracts entered into by the company as of february   the company estimates that its maximum exposure to loss over the contractual term is million 
the company s exposure to loss in the p o swaps is related to changes in the market value of the referenced p o security over the life of the contract 
in fiscal  the company recognized a net gain of million from its servicing hedge 
the net gain included unrealized gains of million and realized gains of million from the sale of various financial instruments that comprise the servicing hedge 
as a part of the adoption of sfas no 
 the company has revised its servicing hedge accounting policy  effective march   to adjust the basis of the servicing assets for unrealized gains or losses in the derivative financial instruments comprising the servicing hedge 
there can be no assurance that the company s servicing hedge will generate gains in the future  or if gains are generated  that they will fully offset impairment of the servicing assets 
see note f to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company recorded amortization and impairment of its servicing assets for fiscal totaling million consisting of amortization amounting to million and impairment of million  compared to million of amortization for fiscal sfas no 
requires that all capitalized mortgage servicing rights be evaluated for impairment based on the excess of the carrying amount of the mortgage servicing rights over their fair value 
under sfas no 
 the impairment evaluation could be made using either discounted or undiscounted cash flows 
no uniform required level of disaggregation was specified 
the company used a disaggregated undiscounted method 
the factors affecting the amount of amortization and impairment recorded in an accounting period include the level of prepayments during the period  the change in prepayment expectations and the amount of servicing hedge gains 
during fiscal  the company acquired bulk servicing rights for loans with principal balances aggregating billion at a price of million or of the aggregate outstanding principal balances of the servicing portfolios acquired 
during fiscal  the company acquired bulk servicing rights for loans with principal balances aggregating billion at a price of million or of the aggregate outstanding principal balances of the servicing portfolios acquired 
during fiscal  the company sold servicing rights for loans with principal balances of billion and recognized a gain of million 
no servicing rights were sold during fiscal salaries and related expenses are summarized below for fiscal and fiscal dollar amounts in fiscal thousands production loan corporate other activities administration administration activities total base salaries      incentive bonus     payroll taxes and benefits      total salaries and related expenses      average number of    employees dollar amounts in fiscal thousands production loan corporate other activities administration administration activities total base salaries      incentive bonus     payroll taxes and benefits     total salaries and related expenses      average number of   employees the amount of salaries increased during fiscal primarily due to the increased number of employees resulting from a larger servicing portfolio and growth in the company s non mortgage banking subsidiaries 
incentive bonuses earned during fiscal increased primarily due to increased loan production 
occupancy and other office expenses for fiscal slightly increased to million from million for fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to a larger loan servicing portfolio 
guarantee fees fees paid to guarantee timely and full payment of principal and interest on mbs and whole loans sold to permanent investors and to transfer the credit risk of the loans in the servicing portfolio for fiscal increased to million from million for fiscal this increase resulted primarily from an increase in the servicing portfolio 
marketing expenses for fiscal increased to million from million for fiscal  reflecting the company s implementation of a new marketing plan 
in fiscal  the company incurred an million charge related to the consolidation and relocation of branch and administrative offices that occurred as a result of the reduction in staff caused by declining production 
no such charge was incurred in fiscal other operating expenses for fiscal increased from fiscal by million  or 
this increase was due primarily to an increase in unreimbursed costs on foreclosed loans resulting from a larger servicing portfolio  and an increased provision for bad debts resulting from home equity and b c loans held in portfolio pending securitization 
profitability of loan production and servicing activities in fiscal  the company s pre tax earnings from its loan production activities which include loan origination and purchases  warehousing and sales was million 
in fiscal  the company s comparable pre tax loss was million 
the increase of million was primarily attributable to improved pricing margins  the effect of the adoption of sfas no 
previously discussed and a change of million in the company s internal method of allocating overhead between its production and servicing activities 
in fiscal  the company s pre tax earnings from its loan servicing activities which include administering the loans in the servicing portfolio  selling homeowners and other insurance and acting as tax payment agent was million as compared to million in fiscal the increase of million was principally due to the increase in the size of the servicing portfolio  partially offset by the change in the company s internal overhead allocation method discussed above and a non recurring gain on sale of servicing in fiscal which was offset  in part  by a non recurring write off of the servicing hedge 
fiscal compared with fiscal revenues for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal net earnings decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in revenues was due to decreased loan production resulting from increased mortgage interest rates in fiscal in addition  intense price competition during fiscal resulted in the company s recording a loss on the sale of loans 
the company had a gain on sale of loans in fiscal in fiscal  the company did not realize any servicing hedge gains  in addition  amortization of option and interest rate floor premiums related to the servicing hedge amounted to million and the write off of the remaining unamortized costs of the company s prior servicing hedge amounted to million 
during fiscal  the company realized million in net servicing hedge gains 
these negative effects experienced in fiscal were somewhat offset by the favorable impact of a larger and more slowly prepaying loan servicing portfolio and of a gain recognized on the sale of servicing 
the decrease in net earnings for fiscal was primarily the result of the decrease in revenues  a smaller decline in expenses than revenues from fiscal to fiscal  higher guarantee fees caused by the larger servicing portfolio and a charge due to the company s downsizing and office consolidation process 
the total volume of loans produced decreased to billion for fiscal from billion for fiscal refinancings totaled billion  or of total fundings  for fiscal  as compared to billion  or of total fundings  for fiscal arm loan production totaled billion  or of total fundings  for fiscal  as compared to billion  or of total fundings for fiscal production in the company s consumer markets division decreased to billion for fiscal compared to combined production of billion for the retail and consumer divisions which divisions were combined into the consumer markets division for fiscal production in the company s wholesale division decreased to billion which included approximately billion of originated loans and billion of purchased loans for fiscal from billion which included approximately billion of originated loans and billion of purchased loans for fiscal the company s correspondent division purchased billion in mortgage loans for fiscal compared to billion for fiscal at february  and  the company s pipeline of loans in process was billion and billion  respectively 
in addition  at february  and  the company s lock n shop r pipeline was billion and billion  respectively 
in fiscal and fiscal  the company received  and  new loan applications  respectively  at an average daily rate of million and million  respectively

the following actions were taken during fiscal on the total applications received during that year  loans of total applications received were funded and  applications of total applications received were either rejected by the company or withdrawn by the applicant 
loan origination fees decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal and a loss was recorded in fiscal on the sale of loans due to lower loan production that resulted from an increase in the level of mortgage interest rates 
reduced margins due to increased price competition caused by lower demand for mortgage loans during fiscal than fiscal also contributed to the loss on the sale of loans 
net interest income interest earned net of interest charges decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal consolidated net interest income is principally a function of i net interest income earned from the company s mortgage loan warehouse million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  ii interest expense related to the company s investment in servicing rights million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively and iii interest income earned from the custodial balances associated with the company s servicing portfolio million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in net interest income from the mortgage loan warehouse was attributable to a decrease in the average amount of the mortgage loan warehouse due to the decline in production and to a decrease in the net earnings rate 
the decrease in interest expense on the investment in servicing rights resulted primarily from a decline in interest costs incurred on payoffs 
the increase in net interest income earned from the custodial balances was related to an increase in the earnings rate  offset somewhat by a decline in the average custodial balances from fiscal to fiscal during fiscal  loan administration income was positively affected by the continued growth of the company s loan servicing portfolio 
at february   the company serviced billion of loans including billion of loans subserviced for others compared to billion including billion of loans subserviced for others at february   a increase 
the growth in the company s servicing portfolio during fiscal was the result of loan production volume and the acquisition of bulk servicing rights  partially offset by prepayments  partial prepayments  scheduled amortization of mortgage loans and a sale of servicing rights of loans with principal balances of billion 
the weighted average interest rate of the mortgage loans in the company s servicing portfolio at february   was compared to at february  during fiscal  the prepayment rate of the company s servicing portfolio was  as compared to for fiscal for fiscal  total amortization amounted to million  representing an annual rate of of average servicing assets 
during fiscal  the company did not realize any servicing hedge gains  in addition  amortization of option and interest rate floor premiums related to the servicing hedge amounted to million 
also during fiscal  the company decided to replace its prior servicing hedge with a new hedge resulting in a write down of the remaining unamortized costs of the prior hedge of million 
for fiscal  total amortization was million  or an annual rate of of the average servicing assets 
amortization for fiscal was offset by servicing hedge gains which aggregated million 
the decline in the rate of amortization from fiscal to fiscal resulted primarily from a decline in the current and projected future prepayment rates caused by an increase in mortgage interest rates 
during fiscal  the company acquired bulk servicing rights for loans with principal balances aggregating billion at a price of million or of the aggregate outstanding principal balances of the servicing portfolios acquired 
during fiscal  the company acquired bulk servicing rights for loans with principal balances aggregating billion at a price of million or of the aggregate outstanding principal balances of the servicing portfolios acquired 
during fiscal  the company sold servicing rights for loans with principal balances of billion and recognized a gain of million 
no servicing rights were sold during fiscal salaries and related expenses are summarized below for fiscal and fiscal dollar amounts in fiscal thousands production loan corporate other activities administration administration activities total base salaries      incentive bonus     payroll taxes and benefits     total salaries and related expenses      average number of   employees dollar amounts in fiscal thousands production loan corporate other activities administration administration activities total base salaries      incentive bonus     payroll taxes and benefits     total salaries and related expenses      average number of   employees the amount of salaries decreased during fiscal primarily due to the decreased number of employees resulting from reduced loan production  offset somewhat by increased employees due to a larger servicing portfolio 
incentive bonuses earned during fiscal decreased primarily due to decreased loan production and decreased loan production personnel 
occupancy and other office expenses for fiscal slightly increased to million from million for fiscal this was due to increased office and equipment rental expenses resulting from the opening of consumer markets division branch offices in fiscal  partially offset by a decline in expenses resulting from the closure of consumer markets division satellite offices and wholesale division branch offices 
guarantee fees fees paid to guarantee timely and full payment of principal and interest on mbs and whole loans sold to permanent investors and to transfer the credit risk of the loans in the servicing portfolio for fiscal increased to million from million for fiscal this increase resulted primarily from an increase in the servicing portfolio 
marketing expenses for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal the decrease in marketing expenses reflected the company s strategy to centralize and streamline its marketing functions 
in fiscal  the company incurred an million charge related to the consolidation and relocation of branch and administrative offices that occurred as a result of the reduction in staff caused by declining production 
other operating expenses for fiscal decreased from fiscal by million  or 
this decrease was due primarily to decreased loan production 
profitability of loan production and servicing activities in fiscal  the company s pre tax loss from its loan production activities was million 
in fiscal  the company s comparable pre tax earnings were million 
the decrease of million was primarily attributed to lower loan production and increased price competition caused by lower demand for mortgage loans 
in fiscal  the company s pre tax earnings from its loan servicing activities was million as compared to million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in the servicing portfolio  a reduction in amortization due to lower prepayment activity and reduced prepayment expectations and a sale of servicing during fiscal which resulted in a gain of million 
the increase was partially offset by an increase in servicing hedge expense and a write off of the remaining costs of the prior servicing hedge 
inflation inflation affects the company in the areas of loan production and servicing 
interest rates normally increase during periods of high inflation and decrease during periods of low inflation 
historically  as interest rates increase  loan production  particularly from loan refinancings  decreases  although in an environment of gradual interest rate increases  purchase activity may actually be stimulated by an improving economy or the anticipation of increasing real estate values 
in such periods of reduced loan production  production margins may decline due to increased competition resulting from overcapacity in the market 
in a higher interest rate environment  servicing related earnings are enhanced because prepayment rates tend to slow down  thereby extending the average life of the company s servicing portfolio and reducing both amortization and impairment of the servicing assets and interest costs incurred on payoffs  and because the rate of interest earned from the custodial balances tends to increase 
conversely  as interest rates decline  loan production  particularly from loan refinancings  increases 
however  during such periods  prepayment rates tend to accelerate principally on the portion of the portfolio having an interest rate higher than the then current interest rates  thereby decreasing the average life of the company s servicing portfolio and adversely impacting its servicing related earnings primarily due to increased amortization and impairment of the servicing assets  a decreased rate of interest earned from the custodial balances  and increased interest costs incurred on payoffs 
seasonality the mortgage banking industry is generally subject to seasonal trends 
these trends reflect the general national pattern of sales and resales of homes  although refinancings tend to be less seasonal and more closely related to changes in interest rates 
sales and resales of homes typically peak during the spring and summer seasons and decline to lower levels from mid november through february 
in addition  delinquency rates typically rise in the winter months  which results in higher servicing costs 
however  late charge income has historically been sufficient to offset such incremental expenses 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal financing needs are the financing of loan funding activities and the investment in servicing rights 
to meet these needs  the company currently utilizes commercial paper supported by chl s revolving credit facility  medium term notes  mbs repurchase agreements  subordinated notes  unsecured notes  pre sale funding facilities and cash flow from operations 
in june  the company completed a public offering of its common stock through the issuance and sale of  shares at a price of per share 
in addition  in the past the company has utilized whole loan repurchase agreements  servicing secured bank facilities  direct borrowings from chl s revolving credit facility  privately placed financings and public offerings of preferred stock 
see note d to the company s consolidated financial statements included herein for more information on the company s financings 
certain of the debt obligations of the company and chl contain various provisions that may affect the ability of the company and chl to pay dividends and remain in compliance with such obligations 
these provisions include requirements concerning net worth  current ratio and other financial covenants 
these provisions have not had  and are not expected to have  an adverse impact on the ability of the company and chl to pay dividends 
the company continues to investigate and pursue alternative and supplementary methods to finance its growing operations through the public and private capital markets 
these may include such methods as mortgage loan sale transactions designed to expand the company s financial capacity and reduce its cost of capital and the securitization of servicing income cash flows 
in connection with its derivative contracts  the company may be required to deposit cash or certain government securities or obtain letters of credit to meet margin requirements 
the company considers such potential margin requirements in its overall liquidity management 
in the course of the company s mortgage banking operations  the company sells to investors the mortgage loans it originates and purchases but generally retains the right to service the loans  thereby increasing the company s investment in loan servicing rights 
the company views the sale of loans on a servicing retained basis in part as an investment vehicle 
significant unanticipated prepayments in the company s servicing portfolio could have a material adverse effect on the company s future operating results and liquidity 
cash flows operating activities in fiscal  the company s operating activities used cash of approximately billion on a short term basis to fund the increase in its warehouse of mortgage loans 
the company s operating activities also generated million of positive cash flow  which was principally allocated to the long term investment in servicing as discussed below under investing activities 
investing activities the primary investing activity for which cash was used in fiscal was the investment in servicing rights 
net cash used by investing activities increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal financing activities net cash provided by financing activities amounted to billion for fiscal net cash used by financing activities amounted to billion for fiscal the increase in net cash provided was primarily the result of higher net short term borrowings by the company in fiscal and from the issuance and sale of common stock 
prospective trends applications and pipeline of loans in process during fiscal  the company received new loan applications at an average daily rate of million and at february   the company s pipeline of loans in process was billion 
this compares to a daily application rate in fiscal of million and a pipeline of loans in process at february  of billion 
during most of fiscal  interest rates decreased  resulting in an increase in demand for mortgage loans 
the size of the pipeline is generally an indication of the level of future fundings  as historically to of the pipeline of loans in process has funded 
in addition  the company s lock n shop r pipeline at february  was billion and at february  was billion 
future application levels and loan fundings are dependent on numerous factors  including the level of demand for mortgage credit  the extent of price competition in the market  the direction of interest rates  seasonal factors and general economic conditions 
for the month ended march   the average daily amount of applications received was million  and at march   the pipeline of loans in process was billion and the lock n shop r pipeline was billion 
market factors mortgage interest rates generally increased in fiscal and declined in fiscal the decline in interest rates in fiscal resulted in increased production particularly from refinancings  impairment as specified in sfas no 
of million and a servicing hedge gain of million 
conversely  the environment of rising interest rates that prevailed in fiscal resulted in lower production particularly from refinancings and greater price competition  which adversely impacted earnings from loan production activities 
in fiscal  the company took steps to maintain its productivity and efficiency  particularly in the loan production area  by reducing staff and embarking on a program to reduce production related and overhead costs 
however  the rising interest rates in that year enhanced earnings from the company s loan servicing portfolio as amortization and impairment of the servicing assets and interest costs incurred on payoffs decreased and the rate of interest earned from the custodial balances associated with the company s servicing portfolio increased 
the company s primary competitors are commercial banks  savings and loans and mortgage banking subsidiaries of diversified companies  as well as other mortgage bankers 
in fiscal  several of the mortgage banking companies that competed with the company exited the business or have been acquired by other companies  particularly banks 
the integration of these formerly independent mortgage banking companies by the acquiring institutions has not been accomplished 
therefore  management cannot evaluate the impact these transactions will have on the company or the overall market 
particularly in california  savings and loans and other portfolio lenders have competed with the company by offering aggressively priced adjustable rate mortgage products which grow in popularity when interest rates rise 
generally  the company has experienced significant price competition among mortgage lenders which has resulted in downward pressure on loan production earnings 
some regions in which the company operates  particularly some regions of california  have been experiencing slower economic growth  and real estate financing activity in these regions has been negatively impacted 
as a result  home lending activity for single one to four family residences in these regions may also have experienced slower growth 
the company s california mortgage loan production measured by principal balance constituted of its total production during both fiscal and the company is continuing its efforts to expand its production capacity outside of california 
since california s mortgage loan production constituted a significant portion of the company s production during the year  there can be no assurance that the company s operations will not continue to be adversely affected to the extent california continues to experience slow or negative economic growth resulting in decreased residential real estate lending activity or market factors further impact the company s competitive position in the state 
the delinquency rate in the company owned servicing portfolio increased to at february  from at february  the company believes that this increase was primarily the result of portfolio mix changes and aging 
the proportion of government and high loan to value conventional loans  which tend to experience higher delinquency rates than low loan to value conventional loans  has increased from of the portfolio at february  to at february  in addition  the weighted average age of the portfolio is months at february   up from months at february  delinquency rates tend to increase as loans age  reaching a peak at three to five years of age 
however  because the loans in the portfolio are generally serviced on a non recourse basis  the company s exposure to credit loss resulting from increased delinquency rates is substantially limited 
further  related late charge income has historically been sufficient to offset incremental servicing expenses resulting from an increased delinquency rate 
the percentage of loans in the company s owned servicing portfolio that are in foreclosure increased to at february  from at february  because the company services substantially all conventional loans on a non recourse basis  foreclosure losses are generally the responsibility of the investor or insurer and not the company 
accordingly  any increase in foreclosure activity should not result in significant foreclosure losses to the company 
however  the company s expenses may be increased somewhat as a result of the additional staff efforts required to foreclose on a loan 
similarly  government loans serviced by the company of the company s servicing portfolio at february  are insured or partially guaranteed against loss by the federal housing administration or the veterans administration 
in the company s view  the limited unreimbursed costs that may be incurred by the company on government foreclosed loans are not material to the company s consolidated financial statements 
servicing hedge as previously discussed  in fiscal the company recorded a net gain of million from its servicing hedge which is designed to protect its servicing investment from the effects of increased prepayment activity that generally results from declining interest rates 
there can be no assurance the company s servicing hedge will generate gains in the future  or that if gains are generated  they will fully offset impairment of the servicing assets
