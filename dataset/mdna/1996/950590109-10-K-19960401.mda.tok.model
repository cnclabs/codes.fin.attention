in total  sites opened in the average sales at standard restaurants were  us dollars in  an increase of 
the company believes there are significant opportunities to expand the hortons concept throughout canada  and eventually perhaps other international markets 
future expansion should primarily be through franchising  and the company plans to open  or have under construction  hortons units in canada is the largest international market for the wendy s concept  and like domestic markets  the restaurant industry is extremely competitive 
the environment includes a difficult economy  adverse tax laws  and minimum wage increases

the company intends to accelerate all international development in and beyond 
at year end there were wendy s and  hortons open outside the us the company anticipates opening or having under construction international wendy s and hortons in management s outlook the company anticipates to be even more challenging than given increased price competition  the difficulty in obtaining quality employees  increased marketing costs and continued efforts to insure food safety 
the company continued to adhere to the basic strategies begun seven years ago and consumers have come to expect quality and value from wendy s and tim hortons 
the company believes that by focusing on areas which can be controlled and improved  such as quality food  quality service and value pricing  customers will recognize the difference and prefer wendy s and tim hortons over the competition

the hortons concept has been developed primarily by franchising restaurants 
the company anticipates that  at least in the near term  development will remain primarily franchised 
while hortons currently operates almost entirely in canada  future expansion will include domestic and possibly other international markets 
the company will continue its strategy of acquiring wendy s restaurants from and selling wendy s restaurants to franchisees where prudent 
acquired restaurants  which may be underperforming  can be improved and then operated profitably by the company or sold to a qualified franchisee 
franchised wendy s restaurants may also be acquired due to geographic or operational benefits to existing company operated markets 
selling restaurants generates cash which is used for new development  acquisitions  and remodeling programs 
during the last three years  the company purchased wendy s franchised restaurants and sold company operated wendy s restaurants to franchisees 
underperforming restaurants  whether company or franchise operated  are monitored carefully and revitalized where economically possible or closed if necessary for the financial health of the system 
the strength of the system s franchise community is an essential part of the company s continued success 
strategies already proven successful are aimed at encouraging responsible new restaurant development  increasing franchise financial health  increasing royalty income  and improving royalty receivable collection rates 
the company will continue to maintain appropriate reserves against franchise receivables 
competition within the quick service restaurant industry remains extremely intense  particularly in areas of pricing and advertising 
additionally  however  numerous external factors can have a significant influence on the company s performance 
these factors could include the economy  consumer perceptions of food safety  harsh weather  particularly in the first and fourth quarters  changing consumer tastes  the labor supply  legal claims  risks inherent to international development  the company s ability to obtain and finance real estate  and government initiatives such as minimum wage rates  taxes  and possible franchise legislation
