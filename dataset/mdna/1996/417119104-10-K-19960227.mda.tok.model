 accounting for income taxes fas 
fas requires  among other things  the recognition of deferred tax assets  including the future benefit associated with operating loss carryforwards  a periodic evaluation of the likelihood that the deferred tax assets are realizable and the establishment of a valuation allowance  in certain circumstances  to offset deferred tax assets to the extent realization is not considered more likely than not 
approximately million of the valuation allowance offsetting the deferred tax asset was reversed during associated with pre tax income for financial reporting  the effective tax rate of was applicable to state income taxes 
during fiscal and  the company reevaluated its deferred tax asset and reversed a portion of its valuation allowance  resulting in a recognized tax benefit of million and million  respectively 
among the factors considered in the recognition were 
a history of sustained profitability of the core mag businesses  even during the loss years which had been caused principally by the businesses subsequently sold or discontinued pursuant to the restructuring  
a third year of consolidated profitability in following the operating losses during the period  
the company s income prospects after consideration of the available operating loss carryforwards  the substantial portion of which do not expire until the period  
termination of litigation related to a business sold in  which eliminated the possibility of a large contingent liability in the event of an adverse ruling  
the expected impact of temporary differences between taxable income and income reported for financial statement purposes 
after giving effect to the benefit from the recognition of a portion of future operating loss carryforwards  the remaining valuation reserve at november  was million 
upon the determination that the realization of some or all of the remaining reserved tax asset is more likely than not  earnings for the applicable year and shareholders equity would be increased accordingly 
also see liquidity and capital resources for further discussion of deferred tax assets and remaining operating loss carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  the company replaced its million borrowing facility  originally due to mature on december   with million of public subordinated debentures  a million revolving credit facility with a nine member lending group and the private placement of million of industrial development bonds issued by development authorities in prior years and maturing in the refinancing accomplished several of the company s objectives  including extending maturities  reducing the level of borrowings subject to interest rate variability and establishing a separate working capital facility providing greater flexibility in addressing the company s seasonal borrowing requirements 
the credit facility is secured by inventories  accounts receivable and intangibles of the company and its subsidiaries 
facility amendments in july  november and january  among other things  resulted in a reduction in the fees  administrative charges and effective borrowing rates  adjustment of certain covenants and extension of the term from march to july the facility contains certain restrictions on the operation of the company s business  including covenants pertaining to capital expenditures  asset sales  operating leases  minimum net worth and incurrence of additional indebtedness  ratios relating to minimum accounts payable to inventory  maximum funded debt to ebitda and minimum fixed charge coverage  as well as other customary covenants  representations and warranties  and events of default 
the company was in compliance with the above noted covenants 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in and million in the decline in compared to was principally attributable to a smaller reduction in working capital than in and the lower earnings 
the improvement in compared to was principally attributable to higher earnings and a reduction in working capital requirements 
at november   net accounts receivable of million declined million or compared to november   principally reflecting the lower sales 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million compared to million last year  representing of gross receivables in compared to in the increase reflected increased exposure of certain retail customers 
inventories of million at november  declined million or compared to november  principally attributable to the disposition of kuppenheimer 
inventory turn in continuing businesses declined slightly 
recoverable and deferred income taxes at november  aggregated million compared to million at november  the balance at november  reflected a valuation allowance of million million in principally related to tax assets associated with prior years operating losses 
as discussed previously under income taxes  the company has evaluated and will continue to evaluate the necessity for the valuation allowance taking into consideration such factors as earnings trends and prospects  anticipated reversal of temporary differences between financial and taxable income  the expiration or limitations of operating loss carryforwards and available tax planning strategies including the ability to adopt the fifo inventory method for those inventories currently valued under the lifo valuation method 
future reversals of the valuation allowance in whole or in part represent a contingent asset which would increase earnings and shareholders equity 
approximately million of the total deferred income taxes has been classified as non current  principally associated with the benefit recognized attributable to expected utilization of future operating loss carryforwards 
at november   the company had approximately million of federal tax operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income 
at november   net properties of million declined million from november   principally attributable to the disposition of kuppenheimer 
capital additions for continuing businesses during were million compared to million in depreciation expense for continuing businesses was million in and million in capital additions during the next several years are expected to be principally funded from cash generated from operating activities 
the capital expenditure limitations contained in the company s current borrowing agreements are not expected to result in delaying capital expenditures otherwise planned by the company 
total debt of million at november  excludes the million industrial development bond assumed by kuppenheimer and declined million compared to november   principally from cash generated from operating activities and the proceeds from the disposition of kuppenheimer 
the million of notes payable classified as current at november  reflects anticipated debt reduction during fiscal under the company s long term borrowing arrangements 
total debt  including short term borrowings and current maturities  represented of the total million capitalization at november   compared to at november   with the improvement principally resulting from the debt reduction 
total borrowing availability was approximately million at november  shareholders equity of million at november  represented book value per share compared to book value per share at november  the million increase during reflected the net earnings for the year  ongoing equity sales to employee benefit plans and recognition of previously unearned employee benefits principally associated with the company s employee stock ownership plan 
dividends have not been paid since and no dividends are anticipated to be declared during fiscal the current credit facility restricts  but does not prohibit  the payment of dividends 
considering the impact of inflation  the current value of net assets would be higher than the company s million book value after reflecting the company s use of lifo inventory method and increases in the value of the properties since acquisition 
earnings would be lower than reported  assuming higher depreciation expense without a corresponding reduction in taxes 
outlook the current industry wide conditions in this difficult retail environment  characterized by generally weak sales of apparel at retail  increasing retailer bankruptcies  and wholesale pricing pressures especially in the moderately priced tailored clothing segment  are not anticipated to improve for at least the first half of fiscal the company s largest customers  which include leading department  specialty and value retailers  are believed to be financially strong and annualized volume is expected to be comparable to levels 
however  consolidated sales volume will likely be less than due to reductions from customers who have filed bankruptcy  which include  among others  hastings  in october  and barney s and today s man in january hastings is being liquidated and its million sales volume in will be lost 
the company has resumed shipments with other companies in bankruptcy on a debtor in possession post petition basis but cannot determine at this time the sales which will ultimately result with these customers during regardless of these current conditions  cost reduction actions are being implemented by continuing emphasis towards lowering product costs by expanding off shore sourcing capabilities  reducing selling  administrative and general expenses in both the corporate and subsidiary entities  and debt reduction 
from a product perspective  emphasis on the company s core manufacturing and marketing businesses comprising the men s apparel group will continue  typified by product line and brand extensions closely associated with existing strengths and competencies 
the company delivered the initial tailored clothing line under the perry ellis and daniel hechter labels in fall  also in  a suits separates program was introduced into a limited number of sears stores and additional sears stores are expected to participate in the spring  season 
the golf inspired collections marketed by the bobby jones division of hickey freeman and the jack nicklaus division were augmented by the introduction of women s golf lines marketed under these brand labels 
these products  along with the jack nicklaus signature sportswear line distributed principally to department stores  collectively contributed to a golfwear sales increase in vs 
and increased sales volume is anticipated for hickey freeman sportswear  with emphasis on casual dressing for the affluent hickey freeman core customer  will encompass a separately designed line of sportcoats  slacks  sweaters and shirts for its initial product introduction in the fall of also in current development is a casual presentation of hart schaffner marx sportswear which will be offered for deliveries 
in the women s apparel group  the austin reed women s line of tailored coats  pants and dresses will be augmented by a more moderately priced hawksley wight line with initial shipments commencing for the spring  season 
the company continually assesses its borrowing availability and requirements under its revolving credit facility  along with the interest rates payable under its various borrowing arrangements 
during the first quarter of  the company acquired million face value of its subordinated debentures through open market purchases 
these purchases will result in a gain of approximately 
million  net of a 
million tax provision  which will be reflected as an extraordinary item in the first quarter of fiscal ending february  based on the various interest rates in effect as of november   the purchases consummated to date will result in annualized interest savings of approximately 
million 
under the amended terms of the company s revolving credit facility  approximately million of additional debenture repurchases are allowable 
while industry conditions are unfavorable currently  the combination of the company s well regarded and time honored brands  anticipated product line extensions  and continuing emphasis on cost control and debt reduction covering all aspects of operations should collectively contribute to a stronger performance upon improvement of the current external environment
