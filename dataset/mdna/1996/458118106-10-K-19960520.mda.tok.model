item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following table sets forth certain amounts  as a percentage of revenues  from the company s consolidated statements of operations for the three fiscal years ended march   april  and april  fiscal year ended march  april  april  revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative total operating expenses operating income net interest income income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes income before extraordinary item extraordinary item gain from early extinguishment of debt  net of tax net income overview revenues were million in fiscal  a increase over fiscal of million and a increase over fiscal of million 
net income was per fully diluted share in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal during fiscal  idt made significant progress in increasing capacity in penang  malaysia  completed the conversion of the salinas wafer facility from five inch to six inch wafers  started construction of a new assembly and test facility in the philippines and completed construction of the hillsboro  oregon wafer facility 
the oregon facility is expected to ship its first revenue units in the first quarter of fiscal both revenues and profits were affected dramatically by a volatile market for the company s largest product line  srams  which accounted for of idt s total fiscal revenue 
for the first two quarters of the fiscal year  srams were in great demand and prices rose 
at the same time  through die shrinks and better utilization of manufacturing capacity  idt reduced costs of production resulting in record operating margins despite startup costs associated with the new oregon plant 
during the latter part of the year  sram pricing began to fall significantly as a number of competitors  particularly taiwanese  shifted capacity to srams 
shortly thereafter  demand for high speed srams by personal computer pc manufacturers slowed 
the sram order rate declined further as certain customers not only reduced sram order rates  but also sold off excess sram inventory at low prices causing excess supply 
as an example of the market conditions  in less than six months  selling prices for new orders on the industry standard volt kx sram declined by as much as from the peak 
consequently  while revenues and earnings grew sequentially in the first three quarters of fiscal  fourth quarter earnings and revenue dropped significantly from the immediately preceding quarter and fourth quarter earnings decreased compared to the same period in the prior year 
results of operations revenues of million were achieved in fiscal through a combination of improved selling prices on sram products shipped during the first three quarters  higher output as the company increased die production and generally increased demand across all of idt s other products 
sram revenues increased to million compared to fiscal fiscal revenue increased over fiscal due to strong demand for fast srams for secondary cache requirements in the pc market 
looking forward  the company does not expect demand in the pc market will resume last year s growth rates  and is uncertain as to whether pricing for commodity srams will change 
gross profit increased to million in fiscal when compared to fiscal and over the gross profit reported in fiscal however  as a result of significant price declines on sram orders taken in the second half of the year  idt s gross profit as a percentage of revenue declined to in fiscal compared to in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of revenue was in fiscal while gross profit as a percentage of revenue for the first three quarters of fiscal was not appreciably different from the prior year  the fourth quarter declined to 
some markets such as telecommunications and datacommunications remained robust throughout the year  but falling prices and orders in the pc market offset strong performance for the remainder of the company s market segments in the third and fourth quarters 
costs associated with the hillsboro  oregon plant are expected to negatively impact gross margins in fiscal  while that plant is on a ramp to increase production 
idt s policy is to expense new plant startup costs to research and development r d expense until a facility is ready to begin commercial production 
in fiscal substantially all oregon plant expenses  amounting to million  were charged to r d expense  but as that plant reaches production status in fiscal  an increasingly significant portion of the total costs will be allocated to cost of goods sold  based upon activities performed 
r d expenses increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  and million in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  r d expense was of fiscal revenue  an increase from in fiscal r d expenses had been of fiscal revenue 
the increase in can be principally attributed to process engineering research costs of approximately million relative to the new oregon wafer fabrication plant 
other r d activities included development of sub micron processes  the release of new products  including idt s first product for the atm asynchronous transfer mode market  the sar segmentation and reassembly chip  and further development and design of new products and processes 
the company expects the startup of the new oregon facility to continue to impact r d expense in fiscal but that total r d expense as a percentage of revenue will be reduced compared to fiscal idt believes that high levels of r d investment is required to support its strategy of providing products to its customers which are not readily available from competitors 
selling  general and administrative s  g a expenses increased to million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  s  g a expenses declined to of fiscal revenue compared to of fiscal revenue 
fiscal s  g a expenses were million or of revenue 
the increase in s  g a expenses can be attributed to higher variable selling expenses associated with the year over year revenue growth of  increases in employee profit sharing and management bonuses  increases in sales personnel and increases in provisions for bad debts 
in  idt plans to install an enterprise wide management information system and anticipates that s  g a expenses will remain constant as a percentage of revenues 
interest expense was million in fiscal as compared to million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
interest expense increased in primarily due to the issuance of million of convertible subordinated notes issued in the first quarter of the fiscal year 
gross interest expense of million was reduced by million in connection with capitalization of construction period interest for the oregon wafer fabrication plant 
despite retiring million of the convertible subordinated notes in the fourth quarter resulting in an extraordinary gain see note of the consolidated financial statements  interest expense is expected to be higher in fiscal  as the notes were not outstanding for all of fiscal furthermore  interest capitalization will cease when the oregon facility is placed in production 
interest income and other  net  increased to million in fiscal compared to million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in interest income was due primarily to the investment of higher cash balances from the proceeds of the issuance of million of subordinated notes in the first quarter of fiscal fiscal had been impacted favorably by a million equity offering 
as the company continues to pay cash for substantial capital equipment acquisitions  less cash will be available for investment  resulting in lower interest income in fiscal the effective tax rates for fiscal  and of  and  respectively  differed from the us statutory rate of primarily due to earnings of foreign subsidiaries being taxed at lower rates  and the utilization of certain tax credits 
the company has consumed substantially all of the tax benefits associated with its malaysian subsidiary  and it has fully utilized carried forward r d tax credits 
the company accounts for its stock option plans and its employee stock purchase plan in accordance with provisions of the accounting principles board s opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees 
in the financial accounting standards board released the statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
while sfas provides an alternative to apb and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   as permitted by sfas  the company intends to continue to account for its employee stock plans in accordance with apb consequently  sfas is not expected to have any material impact on idt s financial condition or results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources idt s financial condition improved during fiscal cash and cash equivalents and short term investments increased from million at the end of to million at the end of working capital increased from million to million despite substantial cash investments in plant  property and equipment 
these increases were a result of improved profitability as well as the issuance of the convertible subordinated notes 
additionally the company has million of cash classified as other assets  which are pledged as security relative to the operating lease for the oregon facility 
as of march   the company had million available under unsecured lines of credit  all of which are overseas 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  and cash flow from operations was million  million and million  respectively 
improved operating results in fiscal and was the largest single factor affecting cash flow from operations 
other factors contributing to greater cash flow from operations include increases in accounts payable and other current liabilities 
see the consolidated statements of cash flows in the consolidated financial statements 
idt expects that increased depreciation expenses associated with its recent and forecasted capital expenditures will be significant relative to future cash flows from operations 
during fiscal  and the company s net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million  respectively  of which million  million and million  respectively  was used for capital equipment and property and plant improvements 
in fiscal  million was used to collateralize the oregon facility lease 
in fiscal  financing activities generated million  the primary source of which was an equity offering which resulted in net cash of million 
in fiscal  financing activities generated million  the primary source of which was an equity offering in december which resulted in net cash of million 
in fiscal  financing activities generated million  the primary source of which was the issuance of convertible subordinated debt see note of the consolidated financial statements which resulted in net cash of million 
in view of current and anticipated capacity requirements  idt anticipates capital expenditures of approximately million in fiscal  principally in connection with continued installation of equipment in the new oregon facility plus the construction and partial equipping of the new philippine plant and other capacity improvements 
looking forward  the company believes that existing cash balances  cash flow from operations  existing credit facilities and other financing arrangements that are available will be sufficient to fund its anticipated capital expenditures and working capital needs through fiscal if the company is required to seek other financing sooner  the unavailability of financing on terms satisfactory to idt could have a material adverse effect on the company 
factors affecting future results except for the historical information contained in this annual report on form k  the matters discussed in this report are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements concern matters that involve risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to those set forth below  that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
in any event  the matters set forth below should be carefully considered when evaluating the company s business and prospects 
idt s operating results have been  and in the future may be  subject to fluctuations due to a wide variety of factors including the timing of or delays in new product and process technology announcements and introductions by the company or its competitors  competitive pricing pressures  particularly in the sram memory market  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  changes in the mix of product sold  availability and costs of raw materials  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  industry wide wafer processing capacity  economic conditions in various geographic areas  and costs associated with other events  such as underutilization or expansion of production capacity  intellectual property disputes  or other litigation 
further  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or potential competitors or that the companies operating results will not be adversely affected by increased price competition 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has been subject to significant downturns at various times that have been characterized by diminished product demand  production overcapacity and accelerated erosion of average selling prices 
during the past year  markets for some of the company s srams were characterized by excess demand relative to supply and the resulting favorable pricing 
during the later part of fiscal  a number of companies  principally foreign  shifted manufacturing capacity to srams causing rapid adjustments to supply and consequently impacting market prices 
the resulting significant downward trend in prices in an extremely short period negatively affected sram gross margins  and adversely affected the company s operating results 
a material increase in industry wide production capacity  shift in industry capacity toward products competitive with the company s products  reduced demand or other factors could result in a rapid decline in product pricing and could also materially adversely affect the company s operating results 
the company ships a substantial portion of its quarterly sales in the last month of a quarter 
if anticipated shipments in any quarter do not occur  the company s operating results for that quarter could be adversely affected 
in addition  a substantial percentage of the company s products are incorporated into computer and computer related products  which have historically been characterized by significant fluctuations in demand 
furthermore  any decline in the demand for advanced microprocessors which utilize sram cache memory could adversely affect the company s operating results 
in addition  demand for certain of the company s products is dependent upon growth in the communications market 
any slowdown in the computer and related peripherals or communications markets could also materially adversely affect the company s operating results 
the company is operating its domestic wafer fabrication facilities and malaysian assembly operations at approximately installed equipment capacity 
as a result  the company has utilized subcontractors for the majority of its incremental assembly requirements  typically at higher costs that its own malaysian operations 
the company expects to continue utilizing subcontractors extensively until it opens its philippines assembly plant 
at times during fiscal  as a result of production capacity constraints  the company was not able to take advantage of all market opportunities presented to it 
due to long production lead times and current capacity constraints  any failure by the company to forecast adequately the mix of product demand could adversely affect the company s sales and operating results 
to address its capacity requirements  during the past year  the company has undertaken extensive production expansion programs including the construction of an eight inch wafer fabrication line in oregon and an assembly and test facility in the philippines 
these expansion programs face a number of substantial risks including  but not limited to  delays in construction  cost overruns  equipment delays or shortages  manufacturing start up or process problems or difficulties in hiring key managers and technical personnel 
in addition  the company has never operated an eight inch wafer fabrication facility 
accordingly  the company could incur unanticipated process or production problems 
from time to time  the company has experienced production difficulties that have caused delivery delays and quality problems 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience manufacturing problems and product delivery delays in the future as a result of  among other things  changes to its process technologies  ramping production  installing new equipment at its facilities and constructing new facilities in oregon and the philippines 
further  the company s existing wafer fabrication facilities are located relatively near each other in northern california 
if the company were unable to use these facilities  as a result of a natural disaster or otherwise  the company s operations would be materially adversely affected until the company was able to obtain other production capability 
the company s capacity additions will result in a significant increase in fixed and operating expenses 
historically  the company has expensed the operating expenses associated with bringing a new fabrication facility to commercial production as r d in the period such expenses are incurred 
however  as commercial production at a new fabrication facility commences  the operating costs will be classified as cost of revenues  and the company will begin to recognize depreciation expense relating to the facility 
accordingly  although the company expects the oregon fabrication facility to contribute to revenues in fiscal  the company will recognize substantial operating expenses associated with the facility in  which could reduce gross margins 
specifically  as commercial production begins in fiscal  the company anticipates incurring substantial operating costs and depreciation expense relating to the facility before production of substantial volume is achieved 
accordingly  if revenue levels do not increase sufficiently to offset these additional expense levels  or if the company is unable to achieve gross margins from products produced at the oregon facility that are comparable to the company s current products  the company s future results of operations could be adversely impacted 
new products  process technology and start up costs associated with the oregon wafer fabrication facility continue to require significant research and development expenditures 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner  that new products will gain market acceptance or that new process technologies can be successfully implemented 
if the company is unable to develop new products in a timely manner  and to sell them at gross margins comparable to the company s current products  the future results of operations could be adversely impacted 
the company s manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining adequate raw materials on a timely basis 
the number of vendors of certain raw materials  such as silicon wafers  ultra pure metals and certain chemicals and gases  is very limited 
in addition  certain packages used by the company require long lead times and are available from only a few suppliers 
from time to time  vendors have extended lead times or limited supply to the company due to capacity constraints 
the company s results of operations would be adversely affected if it were unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner or if there were significant increases in the costs of raw materials 
the semiconductor industry is extremely capital intensive 
to remain competitive  the company must continue to invest in advanced manufacturing and test equipment 
in fiscal  the company expects to expend approximately million in capital expenditures and anticipates significant continuing capital expenditures in the next several years 
there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to seek financing to satisfy its cash and capital needs or that such financing will be available on terms satisfactory to the company 
if such financing is required and if such financing is not available on terms satisfactory to the company  its operations would be materially adversely affected 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions  which have resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation 
in recent years  there has been a growing trend of companies to resort to litigation to protect their semiconductor technology from unauthorized use by others 
the company in the past has been involved in patent litigation  which adversely affected its operating results 
although the company has obtained patent licenses from certain semiconductor manufacturers  the company does not have licenses from a number of semiconductor manufacturers who have a broad portfolio of patents 
the company has been notified that it may be infringing patents issued to certain semiconductor manufacturers and other parties and is currently involved in several license negotiations 
there can be no assurance that additional claims alleging infringement of intellectual property rights will not be asserted in the future 
the intellectual property claims that have been made or may be asserted against the company could require that the company discontinue the use of certain processes or cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  to incur significant litigation costs and damages and to develop noninfringing technology 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to obtain such licenses on acceptable terms or to develop noninfringing technology 
further  the failure to renew or renegotiate existing licenses  or significant increases in amounts payable or the inability to obtain a license  could have a materially adverse effect on the company 
a substantial percentage of the company s revenues are derived from export sales  which are generally denominated in local currencies 
the company s offshore assembly and test operations and export sales are subject to risks associated with foreign operations  including currency controls and fluctuations  changes in local economic conditions and import and export controls  as well as changes in tax laws  tariffs and freight rates 
recently  contract pricing for raw materials  as well as for subcontract assembly services  has been impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the company is subject to a variety of regulations related to hazardous materials used in its manufacturing process 
any failure by the company to control the use of  or to restrict adequately the discharge of  hazardous materials under present or future regulations could subject it to substantial liability or could cause its manufacturing operations to be suspended 
the company s common stock has experienced substantial price volatility and such volatility may occur in the future  particularly as a result of quarter to quarter variations in the actual or anticipated financial results of the company  the companies in the semiconductor industry or in the markets served by the company  or announcements by the company or its competitors regarding new product introductions 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies stock in particular 
these factors may adversely affect the price of the common stock
