overall unit sales of beverage ingredients increased approximately in unit sales of rum have increased since due to the acquisition of the company s virgin islands operations in february the company expanded the production capacity of the virgin islands facility by during and has shifted a substantial part of its domestic rum production offshore in order to capitalize on the lower raw material costs available in the virgin islands 
unit sales of fortified citrus wine have increased substantially in and primarily due to increased sales to one of the company s largest wine customers due to management s decision to expand geographically by acquiring the louisville  kentucky facility in december unit sales of citrus brandy decreased in sales of citrus brandy have declined as a result of a decline in demand for brandy products which management believes is due to changing demographics 
management expects this trend to continue in the future 
popular price spirits produced by the company are distributed under the company s proprietary labels and those of major retailers of liquor in the southeast and include rum  vodka  gin  cordials  brandies and whiskies 
since the acquisition of the virgin islands operations in february  the company also produces and sells popular price spirits in the u 
s 
virgin islands 
the company is importing  marketing and distributing a limited number of alcoholic beverages from the former blair product line in the united states 
during and the first three quarters of the company s popular price products experienced a decrease in profit margins due to increased costs of raw materials which the company elected to absorb in order to maintain market share 
during the fourth quarter of the cost of raw materials decreased and the company was able to increase prices 
the company s contract bottling operations consist primarily of bottling coolers  prepared cocktails and other non alcoholic beverages 
the company s contract bottling volume decreased in due to the loss of certain bottling customers and some bottling customers discontinuing products 
in addition  one of the company s largest bottling customers decreased its orders for bottling services in accordance with its plan to transfer production to its own facility 
the company continues to provide a significant amount of contract bottling services to this customer 
the underutilization of the company s bottling facilities has significantly impacted the company s profitability due to its high overhead costs 
during  management reduced labor and overhead costs in an effort to return this division to profitability 
the company s contract bottling volume increased slightly in while contract bottling volume to the company s significant bottling customers was down slightly  this was offset by the addition of new customers and new business with an existing customer 
management is actively seeking to utilize its remaining capacity by bottling additional types of beverages and through expansion in the territories it serves 
during the quarter ended september   the company discontinued the operations of blair  sold substantially all of its assets  terminated its employees  closed its facilities and began liquidating its remaining assets 
the company acquired blair in august at that time management believed that blair would enhance the company s national sales capabilities and provide an entry to the imported wine and spirits segment of the alcohol beverage market 
however  beginning in january  blair incurred substantial operating losses 
in  the losses from blair amounted to  net of tax benefit of  including operating losses during the phase out period of  these losses resulted from  among other things  the failure to meet exaggerated sales and gross profit projections furnished to the company  certain unrecorded liabilities  surplus inventories  and inadequate reserves for uncollectible receivables  all of which were uncovered subsequent to the acquisition 
the company is reserving all rights that it has to indemnification from the selling shareholders of blair under the merger agreement relating to the acquisition 
see item legal proceedings 
the company s net sales and gross margins gross profit as a percentage of net sales vary depending on the mix of business among the company s product lines 
historically  gross margins have been highest in beverage ingredients and lower in popular price  contract bottling and vinegar and cooking wine operations 
within its contract bottling operations  sales and gross margins have varied substantially based upon the mix of business from the company s largest bottling customers 
although gross profit per case for the company s bottling customers are approximately equal  some customers pay the company to purchase all raw materials 
as a result  net sales and cost of goods sold with respect to products bottled for these customers are higher  and gross margins are lower  than for other bottling customers which supply their own raw materials 
net sales represent the company s gross sales less excise taxes 
excise taxes are generally payable on products bottled by the company 
in addition  excise taxes are payable on sales of industrial alcohol to certain customers 
accordingly  excise taxes vary from period to period depending upon the company s product and customer mix

these statements could be considered forward looking statements that involve a nunber of risks and uncertainties 
the following is a list of factors  among others  that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements  business conditions and growth in certain market segments and industries and the general economy  competitive factors including increased competition and price pressures  availability of third party component products at reasonable prices  excise taxes  foreign currency exposure  changes in product mix between and among product lines  lower than expected customer orders and quarterly seasonal fluctuation of those orders  and product shipment interruptions 
the following discussion relates to the results of continuing operations 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales for the year ended september   were million  an increase when compared to net sales of million for the year ended september  beverage ingredients net sales increased during fiscal due to volume increases in both distilled products and fortified citrus wine

the increase in distilled products volume was due to a increase in export sales of grain alcohol  a increase in sales of rum  and a increase in sales of citrus spirits 
these increases were offset by a decrease in sales of citrus brandy

the average unit price for distilled products decreased due to the increase in export sales of grain alcohol which have a lower unit price than other distilled products 
the average unit price for fortified citrus wine increased 
net sales of popular price spirits increased 
the increase in net sales is due to the company s new business of importing  marketing and distributing branded alcoholic beverages  including its own cruzan rum
