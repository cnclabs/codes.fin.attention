item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations since its founding in  the company has developed and marketed software and services to the process industries 
the company s revenues have grown each fiscal year since  when the company introduced the commercial version of its aspen plus modeling software product 
in addition to internally generated growth the company has completed a number of acquisitions 
in fiscal  aspentech acquired prosys  a uk company  the developer and marketer of speedup 
in fiscal  aspentech acquired isi  a leading supplier of pim software and the developer and marketer of the cim product family 
the prosys and isi acquisitions were accounted for as pooling of interests transactions 
on january  and february   respectively  aspentech acquired dmcc and setpoint  gaining additional expertise in pim  apc and optimization software and services 
the purchase price of the dmcc acquisition was approximately million in cash  and the purchase price of the setpoint acquisition was approximately million  which was paid in cash and by issuance of the setpoint note 
the dmcc and setpoint acquisitions were accounted for as purchase transactions  and therefore only the portion of their results of operations subsequent to the acquisition dates is included in the company s operating results 
as a result  comparisons of results for the years ended june  and are not meaningful 
the company typically licenses its modeling software products to customers for terms of either three or five years  and typically licenses its pim  apc and optimization software products for terms of years 
see item business products and services 
because in all cases the licenses are noncancelable and do not impose significant obligations on the company  the company recognizes software license revenues upon shipment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in the case of license renewals  revenue is recognized upon execution of a renewal license agreement 
the company recognizes revenues from customer support ratably over the term of the license 
if a customer elects to pay for a license in annual installments  the company charges an implicit amount of interest and recognizes interest income over the term of the license 
a substantial majority of the company s term licenses have been renewed upon expiration 
however  there can be no assurance that customers will continue to renew expiring term licenses at the historical rate 
the company s revenues historically have been derived principally from the licensing of software products 
since the acquisitions of dmcc and setpoint  the company has generated a significantly greater amount of consulting revenues from services for the implementation of its off the shelf software products 
the company recognizes service revenues as services are performed 
service revenues from fixed price contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the portion of costs incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total primarily labor costs for each contract 
service revenues from time and expense contracts are recognized as the related services are performed 
training revenues are recognized as services are performed 
services that have been performed but for which billings have not been made are recorded as unbilled receivables  and unrecognized amounts are recorded as unearned revenues on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company licenses its software in us dollars and certain foreign currencies 
the company hedges all material foreign currency denominated receivables with specific hedge contracts in amounts equal to those receivables 
while the company has experienced minor foreign currency exchange gains or losses due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations  the impact of such movements has not been material in any period 
the company does not expect fluctuations in foreign currencies to have a significant impact on either its revenues or expenses in the foreseeable future 
the company s operating costs include the amortization of intangible assets  including goodwill  arising from the acquisitions of dmcc and setpoint 
these intangible assets total approximately million and will be amortized over periods ranging from months to years 
the amortization was approximately  in fiscal and will be approximately  for each of the four succeeding quarters  and approximately  for each of the quarters thereafter 
results of operations the following table sets forth the amount and percentage of total revenues represented by certain consolidated statement of operations data for the periods indicated year ended june  dollars in thousands revenues software licenses    maintenance and other services    expenses cost of software licenses    cost of services and other    selling and marketing    research and development    general and administrative    charge for in process research and development  costs related to acquisition income loss from operations    foreign currency exchange gain loss income loss on equity in joint ventures interest income    interest expense  income loss before provision for income taxes    provision for income taxes    net income loss    comparison of fiscal to fiscal the company acquired dmcc and setpoint in the third quarter of fiscal in purchase transactions and has subsequently taken steps to integrate and reorganize the operations of aspentech and its new subsidiaries 
as a result  the company s operating results for fiscal and fiscal are not directly comparable 
the results of the company s operations for fiscal are not representative of results of operations of the combined entities for subsequent periods

revenues from software licenses in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal the growth in software license revenues was attributable both to internal growth in existing operations and to additional licenses entered into by the newly acquired subsidiaries 
the internal growth in software license revenues was attributable to renewals of software licenses covering existing users  to the expansion of existing customer relationships through licenses covering additional users and additional software products  and  to a lesser extent  to the addition of new customers 
the decrease in software license revenues as a percentage of total revenues was attributable to the growth in service revenues resulting from aspentech s acquisitions of dmcc and setpoint 
total revenues from customers outside the united states were million or of total revenues and million or of total revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
the growth in dollar amount of total revenues from customers outside the united states was attributable in part to revenues generated by setpoint and  to a lesser extent  to internal growth in existing operations 
revenues from services and other consist of consulting services  post contract support on software licenses  training and sales of documentation 
since the acquisitions of dmcc and setpoint  the company has generated a significantly greater amount of consulting revenues from services for the analysis  design and automation of process manufacturing plants 
as a result  revenues from services and other for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal neither the company s joint venture and similar activities nor any discounting or similar activities has historically had a material effect on the company s revenues

cost of software licenses for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal cost of software licenses as a percentage of revenues from software licenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal this decrease was due to the spreading of fixed production and delivery costs over a larger revenue base and to the generation of a greater portion of sales having minimal third party royalty costs

selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal while decreasing as a percentage of total revenues to from 
the percentage decrease in costs reflects the lower level of sales and marketing activities historically supported by dmcc and setpoint  as well as the company s leveraging of its existing worldwide sales and technical sales force to market the software products and services of the newly acquired companies 
the company continues to invest in sales personnel and regional sales offices to improve the company s geographic proximity to its customers  to maximize the penetration of existing accounts and to add new customers

interest income 
interest income is generated primarily from the sale of software pursuant to installment contracts for off line modeling software 
under these contracts  the company offers customers the option to make annual payments for term licenses instead of a single license fee payment at the beginning of the license term 
a substantial majority of the off line modeling customers elect to license these products through installment contracts 
the company believes this election is made principally because the customers prefer to pay for the company s off line modeling products out of their operating budgets  rather than out of their capital budgets 
included in the annual payments is an implicit interest charge based upon the interest rate established by the company at the time of the license 
the company sells a portion of the installment contracts to unrelated financial institutions 
the interest earned by the company on the installment contract portfolio in any one year is the result of the implicit interest established by the company on installment contracts and the size of the contract portfolio

interest expense in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal this increase principally reflected a higher level of borrowings under the company s bank line of credit as a result of borrowings used for payment of a portion of the purchase price for the setpoint acquisition 
provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate in fiscal is calculated as a percentage of income before taxes  exclusive of the non recurring charge for in process research and development 
the effective tax rate decreased in fiscal to of pretax income from in fiscal this percentage decrease related principally to non deductible acquisition costs incurred in connection with the isi acquisition in fiscal comparison of fiscal to fiscal revenues

quarterly results the company s operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
because the company ships software products within a short period after receipt of an order  the company typically does not have a material backlog of unfilled orders for software products  and revenues from software licenses in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders for software products booked in the quarter 
historically  a majority of each quarter s revenues from software licenses has come from license contracts that have been effected in the final weeks of that quarter 
the revenues for a quarter typically include a number of large orders 
if the timing of any of these orders is delayed  it could result in a substantial reduction in revenues for that quarter 
since the company s expense levels are based in part on its expectations as to future revenues  the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any revenue shortfall 
accordingly  any revenue shortfalls would likely have a disproportionate adverse effect on net income 
prior to fiscal  the company experienced a net loss for the first quarter of each fiscal year  in part because a substantial portion of the company s revenues is derived from countries other than the united states where business is slow during the summer months  and also in part because of the timing of contract renewals 
the company expects that these factors will continue to affect its operating results 
the company experienced net losses in the first quarter of each fiscal year prior to the first quarter of fiscal  when it recognized net income of million 
the company may continue to experience net losses in the initial quarter of future fiscal years

the company evaluates on an ongoing basis potential opportunities to acquire or invest in technologies  products or businesses that expand  complement or are otherwise related to the company s current business and products

risk factors risks associated with future acquisitions 
in fiscal and  operating activities provided million and million of cash  respectively  primarily related to net income and increases in accounts payable  accrued expenses and deferred revenue  offset in part by increases in accounts receivable 
in recent years  the company has had arrangements to sell long term contracts to two financial institutions  general electric capital corporation and sanwa business credit corporation 
these contracts represent amounts due over the life of existing term licenses 
during fiscal  installment contracts decreased by million to million  net of million of installment contracts sold to general electric capital corporation and sanwa business credit corporation

at june  and june   the balance of the uncollected principal portion of the contracts sold to these two financial institutions was million and million  respectively  for which the company had partial recourse obligations of million and million  respectively 
the availability under these arrangements will increase as the financial institutions receive payment on installment contracts previously sold 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company maintains a million bank line of credit  expiring on december   that provides for borrowings of specified percentages of eligible accounts receivable and eligible current installment contracts 
advances under the line of credit bear interest at a rate at june  equal to the bank s prime rate plus a specified margin or  at the company s option  a rate at june  equal to a defined libor rate plus a specified margin 
the bank line of credit is secured by a pledge of substantially all of the assets of the company and its united states subsidiaries

the company s commitments as of june  consisted primarily of leases on its headquarters and other facilities 
see item business facilities 
there were no other material commitments for capital or other expenditures 
the company believes its current cash balances  availability of sales of its installment contracts  availability under its bank line of credit and cash flows from its operations  will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operating results to date  nor does the company expect it to have significant impact during fiscal
