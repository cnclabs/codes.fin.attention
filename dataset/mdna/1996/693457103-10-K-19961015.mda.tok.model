acquisitions and mergers since fiscal year through july  the company has purchased portfolios  ranging in size from approximately to  merchant accounts 
the company purchased five merchant portfolios in fiscal year  nine in fiscal and five merchant portfolios in fiscal year significant purchases are discussed further below 
in april  the company purchased a merchant portfolio of approximately  merchants from bankcard america  inc abc for a purchase price of million 
the company paid million in cash  issued a interest bearing note for  due may  and issued a million note bearing interest at due july  the company incurred direct costs and expenses related to the purchase of the merchant portfolio of approximately million 
the purchase agreement provided for additional consideration of million payable to the seller contingent upon the seller s ability to negotiate the transfer of the merchant accounts  to the company s primary processing bank 
in may  an agreement was entered into providing for transfer of the merchant accounts and pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement  the company paid million representing additional purchase price for the merchant portfolio 
additionally  beginning june  the company s amended processing agreement with its primary processing bank required a million security deposit for a six month period as a result of the conversion of other merchant portfolios to this processing bank 
this deposit plus accrued interest was returned to the company in march a sum of  will remain on deposit with this bank as long as the company participates in the bank s association marketing agreement 
in july  the company purchased two additional merchant portfolios of approximately  merchant accounts for approximately million 
the company purchased two portfolios  credit card equipment inventory  a merchant lease portfolio and other office assets 
the company purchased a merchant portfolio from imperial bank consisting of approximately  merchant accounts effective october  the company paid approximately million for the portfolio from proceeds of the company s second public offering 
in the third quarter of fiscal year the company purchased two merchant portfolios 
the company purchased approximately  from umb bank  na umb for a purchase price of million effective march  effective april  the company purchased approximately  merchant accounts from bankcard america  inc abc for a purchase price of million 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal the company acquired two merchant portfolios consisting of approximately  merchant accounts 
the company accounted for the larger of these two acquisitions as a pooling of interests 
on july  the company issued  shares of its common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding common stock of martin howe associates  inc mha 
the company s consolidated financial statements have been restated to include the accounts of mha for all periods prior to the merger 
the growth in the company s revenues and profitability for fiscal years and has resulted largely from the purchase of merchant portfolios 
future growth is dependent upon  among other factors  the company s ability to continue to consummate additional purchases of merchant portfolios 
see pro forma operating results in note to the financial statements for information relative to the potential effect of the acquisitions on the company s operations 
management believes the pro forma operating results reflected in note are not indicative of what would have occurred had the purchases been made at the beginning of fiscal year or fiscal year  or of results which may occur in the future because the cost structures of the acquired portfolios are not directly comparable to the company s 
results of operations the following table presents  for the periods indicated  the percentage of revenues represented by certain line items in the company s statement of income period to period changes year ended july increase decrease vs

revenues cost of revenues gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization provision for merchant losses stock award compensation income from operations interest expense  income net  other income  net income before provision for taxes and change in accounting principle provision for income taxes income before change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net income revenues revenues increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year these increases represent a increase from fiscal year to fiscal year and a increase from fiscal year to fiscal year the increases in revenues for all periods presented resulted primarily from the purchase of merchant portfolios and  to a lesser extent  new merchant contracts generated through the company s telemarketing efforts and fee enhancements with existing merchants 
the increases from fiscal year to fiscal were primarily the result of the purchased merchant portfolios which resulted in a increase in revenues 
in fiscal year  the company added approximately  merchant accounts through nine merchant portfolio purchases and in fiscal  the company purchased five merchant portfolios consisting of approximately  merchant accounts 
in july  the company accounted for the purchase of approximately  merchant accounts as a pooling of interests 
acquisitions accounted for approximately of the increase in revenues in fiscal cost of revenues cost of revenues increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year these increases represent a increase from fiscal year to fiscal year and increase from fiscal year to fiscal year the primary components of the company s cost of revenues have generally remained consistent as a percentage of revenues from fiscal year through fiscal year a majority of the company s cost of revenues are fixed as a percentage of each transaction amount  with the remaining costs being based on a fixed rate applied to the number of transactions processed 
in fiscal year and fiscal year cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues decreased due to the company s increase in ancillary fee revenues received through merchant portfolio purchases and merchant fee enhancements 
in fiscal  cost of revenues increased as a percentage of revenues primarily due to significant merchant acquisitions made late in fiscal which have a higher cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues than those historically experienced by the company 
this resulted from the company assuming certain contractual obligations which are less favorable than other existing agreements 
in some cases  where costs were initially higher than normal  the company has been able to ultimately lower the cost to deliver the services 
the company s cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues can be significantly effected by the cost structures of acquired merchant portfolios 
the remaining components of cost of revenues represent equipment sold and rented  referral compensation paid to trade associations and other supplies and service expenses 
referral compensation paid to associations  along with other supplies and service expenses  increased in general proportion with the growth in revenues from fiscal year through fiscal year from fiscal year to fiscal the cost of equipment sold and rented declined as a percentage of total revenues from to 
this decrease was the direct result of the growth in revenues  improved inventory management  favorable pricing obtained through volume purchases and the decrease in rental costs related to the purchase of rental terminals 
management does not expect this trend of cost reduction to continue because cost reductions available from inventory management have been substantially achieved 
decreases in equipment costs have been partially offset by higher costs incurred as a result of the replacement of malfunctioning equipment in the early months of merchant portfolio purchases and conversions 
equipment costs as a percentage of total revenues for fiscal remained consistent with fiscal prior to december  the company s merchants rented terminals directly from a processing bank and the company received a commission on each rental payment 
on december   the company purchased these rental terminals and related contracts from the processing bank  thereby improving gross margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year and increased to million in fiscal year this increase represents a increase from fiscal year to fiscal year and a increase from fiscal year to fiscal year in fiscal year  selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenues when compared to fiscal year in fiscal year  the company incurred operating costs related to the field sales force  merchant portfolio purchases and a visa mastercard sales solicitation program 
the company opened two field sales offices late in fiscal year and two additional offices by january  which increased payroll  rent  personnel recruitment and office supplies expense 
in fiscal year  the company purchased nine merchant portfolios and incurred operating expenses and additional labor costs related to servicing the purchased merchant portfolios 
the visa mastercard sales solicitation program resulted in increased selling  general and administrative costs in fiscal year the company s policy is to recognize these costs when incurred  however  revenues generated by the program were not realized until fiscal year the company incurred approximately  of costs relating to the sales solicitation program during fiscal year in fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses increased in amount but decreased as a percentage of revenues 
the decrease in the percentage continues to reflect the company s overall improvement in utilization of personnel and the addition of revenues from purchased merchant portfolios which do not cause a proportionate increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year these increases represent a increase from fiscal year to fiscal year and a increase from fiscal year to fiscal year depreciation expense has increased in amount from fiscal year through fiscal year but remained relatively consistent as a percentage of revenues due to the significant increase in revenues 
the increase in depreciation expense is a direct result of additional equipment and fixture purchases for customer service and operations 
amortization expense has generally increased in amount and as a percentage of revenues from fiscal year through fiscal year amortization expense increases in periods when the company purchases merchant portfolios 
the significant increases in fiscal years and are reflective of the merchant portfolio purchases 
in fiscal  the acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the imperial and umb acquisitions contributed to significant increases in fiscal amortization expense 
in fiscal  the company entered into a merger with mha which was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
additionally  the company has accounted for another small merger as a pooling of interests in the first quarter of fiscal there is no amortization expense related to these two acquisitions  and to the extent that the company should continue its growth through significant acquisitions accounted for as a pooling of interests  the amortization expense as a percentage of revenues could decline 
purchased merchant portfolios are evaluated by management for impairment at each balance sheet date through review of actual attrition and projected cash flows generated by each merchant portfolio in relation to the unamortized cost of each merchant portfolio 
if  upon review  an impairment of the value of the purchased merchant portfolio is indicated  amortization will be accelerated and any required loss in value recognized immediately 
subsequent to integration  management anticipates merchant attrition rates for the portfolios acquired in fiscal year to approximate normal rates historically experienced by the company s existing portfolios 
in the fourth quarter of  the company expensed as additional amortization all remaining deferred processing costs totaling approximately  associated with the march abc merchant portfolio purchase in connection with the conversion of processing of this purchased merchant portfolio to its primary processing bank 
provision for merchant losses the provision for merchant losses decreased from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year and increased to  in fiscal year the decrease from fiscal year to represents a decrease 
from fiscal year to fiscal year  the provision for merchant losses increased but decreased as a percentage of total revenue 
in fiscal year  the company adjusted its provision to reflect more accurately recent experience and historical trends 
in fiscal  the company increased its provision for estimated chargebacks and merchant fraud to reflect the increase in merchant accounts serviced while continuing to evaluate the company s recent experience and historical trends stock award compensation stock award compensation increased from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year the company recognizes noncash compensation expense based on the vesting of certain stock awards 
the vesting of awarded shares accelerated upon completion of the initial public offering 
as a result  in fiscal year the remaining unearned compensation expense of  was recognized at the completion of the company s initial public offering 
interest expense in fiscal  the company recognized net interest expense of  in fiscal year  net interest income increased from  to million in fiscal this represents a increase from fiscal year to fiscal year and a  increase from fiscal year to fiscal year the company consummated an initial public offering in august  a second public offering in october and a third public offering in april the company received net proceeds from the initial  second and third public offerings of approximately million  million and million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses of the offerings  respectively 
with the first two offerings  the company repaid all borrowings outstanding under its credit facility 
the company received interest income from the investment of the remaining net proceeds from the initial and second offerings and on the total net proceeds from the april offering 
to the extent the company should use the net proceeds from the third offering for acquisitions or working capital  management would not expect to continue to recognize a significant amount of interest income 
income tax as a result of the company s increased profitability in fiscal year income tax expense has increased 
income tax expense increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year the company s effective income tax rate for fiscal years through has remained relatively consistent 
effective august   the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas as required 
under sfas  the liability method is used in accounting for income taxes  whereby deferred tax assets of approximately  were recognized in fiscal year as a benefit upon adoption for the expected future tax consequences of events that had been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
seasonality the company s revenue volume is generated from consumer credit purchases 
however  the company s revenues do not generally reflect the seasonal fluctuations that are typically associated with traditional peaks in consumer retail sales 
the company s merchants are largely engaged in retail operations which do not display these seasonal fluctuations in consumer spending 
as a result  the company experiences a generally even distribution of revenues throughout its fiscal year with the third quarter experiencing a slightly lower percentage of annual revenues 
quarterly information the following table sets forth statements of income data for each of the eight quarters in the two year period ended july  this income data has been restated for the mha acquisition effective july  accounted for as a pooling of interests 
this unaudited quarterly information has been prepared on the same basis as the annual information presented elsewhere herein and  in management s opinion  includes all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the selected quarterly information when read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire fiscal year or for any future period 
first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter total in thousands revenues      gross margin      income from operations      income before provision for income taxes      net income    revenues      gross margin      income from operations      income before provision for income taxes      net income      the quarterly variances shown above are generally indicative of those discussed for the annual periods 
specifically  the growth in revenues resulted primarily from purchased merchant portfolios  revenue enhancement programs and the growth from a visa mastercard sales solicitation which contributed progressively to quarterly profits 
in fiscal year  purchased merchant portfolios generated higher revenues and  accordingly  a higher gross margin 
in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  the company made significant acquisitions late in fiscal which have a higher cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues than those historically experienced by the company 
in the first quarter of fiscal year the company recognized all remaining unearned compensation relating to the vesting of certain awarded shares 
the shares vested in august at the completion of the company s initial public offering 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the third quarter of fiscal year include operating expenses of approximately  relating to a visa mastercard sales solicitation program 
revenues generated by the program were not realized until fiscal year in all quarters of fiscal year  and in all quarters of fiscal except the first  the company reported net interest income 
following the company s initial public offering in august  the company repaid all borrowings outstanding under its principal revolving credit loan and bridge loan 
the company consummated a second public offering in october and a third public offering in april the company received interest income from the investment of the remaining net proceeds from the first two offerings and interest income on the total net proceeds from the third offering 
liquidity and capital resources the company recognizes as revenue in its statement of income the full discount rate and related fees collected from the merchant 
the various costs incurred by the company  including amounts paid to the card issuing bank  the processing bank  and the network service provider  are reflected as costs of revenues 
in accordance with the company s contracts with its processing banks  all of the funds collection and most of the disbursement function is performed on behalf of the company by the processing bank 
at month end the processing bank collects the total discount rate and related fees from the merchants and disburses to each of the service providers their fees  except disbursements for interchange fees paid to the card issuing bank are made daily 
shortly after month end  the processing bank disburses to the company the remainder of the funds collected from the merchant which represents a significant portion of the company s gross margin 
although the company s revenues reflect the full discount rate and related fees collected  the cash flow statement is prepared using the direct method as provided in sfas  statement of cash flows  and reflects cash received from merchants at the net amount collected as the cash flows received by the company from processing banks are net of the amounts disbursed to the other parties described above 
this presentation follows the actual flow of funds to the company 
several factors can alter the profitability to the company of merchant transactions 
primarily  these include i improper use of the card reading terminal by the merchant resulting in higher interchange fees paid to the card issuing bank  ii lower than anticipated average dollar sales of credit card transactions thereby reducing the discount rate collected because many of the transaction costs are fixed  iii losses incurred as a result of customer chargebacks the company can be required to absorb the full retail purchase amount  iv the inability to collect the discount rate because of insufficient funds in the merchant s bank account  v merchant fraud and vi excessive volume of customer return transactions in which the company again incurs all costs except interchange fees 
actual losses realized as a result of customer chargebacks  merchant fraud and the company s inability to collect the discount rate as a result of insufficient merchant funds were approximately  and  for fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 
the company s actual losses as a percentage of total revenues realized remained consistent from fiscal to fiscal management does not believe that the other factors mentioned above have had a material effect on the company s profitability 
working capital cash flow provided by operating activities was million in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year the increase in cash flow from operating activities resulted from increases in net income for each period which have been achieved principally through purchases of merchant portfolios and internal generation of new merchant accounts 
the effect of net income increases is partially offset by increases in working capital needs 
at july   the company had working capital of million  as compared to negative working capital of  at july  this increase in working capital primarily reflects the net proceeds from the company s third public offering in april accounts receivable increased  from july  to july  this increase was the result of increases in the number of merchant accounts acquired through purchases of merchant portfolios and  to a lesser extent  the internal generation of new merchant accounts 
additionally  at july  the company had a current accounts receivable of million for the proceeds from a life insurance policy on the company s former chief financial officer 
other assets  excluding non competition agreements and deferred processing costs  at july   increased from july  because of the restricted cash balance of  required to be maintained in connection with an acquisition 
additionally  in june when certain acquired merchant accounts were converted to the company s primary processing bank  the bank required a restricted cash balance of million to be maintained for six months 
these funds were released to the company in fiscal year additionally  other assets increased as a result of deferred financing costs incurred in fiscal year as a result of amendments to the company s credit agreement 
accounts payable at july  increased  as compared to july   as a result of increased processing costs related to mha s increase in merchant accounts 
accrued liabilities increased  from july   to july   primarily as a result of increased income and state franchise taxes 
capital expenditures and investing activities capital expenditures were approximately million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year and million for fiscal year the increase in capital expenditures was primarily the result of additional expenditures related to the company s management information system  the purchase of additional credit card terminals  the company s relocation of its office facilities and the purchase of peripheral equipment for lease to merchants 
in addition to the increase in capital expenditures  the company used million  million and million for the purchase of merchant portfolios in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the company purchased five merchant portfolios in fiscal  nine merchant portfolios in fiscal year and five in fiscal year financing activities the significant increase in cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year resulted from the consummation of the company s initial public offering in august cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year was million which reflects the net proceeds of the initial public offering after retirement of the company s outstanding indebtedness to first union national bank of tennessee and to abc for the march abc purchase 
additionally  the company issued million of long term debt in connection with three of the nine merchant portfolios purchased in fiscal year the cash provided by financing activities for fiscal reflects the company s consummation of its second and third public offerings in october and april  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal which reflects the net proceeds from the offerings after retirement of the company s outstanding bank indebtedness 
future capital needs management believes that significant expenditures for the purchase of additional merchant portfolios may be required for the company to sustain its growth in the future 
management expects to fund such purchases primarily through cash generated from operations and additional bank borrowings 
management believes the combination of these sources will be sufficient to meet the company s anticipated liquidity needs and its growth plans through fiscal year the company  however  may pursue additional expansion opportunities  including purchases of additional merchant portfolios  which may require additional capital  and the company may incur  from time to time  additional short term and long term indebtedness or issue  in public or private transactions  equity or debt securities  the availability and terms of which will depend upon then prevailing market and other conditions 
the company s revolving credit facility was amended and restated during fiscal year to increase the line of credit to million 
the company repaid all outstanding debt related to this credit facility with the proceeds from its second public offering during fiscal year the amended agreement expires november  with all amounts then outstanding under the agreement due on november   unless the agreement is extended or the outstanding amounts have been converted to a term loan requiring equal monthly payments for months 
borrowings under the amended revolving credit facility are used to finance purchases of merchant portfolios and equipment and for working capital purposes 
borrowings are secured by substantially all the company s assets and life insurance policies on the lives of two of the company s executive officers
