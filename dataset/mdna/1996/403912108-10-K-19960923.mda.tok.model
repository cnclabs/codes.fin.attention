item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company licenses its products primarily pursuant to multi year non cancellable agreements that  in general  provide for payment of equal annual license fees over their terms 
this type of arrangement provides the company with a significant recurring component to its revenues each year 
revenues from software license agreements are recognized upon execution of a contract and shipment of the software provided that no significant vendor obligations remain outstanding and collection of the related receivable is deemed probable by management 
for annual recurring license fees  revenues are recognized on the contract anniversary date 
the company accrues incidental support costs associated with these licenses when revenues are recognized 
revenues from services are recognized when the services are delivered 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to enter into new license agreements at the current rate or to maintain the current pricing for its products 
prior to fiscal  the company s revenues were derived from a single product  codereview  and between july and may from two products  codereview and patterns review 
in may  the company introduced its third product  episode profiler  and in october introduced its fourth product  quality profiler 
the acquisition of the integrity group  inc in april provided the company with its fifth product  credentialer 
the company released its sixth product  referral profiler  in july the company believes that as the markets for codereview and patterns review mature  the continued growth of the company will require the successful introduction of new products and further enhancements to its existing products 
the company has experienced a seasonal pattern in its operating results  with the fourth and second fiscal quarters typically having the highest revenues and net income and the first and third fiscal quarters typically having lower revenues and net income 
the timing of revenues is influenced by a number of factors  including the timing of individual orders and shipments  seasonal customer buying patterns and changes in product development and sales and marketing expenditures 
the company believes the seasonality of its revenues and net income for the fourth fiscal quarter can be attributed to due dates for payment obligations under multi year license agreements  renewals of existing agreements and the company s sales compensation program  which is based significantly on fiscal year sales levels 
furthermore  the company typically experiences long sales cycles for new customers  which may extend over several quarters before a sale is consummated 
as a result  the company believes that quarterly results of operations will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations and that its results of operations for any particular quarter or fiscal year may not be indicative of results of operations for future periods 
the company believes that continued investment in research and development and expansion of its national direct sales force are critical to its success 
the company believes that the aggregate amount of research and development expense will continue to increase  if revenues increase as expected  while the level of research and development expense as a percentage of revenues will remain relatively constant 
the company expanded its sales force during fiscal in anticipation of the release of episode profiler and the introduction of quality profiler and again in fiscal following the acquisition of the integrity group  inc and the anticipated release of referral profiler 
the company believes that its national sales force will be well positioned to address the shift of financial risk associated with the delivery of healthcare from payors to providers and consequently  will be prepared to sell into this new market for the company 
the company capitalizes software costs for internally developed software in accordance with fasb  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
these costs relate primarily to the development of new products and the extension of existing applications to new markets or platforms using existing technologies and programming methods 
the capitalized costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the product typically three years  commencing when each product is available to the market 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on the company s financial results 
there can be no assurance  however  that inflation may not adversely affect the company s financial results in the future

the company expects sales and marketing to remain relatively constant as a percentage of revenues 
research and development 
research and development efforts by the company are focused on developing new products and enhancing existing products 
research and development increased from  in to  in primarily as a result of the expenses associated with episode profiler  and to a lesser extent  referral profiler and quality profiler 
research and development increased from  in to  in as a result of continued research efforts on quality profiler and referral profiler and new efforts focused on the company s next product line currently under development 
as a percentage of revenues  research and development increased from in to in and decreased to in the decrease in is a result of two factors the significant increase in revenue dollars in over and the release of episode profiler in late and quality profiler in october  both of which were in development during fiscal with the increase in development activities on the company s new product lines  management expects that research and development expenditures will increase but remain substantially the same as a percentage of revenue for the foreseeable future

safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of statements in this report concerning the future results of operations  financial condition and business of the company are forward looking statements as defined in the securities act of and the securities exchange act of investors are cautioned that information contained in these forward looking statements is inherently uncertain  and that actual performance and results may differ materially due to numerous risk factors  including but not limited to the following seasonality and variable operating results 
the company has experienced a seasonal pattern in its operating results  with the fourth and second fiscal quarters typically having the highest revenues and net income and the first and third fiscal quarters typically having lower revenues and net income 
the timing of revenues is influenced by a number of factors  including the timing of individual orders and shipments  seasonal customer buying patterns and changes in product development and sales and marketing expenditures 
the company believes the seasonality of its revenues and net income for the fourth fiscal quarter can be attributed to due dates for payment obligations under multi year license agreements  renewals of existing agreements and the company s sales compensation program  which is based significantly on fiscal year sales levels 
the company believes the seasonality of its revenues and net income in the second fiscal quarter can be attributed to the seasonal purchasing patterns of its customers 
the company reported a net loss in the first and third quarters of fiscal and there can be no assurance that the company will be profitable during future quarters 
in addition  although the company has no present agreements or commitments to enter into any major contracts  the signing of a major contract could generate a large increase in revenues and net income for any given quarter or fiscal year  which increase may prove anomalous when compared to changes in revenues and net income in other periods 
furthermore  the company typically experiences long sales cycles for new customers  which may extend over several quarters before a sale is consummated 
as a result  the company believes that quarterly results of operations will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations and that its results of operations for any particular quarter or fiscal year may not be indicative of results of operations for future periods 
dependence upon new product development  acceptance and enhancement 
the market for the company s products is characterized by rapid technological progress and changing customer needs 
the company believes that as the markets for codereview and pattern review mature  the continued growth of the company will require the successful introduction of new products 
accordingly  the company s future success will depend on its ability to successfully develop and introduce new products  including referral profiler  and to enhance its existing products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing  introducing on a timely basis  and marketing such products or enhancements or that they will be accepted by the market 
research and development expenditures have equaled   and of the company s revenue for the fiscal years ended june    and  respectively 
significant research and development expenditures will be required in the future 
there can be no assurance that the company s expected new product releases and product enhancements will adequately address customer requirements for performance and functionality or that its software will not contain bugs that would delay product introduction or shipment 
dependence on third party for component of episode profiler 
a principal component of episode profiler  the episode treatment groups product  is licensed from a third party vendor  symmetry health data systems  inc symmetry  under the terms of a month license which commenced november  and has a month renewal option which is contingent on the company meeting minimum royalty requirements 
symmetry has agreed  subject to certain conditions  that it will not license episode treatment groups to certain other companies which might be considered competitors of the company 
while the company believes that the terms of such license are adequate to protect the company s investment in episode profiler  any factor adversely affecting the company s ability to retain the benefits of such license or to obtain the updated episode treatment groups would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition and business 
risk of inability to grow through acquisitions 
the company has grown  and intends to continue to grow  in part through acquisitions of products  technologies and businesses 
the company s ability to expand successfully through acquisitions depends on many factors  including the successful identification and acquisition of products  technologies and businesses and management s ability to effectively integrate and operate the new products  technologies or businesses 
there is significant competition for acquisition opportunities in the industry  which may intensify due to consolidation in the industry  increasing the costs of capitalizing on such opportunities 
the company competes for acquisition opportunities with other companies that have significantly greater financial and management resources 
management of growth 
the company is currently experiencing a period of rapid growth and expansion which could place a significant strain on the company s personnel and resources 
the company s growth has resulted in an increase in the level of responsibility for both existing and new management personnel 
the company has sought to manage its current and anticipated growth through the recruitment of additional management and technical personnel and the implementation of internal systems and controls 
however  the failure to manage growth effectively could adversely affect the company s results of operations  financial condition or business 
inability to retain or attract customers due to competition 
the market in which hpr s products are licensed is highly competitive 
most of the company s competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  product development and marketing resources than the company 
the company s potential competitors for customers include healthcare information companies and large data processing and information companies 
many of these competitors have substantial installed customer bases in the healthcare industry and the ability to fund significant product development and acquisition efforts 
the company believes that the principal competitive factors in its market are clinical credibility and integrity and product innovation 
these factors address both customer needs for cost containment tools and increasing industry concerns about quality control 
other important competitive factors include product reputation and reliability  system features  client service  price  and the effectiveness of marketing and sales efforts 
there can be no assurance that future competition will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition or business 
dependence on proprietary software and clinical knowledge bases 
the company s success is dependent to a significant extent on its ability to maintain the proprietary and confidential software and clinical knowledge bases incorporated in codereview  patterns review  episode profiler  quality profiler  referral profiler and other products as they are released 
the company relies on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and contractual protections to establish and protect its proprietary rights 
there can  however  be no assurance that the legal protections and the precautions taken by the company will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of the company s technology 
any infringement or misappropriation of the company s proprietary software and clinical knowledge bases would disadvantage the company in its efforts to retain and attract new customers in a highly competitive market  and could cause the company to lose revenues or incur substantial litigation expense 
in addition  these protections and precautions do not prevent independent third party development of competitive technology or products 
further  the company depends on third party suppliers to license to hpr necessary technology that is incorporated into certain of the company s products  including episode profiler 
the inability of the company for any reason to continue using or otherwise acquire such technology could prevent distribution of such products  having a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition or business 
dependence on certain key personnel 
the company depends to a significant extent on key management  technical and marketing personnel 
the company s growth and future success will depend in large part on its ability to attract  motivate and retain highly qualified personnel 
the company does not have employment agreements with any of its officers or key employees providing for their employment for any specific term 
the company does not have key man life insurance on any of its personnel other than marcia j 
radosevich  the company s chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer 
the loss of key personnel  particularly the loss of more than one member of the company s executive management team  or the inability to hire or retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition or business 
uncertainty in the healthcare industry 
the healthcare industry is subject to changing political  economic and regulatory influences that may affect the procurement practices and operation of healthcare organizations 
the company s products are designed to function within the structure of the current national healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently being used in the united states 
the company believes that the commercial value and appeal of its products may be adversely affected if that system were to be materially changed 
during the past several years  the united states healthcare industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation of  among other things  reimbursement rates 
certain proposals to reform the united states healthcare system are currently under consideration by congress 
these programs may contain proposals to increase government involvement in healthcare and otherwise change the operating environment for the company s customers 
healthcare organizations may react to these proposals and the uncertainty surrounding such proposals by curtailing or deferring investments in cost containment tools and related technology such as the company s products 
the company cannot predict what impact  if any  such factors might have on its results of operations  financial condition or business 
in addition  many healthcare providers are consolidating to create integrated healthcare delivery systems with greater regional market power 
as a result  these emerging systems could have greater bargaining power  which may lead to price erosion of the company s products 
the failure of the company to maintain adequate price levels would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition or business 
other legislative or market driven reforms could have unpredictable effects on the company s results of operations  financial condition or business 
risk of product liability claims 
the company s products provide information that relates to payment of healthcare claims and to the appropriateness of medical treatment in particular cases and in general 
any failure by the company s products to process such claims or to review such treatments accurately could result in claims against the company by its customers 
further  successful use of the company s products could influence the treatments rendered by providers and give rise to claims against the company by patients or providers 
the company maintains insurance to protect against certain claims associated with the use of its products  but there can be no assurance that its insurance coverage would adequately cover any claim asserted against the company 
a successful claim brought against the company in excess of  or excluded from  its insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition or business 
even unsuccessful claims could result in the company s expenditure of funds in litigation and management time and resources 
while to date the company has not experienced any product liability claims against it  the company is aware of claims made against payors by patients for coverage decisions which adversely influenced medical treatment 
there can be no assurance that the company will not be subject to product liability claims  that such claims will not result in liability in excess of its insurance coverage  that the company s insurance will cover such claims or that appropriate insurance will continue to be available to the company in the future at commercially reasonable rates 
in addition  if liability of the company were to be established  substantial revisions to its product could be required that may cause the company to incur additional unanticipated research and development expenses 
possible volatility of stock price 
prior to august   there was no public market for the common stock  and there can be no assurance that an active trading market will be sustained or that the market price of the common stock will not decline below its current price 
the stock market historically has experienced volatility which has affected the market price of securities of many companies and which has sometimes been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
the trading price of the common stock could also be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly results of operations  announcements of new products or acquisitions by the company or its competitors  governmental regulatory action  other developments or disputes with respect to proprietary rights  general trends in the industry and overall market conditions  and other factors 
the market price of the common stock may be significantly affected by factors such as announcements of new products by the company s competitors  as well as variations in the market conditions in the medical cost containment or software industries in general 
the market price may also be affected by movements in prices of equity securities in general
