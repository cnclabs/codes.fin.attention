item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year ended may  fiscal year compared to year ended may  fiscal year the company s revenues increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year due to higher sales volume in the company s aerospace  power generation and energy and other markets 
these sales volume increases during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year are reflected by market as follows a million increase in aerospace  a million increase in power generation and energy and a million increase in other 
the cause of the strength in these markets was higher demands for spares from aerospace engine prime contractors and higher extruded pipe shipments to energy customers 
the higher spares demand will continue to be reflected in fiscal year revenues 
revenues in fiscal year and  to a lesser extent  in fiscal year were limited by raw material shortages and production delays caused by capacity constraints of the company s suppliers 
the revenue increases mentioned above have occurred while the company s backlog has grown to million at may  from million at may  the company believes that the higher order activity reflects continued higher spares demand and new business resulting from increasing production rates on commercial aircraft by commercial airframe primes 
the company s gross margins were in fiscal year  as compared to in fiscal year this improvement resulted from higher production volumes and productivity gains resulting from the company s efforts toward focusing forging production of rotating parts for jet engines in its houston  texas facility and forging production of airframe structures and large turbine parts in its grafton  massachusetts facility 
additionally  continuing realization of cost reductions from synergies associated with the integration of cameron contributed to this higher ratio 
these favorable trends were offset somewhat by production delays resulting from the raw material shortages experienced during fiscal years and additionally  in the second half of fiscal year  the higher spares demand referred to above required the company to purchase certain raw materials under terms not covered by long term agreements ltas with its vendors 
the company simultaneously entered into supply customer and purchase vendor ltas and minimized its raw material price exposure to an anticipated volume level 
to the extent that the demand is greater than anticipated by the ltas  the company must purchase raw materials at market prices 
the current rebound in demand for many of these raw materials  especially nickel and titanium  has resulted in significant price increases by the company s vendors which have negatively affected the company s gross margins 
the company is not likely to see significant pricing relief for its products until early calendar when new ltas that the company expects to negotiate with its customers will go into effect 
until the new ltas are finalized  the company may continue to experience pressures on its gross margins
