semiconductor market fluctuations the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns at various times  which often have a disproportionate effect on manufacturers of semiconductor capital equipment 
while the semiconductor industry in recent periods has experienced increased demand and production capacity constraints  it is uncertain how long these conditions will continue 
as a result there can be no assurance that the company will not experience material fluctuations in future quarterly or annual operating results as a result of such a market fluctuation 
variability in quarterly operating results during each quarter  the company customarily sells a limited number of systems  thus a change in the shipment of a few systems in a quarter can have a significant impact on results of operations for a particular quarter 
to achieve sales objectives  the company must generally obtain orders for systems to be shipped in the same quarter in which the order is obtained 
moreover  customers may cancel or reschedule shipments with limited or no penalty  and production difficulties could delay shipments 
accordingly  the company s operating results are subject to significant variability from quarter to quarter and could be adversely affected for a particular quarter if shipments for that quarter were lower than anticipated 
moreover  since the company ships a significant quantity of products at or near the end of each quarter  the magnitude of fluctuation is not known until late in or at the end of any given quarter 
international operations in fiscal  of the company s net sales were derived from customers in international markets 
the company is therefore subject to certain risks common to many export activities  such as governmental regulations  export license requirements  air transportation disruptions  freight rates and the risk of imposition of tariffs and other trade barriers 
all of the company s international sales are invoiced in us dollars and  accordingly  have not historically been subject to fluctuating currency exchange rates 
in the future  the company may decide to conduct its international business denominated in foreign currency in which case there can be no assurance that the company would be able to protect its position by hedging its exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
new product introductions the company s success depends in part on its continued ability to develop and market new products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner or that such products  if developed  will achieve market acceptance 
additionally there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manufacture such products at profitable levels or in sufficient quantities to meet customer requirements 
the inability of the company to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
competition the markets for the company s products are highly competitive 
the company s competitors include a number of established companies that have significantly greater financial  technical  manufacturing and marketing resources than the company 
the company also competes with a number of smaller companies 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against current and future sources of competition or that the competitive pressures faced by the company will not adversely effect its profitability or financial performance 
customer concentrations although the company has a growing customer base  from time to time  an individual customer may account for or more of the company s quarterly or annual net sales 
during the year ended march   one customer accounted for of net sales 
the company expects that such customer concentration of net sales will continue to occur from time to time as customers place large quantity orders with the company 
as a result  the loss of  or significant reduction in purchases by  any such customer could have an adverse effect on the company s annual or quarterly financial results 
investments in research development and selling general administrative expenses the company is currently investing in specific time sensitive strategic programs related to both the research and development and selling  general and administrative areas which the company believes are critical to its future ability to compete effectively in the market

the company has limited internal sales personnel 
a reduction in the sales efforts by the company s current manufacturers representatives or a termination of their relationships with the company could adversely affect the company s operations and financial performance 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain its current manufacturers representatives or its distribution channels by selling directly through its sales employees or enter into arrangements with new manufacturers representatives 
dependence on key personnel the company s success depends to a significant extent upon a number of senior management and technical personnel 
these persons are not bound by employment agreements 
the loss of the services of a number of these key persons could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s future success will depend in large part upon its ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel in the company s industry is intense 
although the company has been successful to date in this endeavor  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel it requires to successfully develop new and enhanced products and to continue to grow and operate profitably 
dependence on proprietary technology the company s success is dependent upon proprietary software and hardware which the company protects primarily through patents and restrictions on access to its trade secrets 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology or independent development by others of similar technology 
although the company believes that its products and technology do not infringe any existing proprietary rights of others  the use of patents to protect software and hardware has increased and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the company in the future
