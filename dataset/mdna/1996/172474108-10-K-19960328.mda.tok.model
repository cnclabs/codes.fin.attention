item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cinergy  cg e  psi  and ulh p the companies cinergy is a registered holding company under the puhca 
cinergy was created in the october merger of resources and cg e 
the business combination was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
following the merger  cinergy became the parent holding company of psi  previously resources utility subsidiary  cg e  investments  and services 
financial condition competitive pressures electric utility industry cinergy  cg e  psi  and ulh p introduction the primary factor influencing the future profitability of cinergy is the changing competitive environment for energy services  including the impact of emerging technologies  and the related commoditization of electric power markets 
changes in the industry include increased competition in wholesale power markets and ongoing pressure for customer choice by large industrial customers and  ultimately  by all retail customers 
pressures for customer choice extending choice to end user customers  also referred to as retail wheeling  would allow customers within a particular utility s service territory to unbundle their purchase decisions 
customers would be able to buy power as a commodity directly from another source and buy distribution service over the power lines of the local utility for delivery 
the regulatory and legislative reform to facilitate this result is primarily driven by large industrial energy users  the emergence of new suppliers in the competitive markets  and increasing evidence from other regulated industries that wherever effective competition is feasible  it can yield lower costs and a wider range of customer options and services than traditional cost of service regulation 
industrial customers are intensifying their efforts to change the regulatory process so that they may access the lower cost power necessary to remain competitive in the global marketplace 
the current restrictions on access to low cost power are exacerbated by traditional cost of service regulation which has produced average industrial rates to customers that vary substantially across the united states from less than cents per kwh to approximately cents per kwh 
while customer efforts at industry reform have resulted in some success  the emergence of new competitors to the local franchise utility has become an equally effective force for change 
this new competition was facilitated by the energy policy act of energy act  which granted the ferc authority to order wholesale transmission access 
new competitors include power marketers  power brokers  and local franchise utilities that now sell power in regional or national markets 
to date  the ferc has granted approximately power marketers the ability to sell at market based rates and accepted several utilities general sales tariffs that allow for sales anywhere in the united states 
cinergy s non firm power sales tariff was accepted by the ferc in december  and an affiliated power marketer of cinergy was given authorization to begin transacting business in september additionally  utilities are using merger and acquisition strategies to achieve expanded scale and scope to support a regional or national market strategy 
for example  since the beginning of  there were seven mergers involving major investor owned utilities announced in the industry  representing nearly billion of combined market value 
brokers are intermediaries between buyers and sellers ie  they do not take title to the power 
power marketers are entities licensed by the ferc to conduct bulk power trades at market based prices 
they manage portfolios of power contracts to which they have title and owned generation and package energy products for customers of bulk power  including price risk management contracts such as options on fixed price energy or guaranteed fixed price contracts 
despite increased activity by utilities and new competitors to respond to the demands of industrial customers for greater choice and lower prices  the pace of legislative and regulatory restructuring appears to have slowed somewhat in many states continue to examine the complex technical and economic issues restructuring presents 
among other things  states are considering the trade offs between achieving long run economic efficiency and potential short term wealth transfers between customers and shareholders see further discussion below or among customers  as well as the potential impact if any of restructuring on other socially desirable objectives like clean air or energy efficiency 
the most difficult issue polarizing the debate on the future competitive framework of the industry is the transition from the old order to the new and who will bear the costs of historical utility investments or past commitments incurred under cost of service regulation 
if the generation component of the industry s business was immediately brought to market and priced at competitive wholesale prices  it is likely that many utilities would currently be unable to recover a large percentage of their fixed costs 
other costs such as investments in energy efficiency dsm investments could also become stranded ie  unrecoverable at competitive market prices in this scenario 
the financial impact on the industry of alternative scenarios for a transition to market prices is highly dependent upon the speed of the transition  the clearing price for electricity in a fully competitive market  and customer behavior eg  loyalty when afforded potentially lower cost alternatives 
because of the complex nature of electric power flows  the variety of state by state regulations  and the potential inability or unwillingness to shut down high cost plants eg  nuclear in a fully competitive market  great uncertainty exists as to the time frame required for the future price of electricity in a commodity market to rise to long run marginal cost eg  full cost of new resources and  importantly  how close to short term marginal cost eg  fuel and variable operating expenses prices may fall in the interim 
for example  depending upon the scenario  moody s has quantified the stranded investment issue for the industry at between billion and billion with the most likely result approximately billion  while s p has estimated a total exposure of between billion and billion and  respectively of total industry annual revenues 
the oak ridge national laboratory has quantified the industry financial impact at billion for every mill tenth of a cent change in market price 
the position that all prudent past investments and commitments must be honored has received support from regulators at the ferc and in the state of california  both of which have provided for the recovery of utility stranded investments see further discussion of each of these proposals herein  although that position varies from state to state 
for example  a recent survey of state utility commissioners from states concluded that approximately agreed with allowing recovery of stranded costs at the state level  while disagreed with recovery  and the remaining were uncertain 
cinergy s response to the changing competitive environment cinergy supports increased competition in the electric utility industry 
cinergy believes that competition would benefit electric customers and the economy as a whole 
at the same time  cinergy possesses competitive advantages eg  low cost generation that could work to the benefit of its shareholders in a competitive environment 
however  these advantages could be substantially eroded by restrictive regulations that lag the development of a competitive market and limit the company s ability to preempt the competition in responding to customer needs 
as such  cinergy has chosen to take a leadership role in state and federal debates on industry reform 
however  cinergy believes there are two substantial impediments to realizing the potential efficiencies of competition in the generation segment of the business resolving the issue of stranded costs associated with past utility commitments and recognizing states rights  concerns  and authority in regulating a product that flows in interstate commerce 
while cinergy is among the lowest cost producers nationwide and has been recognized by both moody s and s p as having little exposure to stranded investment  cinergy nevertheless recognizes the legitimacy of the industry s equity argument for recovery of at least some of the costs associated with past commitments and the importance of resolving this issue in the interest of moving the debate to more important issues like how to achieve the potential economic efficiencies that competition offers and what regulatory and structural reforms are necessary to achieve those results 
cinergy remains concerned that even low cost producers  under certain scenarios  could face difficult if not ruinous competition in an excess capacity market that was created at least in part by past government policies 
cinergy has approximately billion of regulatory assets past costs incurred for which regulators have promised recovery in the future that could be at risk  at least in part  in some scenarios 
at the same time  cinergy believes that full recovery of the industry s potential stranded investment is unrealistic to expect in a market where certain customers can bypass stranded cost mechanisms eg  self generation  is politically infeasible  and is neither necessarily equitable nor efficient 
additionally  cinergy believes that efficient competition cannot be achieved if neighboring states reach substantially different conclusions concerning items such as the transition rules  the timetables for implementation  universal service to customers  and reliability standards 
such state by state disparity would provide inequitable advantages to some competitors while unduly harming others ability to compete in the marketplace 
while cinergy believes that satisfactory results cannot be achieved without a broad national consensus for the long term goal and a time frame for getting there  cinergy does not believe a total preemption of states rights on this issue is either politically feasible or necessary 
cinergy intends to pursue aggressively a national solution that will recognize the legitimacy of certain claims to past costs within some level of cost and demonstrated prudence and provide a required framework for states to align their regulations and policies within a specified time frame 
the framework would require a consistent transition to full competition for generation in all markets  thus minimizing the current fragmentation resulting from the initiatives of multiple regulators and regulations 
as further evidence of its leadership in the restructuring of the electric utility industry  in february  cinergy and several other midwestern utilities announced the formation of a coalition to create and develop a multi state transmission region operated by an independent system operator iso 
the coalition  which cinergy believes is likely to expand in membership  is proposing a midwest iso which would ensure non discriminating open transmission access  develop a regional transmission tariff  and ensure system reliability 
cinergy believes the formation of isos will be a major step toward facilitating competition in the electric utility industry and potentially more mergers among utilities ie  reduced market power concerns 
for an electric utility to be successful in this competitive environment  it is critical that regulatory reform in all segments of the business keeps pace with the competitive realities facing electric utilities and their customers in not only generation  but also transmission  distribution  and energy services activities 
strict adherence to traditional  cost based rate of return regulation will both significantly disadvantage a utility s ability to compete successfully to supply customer needs and result in a failure to realize the potential economic efficiencies from restructuring 
for example  performance based regulation eg  price caps would result in better economic incentives to control costs and likely add substantial flexibility for the franchise utility in the transition to a fully competitive environment 
legislation allowing significant flexibility was passed senate bill in indiana in the company intends to pursue similar flexibility in all markets where it conducts business 
federal developments mega nopr the energy act granted the ferc the authority to order wholesale transmission access 
acting on that authority  in march  the ferc took a substantial step toward assuring increased competition in the electric industry by issuing the mega nopr 
cinergy was the first utility in the country to file its comments endorsing the mega nopr  reaffirming its support for the ferc s authority to order utilities owning transmission systems to provide access to other entities at rates and terms comparable to those provided to affiliated companies 
as proposed  the ferc s mega nopr would  among other things  provide for mandatory filing of open access comparability transmission tariffs  provide for functional unbundling of all services  require utilities to use the filed tariffs for their own bulk power transactions  establish an electronic bulletin board for transmission availability and pricing information  and establish a contract based approach to recovering any potential stranded costs as a result of customer choice at the wholesale level 
a final order is expected to be issued during the first half of repeal of the puhca after a year long review of its continuing regulation of public utility holding companies under the puhca  in june  the sec endorsed recommendations for reform of the puhca 
the recommendations call for repeal and  pending repeal  significant administrative reform of the year old statute 
while the report offers three alternative approaches to repeal and legislative reform  the sec s preferred option is repeal coupled with a transition period of one year or longer and a transfer of certain consumer protection provisions of the puhca to the ferc 
the report further recommends that  pending consideration of legislative options  the sec take prompt administrative action  by rulemaking and on a case by case basis  to modernize and simplify regulation under the puhca  with particular reference to financing transactions  diversification into non utility businesses  utility mergers and acquisitions  and the puhca s integration standards 
in the latter regard  the report recommends a changed interpretation of the puhca to permit registered holding companies to own combination electric and gas utility companies  provided the affected states agree 
subsequent to the issuance of the report  the sec adopted rule changes exempting various types of financing transactions by utility and non utility subsidiaries of registered holding companies 
the sec also proposed a rule that would exempt investments by registered systems in specified energy related companies  subject to certain conditions 
in october  a bill was introduced in the united states senate providing for the repeal of the puhca 
the bill is pending before congress 
in addition  various members of congress have indicated their support for industry restructuring 
one view that has been publicly stated in congress is that the repeal of the puhca and the orderly transition to open competition should be considered comprehensively rather than piecemeal 
hearings have been initiated in congress for a comprehensive review of the electric utility industry and the role congress should play in fostering competition 
cinergy supports the repeal of the puhca  either as part of comprehensive reform of the electric utility industry or as separate legislation 
cinergy  cg e  psi  and ulh p state developments during  states initiated or took part in formal or informal processes  held hearings  and or passed legislation addressing retail wheeling  restructuring  competition  alternative regulation  or closely related issues concerning electric utility industry restructuring 
cinergy and cg e ohio the puco has been actively examining issues raised by continuing competitive pressures 
the chairman of the puco has publicly stated his desire to make progress toward enhancing competition in ohio  but with the objective of doing it right and not necessarily first 
in late  the puco formed an electric competition roundtable that meets on an informal basis to address competition  restructuring  performance based regulation  and related issues  with a stated mission of promoting increased competitive options for ohio businesses that do not unduly harm the interests of utility company shareholders or ratepayers 
in  the roundtable participants submitted principles for a customer choice pilot program for interruptible buy through service 
the puco issued the proposed guidelines for comments in late and issued final guidelines in february additionally  two recent actions of the puco provide support for maintaining the financial integrity of the utilities in the state 
in october  the puco approved a stipulated rate plan which could improve the competitive position of a major utility in the state by the end of a year moratorium period  including provisions for accelerating depreciation and amortization of the utility s nuclear plants and regulatory assets  respectively 
in november  the puco staff recommended a rate increase for another at risk utility that is conditioned upon the increase being utilized to achieve a significant reduction in the utility s uneconomic generating assets 
finally  a retail wheeling bill was introduced in the ohio legislature that would  if passed  require utilities to develop retail wheeling plans by january   and provide flexibility to propose alternatives to traditional cost of service ratemaking methodologies 
the bill is expected to be considered during the legislative session 
cinergy  cg e  and psi indiana the iurc has taken several steps to investigate the desirability of retail competition in the state 
a legislative regulatory flexibility committee was established by senate bill senate bill also allows the iurc to approve utility alternative regulation proposals upon a showing that  among other things  traditional regulation in a particular service sector is no longer needed 
additionally  the iurc has sponsored informal competition forums that are designed to develop a better understanding of issues related to expanding the competitive market on both the wholesale and retail levels 
while various parties have participated in this process  the citizens action coalition of indiana  inc cac a non profit organization representing customers has called for electric utilities to make a new covenant with customers 
the cac outlines eight principles intended to balance various economic and environmental interests at stake in the debate 
among other things  the covenant would include a voluntary pledge by utilities that customers bills will not increase  the environment will not be polluted  universal service will be provided  construction of new power plants will be avoided  and customers will not be harmed by utility self dealing 
cinergy  cg e  and ulh p kentucky there has been considerably less activity and interest in industry restructuring in kentucky 
this situation is generally attributed to the fact that kentucky is one of the lowest cost states in the country for electric service 
while large volume customers have circulated a draft of a retail wheeling bill  cinergy does not believe such legislation  if introduced  would receive much attention in cinergy  cg e  psi  and ulh p other states in addition to the states in which cinergy operates  significant developments in other states have occurred during not surprisingly  the higher cost regions of the country have been most interested in facilitating the more rapid development of a competitive market for electric utilities 
for example  in december  california regulators adopted a hybrid plan for restructuring the state s electric services industry 
the plan will simultaneously create an iso  a wholesale power exchange  and direct access customer choice phased in over five years beginning on january  the plan further provides for a non bypassable competitive transition charge on all retail customers to ensure utilities the opportunity for full recovery of their stranded investments by several aspects of the plan require enabling legislation to be passed in california prior to restructuring 
the plan contemplates the continuation of state regulation over the transmission and distribution segments of the industry 
in the northeastern united states  massachusetts  connecticut  new hampshire  and rhode island have all recently issued guidelines or principles for industry restructuring  authorized restructuring studies  or created retail wheeling pilot programs 
in particular  the restructuring principles issued in august by the massachusetts state commission provide for the largest utilities in the state to file negotiated restructuring plans in february to provide for a transition to full competition  including provisions for functional unbundling and retail wheeling 
a major utility in the region has already filed a plan that provides for customer choice  transition to a competitive market  restructuring  lower prices to customers in the interim  and the recovery for shareholders of all stranded costs 
at the same time  the traditionally low cost midwest has also been exploring how competition can efficiently and effectively be implemented for the benefit of customers 
in wisconsin  a revised proposal by a state commissioner focuses on some of the social issues and economic trade offs involved in restructuring the industry 
the plan has established the year as a target date for implementation of restructuring in that state  modifying the previously adopted building block approach 
the proposal would create an iso for the transmission system  while the distribution system would continue to be subject to commission jurisdiction 
other provisions of the proposal include a request for utilities to file plans for establishing functional separation of the generation  transmission  and distribution business units  commission certification of new market entrants  continuation of the winter moratorium on disconnections  a permanent commitment to low income and universal service programs  priority generation service for wisconsin customers  and the transfer of the risk of decisions on power generation from customers to shareholders 
the state of michigan has proposed a thorough review of existing state laws and the comprehensive changes to those laws that would be required to facilitate competition in the electric utility industry 
additionally  michigan has also mandated retail wheeling experiments for two of the large utility companies in the state  scheduled to begin at the time of each respective utility s next capacity solicitation 
in illinois  the legislature has passed a resolution establishing a joint legislative committee to study and recommend policy changes regarding competition 
at least two of illinois investor owned utilities have recently filed two proposed retail wheeling pilot programs with the state commission 
cinergy  cg e  psi  and ulh p cinergy s future others views the major credit rating agencies continue to recognize the risk of the imminent restructuring of the electric utility industry 
in august  moody s issued a report entitled stranded costs will threaten credit quality of us electrics  wherein moody s notes its belief that a substantial amount of fixed costs approved for recovery under the traditional regulatory regime is likely to be stranded 
in november  s p issued its report  direct access threatens electric utility revenues  in which s p estimated the potential loss of annual revenues in the industry 
however  cinergy has received praise and some measure of optimism for its position in a more competitive environment 
as part of the november upgrade of cinergy s operating subsidiaries debt and preferred stock  moody s expressed its opinion that cinergy will have no exposure to stranded costs and that cinergy is expected to be a formidable competitor because of its low production costs 
all such models used to predict potential exposure to stranded costs are extremely sensitive to the assumed future market clearing price 
in its july upgrade of cinergy s operating subsidiaries debt and preferred stock  s p commented that the business position evaluation of all the cinergy operating units is now high average reflecting low electric production costs  efficient coal fired equipment  relatively low rates  a well positioned gas operation  the absence of nuclear challenges  a healthy service territory  and a balanced capital structure 
certain sell side equity analysts continue to rank cinergy highly as a utility possessing a strong competitive profile and aggressive and innovative management  with some considering cinergy to be well positioned to outperform the market in the competitive arena 
cinergy believes the opinions of these rating agencies and equity analysts further support its position that its competitive strategy and agenda will be successful 
cinergy  cg e  and ulh p gas utility industry order in  the ferc issued order which restructured operations between interstate gas pipelines and their customers for gas sales and transportation services 
order mandated changes to the way cg e and its utility subsidiaries purchase gas supplies and contract for transportation and storage services  resulting in increased risks in meeting the gas demands of their customers 
cg e and its utility subsidiaries have responded to the supply risks and opportunities of order by introducing innovations to their supply strategy 
these innovations include contracting with major producers and marketers for firm gas supply agreements with flexible  extremely market sensitive pricing  marketing short term unused pipeline capacity and storage gas to other companies throughout the country through use of electronic bulletin boards  and restructuring their allotment of interstate pipeline capacity among delivering pipelines 
order also allowed pipelines to recover transition costs they incurred in complying with the order from customers  including cg e and its utility subsidiaries 
in july  the puco issued an order approving a stipulation between cg e and its residential and industrial customer groups providing for recovery of these pipeline transition costs 
cg e is presently recovering its order transition costs pursuant to a puco approved tariff 
cg e and its utility subsidiaries  including ulh p  recover such costs through their gas cost recovery mechanisms 
customer choice in a january gas filing in ohio see additional discussion in note b of the notes to financial statements in item financial statements and supplemental data  cg e proposed to initiate a pilot program that would allow residential customers the ability to choose their gas supplier and have cg e transport the gas for them 
this pilot program for residential customers is essentially an extension of customer choice that has been available for several years to large volume commercial and industrial customers 
proposed legislation house bill hb was adopted unanimously by the ohio house of representatives in march hb addresses regulatory reform of the natural gas industry at the state level and thus is an extension of order for local distribution companies 
the proposed legislation  among other things  provides that natural gas commodity sales services may be exempted from puco regulation and that the puco allow alternative rate making methodologies in connection with other regulated services 
the ohio senate is expected to begin consideration of the legislation in april cinergy  cg e  psi  and ulh p substantial accounting implications historically  regulated utilities have applied the provisions of statement the accounting afforded regulated utilities in statement is based on the fundamental premise that rates authorized by regulators allow recovery of a utility s costs  including the cost of capital 
these principles have allowed the deferral of costs ie  regulatory assets based on assurances of a regulator as to the future recoverability of the costs in rates charged to customers 
certain criteria must be met in order to continue to apply the provisions of statement  including regulated rates designed to recover the specific utility s costs 
failure to satisfy the criteria in statement would eliminate the basis for reporting regulatory assets 
although cinergy s current regulatory orders and regulatory environment fully support the continued recognition of its regulatory assets  the ultimate outcome of the changing competitive environment could result in cinergy discontinuing application of statement for all or part of its business 
such an event would require the write off of the portion of any regulatory asset for which sufficient regulatory assurance of future recovery no longer exists 
no evidence currently exists that would support a write off of any portion of cinergy s regulatory assets 
in march  the fasb issued statement  which is effective in january for cinergy 
statement  which addresses the identification and measurement of asset impairments for all enterprises  will be particularly relevant for electric utilities as a result of the potential for deregulation of the generation segment of the business 
statement requires recognition of impairment losses on long lived assets when book values exceed expected future cash flows 
based on the regulatory environment in which cinergy currently operates  compliance with the provisions of statement is not expected to have an adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
however  this conclusion may change in the future as competitive pressures and potential restructuring influence the electric utility industry 
cinergy intends to continue its pursuit of competitive strategies that mitigate the potential impact of these issues on the financial condition of the company

regulatory matters cinergy and psi indiana psi s current retail rate proceeding psi currently has pending before the iurc a retail rate increase request of million annually 
major components of the increase include the costs of the clean coal project  increased dsm costs  the costs of a scrubber at gibson  and other investments in utility plant 
both the clean coal project and the scrubber at gibson were previously approved by the iurc 
the request also reflects a return on common equity of  before the basis points additional common equity return allowed as a merger savings sharing mechanism in the february order discussed further herein  with an overall rate of return on net original cost rate base 
the ucc filed testimony with the iurc recommending a million annually retail rate increase 
the primary differences between psi s request and the ucc s proposal are the requested return on common equity and dsm costs 
the ucc recommended the requested increase in dsm costs be excluded from this proceeding and addressed in a separate currently pending proceeding specifically established to review psi s current and proposed dsm programs 
an order in the rate proceeding is anticipated by the end of the second quarter of cinergy cannot predict what action the iurc may take with respect to this proposed rate increase 
see the capital resources section herein and notes a and in item financial statements and supplementary data 
february order retail rate proceeding and merger savings allocation plan the iurc s february order approved a settlement agreement between psi and certain intervenors which authorized psi to increase retail rates million on an annual basis 
the million increase is before reductions for customer credits for non fuel merger savings and excludes increases for carrying costs attributable to certain environmental expenditures not included in psi s base retail electric rates  both of which are further discussed herein 
the increase included  among other things  recovery of the costs of postretirement benefits other than pensions on an accrual basis  recovery of dsm expenditures  and recovery of a portion of amounts deferred for post in service carrying costs and depreciation expense 
the february order also reflects the adoption of lower depreciation rates  which reduced annual depreciation expense by approximately million 
this rate increase reflected an return on common equity with an overall rate of return on net original cost rate base 
additionally  through december   the february order provides a mechanism to allocate psi s share of net non fuel merger savings between psi s customers and cinergy s shareholders 
in essence  the mechanism guarantees psi s customers of psi s portion of projected net non fuel merger savings 
psi s customers are receiving these merger savings via credits to base rates of million in and an additional million and million in and  respectively 
the credits in and will be applied to the retail rates established in psi s previously discussed current retail rate proceeding 
after  the accumulated credits will continue until the effective date of an order in a psi retail rate proceeding 
the non fuel merger savings sharing mechanism provides psi with a financial incentive to achieve  or exceed  merger savings projections and enhance operating efficiencies by allowing psi to earn up to a return on common equity until the effective date of an iurc order in psi s current retail rate proceeding 
upon the effective date of an order relating to the current retail rate proceeding  the february order provides psi an opportunity to earn an additional basis points above the common equity rate of return to be granted by the iurc in such order until december  to be eligible for the additional earnings  psi must meet certain performance related standards 
psi currently meets these standards which are measured in conjunction with quarterly fuel adjustment clause filings 
this arrangement for sharing of non fuel merger savings allows psi to recover merger costs over a year period 
see note i of the notes to financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data 
any mechanism for sharing of merger savings after december   will be determined in subsequent regulatory proceedings 
effective with this order  psi began recovering carrying costs on certain environmental related projects while under construction and prior to the date of an order reflecting such projects in rates 
through this mechanism  revenues were increased by million  million  and million on an annual basis in february  march  and january  respectively 
finally  the february order included certain additional ratemaking and accounting mechanisms to address regulatory lag see notes h and a of the notes to financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data 
cinergy and cg e ohio cg e s current gas rate proceeding in january  cg e filed a request with the puco supporting a gas rate increase of million annually 
the increase  anticipated to be effective in november  is being requested  in part  to recover capital investments made since cg e s last gas rate increase in the proposed rate design includes a pilot program that would allow  to  residential customers to choose their natural gas supplier with cg e providing transportation services to the customers premises 
settlement discussions with gas customer representatives  which began in july  are ongoing 
cinergy cannot predict the outcome of the settlement discussions nor what actions the puco may take with respect to the proposed rate increase 
see the capital resources section herein 
other during the through period  cg e received a number of rate increases 
the primary reasons for the electric rate increases were recovery of cg e s investments in zimmer and woodsdale units 
the gas rate increase reflected investments in new and replacement gas mains and facilities 
in the august order  the puco authorized annual increases of approximately million in electric revenues and million in gas revenues 
in april  the puco issued an order approving a settlement agreement among cg e  the puco staff  the ohio office of consumers counsel  and other intervenors which resolved outstanding issues related to the merger and the may order which established a rate phase in plan for zimmer 
as a result of this order  the rate phase in plan  which granted annual increases in electric revenues of million  million  and million in may   and  respectively  remained unchanged 
additionally  as part of this settlement  cg e agreed to a moratorium on increases in base electric rates until january  except under certain circumstances  and  in return  is allowed to retain all puco electric jurisdictional non fuel merger savings until consistent with the provisions of the settlement agreement  cg e expensed merger costs of million in and million in applicable to its puco electric jurisdiction 
cg e and its utility subsidiaries are deferring the non puco electric jurisdictional portion of merger costs for future recovery in customer rates  including million in cg e s current gas rate proceeding 
cinergy  cg e  and ulh p kentucky in mid  the kpsc issued orders authorizing ulh p to increase annual gas revenues by million 
in exchange for the kpsc s support of the merger  in may  ulh p accepted the kpsc s request for an electric rate moratorium commencing after ulh p s next retail rate case and extending to january  in  ulh p deferred million of merger costs 
ulh p intends to continue deferring its portion of merger costs for future recovery in customers rates 
cinergy  cg e  and ulh p potential divestiture of gas operations under the puhca  the divestiture of cg e s gas operations may be required 
in its order approving the merger  the sec reserved judgment over cinergy s ownership of the gas operations for a period of three years 
however  as previously discussed in the competitive pressures section  in june  the sec endorsed recommendations for reform repeal of the puhca  including allowing registered holding companies to own combination electric and gas utility companies  provided the affected states agree 
in addition  legislation providing for the repeal of the puhca is currently pending before congress 
regardless of the outcome of the proposals to reform repeal the puhca  cinergy believes it has a justifiable basis for retention of its gas operations and will continue its pursuit of sec approval 
if divestiture is ultimately required  the sec has historically allowed companies sufficient time to accomplish divestitures in a manner that protects shareholder value 
environmental issues cinergy  cg e  and psi caaa the revisions to the clean air act require reductions in both sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from utility sources 
reductions of these emissions are to be accomplished in two phases 
compliance under phase i was required by january   and phase ii compliance is required by january  to achieve the sulfur dioxide reduction objectives of the caaa  emission allowances have been allocated by the epa to affected sources eg  cinergy s electric generating units 
each allowance permits one ton of sulfur dioxide emissions 
the caaa allows compliance to be achieved on a national level  which provides companies the option to achieve this compliance by reducing emissions and or purchasing emission allowances 
cinergy s operating strategy for phase i is based upon the compliance plans developed by psi and cg e and approved by the iurc and the puco 
all required modifications to cinergy s generating units to implement the compliance plans were completed prior to january  to comply with phase ii sulfur dioxide emission requirements  cinergy s current strategy includes a combination of switching to lower sulfur coal blends and utilizing its emission allowance banking strategy 
this cost effective strategy will allow cinergy to meet phase ii sulfur dioxide reduction requirements while maintaining optimal flexibility to meet changes in output due to increased customer choice as well as potentially significant future environmental demands 
cinergy intends to utilize an emission allowance banking strategy to the extent a viable emission allowance market exists 
however  the availability and economic value of emission allowances over the long term is still uncertain 
in the event the market price for emission allowances or lower sulfur coal increases substantially from the current forecast  cinergy could be forced to consider high cost  capital options 
to meet nitrogen oxide reductions required by phase ii  cinergy may install additional low nitrogen oxide burners on certain affected units in addition to the use of a nitrogen oxide emission averaging strategy 
cinergy is forecasting caaa compliance capital expenditures of million during the through period 
of the forecasted expenditures  million relates to cg e and million relates to psi 
these construction expenditures are included in the amounts provided in the capital requirements section herein 
in addition  operating costs may increase due to higher fuel costs eg  higher quality  lower sulfur coal  increased use of natural gas and maintenance expenses 
global climate change some scientists  environmentalists  and policymakers continue to express concern about the potential for climate change from increasing amounts of greenhouse gases released as by products of burning fossil fuel and other industrial processes 
however  significant uncertainty exists concerning increased greenhouse gas concentrations and their effect on the global climate system 
cinergy s plan for managing the potential risk and uncertainty of climate change includes implementing cost effective greenhouse gas emission reduction and offsetting activities  encouraging the use of alternative fuels for transportation vehicles a major source of greenhouse gases  funding research of more efficient and alternative electric generating technologies  funding research to better understand the causes and consequences of climate change  and encouraging a global discussion of the issues and how best to manage them 
cinergy believes that voluntary programs  such as the united states department of energy climate challenge program which cinergy joined in  can successfully limit greenhouse gas emissions 
air toxics the air toxics provisions of the caaa exempt fossil fueled steam utility plants from mandatory reduction of listed air toxics until the epa completes a study  expected in early  of the risk of these emissions on public health 
if additional air toxics regulations are issued  the cost of compliance could be significant 
cinergy cannot predict the outcome or the effects of this epa study 
cinergy  cg e  psi  and ulh p other as more fully discussed in note b ii of the notes to financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data  psi has received notification from igc and nipsco alleging psi is a prp under the cercla with respect to certain mgp sites 
psi has not assumed any responsibility to reimburse igc or nipsco for their costs of investigating and remediating mgp sites  with the exception of a site at shelbyville  for which the costs are not material 
it is premature  at this time  to predict the nature  extent  and ultimate costs of  or psi s responsibility for  environmental investigations and remediations at mgp sites owned or previously owned by psi 
information available to psi regarding the current status of investigation and or remediation at the sites identified in igc s claim indicates psi s potential exposure to probable and reasonably estimable liabilities associated with these mgp sites would not be material to its financial condition or results of operations 
however  further investigation and remediation activities at these sites and the additional sites identified in nipsco s claim may indicate that the potential liability for mgp sites could be material 
during  the iurc denied igc s request for recovery of costs incurred relating to its mgp sites  which included sites acquired from psi 
igc has appealed this decision 
the iurc has granted psi s motion to establish a sub docket to psi s pending retail rate proceeding to consider its request for rate recovery of any mgp site related costs it may incur 
psi is unable to predict the extent to which it will be able to recover through rates any mgp costs ultimately incurred

capital requirements construction cinergy  cg e  psi  and ulh p construction expenditures for the cinergy system are forecasted to be approximately million for  and over the next five years through  are forecasted to be approximately billion

these expenditures include approximately billion  about half of which relates to each cg e and psi  for production plant additions  of which million million for cg e and million for psi relate to investments in new generation 
as previously discussed in the competitive pressures section  potential deregulation of the generation segment of the electric utility industry creates numerous uncertainties eg  customer self and cogeneration efforts  alternative supply side options  and eventual retail wheeling which could affect cinergy s generation resource plan 
cinergy plans to continue to evaluate future generation investments to maintain maximum flexibility in its ability to react to change as it occurs in the industry 
all forecasted amounts are in nominal dollars and reflect assumptions as to the economy  capital markets  construction programs  legislative and regulatory actions  frequency and timing of rate increases  and other related factors which may change significantly 
other commitments cinergy  cg e  psi  and ulh p dsm the level of cinergy s future expenditures on dsm programs within its regulated franchise is contingent on the extent to which recovery of its dsm costs is assured by the applicable state utility regulatory commissions 
psi currently has a proceeding pending before the iurc to address its ongoing dsm programs

additionally  cg e redeemed on february   the remaining million principal amount of these bonds at a price of through the m r fund provision of its first mortgage bond indenture 
ulh p also redeemed on the same date million principal amount of its first mortgage bonds due november  at a price of and the remaining million principal amount of such bonds at a price of through its m r fund provision

this forecast reflects nominal dollars and assumptions as to the economy  capital markets  construction programs  legislative and regulatory actions  frequency and timing of rate increases  and other related factors which may change significantly 
internal funds cinergy  cg e  psi  and ulh p general currently  substantially all of cinergy s revenues and corresponding cash flows are derived from the cost of service regulated operations of cg e and its subsidiaries  including ulh p  and psi 
as previously discussed in the competitive pressures section  cinergy believes the generation segment of the electric utility industry will ultimately be deregulated 
however  the timing and nature of the restructuring is uncertain 
in the interim  revenues provided by cost of service regulated operations are anticipated to continue as the primary source of funds for cinergy 
as a result of its low cost position and market strategy  over the long term  cinergy believes it will be successful in a more competitive environment 
however  as the industry becomes more competitive  future cash flows from cinergy s operations could be subject to a higher degree of volatility than under the present regulatory structure

pursuant to the february order  dsm expenditures in excess of this million base level are being deferred for future recovery in rates 
if dsm expenditures in any calendar year are less than the million in base rates  the unamortized balance of deferred dsm expenditures will be reduced by such difference 
in its current retail rate proceeding  psi has requested similar treatment of dsm costs  including an increase in the ongoing annual expense level from million to million 
the august order authorized cg e to recover annually approximately million of costs associated with dsm programs for residential customers 
in  the puco authorized the deferral  with carrying costs  of the expenditures associated with a number of approved dsm programs to the extent such expenditures are in excess of the million already being recovered
