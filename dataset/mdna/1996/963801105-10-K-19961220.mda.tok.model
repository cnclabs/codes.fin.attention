item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations fiscal   and net sales were   and  respectively 
the decrease in net sales from to was the result of a decrease in sales in the electromechanical segment 
this decrease occurred in the mechanical ordnance and rapid heat transfer sterilizer rht product line  partially offset by increased mechanical product sales 
the ordnance and rht product lines were sold in the fourth quarter  which caused the sales to be somewhat lower 
interface sales were lower because of the increased competition in the marketplace 
sales in the microelectronic segment increased 
as a result of the microelectronic segment shift to standard military products  flash and sram product lines  sales increased significantly while eeprom sales were down dramatically because of the completion of the abrams tank orders 
the decrease in net sales from to was the result of a decrease in sales in the electromechanical segment 
the decrease in sales in the electromechanical segment was primarily in the mechanical and interface product lines  partially offset by increased sales in the ordnance and rht product lines 
the increased sales in ordnance products were positively impacted by a  claim settlement recognized in the second quarter of fiscal sales during fiscal in the microelectronic segment were approximately equivalent to those in the prior year 
this segment experienced a decrease in custom military products which was offset by an increase in the standard military memory product line 
the company continues to believe that changes in defense spending will not have a material adverse affect on the company s overall results 
however  it appears that although the company s microelectronic segment of the company s business could experience growth as a result of changes in defense spending  the company s electromechanical segment has been negatively impacted 
accordingly  the company continues to pursue its goal of reduced dependency on the defense industry  by pursuing commercial business while emphasizing niche military markets  where it has a competitive advantage 
gross margin  as a percentage of sales  increased during fiscal to 
gross margins in the microelectronic segment were approximately million or due to improved margins in the custom product lines 
gross margins in the electromechanical segment were approximately million or 
while the gross margin dollars in the electromechanical segment were down due to lower sales volume  the gross margin percentage increased 
the main reason for this increase was the improved margins in the interface and rht products lines 
gross margins  as a percent of sales were in gross margins in the microelectronic segment were approximately million or as compared to in fiscal the increase was due to improved margins in the standard military memory product line 
the gross margins in the electromechanical segment were approximately million or where margin percentages were down in each product line 
the gross margin for this segment was positively impacted by due to the recognition of the above noted ordnance claim settlement 
gross margins  as a percent of sales  were in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were below the main reason for the decline was the  in writeoffs that were incurred in related to prepaid royalty payments on the cox sterile products acquisition and post employment benefits for a former executive of the company 
the remainder of the decline was attributed to cost cutting in the electromechanical segment 
this decline was partially offset by higher costs at the microelectronic division related to increased volume and legal expenses associated with the investigation by the us attorney s office  as discussed in item selling  general and administrative expenses were above because of the writeoffs in which were previously discussed and increased commissions  bonuses and advertising in the microelectronics segment 
product development expense in fiscal decreased by  or from the main reason for the decline was the increased spending in on the rht product line that was not repeated in this also explains the higher costs as compared to interest expense in fiscal declined as a result of both lower rates and decreased borrowings as compared to interest expense in fiscal was approximately the same as fiscal due to decreased borrowings which offset the effect of higher interest rates 
other income in fiscal consists primarily of the net proceeds from the company s leased facility in acton  ma 
this lease expires in february  and the company has listed the property for sale 
see footnote to the financial statements the increase in other income in as compared to was caused by a writeoff of  in related to the goodwill associated with the cox sterile products acquisition 
this writeoff was also responsible for the decline in other income in as compared to during the third quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a million tax credit resulting from the elimination of the valuation allowance  as prescribed by the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no

the company s current ratio at fiscal year end is approximately to its total debt to equity ratio improved to approximately to the company s capital expenditure plans are principally to expand manufacturing capacity in the microelectronic segment and to improve the efficiency of the manufacturing processes  and are expected to be financed largely through leasing arrangements and  to a lesser extent  through funds provided from operations 
management believes that cash generated by operations  in addition to the company s borrowing capability  should be sufficient to fund the company s cash needs for the foreseeable future 
the company is actively seeking a buyer for its land and building in acton  ma  and anticipates that proceeds from a sale would be in excess of the obligations thereon 
in fiscal and  the company generated  and  respectively of cash from operating activities 
management anticipates that operations will continue to generate cash in the foreseeable future
