the miami tribe has challenged this opinion in federal court to prove and protect the sovereignty of the miami tribe and other indian tribes relating to their lands

is not indian land pursuant to igra is affirmed 
however  the court noted in its ruling that nothing precludes the tribe from resubmitting its management agreement to the nigc along with evidence of the current owners consent and the newly adopted tribal amendment 
on february   the bia approved the miami tribe s constitution and the membership of the heirs 
currently  the tribe is in the process of resubmitting the management agreement
