this increase is primarily fully attributable to the increase in revenues from sales of products and services for these revenues totaled  an increase of compared to  for the prior year 
laboratory service revenues for the year ended december  were  an increase compared to  for the prior year 
this increase was due primarily to the efforts of a full sales and marketing force for the laboratory services of pdla 
during the year ended december   the company realized sales of  from laboratory services that were transferred to american medical laboratories  inc aml in january and  as such  are not included in the sales for the year ended december  accordingly  the increase in laboratory service revenue excluding those sales transferred to aml was actually  product sales include the sales generated from substance abuse testing products  which incorporates the ez screen and verdict on site tests and other ancillary products for the detection of abused substances 
sales from these products were  down compared to  for the prior year 
the company believes this decrease was primarily due to increased competition 
this competition was caused by the introduction of several products by competitors which compete with the products of the company 
the decrease was also affected by the lack of a complete product line of the verdict products

as a result of this restructuring plan  the company has taken a charge of  to cover certain costs of the restructuring 
the company had no such charge in see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained herein 
with the subsequent consolidation of the laboratory operations  the company has written off the remaining amount of goodwill that was recorded from the acquisition of pdla in this resulted in a charge of  for the year ended december  the company had no such charge for the year ended december  as a result of the above  the net loss for the year ended december  was  compared to the net loss of  for the year ended december  management believes the acquisition of medtox and the restructuring of the laboratory operations will significantly improve the operating results of the company although there can be no assurance of the success of the consolidation of the laboratory operations in reducing costs and improving efficiencies

the gross margin from overall sales for the year ended december  was  compared to of sales for the year ended december  excluding the effect of the pdla acquisition for the year ended december   the gross margin would have been 
this increase in gross margin excluding the effect of the pdla acquisition is overshadowed by the impact of the laboratory services provided through pdla

excluding the bioman receivables  accounts receivables for the year ended december  increased over the prior year 
the allowance for doubtful accounts at december  was  a decrease of compared to  for the prior year end
