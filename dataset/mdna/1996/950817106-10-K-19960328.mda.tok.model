item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition the financial condition of wesco financial corporation wesco continues to be very sound 
its net worth is greater than ever due mainly to continued appreciation of marketable securities as well as continued successful operations 
its liquidity in terms of cash equivalents is adequate for all operating and other current needs 
other resources are available such as liquidation of marketable securities and borrowings from banks and others 
wesco adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  effective at yearend 
as a result  all marketable equity securities began to be carried in the consolidated financial statements at market value 
previously only those owned by wesco s wesco financial insurance company wes fic subsidiary could be written up to market 
those owned by wesco and its other subsidiaries were required to be carried at the lower of aggregate cost or market  because for many years aggregate cost had been below aggregate market  they had invariably been carried at cost 
securities with fixed maturities  on the other hand  continued to be carried at amortized cost at yearend as mandated by sfas no 
 because such investments were deemed to be held to maturity 
however  in  wesco s management reclassified its fixed maturity investments to available for sale  under sfas no 
fixed maturity investments so classified had to be carried at quoted market value or  in the absence of such a quotation  at estimated fair value  and thus their reporting was conformed to that of marketable equity securities  without material effect in relation to wesco s reported net worth 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information as to the investments owned by wesco and its subsidiaries 
following is a calculation of the pro forma shareholders equity net worth figures that would have been reported beginning with yearend if sfas no 
had been available for adoption by wesco in instead of and if wesco had viewed its fixed maturity securities as available for sale commencing with amounts are in millions 
december  shareholders equity before any unrealized gains net unrealized gains included in shareholders equity shareholders equity as actually reported net unrealized gains not included above pro forma shareholders equity proportion of appreciation to pro forma equity as can be seen above  the proportion of total unrealized appreciation to pro forma equity increased steadily through yearend and jumped in because unrealized appreciation is recorded using quoted market values  which are subject to fluctuation  ultimate realization could be less than or exceed the amount included in shareholders equity by a wide margin 
borrowings from banks and others have been available to wesco and its subsidiaries under attractive terms for a number of years 
in recognition of the sound financial condition of wesco and of its wes fic insurance subsidiary  standard poor s corporation has assigned its highest credit rating of aaa to wesco s million of notes due november and to wes fic s claims paying ability 
wesco s mutual savings and loan association mutual savings subsidiary  prior to sale of most of its real estate loans in october  did not suffer the crippling loan losses reported by much of the savings and loan industry in the early s 
mutual savings did  however  experience some loan losses and progressive deterioration of collateral value due mainly to recessionary economic conditions and decreasing real estate values in southern california 
recessionary conditions  though less severe than previously  are continuing to affect the marketing of foreclosed real estate owned by wesco s ms property company ms property subsidiary 
mutual savings  in connection with its sale of million of real estate loans late in  indemnified the buyer  cenfed bank  a federal savings bank cenfed  against any losses that might ultimately be sustained to the extent of at least of each loss 
management of wesco does not believe that the indemnification will have a significant effect on wesco s financial condition  principally because the loans are first mortgage real estate loans mainly on owner occupied  single family residences  mutual savings seriously delinquent loans were not sold to cenfed but rather transferred to ms property  no losses have been incurred on the loans sold to cenfed to date  management of cenfed reported as of yearend that  with the exception of one loan brought current shortly after yearend  there were no serious delinquencies as of that date  and another problem loan  which was repurchased from cenfed by ms property in  has been foreclosed on  and the property sold at approximately net book value 
ms property is in process of selling off several foreclosed real estate properties 
the most significant of these is a acre parcel of largely oceanfront land in montecito  near santa barbara  california  which mutual savings and more recently ms property have been developing on an upscale basis and marketing over a period of several years 
approximately half of the townhomes and lots have been sold to date  including several in after deducting writedowns to estimated net realizable value of million  the carrying value of the remaining property at yearend was approximately million 
the market for homes and residential lots of the type comprising ms property s montecito development appears to be improving after several years of weakness 
other foreclosed properties and real estate loans were carried on the books at yearend at approximately million  net of reserves 
wesco is not now suffering from inflation  but its insurance and industrial segments have potential exposure 
very large unanticipated changes in the rate of inflation could adversely impact the insurance business  because premium rates are established well in advance of incurrence of the related costs  also  wesco s shareholders equity contains substantial unrealized appreciation relating to wes fic s investment in freddie mac stock  which is considered interest sensitive 
precision steel s steel service businesses are competitive and operate on tight gross profit margins  and thus its earnings are susceptible to bad effects from inflationary cost increases 
results of operations wesco  which had started essentially as a savings and loan holding company  began to diversify its operations in the s mainly in response to perceived uncertainties and turmoil in the savings and loan industry 
mutual savings activities declined both in size and in relative importance to wesco s consolidated operations until  finally  its savings deposits and most loans were disposed of in late  and it merged into wesco s insurance subsidiary effective january  as the portfolio of investment securities has grown  mostly inside the savings and loan and insurance subsidiaries  dividend and interest income and realized and unrealized gains on securities have increased in importance to wesco 
steel service operations were added in  property and casualty insurance operations were added in  and electrical equipment manufacturing operations sold in mid were added at yearend 
see item  business  for further discussion of wesco s operations 
the following summary sets forth the contribution to consolidated net income of each of wesco s business segments insurance  industrial and  through yearend  financial and of wesco s nonsegment activities

amounts for have been reclassified to facilitate comparison  in item presentations in form k annual reports for years prior to these amounts were included in the financial segment  because they were more closely associated with activities of the then used financial segment than the other two segments 
in the following sections the normal net operating income data set forth in the foregoing summary on an after tax basis are broken down and discussed 
attention is directed to note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information as to operating profit before taxes 
insurance segment wesco entered into the property and casualty insurance business in through wes fic  a newly formed subsidiary 
substantially all of its insurance business to date has been derived through relatively short lived quota share and excess of loss reinsurance arrangements with national indemnity company nico and cypress insurance company cypress  wholly owned subsidiaries of berkshire  wesco s ultimate parent 
under the arrangements  wes fic has been ceded portions of the property and casualty reinsurance business of nico and has reinsured workers compensation business written by cypress 
quota share reinsurance provides indemnification to ceding companies of specified portions of the ceding companies own losses 
excess of loss reinsurance provides indemnification to ceding companies for all or part of covered losses in excess of specified retentions or deductibles 
wes fic s arrangements with nico to date have comprised principally reinsurance of nico s quota share reinsurance contract under which wes fic reinsured of the property and casualty insurance business of the fireman s fund insurance companies fireman s fund during a four year coverage period that expired on august   reinsurance of another quota share contract under which wes fic reinsured of certain personal lines reinsurance business that nico had assumed in an arrangement that accounted for substantially all of wes fic s earned premiums in and  and which terminated in mid when the original source of the reinsurance stopped making cessions to nico  and reinsurance of to of several catastrophic excess of loss super cat reinsurance contracts beginning in wes fic has also written small amounts of direct insurance business 
wes fic s entry into the business of super cat reinsurance followed a large increase in its net worth  from million as of december  to million as of january   when it absorbed mutual savings and loan association mutual savings through merger 
as of december   wes fic s net worth had grown to million due principally to continued appreciation of its investments in marketable securities 
see item  business  for further information on wes fic  nico  cypress  berkshire  fireman s fund and mutual savings 
the normal net operating income of wes fic ie  income before securities gains  losses and writedowns  and unusual income tax charges represents the combination of its underwriting results with the dividend and interest income from its investment and other activities 
following is a summary of such data in thousands year ended december  premiums written    premiums earned    underwriting gain loss   dividend and interest income    income before income taxes    income tax provision    normal net operating income    premiums written in and consisted almost entirely of super cat premiums retroceded by nico 
the decrease in volume of premiums written in was caused by nico s retrocession to wes fic of fewer contracts in than in  as not all of the contracts in which wes fic participated in were renewed 
management of berkshire has reported that super cat reinsurance pricing has become less attractive due to increased competition  including pressures from other companies that have recently raised capital to enter the business 
insurance premiums are recognized as earned revenues by wes fic pro rata over the term of the contract on all forms of insurance except for super cat reinsurance 
premiums on super cat reinsurance are not recognized as earned until the earlier of a loss occurrence or policy expiration  in order to avoid premature recognition of underwriting profits 
the increase in premiums earned in over the comparable figure for was attributable principally to the recognition of earned premiums on super cat reinsurance discussed above 
a large underwriting gain was reported by wes fic in upon expiration of several one year super cat reinsurance contracts on which there had been no losses 
the underwriting gain reported for resulted mainly from a reduction of liabilities for losses and loss expenses with respect to business written in earlier years 
liabilities for losses and loss expenses are typically based on estimates and thus are subject to estimation error  revisions of such estimates are reflected in underwriting results of the current accounting period 
the adjustment  while not insignificant in terms of its effect on wesco s net income for the year  was not material in relation to the cumulative insurance business previously written by wes fic or in terms of its effect on wesco s net worth 
the relatively small underwriting loss reported for was typical of wes fic s experience before its entry into the super cat reinsurance business  where significant underwriting gains and losses may be expected 
one area of particular concern to the insurance industry is its exposure to claims for environmental contamination 
management of wes fic has reported that it believes wes fic has virtually no such liability 
wes fic s revenues and net income have benefited from its absorption of mutual savings effective january   inasmuch as dividend and interest income previously reported as revenue of wesco s financial segment has been included in wes fic s revenues for each of the last two years 
wes fic s relatively low volume of insurance and reinsurance premiums in recent years has been attributable mainly to management s perception that the opportunity to write more business at sensible rates has not been available  given the generally competitive industry wide conditions 
meanwhile  wes fic has been actively pursuing other insurance and reinsurance opportunities 
wes fic remains liable for runoff of its share of the losses and loss expenses under the insurance arrangements summarized above 
as claims are paid over many future years  the liability approximately million as of december  will decline  as will the funds set aside and invested pending payment of claims float 
dividend and interest income has been earned by wes fic principally on the assets approximately million at market value added by the merger of mutual savings on january   on capital contributed to the insurance business by wesco  on earnings retained and reinvested  and on float 
the income tax provision of wes fic has fluctuated as a percentage of its pre tax income in each of the periods presented in the foregoing table 
these fluctuations have been caused by fluctuations in the relationship of substantially tax exempt components of income to total pre tax income 
insurance losses and loss expenses  and the related liabilities reflected on wesco s consolidated balance sheet  because they are based in large part upon estimates  are subject to estimation error 
revisions of such estimates in future periods could significantly affect the results of operations reported for future periods 
however  wes fic has maintained a capital position strong enough not only to absorb adverse estimation corrections but also to enable it to accept other insurance contracts 
although additional reinsurance retrocessions from berkshire subsidiaries  or other attractive reinsurance or insurance arrangements  would be welcome  the timing and extent of any increase in wes fic s insurance underwriting activity cannot presently be predicted 
industrial segment following is a summary of the normal net operating results of the industrial segment  whose operations have included the businesses of precision steel warehouse  inc and its subsidiaries precision steel and new america electrical corporation new america electric  until the latter sold its electrical equipment manufacturing operations effective july  and liquidated shortly thereafter in thousands year ended december  revenues  principally sales and services    income before income taxes    income tax provision    minority interest normal net operating income    revenues of precision steel s businesses increased moderately in each of the past three years in spite of unstable economic conditions in the industrial sector of the economy 
revenues for included electrical equipment manufacturing revenues of million 
income before income taxes and normal net operating income of the industrial segment was negatively affected in as a result of the inclusion of the operating results of new america electric 
had it not been for wesco s equity of  in new america electric s after tax operating losses in  the industrial segment would have reported normal net operating income of  for the subsequent improvement in these earnings figures was attributable mainly to the following increases in sales  reductions in operating expenses  and  in  a reduction in cost of products sold as a percentage of steel service revenues 
this percentage was   and for  and the cost percentage typically fluctuates slightly from year to year as a result of changes in product mix  price competition among suppliers and at the retail level  and availability of favorable quantity order prices on materials purchased 
financial segment through  wesco had a financial segment  which included revenues and expenses of mutual savings as well as revenues and expenses of other activities more closely associated with the savings and loan business than any of wesco s other businesses  namely  investment activity other than wes fic s  and parent company operations 
in october  mutual savings discontinued as a regulated savings and loan association  and  effective january   it merged into wes fic see item  business  for further information 
as a result  several of mutual savings traditional items of revenue and expense notably interest income on loans  interest expense on savings accounts and operating expenses wholly or partially disappeared  with the remaining items such as income from indirect mortgage lending transferred to the insurance segment  and revenues and expenses of other wesco entities that had previously been included in the financial segment were removed from that segment and are no longer identified with any specific business segment see next section 
mutual savings normal net operating income from january until it discontinued savings and loan activities in october totaled  this resulted from revenues of  less costs and expenses of  plus an income tax benefit of  other than identified business segments set forth below is a summary of normal net operating income for items not identified with any business segment insurance  industrial  or prior to financial amounts are in thousands year ended december  dividend and interest income other than wes fic s and mutual savings    rental income  net  from commercial real estate    interest expense    general and administrative expenses    provision for losses on loans and foreclosed real estate   other items  net income loss before income tax provision or benefit   income tax provision benefit   normal net operating income   as explained more fully in the fourth and fifth paragraphs of item  business  effective with the beginning of  the financial segment was discontinued  and certain relatively insignificant activities previously included in that segment are no longer identified with any specific business segment 
these activities include investment activity other than wes fic s  management of owned commercial real estate  development and liquidation of foreclosed real estate and delinquent loans formerly owned by mutual savings  and parent company activities 
the and figures shown in the foregoing table reflect the new classification 
in addition  to facilitate comparison  extraneous amounts that were included in financial segment operating figures for because they were more closely related to that segment than the other two business segments have been removed from financial segment figures and included in those shown in the foregoing table 
these include amounts relating to investment activity other than wes fic s and mutual savings  management of owned commercial real estate  other operations of the parent company and  after activation late in  ms property  and corresponding income taxes 
in reclassifying figures for  however  revenues and expenses that were integral to mutual savings operation have not been removed from financial segment operating figures and included in those shown in the foregoing table 
as a result  general and administrative expenses and other items applicable to development and liquidation of foreclosed real estate and delinquent loans are included in the and figures in the foregoing table but not those of also  the provisions for losses on loans and real estate of million and million in and have no counterpart in the foregoing table  a pre tax loss provision of million for is included in the operating results of the financial segment 
rental income is shown net of related direct expenses and relates principally to the operation of ms property s commercial office building in downtown pasadena 
net rental income declined in each of the last two years  due in mainly to i a slight increase in vacancies  ii increases in operating expenses  primarily inflationary  and iii higher depreciation expense resulting from retrofitting the building beyond current earthquake code requirements and refurbishing the building s lobby and patios 
the decline in net rental income for resulted mainly from the change in major tenant towards the end of calendar mutual savings large headquarters operation was replaced by a smaller cenfed branch operation 
nonsegment interest expense was much higher in and than in  principally as a result of borrowings from wes fic made late in to facilitate the transfer of loans and foreclosed properties from mutual savings to ms property  insurance segment income benefited accordingly 
the income tax provision or benefit on wesco s nonsegment activities has fluctuated as a percentage of the pre tax income or loss from such activities 
these fluctuations have been caused mainly by fluctuations in the relationship of substantially tax exempt dividend income to total pre tax income or loss from such activities 
management s long term goal is to maximize gain in wesco s intrinsic business value per share  with little regard to earnings recorded in any given year 
there is no particular strategy as to the timing of sales of investments or the realization of securities gains 
securities may be sold for a variety of reasons  including the belief that prospects for future appreciation of a particular investment are less attractive than the prospects for reinvestment of the after tax proceeds from its sale  or the desire for funds for an acquisition or repayment of debt 
realized gains and losses on investments have been an element of wesco s net income for a number of years 
the amounts of these gains or losses  recorded when securities are sold or when a decline in market value of an investment is considered to be other than temporary  tend to fluctuate significantly from period to period 
the varying effect upon wesco s pre tax income is evident on the face of the consolidated statement of income 
the amount of realized gain or loss has no predictive value  and variations in amount from period to period have no practical analytical value  particularly in view of the existence of substantial net unrealized price appreciation in wesco s consolidated investment portfolio 
wesco s shareholders equity at december  contained  or per share  of unrealized appreciation of investments  net of taxes about of shareholders equity  compared to at december  in wesco and its subsidiaries realized securities gains of million  after income taxes  including an after tax gain of million realized on conversion to common stock and sale of their investment in convertible preferred stock of champion international corporation 
in wesco realized net after tax gains on sales of securities of million  it also wrote down the carrying value of an investment convertible preferred stock of usair group  inc believed to have declined in market value other than temporarily by million after income tax effect 
see note to wesco s consolidated financial statements for further information as to wesco s investments 
realized securities gains amounted to million  after taxes  in as explained in the second paragraph of this item  unrealized appreciation of all wesco s investment securities not just the marketable equity securities owned by its wes fic insurance subsidiary has  since yearend  been included in the consolidated balance sheet net of deemed applicable income taxes 
the financial accounting standards board required in sfas no 
that the net writeup be credited directly to shareholders equity without figuring in any way in the determination of net income  the same  sensible procedure that had been followed for insurance entities 
however  in another pronouncement sfas no 
which required  among other things  adjusting deferred income tax liabilities to reflect tax rate changes the fasb directed that all rate change adjustments not bypass net income  thus  wesco s net income was penalized by million due to an increase in the federal rate from to on wes fic s unrealized appreciation  notwithstanding the fact that the appreciation had never benefited net income 
wesco s consolidated revenues include significant amounts of substantially tax exempt dividend income from preferred and common stocks as well as fully tax exempt interest on state and municipal bonds 
fluctuations in the proportion of these components to total consolidated pre tax income plus a special tax provision of million in to give effect to the tax rate increase applicable to deferred tax items including the million discussed in the preceding paragraph have resulted in tax provisions as percentages of pre tax income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of  and in  and see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information on income taxes 
consolidated revenues  expenses and earnings set forth in item  selected financial data  and in wesco s consolidated statement of income  are not necessarily indicative of future revenues  expenses and earnings  in that they are subject to significant variations in amount and timing of securities gains and losses and the possible occurrence of other unusual items 
in addition  the merger of mutual savings into wes fic at the beginning of increased wes fic s insurance and reinsurance capacity and asset deployment options  enabling it to enter into the business of super cat reinsurance in it is hoped that the restructuring of wesco s consolidated operations will result in further benefits in the future
