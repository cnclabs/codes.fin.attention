liquidity and capital resources the following discussion relates to consolidated financial data with respect to the company giving effect to the combination 
the company s internal sources of liquidity are cash balances and cash flow from operations 
external sources include the planned debt offering  the unutilized portion of the revolving credit facility and equipment financing and trade credit 
the company maintains a million revolving credit facility the credit facility with a commercial bank the bank which currently provides for borrowings of up to of a majority of the company s domestic and foreign receivables excluding the receivables of ves at an interest rate of over the prime rate and is secured by most of the company s world wide assets excluding the assets of ves 
in connection with such facility  the company is limited  without the consent of the lender  in taking certain actions  including creating indebtedness in excess of specified amounts  declaring and paying dividends and is required  among other provisions  to maintain certain financial ratios 
the facility matures july the company is preparing for a public offering the offering of million of senior notes due the senior notes 
the offering is expected to generate approximately million of net proceeds and is planned to be completed in late october  however  there can be no assurance that the offering will be completed 
the senior notes are unsecured and will be effectively subordinated to secured debt of the company with respect to the assets securing such debt and to all debt of its subsidiaries whether secured or unsecured 
the indenture relating to the senior notes will contain certain covenants  including covenants which limit the company s ability to incur additional debt  pay dividends and complete mergers  consolidations and sales of assets 
the company expects that approximately million of the net proceeds from the offering will be used to retire outstanding indebtedness of the company including borrowings under the credit facility and borrowings of ves 
the remaining net proceeds will be used to fund a portion of the company s million capital expenditure budget for fiscal it is anticipated that the balance of the capital expenditure budget will be financed from internally generated funds  and  if necessary  from the revolving credit facility or other borrowings permitted by the indenture 
of the million capital expenditure budget  approximately million represents capital spending necessary to maintain the company s operating equipment and the remainder is for discretionary capital spending  including approximately million for the replacement of older operating equipment with a view to substantially enhancing operating efficiency and the remaining million for expansion of its equipment complement to meet increased demand for seismic services 
subject to the completion of the offering  the bank has agreed to amend the credit facility 
the company will be entitled to borrow up to million on a revolving basis  which will mature in july and will be secured by substantially all of the receivables of the company 
the bank will release its existing security interest in assets of digicon other than its receivables and approve the issuance of the senior notes 
pursuant to the amendment  advances under the credit facility will bear interest  at the company s election  at the prime rate or libor plus two percent 
advances under the credit facility will be limited by a borrowing formula which  based on current levels of receivables  results in a borrowing base well in excess of the maximum commitment 
covenants in the amended credit facility will prohibit the payment of dividends and will limit the company s capital expenditures in any fiscal year 
in addition  the amended credit facility will require minimum cash flow coverage and the maintenance of minimum tangible net worth  will limit the ratio of funded debt to total capitalization  and will require the company to maintain a minimum current ratio 
the company requires significant amounts of working capital to support its operations and to fund capital spending and research and development programs 
the company s foreign operations require greater amounts of working capital than similar domestic activities  as the average collection period for foreign receivables is generally longer than for comparable domestic accounts 
in addition  the company has increased its participation in multi client data surveys and has significantly expanded its library of multi client data 
because of the lead time between survey execution and sale  multi client data surveys generally require greater amounts of working capital than contract work 
during the first half of the past two fiscal years  this problem was exacerbated as  for budgeting purposes  several clients deferred payments on multi client data library purchases until january and  respectively  at which time substantially all of such receivables were collected 
depending on the timing of future sales of the data and the collection of the proceeds from such sales  the company s liquidity will continue to be affected  however  the company believes that these non exclusive surveys have good long term sales  earnings and cash flow potential 
the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards nols is subject to certain limitations 
additionally  when such nols are utilized  the benefit will be recognized as an addition to paid in capital and will not be reflected in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company will require substantial cash flow to continue operations on a satisfactory basis  complete its capital expenditure and research and development programs  and assuming the offering is completed as expected meet its principal and interest obligations with respect to the senior notes 
the company anticipates that the net proceeds from the senior notes  cash flow generated from operations and borrowings permitted under the indenture will provide sufficient liquidity to fund these requirements until the senior notes become due 
however  the company s ability to meet its debt service and other obligations depends on its future performance  which  in turn  is subject to general economic conditions  business and other factors beyond the company s control 
if the company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or otherwise to comply with the terms of the credit facility or the senior notes  it may be required to refinance all or a portion of its existing debt or obtain additional financing  although there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such refinancing or additional financing 
the company s ability to effect the offering or any other financings are dependent on its historical results of operations and its current financial condition and prospects at the time it seeks access to capital markets  as well as other factors beyond the company s control  including the condition of the financial and capital markets and the investment community s perception of the company and the seismic industry generally 
there can be no assurances that the offering will be completed  or that the offering or any financing will result in the level of net proceeds described above 
the company believes that it possesses sufficient liquidity to continue operations on a satisfactory basis 
if additional working capital were to become necessary as a result of deterioration in demand for or pricing of the company s services  and if additional financing were not available  the company s operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected
