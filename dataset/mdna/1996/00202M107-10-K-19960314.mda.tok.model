in late  the company initiated pricing actions for specific commodities in specific trade lanes in response to competitive conditions and loss of market share in its us import market 
subsequently  competitors and the company have lowered rates  and considerable rate instability in the us import market continues to exist

the company is currently unable to predict the extent of such consequences 
since  the company and oocl have been parties to agreements enabling them to exchange vessel space and coordinate vessel sailings through these agreements permit both companies to offer faster transit times and more frequent sailings between key markets in asia and the us west coast  and to share terminals and several feeder operations within asia 
in september  the company  mitsui osk lines  ltd 
mol  and oocl signed an agreement to exchange vessel space  coordinate vessel sailings and cooperate in the use of port terminals and equipment for ocean transportation services in the asia us west coast trade through the carriers commenced service under this agreement in january the agreement between the company and oocl is suspended so long as the agreement between the company  oocl and mol is in effect 
the three carriers and nedlloyd lines bv nll are also parties to a separate agreement to exchange vessel space  coordinate vessel sailings and cooperate in the use of port terminals and equipment in an all water service in the asia latin america trade for a minimum of three years 
the four carriers initiated service under this agreement in march additionally  the four carriers and malaysian international shipping corporation bhd have an agreement to exchange vessel space  coordinate vessel sailings and cooperate in the use of port terminals and equipment for ocean transportation services in the asia europe trade through  with early termination rights upon six months notice to the other parties beginning january  the carriers commenced service under the agreement in january the company entered the asia europe trade in march by chartering vessel space through mol 
under the alliance agreements  alliance partners contribute and are allocated vessel space  which may be adjusted from time to time 
the agreements provide for  among other things  settlement of the difference between the value of vessel space provided by each partner and the value of vessel space available to that partner  at specified vessel costs per teu per day 
the value of vessel space provided by the company to the alliances is less than the value of the total capacity allocated to it through the alliances  resulting in an annual net cash payment from the company to its alliance partners 
the amount paid to alliance partners was million in  and is currently estimated to be million in agreements covering terminal and equipment sharing among the alliance partners have not been finalized  and the commitment of the alliance partners  including the company  for these services cannot be determined at this time 
in  the company and tmm entered into an agreement enabling them to reciprocally charter vessel space for a period of three years between major asian ports and certain ports on the pacific coast of the us and mexico 
this agreement was terminated in september  and the company and tmm have entered into a memorandum of understanding with respect to the negotiation of a new three year agreement for reciprocal charters of lesser amounts of vessel space beginning in march or april and a possible joint service

in october  the company and matson navigation company  inc matson signed an agreement for a year alliance  which commenced in february pursuant to the terms of this alliance  the company sold matson six of its ships three c class vessels and three c class vessels and certain of its assets in guam for approximately million in cash 
one of the ships was sold in december and resulted in a gain of million 
the remaining five vessels were sold in january four of these vessels  together with a fifth matson vessel  are being used in the alliance 
the net gain on the sale of the four vessels used in the alliance and the assets in guam  after deducting costs associated with the agreement  is estimated to be million  and will be deferred and amortized over the year term of the alliance 
matson is operating the vessels in the alliance  which serves the us west coast  hawaii  guam  korea and japan  and has the use of substantially all the westbound capacity 
the company has the use of substantially all the vessels eastbound capacity 
the gain on the sale of the fifth vessel was million 
the company is party to an operating differential subsidy ods agreement with the us government  expiring on december   which provides for payment by the us government to partially compensate the company for the relatively greater expense of vessel operation under us registry 
ods payments to the company were approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the company expects ods payments in to be between million and million as a result of its sale of six vessels to matson 
in june  the bush administration announced that no new ods agreements would be entered into and existing ods agreements would be allowed to expire 
the clinton administration and congress have been reviewing us maritime policy 
proposed maritime support legislation introduced in  referred to as the maritime security program  was not enacted 
the administration s proposal included a year subsidy program with up to million in annual payments to be requested and appropriated on a year to year basis 
congress has appropriated million in fiscal  or million per vessel 
this compares with subsidy of approximately million per vessel under ods 
maritime support legislation incorporating the administration s program has recently passed the us house of representatives and is currently awaiting consideration before the us senate  but has not yet been approved 
the company is not able to predict whether or when maritime support legislation will be enacted or what terms such legislation may have  if enacted 
while the company continues to encourage efforts to enact maritime support legislation  prospects for passage of a program acceptable to the company are unclear 
accordingly  in july  the company filed applications with the united states maritime administration marad to operate under foreign flag its six c class containerships  delivered to the company in and january  and to transfer to foreign flag seven additional us flag containerships in its trans pacific fleet 
in  marad issued a waiver to allow the company to operate its six c class vessels under foreign registry on the condition that the vessels be returned to us flag in the event acceptable maritime reform legislation is enacted 
the remaining application is still pending and no assurances can be given as to whether  or when  the authority will be granted 
management of the company believes that  in the absence of ods or an equivalent government support program  it will be generally no longer commercially viable to own or operate containerships in foreign trade under the us flag because of the higher labor costs and the more restrictive design  maintenance and operating standards applicable to us flag liner vessels 
the company continues to evaluate its strategic alternatives in light of the pending expiration of its ods agreement and the uncertainties as to whether an acceptable new us government maritime support program will be enacted  whether sufficient labor efficiencies can be achieved through the collective bargaining process  and whether the company s remaining application to flag its vessels under foreign registry will be approved 
while no assurances can be given  management of the company believes that it will be able to structure its operations to enable it to continue to operate on a competitive basis without direct us government support 
in july  legislation was introduced in the us house of representatives that would substantially modify the shipping act  which  among other things  provides the company with certain immunity from antitrust laws and requires the company and other carriers in us foreign commerce to file tariffs 
the legislation  which was not enacted in  would have been phased in during and and would have eliminated government tariff filing and enforcement  allowed confidential and independent contracts between shippers and ocean carriers and strengthened provisions that prohibit predatory activities by foreign carriers 
the company is unable to predict whether this or other proposed legislation will be introduced in or enacted or  whether  if enacted  it will contain terms similar to those proposed 
enactment of legislation modifying the shipping act  depending upon its terms  could have a material adverse impact on the competitive environment in which the company operates and on the company s results of operations 
the company currently expects challenging conditions for the company and the shipping industry in whether these conditions materialize  and the severity of the challenge the company faces  depends upon developments such as  but not limited to  the timing and extent of industry deregulation  the changes in market growth rates  the amount and timing of the anticipated significant increase in industry capacity  the extent of rate cutting in its markets and successful implementation of the company s alliances

in december  burlington motor holdings  inc  the parent company of bmc  filed a petition seeking protection from its creditors under chapter of the us bankruptcy laws 
the company currently cannot assess the impact of this filing  if any  on its operations  but does not expect the impact to be material 
in  the company expects modest growth in demand in the north america stacktrain market 
demand for automotive shipments is expected to remain strong but is dependent upon conditions in the us and mexican economies and the extent to which us automakers continue to operate in mexico  among other factors

the severity of the challenging conditions expected for the company and the shipping industry generally  and the impact of those conditions on the company s operating results  will depend on factors such as the timing and extent of an anticipated slowing of market growth in certain markets served by the company  the amount and timing of an anticipated significant increase in industry capacity due to new vessel deliveries to competing carriers  rate cutting in some market segments due to this additional capacity and other factors  successful implementation and continuation of the company s alliances  which comprise a significant factor in the company s long term strategy to remain competitive  and the pace and degree of industry deregulation  including whether an acceptable maritime support program and proposed amendments to the shipping act of are enacted 
demand in the trans pacific market is dependent on factors such as the quantity of available import and export cargo in this market and economic conditions in the us and other pacific basin countries 
the magnitude of the impact on the company of any growth or contraction in the trans pacific market will depend on whether and when new vessels ordered by competing carriers are delivered and where they are ultimately deployed and further vessel orders  if any  by competing carriers 
because a number of competing ocean carriers have placed orders for the construction of a significant number of new vessels  growth in capacity in the trans pacific market is expected to be significantly greater than growth in demand 
growth in demand in the north america stacktrain market and demand for automotive shipments will depend on conditions in the us and mexican economies  including the relative values of the us dollar and the mexican peso  and the extent to which us automakers continue to operate in mexico  among other factors
