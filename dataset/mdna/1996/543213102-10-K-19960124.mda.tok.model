item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations vs 
earnings in improved by over the prior year 
however  earnings remained below  while shareholders equity has increased by since this shows a continuing need for improvement 
timber profits increased from  to  in fiscal due primarily to a increase in log footage sold 
prices for logs in fiscal were flat as compared with fiscal demand and prices remain at good levels in both the export and domestic markets 
we have salvaged the bulk of the fire killed trees from the chelan county fire 
because of checking in dry weather  any remaining fire killed crop will be primarily useful for chips 
the company operates its  acres on a sustained yield basis with rotations of years for hardwood and to years for coniferous species 
based on recent purchases and sales  we now estimate the value of the tree farms to be between five and seven times book value 
attempts are continuing to extend environmental overkill to private lands 
this effort increases our operating costs and can reduce the value of our lands 
we presently estimate this adverse effect to be not greater than of realizable value 
operating results for paper and paperboard improved from  to  due to a increase in volume sold and price increases that more than covered cost increases 
the average selling price for paper and paperboard improved and  respectively 
high labor and wood chip costs continue to hold back earnings 
chip costs increased compared with the prior fiscal year  but it appears that the peak has passed and further reductions can be expected 
vigorous efforts to broaden the area tapped and to extend supply by more intensive salvage have reduced the supply demand imbalance 
we continue to expect that regional differences in chip costs will diminish 
the shutdown of our bleach plant in fiscal has turned out to be unfortunate 
price of bleached market pulp has more than doubled  which has caused a reduction in the amount of bleached product we can sell profitably 
we have started making a semi bleached pulp utilizing hydrogen peroxide 
this product can be substituted for full bleached in some grades 
it appears that it may become possible to equip to extend hydrogen peroxide bleaching to brighter grades 
if this can be accomplished  we might be freed from the purchase of market pulp and would have a totally chlorine free product 
old corrugated container prices declined in the last part of the fiscal year 
markets were strong for the first two quarters with slowing in the last half of the year 
mill operation was at about of capacity 
paperboard and packaging paper demand is currently fairly close to industry capacity which should augur well for price stability  however  competitors often fail to realize that when volume declines industry downtime is inevitable 
page converting results improved from  to  due to a increase in volume sold and price increases that more than covered cost increases 
the company has invested very heavily in equipment to meet the needs of its customers 
these costs have necessitated moderate price increases 
we are confident that the improvements in quality  service  continuity and specialized manufacturing ability achieved after equipment improvements have met our customers best interests 
the cogeneration plant came on line in june with a few minor difficulties and delays 
it is now operating well and is making a contribution to cost reduction 
sale of power continues to make a substantial contribution to results 
selling  administrative and general expenses were of sales in fiscal and of sales in fiscal interest expensed increased in fiscal as compared with fiscal due to higher borrowing for capital expenditures and higher interest rates 
the current market for the company s manufactured products is somewhat weak 
while this may be due in part to user s inventory corrections  the question remains how soon the market will recover 
the company will seek to keep prices above costs as this is in the best long term interest of our customers 
log markets are expected to remain strong 
chip costs should respond favorably to lower industry demand 
results of operations vs 
was the sixth consecutive unsatisfactory year 
earnings decreased by and were below when shareholders equity was lower 
timber profits increased from  to  in fiscal the improvement was primarily due to increase in log and lumber footage sold 
prices for logs and lumber held steady with year ago levels  but operating results were adversely affected by fire losses 
demand and prices remain at good levels in both the export and domestic markets 
summer of was a period of devastating forest fires east of the cascades where we have about  acres 
parts of  acres were subject to fire 
we have charged to earnings million which is our best current estimate of the timber lost based on cost of that timber 
market value is  of course  greater  potential profit lost will be reflected in later years 
the company operates its  acres of tree farms on a sustained yield basis with rotations between and years 
based on recent purchases and sales  we now estimate the value of the tree farms to be between five and seven times book value 
these multipliers are lower than the prior year because of large purchases in fiscal at market prices 
while actual purchases reflect current market prices  we are confident that prices we paid have adequate allowance for profit and risk 
lockup of federal and state timber for so called threatened species continues to expand 
the resulting reduced log supply in the marketplace keeps log prices at very good levels 
attempts are continuing to extend environmental overkill to private lands 
this effort increases our operating costs and can page reduce the value of our lands 
we presently estimate this adverse effect to be not greater than 
for the year  sales of paper and paperboard increased while operating results declined from  to 
tonnage sold during the year increased while the average prices for paper declined and the average price for paperboard improved 
increased costs which contributed to the reduced results are discussed below 
markets improved starting late in the second quarter  full operation and improved prices were achieved in the fourth quarter of the year 
weak markets in the early part of the fiscal year resulted in operations for the year at about of capacity 
chip costs were about lower than the prior year but continue to be high 
increased demand for occ old corrugated containers caused its price to increase sharply  however  it is still cheaper than virgin pulp 
our expectation is still  as reported last year  that in time chip cost differences between the pacific northwest and other regions will diminish 
market bleached pulp is now used for all bleached products and part of the bleach plant has been written off 
bleached pulp prices are increasing which necessitates higher prices for bleached products 
the company made a six year labor settlement at the mill with moderate wage increases  but accompanied by substantial retirement improvements 
the cost of the pension improvements reduced reported earnings by approximately  while the settlement is expensive  it is not out of line with regional competitors  but rates are high compared with other regions 
converting results declined from  in fiscal to  in fiscal sales increased due to an increase in tonnage sold and a increase in average price 
operating losses increased due to higher costs of containerboard used to manufacture boxes 
paperboard demand increased so that the industry is now running at capacity 
the paper market improved slightly as swing machines shifted to paperboard 
corrugated box prices improved as containerboard became scarce 
during weak markets some large buyers tend to hold auctions 
longview fibre will do its best to avoid such buyers and to have continuing long term relationships with customers who see the necessity for paying compensatory prices for quality  service  continuity  product design and specialized manufacturing capability 
in the long term  no user of our products can expect to rely on producers who are forced to sell below cost 
sale of power continues to make a substantial reduction in net cost of power used 
the new cogeneration plant is expected to be on line by next summer 
selling  administrative and general expenses were of sales in fiscal and fiscal interest expensed increased in fiscal as compared with fiscal due to higher borrowing for capital expenditures and higher interest rates 
the harsh government climate for manufacturing continues to make production expensive  no improvement is in sight 
the current very strong market for our products will make manufacturing profitable  it will  nevertheless  take considerable time to recover the large amount lost in manufacturing in the page last four years 
the current recovery has gone on for long enough to start speculation as to when it may end 
modest expansion in the paper industry leads one to the hope that the next downmarket will not be as bad as the recent debacle 
it appears probable that the log market will stay fairly strong even in a downturn

the corrugated sheet plant in cedar city  utah is in operation 
capital expenditures for plant and equipment are expected to range between  and  per year 
purchase of timberlands will depend on offerings  price levels and competition 
during fiscal  the company purchased  shares of its stock for an average price of per share 
during fiscal  the company purchased  shares for an average price of per share 
purchases began in  the total number of shares acquired through fiscal is  shares for  at an average cost of per share 
stock purchases increase interest costs and thus reduce corporate earnings 
in most years when earnings are good  they increase earnings per share 
in a bad year  the interest cost can decrease earnings per share slightly 
page dividends of

depending upon the final form of these rules  the company estimates that over the next to years required pollution control capital expenditures could range from million to million 
although future pollution control expenditures cannot be predicted with any certainty because of continuing changes in laws  the company believes that compliance with these requirements will not have a material impact on its capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared based on historical costs and do not portray the effects of inflation 
the impact of inflation is most noticeable for inventories and capital assets  although most of the inflationary effect on inventories is already portrayed in the consolidated income statement by the use of the lifo method of inventory valuation
