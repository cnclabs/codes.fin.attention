specifically  during the third and fourth quarters of  the company experienced both poor purchasing performace and engineering design errors which were the primary origin of the poor financial performance 
in purchasing  component prices were not adequately controlled  leading to increased product cost and reduced gross margin 
additionally  the failure to contain the quantities ordered  based on production demand  led to a significant buildup of component inventory  which both exerted pressure on the company s cash flows and  ultimately  contributed to the increase in the provision for excess and obsolete inventory 
reacting to engineering design errors created manufacturing inefficiencies as product was reworked to correct the problems  which increased product cost and reduced gross margin 
further  these design issues caused delays in meeting production schedules which ultimately resulted in missed or delayed sales opportunities 
net sales cincinnati microwave s net sales for were up over sales of the company s products to oems and resellers rose to of net sales from in  reflecting a planned shift in the business to reduce dependence on direct retail sales 
eight oem and reseller customers accounted for million  or  of the sales through these channels  including lucent technologies formerly at t  which represented of net net sales for the year 
for the year  net sales for the company s radar detectors rose on a rise in unit volume over  reflecting continued strong market acceptance of the company s products and the growth of the oem and reseller channels 
the decline in the average unit price reflected the growing significance of major customers  who generally receive volume discounts 
the company s fourth quarter detector net sales were lower than the third quarter of this year as well as the comparable prior period for several reasons 
first  oem and reseller customers tend to make the majority of their purchases earlier in the fall holiday selling season than do retail customers 
additionally  the timing of radar detector sales was impacted by the relatively earlier introduction of new products when compared with finally  weakness in the overall consumer electronics market as well as the radar detector market impacted sales of the company s escort brand detectors 
net sales for the company s cordless telephones with surelink tm technology rose in compared with unit volume jumped  partially offsetting the decline in the average unit price due to the significantly greater percentage of oem reseller sales and the company s strategy to reduce the selling prices of its cordless telephones to enhance market penetration 
sales of cordless telephones  while strong  were slightly below the levels anticipated by management primarily because of factors that impacted sales late in the fourth quarter 
fourth quarter sales grew only  the smallest gain of the year 
factors that impacted results late in the fourth quarter included the delay of a large order which has since been shipped 
this delay was due to the company s inability to complete production of a specific cordless telephone model due to delays in purchasing and engineering 
additionally  an oem customer postponed a large order  scheduled for the second half of december 
other sales for  which includes sales of the company s cellular digital packet data cdpd modems  were down significantly versus due to the discontinuation of contract sales to bi  inc of the company s home arrest product line in the first quarter of modem sales were insignificant in both years 
gross margin the company s gross profit margin was in vs 
in  reflecting a rise in cost of goods sold and the adverse impact of the continued  planned shift in the sales mix from higher margin direct retail business to oem and reseller business 
factors that contributed to the rise in the cost of goods sold included poor purchasing and material management practices that kept the company from achieving the cost reductions necessary to reach specific margin targets 
these targets were established in conjunction with the planned reduction in selling prices of the company s consumer electronic products to maintain their competitive position 
the decline also was due to unanticipated material and manufacturing costs incurred by the company in the third quarter and continuing into the fourth quarter  in order to maintain product quality and timely production and to meet commitments to customers 
to correct a design difficulty with a key component battery charge contacts in certain of its new cordless telephone models  the company was required to spend more than expected to customize replacement parts  to obtain additional parts and to run the production lines at less than optimum capacity 
in addition  as a result of a vendor s production error and  separately  a product design error relating to preprogrammed integrated circuits  the company incurred additional costs to obtain one time programmable integrated circuits to use in place of the preprogrammed integrated circuits and to redesign its cordless telephone and radar detector models to use these programmable circuits 
in the fourth quarter  the company undertook a review of all inventory and purchasing functions 
generally  it was determined that the company was overpaying for components and frequently ordering quantities in excess of the sales plan  which contributed to the rise in cost of goods sold 
as a result of this review  the company appointed a new manager of purchasing to oversee a complete restructuring of the department and increased the fourth quarter provision for excess and obsolete inventory by million over the prior year  which increased cost of goods sold 
included in the provision was a million write down of previously purchased and or noncancelable orders of components for earlier generation cdpd modems and a write down totalling million of the remaining inventory of earlier generation cordless telephones 
the modems to be built with the components on hand and the earlier generation cordless telephones will be marketable in the us or internationally at the new cost levels 
in addition to its efforts to improve its purchasing function and inventory management  since year end  the company has restructured manufacturing  including a reconfiguration of the factory to streamline the production process and reduce manufacturing cycle times 
manufacturing staffing levels have been reduced approximately since year end while factory yield performance has shown continuous improvement 
operating expenses although operating expenses for decreased to of net sales from in the comparable prior period  the total increased by million reflecting a million rise in administrative expense and a million increase in selling expenses offset by a million decline in research and development expense 
the decrease in research and development expense reflected the lower development requirements  which permitted staff reductions  for the radar detector  cordless telephone and cdpd modem models introduced in selling expenses were up only for the full year  reflecting a benefit of the company s shift to oem reseller business  which requires proportionately less selling effort 
to support the retail sales effort  however  the company initiated substantial advertising in the fourth quarter to stimulate escort sales 
in comparison to a very low level of advertising in s fourth quarter  selling expenses in the fourth quarter of rose 
administrative expenses for the year were up million  or  predominantly due to a rise in legal and professional expenses  a change in the method of allocating certain benefit related expenses between cost of sales  administrative  selling  and research and development expenses and higher staffing levels 
in light of results for the second half of  the company reevaluated the required staffing levels and has reduced head count of salaried employees by approximately since december  net interest expense for the year rose to million vs 

million due to higher average outstanding balances on the company s revolving credit facility caused primarily by the build up of inventory during during the year  the company recorded a nonoperating gain of million reflecting the release of certain tax reserves to income as a result of the closure of the company s federal tax return 
the results included a nonoperating gain of  from the sale of land 
as compared with cincinnati microwave s net sales of million for were higher than sales 
this increase was due entirely to sales of the spread spectrum cordless telephone product line  offsetting the decline in the detector product line 
the telephone was introduced during the second quarter of and had modest sales in the decline in the radar detector net sales was due to the market contraction for these products and lower pricing 
the company s cdpd modem sales for were insignificant 
testing of the cdpd system continued with end users testing the system for its compatibility with their business applications 
the company s modem has been tested for various industrial and commercial cdpd applications 
the company s gross profit decreased to in from in this decline was caused by two significant factors 
during  the company experienced significant component delivery problems relating to the spread spectrum telephone product line 
this impacted the factory production schedule and increased the cost to fill customer orders 
for much of the fourth quarter  the company operated its telephone production line in a stop and start mode as and when parts became available in order to expedite deliveries to its customers 
secondly  the market size and demand for detectors declined causing several competing radar detector manufacturers to initiate price reductions during in an attempt to maintain its market position  the company reacted to these developments by introducing a major sales promotional program for its retail customers for the month of december 
the reduced volume resulting from the market decline and the pricing action contributed to the gross profit decline 
research and development expenses increased  from the company continued to focus its efforts on new product development and product improvements 
selling expenses increased million from primarily in the area of advertising 
this increase resulted from the company s program of introducing spread spectrum telephone information to potential consumers in an effort to expand its potential customer base 
administrative expenses did not fluctuate significantly from the prior year 
quarterly results of operations the following table shows quarterly results for and in thousands except for per share data first second third fourth total quarter quarter quarter quarter year net sales      gross profit     net loss    net loss per share net sales      gross profit      net loss     net loss per share quarterly earnings per share calculations are based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the three month period then ended 
annual earnings per share calculations are based on weighted average number of shares outstanding for the twelve month period then ended 
due to fluctuations in the weighted average number of shares outstanding  the sum of the earnings per share calculations for each quarter will not necessarily equal the calculated earnings per share for the twelve month period 
first quarter includes weeks as compared to weeks for the comparable period in total year includes weeks as compared to weeks for the comparable period in liquidity and capital resources in the first quarter of  the company completed a rights offering of  units for per unit  each unit consisted of two common shares and one warrant entitling the holder to purchase one additional common share for the rights offering generated net proceeds of million 
during   warrants were exercised 
at december   the company had  outstanding warrants which expire on december  the proceeds from the rights offering were used to reduce debt and to increase working capital 
during the third quarter of  the company completed an equity offering that generated million in net proceeds 
the funds were used to pay off the then existing revolving credit line and to fund the growth in working capital that occurred during the third and fourth quarters of  including expenses associated with a planned increase in production to support higher sales for the third and fourth quarters 
in addition  during the company incurred  of capital lease obligations and utilized million of cash flow for capital expenditures for additional production equipment 
the primary contributors to the million increase in working capital between year end and year end were a million rise in accounts receivable  a million increase in inventories offset by a million increase in accounts payable and a shift to current liabilities of the entire million outstanding balance on the company s credit facility at december  the increase in accounts receivable to million at the end of reflected the upward sales trend of cordless telephones during  with of total year unit volume of cordless telephones shipped in the last four months of the year 
oems and resellers  for which typical credit terms eg  payment within to days after delivery are made available on their large volume orders  represented a significantly larger proportion of sales in versus retail customers generally have paid for their purchase at the time it was shipped or delivered 
the million increase in inventories between year end and year end was driven by a million rise in raw materials and work in process and a million increase in finished goods inventory  offset in part by a million increase in the inventory valuation reserve 
poor purchasing practices were the primary reason for the excess inventory and the previously mentioned delay in certain sales 
reflecting the emphasis being placed on improving the purchasing function  raw material and work in process inventory has been reduced since year end to approximately million at march  from million at year end 
the million in finished goods inventory at year end  which has since been reduced to million at march   was impacted by the lower than anticipated sales in december 
at year end  the company had borrowed million term loan balance of million and million on the revolving credit facility against its credit facility due june  the million credit facility consisted of i the term loan  ii a million revolving credit facility and iii a standby letter of credit facility not to exceed million  however  the sum of the outstanding principal balance of the revolving credit and the aggregate amount of the company s outstanding letters of credit shall not exceed million at any time 
the credit facility is secured by a first lien on the company s inventory  receivables  equipment and a mortgage on the real estate of the company 
at year end  the company was in violation of certain covenants of the borrowing agreement triggered by the net loss incurred for the fourth quarter and total year  which resulted in financial statement ratios falling below the requirements of the borrowing agreement 
the company remained current on all required payments to the lender throughout and has remained current in the lending institution waived similar violations for the third quarter  however  as a result of the anticipated net loss for the fourth quarter and therefore for the full year  the bank notified the company on january  of a default on the covenants and further reduced the revolving credit facility to million 
on february   the bank notified the company on that it had elected to further reduce the revolving credit facility to million effective march  and increase the interest rate charged to the default rate of interest  as stipulated in the borrowing agreement  retroactively from february  to prime plus from prime plus for the revolving credit facility and to prime plus from prime plus on the term loan 
since year end  the bank has elected to continue to make advances to the company under the reduced credit facility  notwithstanding the event of default under the borrowing agreement 
the reductions in the revolving credit facility  however  caused the company to have less cash than previously anticipated and heightened the company s need to manage cash balances very carefully  particularly in light of the higher than normal inventory levels and slowdown in year end sales 
there can be no assurances that the bank s election will continue because the bank has not waived the default and has reserved all of its rights and remedies under the borrowing agreement  related loan documents and applicable law which include  but are not limited  to demanding immediate payment of all outstanding balances owed to the bank 
the company continues to work with the bank and has informed the bank of its efforts and progress in pursuing an alternative financing institution to replace the bank 
due to the reduced levels of available cash as a result of the increase in inventories and accounts receivable  as well as the reduced credit facility  accounts payable at year end were million vs 
million at year end the company is currently in communication with its key suppliers and vendors to maintain good relationships as it seeks additional financing and uses cash flow to make payments on the accounts payable balances 
since year end  the accounts payable balance has been reduced to million at march  at present  the company estimates that suppliers and creditors can be brought closer to normal payment terms  although there can be no assurance that such objectives will be accomplished 
although the company s suppliers and creditors have generally been very supportive  the company is currently purchasing approximately of its material requirements on a cash basis  which has periodically created scheduling and downtime problems 
the company is presently seeking to refinance its existing bank debt to obtain  in particular  a higher credit limit  a longer term  less restrictive covenants and lower interest rates and costs 
although there can be no assurances that the new financing can be obtained  in march  the company received proposals from three financial institutions at interest rates below those currently being charged by the bank and for amounts exceeding twice the current facility 
the company selected the cit group credit finance  inc cit to proceed with their due diligence review and believes that it will be able to complete negotiations with cit  or an alternative comparable lender  and receive funding in the next days 
funding is subject to successful completion of the due diligence process and execution of a definitive borrowing agreement 
the credit facility is not expected to be subject to financial covenants 
proceeds from the new credit facility will be used to pay off the existing credit facility with the bank and will be used going forward to fund working capital requirements  including the reduction of accounts payable 
the agreement will be secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
at year end  shareholders equity was million and the ratio of debt to equity was versus equity of million and a debt to equity ratio of at december  the company believes that its working capital and refinanced credit facilities  along with cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to fund its operations for the foreseeable future
