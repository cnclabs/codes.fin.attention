fiscal vs 
fiscal revenues in fiscal of  remained substantially unchanged from the fiscal level of  excluding the revenues from divested operations of  and  in fiscal and  respectively  the sales volume in fiscal increased  or  from the prior year  in large part reflecting improved worldwide demand for daniel s products  particularly large diameter gate valves 
revenues of  from businesses acquired in fiscal also contributed to the increase 
the gross profit margin for fiscal was compared to in the prior year 
the gross profit margin  adjusted for divested operations in both periods and the charge for inventory writedowns recorded in fiscal  was and  respectively 
the slight deterioration in margins can be attributed to a change in product mix towards sales of valve products  which historically have earned lower margins than sales of mechanical and electronic products 
selling and administrative s a expenses declined to  in fiscal s a expenses adjusted for divested operations in fiscal and were  and  respectively  representing and of revenues  respectively 
the improvement in s a expenses as a percentage of revenues is a result of revenues increasing at a higher rate than expenses 
research and development expenses decreased to  in fiscal due primarily to completion of certain electronics projects 
the effective tax rate in fiscal of approximately is higher than the us statutory rate due primarily to losses at the german operation  for which no tax benefits are currently recognized 
daniel sold in fiscal certain non manufacturing properties in germany and a non core product line resulting in pretax gains of  and  in fiscal  recorded losses aggregating  related to the divestitures of non core assets 
while the original goals of daniel s restructuring plan have been substantially achieved  management is continuing to evaluate certain operations 
management believes that there may exist additional opportunities to eliminate or combine certain operations  which measures  if undertaken  would  like the restructuring plan  be directed toward achieving more efficient and profitable operations 
although no decisions have been made  such measures  if taken  could in the future result in excess assets or require other charges that could have a non recurring effect material to daniel s results of operations in a particular future period or interim period 
management does not foresee the likelihood of any such actions that would have any material adverse effect on daniel s financial position  liquidity or cash flows 
in accounting for the bettis merger as a pooling of interests  daniel will record as expense the transaction costs associated with the merger  currently estimated at approximately  during the first quarter of fiscal fiscal vs 
fiscal revenues decreased to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal this decline was due to the inclusion in the prior year of revenues related to the construction of two large gas metering stations destined for the north sea 
in addition  during fiscal  a competitive foreign market for valves and the divestiture of the energy fabrication business caused a decline in sales of valves and fabricated energy products  respectively  compared to fiscal levels 
this decrease in revenues was partially offset by higher revenues from sales of fastener products due to price increases allowed by improved demand 
the gross profit margin for fiscal improved to of revenues compared to of revenues in fiscal this improvement was due in large part to a change in product mix towards sales of flow measurement products which earn higher margins than sales of flow measurement systems  and improved margins on fastener products due primarily to price increases 
the improved gross profit margin was partially offset by a  charge for inventory writedowns recorded in the second quarter of fiscal in connection with daniel s decision  as part of its strategic restructuring plan  to focus on core product lines 
s a expenses declined to  in fiscal due primarily to the decrease in sales volume and the realization of benefits from the strategic restructuring program 
results of operations for fiscal include restructuring and other charges of  representing primarily accruals relating to employee severance payments and the impairment of assets 
losses aggregating  related to the divestitures of non core assets  primarily resulting from the divestiture of the fastener business  were recorded in fiscal research and development expenses declined to  during fiscal due primarily to reduced expenditures related to several electronic development projects 
interest expense increased to  in fiscal due to increased short term borrowing levels partially offset by lower long term debt levels 
impact of inflation an effect of inflation is to increase the prices of labor and raw materials used to manufacture daniel s products  which may require periodic increases in the prices for those products to maintain gross profit margins 
although this principle impacts most manufacturers  management does not consider daniel to have any unique difficulty in managing the effects of inflation on its business 
daniel utilizes the lifo method to account for a majority of its inventories  which  in times of inflation  may have a significant impact on reported income 
liquidity and capital resources the primary sources of daniel s liquidity for the year ended september  were proceeds from the divestitures of assets see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  proceeds from a term loan  internally generated funds and cash available at the beginning of the year 
these funds were used primarily for acquisitions see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  payments on long term and short term debt  funding of operations  capital expenditures and payments of dividends 
working capital decreased  from september  to  at september  due primarily to the receipt of long term notes received in partial consideration for the net assets of the fastener business  which were classified as net assets held for sale and included as current assets at september   and a net increase in short term borrowings due to the acquisition of spectra tek 
this decrease in working capital was partially offset by an increase in receivables as a result of higher sales volume in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the same quarter last year 
daniel considers its financial position to be strong with a debt to total capitalization ratio and current ratio as of september   of and to  respectively 
working capital at september  included  in inventory and deferred tax assets  which are not as liquid as other current assets 
at september   daniel had uncommitted short term lines of credit aggregating approximately  one of these lines contains restrictions regarding the amount of the line available for short term borrowings and the amount available for issuance of letters of credit 
the other lines are available for either short term borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit 
loans under these lines may be made in such amounts and at such maturities and interest rates as may be offered by the banks and accepted by daniel at the time of each borrowing 
at september    was available for short term borrowings 
in may  daniel  borrowed pound  approximately  for a period of six months at a variable interest rate which did not exceed for the five months ended september  the proceeds were primarily used to acquire spectra tek 
in november  daniel received an extension on the maturity of the loan to may daniel has both the intent and the ability to refinance this loan 
daniel s operations outside the united states are subject to the usual risks of such operations  including changes in governmental policies  currency transfer restrictions and devaluation 
daniel endeavors to minimize these risks through the use of letters of credit  united states dollar denominated contracts and hedging of specific foreign currency commitments 
capital expenditures for fiscal were  daniel continues to seek acquisitions that would build upon its expertise in the manufacture and sale of flow measurement and flow control products and systems 
subject to the approval of the stockholders of daniel and bettis  the bettis merger is expected to occur in december whereby bettis will become a wholly owned subsidiary of daniel 
the acquisition of bettis will be made with daniel common stock and will not affect daniel s liquidity or otherwise use its capital resources 
at september  bettis had outstanding indebtedness of approximately  of which  was long term 
daniel believes that its working capital  cash generated from operations and amounts available under its uncommitted short term lines of credit will be adequate to meet its operating needs for the foreseeable future
