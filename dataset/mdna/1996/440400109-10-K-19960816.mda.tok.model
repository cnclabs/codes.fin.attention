the balance of the acquisitions was comprised of various specialty medical services operations 
total operating revenues recorded during fiscal subsequent to these acquisitions totaled approximately million

see medicaid and medicare and regulation in item of part i of this form k

as a percentage of total operating revenues  facility lease expense declined to from for the year ended may   compared to the corresponding period in fiscal depreciation and amortization increased million  or for the year ended may   compared to the corresponding period in fiscal as a percentage of total operating revenues  depreciation and amortization declined to from for fiscal year  compared to fiscal the increase in depreciation and amortization is attributable to the growth in the number of facilities owned in fiscal as well as the impact of capital expenditures made 
interest expense declined million  or for the year ended may   compared to the corresponding period in fiscal the decline in interest expense is primarily attributable to the retirement of substantially all of the senior subordinated notes as hereinafter defined of cms  utilizing proceeds from the company s credit facility which bears interest at a substantially lower rate 
the decrease in interest expense due to interest rates was offset somewhat by an increase in the average amount of debt outstanding 
the company recorded special charges totaling million and  million during the first and fourth quarters of fiscal  respectively 
the first quarter charge resulted primarily from costs incurred in completing the merger with cms  the approval by management of restructuring measures related to efforts to combine the previously separate companies and a decision by management prior to the cms merger to dispose of selected long term care facilities 
the fourth quarter charge reflected the accrual of estimated legal and other costs related to monitoring and responding to the various legal and investigative matters affecting the company and the impairment of selected long lived assets to fair market value 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of these charges 
as discussed above  several components of the fiscal charges were related to the company s expansion through acquisition 
the company intends to continue to expand its operations through acquisitions in selected geographic areas and will rely on cash as a currency to effect future acquisitions 
growth through acquisition entails certain risks in that acquired operations could be subject to unanticipated business uncertainties or legal liabilities 
the company seeks to minimize these risks through investigation and evaluation of the operations proposed to be acquired and through transaction structure and indemnification 
in addition  each such business combination presents the risk that currently unanticipated difficulties may arise in integrating the operations of the combined entities 
moreover  such business combinations present the risk that the synergies expected from the combined operations may not be realized 
the various risks associated with the integration of recent and future acquisitions and the subsequent performance of such acquired operations may adversely affect the company s results of operations 
following each acquisition  management will consider opportunities to eliminate excess or duplicative operations  processes or personnel or other measures to maximize the potential of the combined operations 
as a result of these considerations  management may commit to undertake restructuring measures which would result in a current charge against earnings 
depending upon the relative significance of an acquisition and the extent of the restructuring program undertaken  such charge could be material to the company 
extraordinary item the extraordinary item recorded during fiscal results from the extinguishment of debt and management s decision to dispose of certain assets following the cms merger 
on september   the company completed a tender offer and consent solicitation for two issues of publicly held indebtedness of cms together  the senior subordinated notes 
the company purchased million in principal amount of senior subordinated notes due at plus a consent fee of and million in principal amount of senior subordinated notes due at plus a consent fee of 
the company paid million to retire the senior subordinated notes  including principal  premiums  accrued interest  consent fees and other related costs 
as a result of the tender  the company recorded an extraordinary charge related to the loss on the retirement of the senior subordinated notes  including the write off of related deferred discount  swap cancellation and financing costs  of approximately million  net of tax  in the second quarter of fiscal as a result of discussions occurring during the fourth quarter of fiscal  management significantly revised and expanded the group of facilities originally identified for disposal in the first quarter of fiscal management also obtained board of director approval to pursue such a sale 
subsequent to year end  the company reached agreement regarding the sales price of these assets 
the difference between the proposed sales price or estimated fair value of the properties and the recorded basis of the assets to be sold is approximately million 
as a result  a million charge was recorded in the fourth quarter to increase the million first quarter asset disposal reserve to million 
in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  business combinations  the fourth quarter charge was classified as an extraordinary item 
management s decision with respect to the fourth quarter revision and expansion of the group of facilities to be disposed of occurred subsequent to the merger with cms  in july  which was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
apb requires that profit or loss resulting from the disposal of assets within two years after a pooling of interests should be classified as an extraordinary item  net of tax 
because the million first quarter asset disposal charge occurred prior to the cms merger  that charge was appropriately classified within operations 
the operations currently proposed for disposition include leased long term care facilities  ten owned long term care facilities  three managed long term care facilities and three pharmacy operations 
the assets to be disposed of comprise substantially all of the company s long term care and pharmacy operations in the states of massachusetts  connecticut  ohio and wisconsin

the company also experienced an approximate increase in the average rates realized in long term and subacute care operations

rates by payor type in both the long term care and specialty health care operations remained relatively constant 
costs and expenses cost of services increased approximately million  or for the year ended may   compared to the corresponding period in fiscal the increases in cost of services is primarily attributable to the significant expansion through acquisitions of the long term and subacute care operations
