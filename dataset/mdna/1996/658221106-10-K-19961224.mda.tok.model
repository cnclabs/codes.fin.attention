item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general north carolina natural gas corporation ncng or the company is engaged primarily in the business of transporting and distributing natural gas at regulated retail rates to customers in cities  towns and communities  as well as at regulated wholesale rates to four municipal gas distribution systems  in southcentral and eastern north carolina with a peak number of approximately  total natural gas customers for the year ended september  the company also has a propane division with  customers 
ncng continues to expand its transmission and distribution systems to keep pace with the economic development in residential  commercial and industrial growth in its service area 
the company s financial condition and results of operations are substantially dependent upon its receiving adequate and timely increases in rates  which are regulated by the north carolina utilities commission ncuc 
liquidity and capital resources the company has bank lines of credit totaling million  including million on a committed basis 
borrowings under the lines can include bankers acceptances and promissory notes not to exceed days  with a maximum rate of the lending bank s commercial prime interest rate 
at september   million was outstanding at interest rates ranging from to  compared to debt outstanding of million with interest rates ranging from to at september  the decrease of million was due to the issuance of long term debt  which was used to refinance amounts outstanding on these lines of credit and the level of cash generated by operating activities  which was million in these sources were sufficient to cover the million in capital expenditures and million of dividend payments in ncng uses the short term bank loans as needed to finance construction expenditures  and it replaces the bank loans with permanent financing when total borrowings approach the maximum level available under the lines of credit or when conditions are favorable for obtaining long term capital 
on november   the company issued in a private placement of million of senior notes  due  and all of the short term debt then outstanding was repaid 
construction expenditures of million in were lower than by million 
this was due primarily to the completion of the company s transmission line from a point near goldsboro to mount olive in southern wayne county in  with no similar expenditures in the company has budgeted construction expenditures of million  including approximately million for system strengthening  compressors and related projects as well as million for the expansion project to duplin and onslow counties 
the company s ratio of long term debt to total capitalization was at september   down from at september   due to an increase in overall debt of only million compared to an increase in stockholders investment of million 
the company does not anticipate the need to raise additional capital from the long term debt market or from the public sale of common stock during fiscal management expects that the generation of net cash from operating activities together with its bank lines of credit and other sources will be sufficient to provide for its construction program and other capital needs during the company expects to raise approximately million of additional equity in from its dividend reinvestment plan  its employee stock purchase plan and its key employee stock option plan 
common equity realized from such sources totaled million in and million in results of operations earnings ncng earned million or per share in  compared to million or per share in and million or per share in the increase in earnings in as compared to was primarily due to a general rate increase effective november   higher throughput volumes driven by customer growth and colder than normal weather  an increase in the customer base of approximately which resulted in increased facilities charges as well as increased sales volumes  and higher earnings realized by the company s propane division and subsidiary gas marketing activities 
the winter weather in fiscal year was colder than normal and colder than this caused total dekatherms dt delivered to increase nearly to million dt compared to million dt in the increase in earnings in compared to was due to increased deliveries of natural gas in the industrial and municipal markets together with strong customer growth in the core market residential and commercial sectors 
throughput and margin the company s total throughput volumes in increased by million dt to million dt 
residential  commercial  and wholesale volumes increased million  million and million dts  respectively  largely due to strong customer growth and colder weather 
total industrial throughput decreased million dt primarily due to more weather induced curtailments of the larger industrial boiler fuel customers who use heavy oil as an alternative fuel  a cooler than normal summer which decreased electric power generation and competition with alternative fuel sources 
ncng continued adding natural gas customers at an above average growth rate in the addition of approximately  customers in represents a growth rate of compared to the national average of less than for all natural gas distribution utilities 
even though colder than normal weather in the winter increased sales of gas to residential  commercial and municipal customers  the company did not realize a proportional increase in additional margin from such customers because of the operation of the weather normalization adjustment wna mechanism which stabilizes the company s margin from space heating customers based on normal weather 
the wna reduced margin million in compared to an increase in margin of million in  as a result of colder weather in the winter of as compared to the same period in the following chart compares margins in fiscal years and by customer class margin increase decrease customer class amount in thousands residential    commercial and small industrial    industrial electric power generation    municipal   total    the residential  commercial and small industrial and municipal margins increased primarily due to the general rate increase  colder than normal weather and customer growth which increased volumes by million dt 
industrial and electric power generation margins decreased due to the company s general rate case  which lowered industrial and electric power generation rates  and lower volumes due to curtailment of interruptible customers 
the company s total margin growth in was million  but ncng s total throughput in increased million dt  or  to million dt 
weather in both and was warmer than normal  so weather had no significant impact on annual throughput in revenues and cost of gas in the natural gas distribution industry in recent years  gross margin rather than revenues has become a more valid indicator of the results of operations 
two factors account for this change the steadily increasing incidence of customers acquiring their own gas supplies for transportation  and the increased volatility in the commodity price of natural gas 
ncng s transportation volumes decreased in after four consecutive years of growth 
transportation volumes were million dt in compared to million dt in and million dt in conversely  the company s sales volumes increased million dt  growing to million dt in compared to million dt in and million dt in in general  the margin earned on gas transported is equal to the margin earned on gas sold  however  transportation  which replaces sales  results in lower revenues because transportation rates exclude the commodity cost of gas which is paid by the customer directly to its gas supplier 
the company still delivers the gas and earns transportation revenue equivalent to the margin contained in a comparable sales rate 
gas costs increased by approximately million in  primarily due to a significant increase in the commodity cost of gas to an average of per dt in from per dt in additionally  the company s fixed charges increased slightly due to an increase in pipeline demand and storage charges  offset by a decrease in reservation fees 
the company s operating revenues increased million in because of the increase in gas costs  the switch by industrial customers from transportation to sales services  a general rate increase and customer growth 
operating revenues decreased million in due to a combination of factors  including lower gas costs and the shift to more transportation than sales services and less sales to large customers in compared to these factors were partially offset by strong customer growth and a slight increase in net throughput 
operating expenses and taxes ncng s total operating expenses and taxes increased to million in  compared to million in and million in as a percentage of margin  the amount was  down slightly from in  and in operations and maintenance expenses increased to million in  compared to million in and million in this increase was primarily due to increased customer collections expense  including an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts  higher distribution maintenance and transmission operation expenses  higher wages and higher costs associated with administration  customer service and sales promotion efforts associated with the rapidly growing customer base 
the company s depreciation rates must be approved by the north carolina utilities commission 
in connection with the company s general rate case effective november   the composite depreciation rate was increased to for from in and accordingly  the increases in depreciation expense relates to the increases in both the depreciation rate and gross plant investment 
the most significant component of general taxes is gross receipts taxes related to operating revenues 
therefore  the increase in general taxes in is in line with the higher operating revenues 
general taxes also includes payroll and property taxes which have increased in each of the years  and due to the company s increasing payroll caused by higher wages and its additional investment in plant in service 
income tax expense increased in and is in line with the increase in pretax income 
the effective income tax rate of for is not significantly different than and  with the equity component of allowance for funds used during construction being the largest variable influencing the effective tax rate 
other matters on october  the ncuc issued its order granting a general rate increase amounting to approximately million in annual revenues effective november  see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
as reported in prior years  the company retained an environmental services consulting firm which has estimated the cost of investigation and remediation of the kinston manufactured gas plant mgp site to be between million and million 
the company believes that any appreciable costs not previously provided for will be recovered from third parties  including liability insurance carriers  or in natural gas rates as approved by the commission in the october rate order 
the company also owns another site of a former mgp site in new bern  north carolina  and was a previous owner of three small former mgp sites 
no significant problems have arisen to date

in addition  the company would be required to determine any impairment to the other assets  including plant  and write down the assets  if impaired  to their fair value

significant trends the natural gas industry continues to evolve into a more competitive environment 
the company completed its third full year of operations under the requirements of ferc order  which is applicable to all us interstate pipelines including the two serving the company 
ncng has a balanced gas supply portfolio which provides security of supply at the lowest reasonable cost as the ncuc has found in all of the company s annual prudency reviews  the most recent of which was completed in april the company has experienced no major problems due to order in response to the growth of the natural gas business in north carolina  ncng established a new subsidiary  ncng energy corporation  in august to participate in two partnerships with subsidiaries of transco  piedmont natural gas company piedmont  and public service company of north carolina public service  regarding gas supply and pipeline projects affecting the entire state 
ncng energy corporation has become a equity owner in pine needle lng company  llc  which owns the site and plans to build and operate a bcf liquefied natural gas plant lng at a site near transco s main line north of greensboro  north carolina 
this is scheduled to be in service by the winter heating season 
ncng has committed to take of the capacity in order to support continuing growth in customer base which is expected for the next five years 
additionally  ncng energy and its partners have organized another company  called cardinal expansion company  llc cardinal  which will take over an existing intrastate pipeline now owned by piedmont and public service 
the pipeline will be extended from burlington  north carolina to an interconnection with the systems of public service and ncng southeast of raleigh at clayton  north carolina near ncng s service territory 
the expanded cardinal pipeline would enable the company to take substantial additional volumes of natural gas year round into the middle of its system 
ncng energy has a equity interest in cardinal  also 
in august  the ncuc approved the company s duplin onslow counties expansion project 
the marine base camp lejeune will be the largest customer of this pipeline extension  with service expected to begin in see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in addition to the duplin onslow counties project  the company is also considering other expansion projects that it may seek ncuc approval to construct after the duplin onslow counties project has been completed
