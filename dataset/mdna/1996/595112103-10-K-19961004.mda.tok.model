item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains trend information and other forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from the company s historical results of operations and those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include  but are not limited to  those identified in certain factors 
all period references are to the company s fiscal periods ended august   august  or september   unless otherwise indicated 
overview the company designs  develops  manufactures and markets semiconductor memory products  primarily dram  for use in pcs 
through its majority owned subsidiary  mei  the company also designs  develops  markets  manufactures and supports micron brand pc systems  and operates a contract manufacturing and component recovery business 
the company s semiconductor memory products are commodity products  the price and profitability of which are highly dependent on overall supply demand dynamics in the industry 
historically  the semiconductor memory industry has experienced declines in average selling prices commensurate with the industry s ability to reduce cost per megabit 
consequently  the company s operating results are significantly affected by the company s ability to reduce cost per megabit commensurate with  or at a rate greater than  reductions in average selling prices 
cost reductions are effected through design and ramp up of shrink products  maximizing yield of good die produced and maximizing equipment capacity utilization 
the company s gross margins from fiscal through fiscal benefited from the company s ability to effect such cost reductions while dram average sales prices remained relatively stable 
from december through august  the average selling price of the company s meg dram fell as industry supply exceeded demand 
gross margins for the three fiscal quarters ended august  decreased sequentially as a result of the sharp decline in average selling prices for semiconductor memory products at a rate exceeding the company s ability to effect cost reductions for such products 
as dram prices have fallen and as unit shipments of pc systems have increased  the company s consolidated operating results have been increasingly affected by the results of the pc operations of mei 
while sales of pc systems  less the sales of the company s semiconductor memory included therein  constituted approximately of the company s total net sales for fiscal  such sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal constituted approximately of the company s total net sales 
unit sales of pc systems increased in fiscal compared to fiscal principally due to increased name recognition and market acceptance of micron brand pc products 
while sales of pc systems generally continued to have a lower gross margin percentage than sales of the company s semiconductor memory products in  the gross margin percentage on sales of pc systems increased in compared to and was higher than the gross margin percentage on sales of semiconductor memory products in the fourth quarter of fiscal any reduction in mti s ownership percentage of mei  whether caused by future dispositions of shares of common stock of mei by mti or issuances of shares of common stock by mei  will have the effect of reducing mti s share of future results of operations of mei 
results of operations net income for was million  or per fully diluted share  on net sales of  million 
the higher level of net sales in principally resulted from increased production of semiconductor memory products and an increase in pc system sales  which were offset in part by a sharp decline in average selling prices for semiconductor memory products 
the decrease in average selling prices for the company s semiconductor memory products in at a rate faster than the company s reductions in cost per megabit resulted in lower net income in as compared to net income for was million  or per fully diluted share  on net sales of  million 
the company s results of operations in fiscal were adversely affected by a restructuring charge of million associated with the discontinuation of sales of zeos brand pc systems and the closing of the related pc manufacturing operations in minneapolis  minnesota 
net sales the following table presents the company s net sales by principal product or service 
the caption other principally includes revenue from contract manufacturing and from module assembly services 
net sales of semiconductor memory products include sales of such products incorporated in mei personal computer systems and other products 
corresponding amounts excluded from sales of personal computer systems and other products million  million and million in  and  respectively equal the aggregate purchase prices paid by mei to mti for semiconductor memory products 
net sales of total net sales of total net sales of total dollars in millions semiconductor memory products    personal computer systems  other total net sales    net sales in increased by over  principally due to a higher level of production of semiconductor memory and a higher level of net sales of pc systems 
the effect on net sales of increased production of semiconductor memory products was offset by a sharp decline in average selling prices 
net sales of semiconductor memory products declined as a percentage of total net sales to in from in  due to the sharp decline in average selling prices for semiconductor memory products and continued growth of the company s pc system sales 
the company s principal product in was the meg dram  which comprised approximately of the net sales of the semiconductor memory products  and of total net sales 
net sales of the meg dram were and of net sales of semiconductor memory products in and  respectively 
in  total megabits produced increased approximately and megabits shipped increased by approximately from levels 
these increases were principally due to the conversion of fab iii to inch wafers  ongoing transitions to successive shrink versions of existing memory products  particularly the meg dram  a increase in total wafer outs  a shift in the company s mix of semiconductor memory products to a higher average density and enhanced yields on existing memory products 
net sales of pc systems  less sales to mei of the company s semiconductor memory included therein  increased to approximately of the company s total net sales for from and in and  respectively  primarily due to significantly higher unit sales of pc systems and  to a lesser extent  higher average selling prices for pc systems 
unit sales of pc systems increased in compared to  principally due to increased name recognition and market acceptance of micron brand desktop pc products 
increased sales to governmental entities and increased sales of notebook systems also contributed to higher overall unit sales 
net sales in increased by compared to principally due to relatively stable prices for semiconductor memory products and the comparatively higher volume of semiconductor memory produced in total megabits produced increased by approximately in compared to  principally as a result of ongoing transitions to successive shrink versions of then existing products  a shift in the company s mix of semiconductor memory products to a higher average density and enhanced yields on then existing memory products 
net sales of pc systems  less the value of the company s semiconductor memory included therein  increased to approximately of the company s total net sales for from in pc system sales increased principally due to increased demand for the company s pc systems as a result of greater brand name recognition and market acceptance of such products 
gross margin change change dollars in millions gross margin   as a of net sales the company s gross margin percentage in was lower than in primarily as a result of lower average selling prices for semiconductor memory products and higher net sales of pc systems as a percentage of total net sales 
the company s gross margin percentage on sales of semiconductor memory products for was  compared to and in and  respectively 
the lower gross margin percentage on sales of semiconductor memory products in was principally due to a sharp decline in average selling prices for such products as compared to more gradual decreases in per megabit manufacturing costs 
decreases in the company s manufacturing costs per megabit were achieved through significant increases in volume production which principally resulted from greater number of die per wafer achieved through conversion of fab iii to inch wafers  transitions to shrink versions of existing products  improved manufacturing yields  increased wafer output and a shift in the company s mix of semiconductor memory products to higher density devices 
the lower gross margin percentage on sales of semiconductor memory products in was partially offset by the effect of a net reduction of approximately million in accruals recorded in prior years relating to product and process rights contingencies for both semiconductor and personal computer operations 
sales of pc systems generally had a lower gross margin percentage than sales of the company s semiconductor memory products in however  the gross margin percentage on sales of pc systems increased in compared to primarily as a result of improved component costs and improved inventory management 
in addition  increased sales of notebook pc products favorably affected the gross margin percentage on sales of pc systems 
while sales of pc systems generally continued to have a lower gross margin percentage than sales of the company s semiconductor memory products in fiscal  the gross margin percentage on sales of pc systems was higher in the fourth quarter of fiscal than the gross margin percentage on sales of semiconductor memory products 
cost of goods sold includes estimated costs of settlement or adjudication of asserted and unasserted claims for patent infringement prior to the balance sheet date and costs of product and process technology licensing arrangements 
product and process technology costs decreased as a percentage of total net sales in principally due to the higher level of net sales of pc systems in which are subject to generally lower royalty costs compared to the company s semiconductor memory products  and due to the resolution of contingencies for product and process technology rights 
the slight increase in gross margin percentage for compared to was principally due to relatively stable prices as compared to reductions in cost per megabit of memory sold for dram products 
reductions in cost per megabit of memory sold were realized primarily from a combination of increased wafer output  yield improvements  die shrinks and transitions to generally higher density memory products 
this slight increase in gross margin percentage was offset in part by higher net sales of pc systems as a percentage of net sales 
sales of pc systems generally had a lower gross margin percentage than sales of the company s semiconductor memory products in selling  general and administrative change change dollars in millions selling  general and administrative as a of net sales the higher level of selling  general and administrative expenses for as compared to principally resulted from a higher level of personnel costs associated with the increased number of administrative employees and sales and technical support employees in the company s pc operations and  to a lesser extent  increased legal costs associated with the development and resolution of product and process technology rights and contingencies  advertising costs for the company s pc operations and depreciation expense resulting from the addition of new computer equipment in late and in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses for reflect an approximate million pretax gain from the disposal of equipment  compared to a million pretax gain in during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company charged operations with a million accrual relating to revisions of estimates for selling costs associated with sales of pc systems 
the higher level of selling  general and administrative expenses for as compared to principally resulted from a higher level of personnel costs associated with the company s profit sharing programs  an increased number of administrative employees and  to a lesser extent  increased advertising costs and credit card processing fees associated with the increased level of sales from the company s pc operations 
such increases were partially offset by a reduction in legal fees compared to primarily resulting from the company s resolution of product and process technology rights contingencies 
research and development change change dollars in millions research and development as a of net sales research and development expenses vary primarily with the number of wafers and personnel dedicated to new product and process development 
the company s research and development efforts are currently focused principally on further development of shrink versions of the meg dram 
development efforts are also focused on meg and meg sdram and a move from 
mu process technology to 
mu and 
mu process technology 
other research and development efforts are currently devoted to design of the meg  meg and gig drams  and design and development of new technologies including remote intelligent communications products and flash semiconductor memory products 
income tax provision change change dollars in millions income tax provision the effective tax rate for was  which primarily reflects the statutory corporate tax rate and the net effect of state taxation 
the effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
the changes in the effective tax rates were principally due to the change in the mix of income among taxing jurisdictions and the utilization of state tax credits as a percentage of pretax income 
state income taxes have been reduced by state tax credits 
as of june  mei was not consolidated with mti for federal income tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources as of august   the company had cash and liquid investments totaling million  representing a decrease of million during approximately million of the company s consolidated cash and liquid investments were held by mei 
cash generated from operations by mei is not readily available or anticipated to be available to finance operations or other expenditures of mti 
the company s principal sources of liquidity during were cash flows from operations of  million  equipment financing of million and net borrowings under the company s bank credit agreements of million 
the principal uses of funds in were  million for property  plant and equipment and million for repayments of equipment contracts and long term debt 
cash flows from operations for fiscal were slightly higher than cash flows from operations in fiscal cash flows from operations are significantly affected by average selling prices and variable cost per megabit for the company s semiconductor memory products 
for example  the company estimates that each reduction in average selling prices of per megabit reduced the company s cash flows by approximately million in fiscal in the future  to the extent that the company s level of production increases  similar price decreases may have an even more significant impact 
in  the rate of decline in average selling prices for semiconductor memory products surpassed the rate at which the company was able to decrease costs per megabit  and as a result the company s cash flows were significantly adversely affected  particularly in the second half of fiscal in the event that average selling prices were to continue to decline faster than the rate at which the company is able to decrease costs of production  the company may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to sustain operations 
as of august   the company had contractual commitments extending through calendar year of approximately million for equipment purchases and approximately million for the construction of facilities 
the company believes continuing investments in manufacturing technology  facilities and capital equipment  research and development  and product and process technology are necessary to support future growth  achieve operating efficiencies  and enhance product quality 
the company anticipates that it will need to spend approximately million in fiscal to continue its capacity enhancement program 
however  due to current market conditions the company may not have sufficient internal sources of liquidity to continue its capacity enhancement program 
as a result  in order to continue its capacity enhancement program as planned  the company may need to secure additional financing from external sources 
as of year end  the company was evaluating a number of financing alternatives 
there can be no assurance that external sources of liquidity will be available to fund the company s ongoing operations or expansion  diversification and capital improvements in accordance with the company s capacity enhancement program 
the failure to obtain external sources of liquidity would hinder the company s ability to make continued investments in its capacity enhancement program  which could materially adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
during the third quarter of  the company established a million revolving credit agreement expiring in may the credit facility was amended in the fourth quarter of to reduce the total potential borrowing to million and to modify the covenants to reflect changes in industry conditions 
as of august   the company had borrowings of million outstanding under the facility 
the amended agreement contains certain restrictive covenants and conditions including a borrowing base tied to the company s accounts receivable  an earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda covenant  and a maximum net loss covenant 
the company was not in compliance with the ebitda covenant at the end of the third fiscal quarter  at which time the company obtained a waiver 
as of august  the company was in compliance with all bank covenants and conditions 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be able to meet the terms of the covenants and conditions or be able to borrow the full amount of the credit facility 
the company s majority owned subsidiary  mei  has an unsecured revolving credit facility with two financial institutions providing for borrowings of up to million 
as of august   there were no borrowings outstanding under the agreement 
borrowings are limited based on the amount of mei s eligible receivables 
as of august   mei was eligible to borrow the entire million pursuant to the agreement 
certain factors in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k  the following are important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement made by or on behalf of the company 
volatility of the semiconductor memory industry  recent market conditions the semiconductor memory industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent product introductions and enhancements  difficult product transitions  relatively short product life cycles  rapid changes in market prices and volatile market conditions 
historically  the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical  particularly in the market for dram products  which are the company s primary semiconductor memory products 
the selling prices for the company s semiconductor memory products fluctuate significantly with changes in the balance of supply and demand for these commodity products 
market conditions through the end of fiscal indicated that growth in worldwide supply outpaced growth in demand 
many of the company s competitors have recently added significant capacity for the production of semiconductor memory components 
the amount of capacity placed into production and future yield improvements by the company s competitors could dramatically increase worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and increase downward pressure on pricing 
average sales prices for meg dram  the company s primary product  declined approximately from early december to late august  while industry wide average sales prices for meg dram products declined approximately for the same period 
there can be no assurance that the rate of decline of average sales prices will lessen or that market conditions will improve in the foreseeable future 
these declines have had a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
further declines in average sales prices for the company s dram products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
dependence on personal computer industry  customer concentration drams are the most widely used semiconductor memory component in most personal computer systems 
approximately of the company s sales of semiconductor memory products during the fourth quarter of fiscal were into the pc or peripheral markets 
the company believes that the rate of growth in overall worldwide sales of pc systems has declined and may remain below prior years growth rates for the foreseeable future 
in addition  the growth rate in the amount of semiconductor memory per pc system may decrease in the future as well 
should demand for pc systems decrease or the growth rate in the amount of memory per pc system decrease  growth in demand for semiconductor memory could also decrease  placing further downward pressure on selling prices for the company s semiconductor memory products 
the company is unable to predict changes in industry supply  major customer inventory management strategies or end user demand  which are significant factors influencing pricing for the company s semiconductor memory products 
approximately of the company s net sales for fiscal were to the company s top five customers 
as a result of this concentration of the company s customer base  loss or cancellation of business from any of these major pc system customers  significant changes in scheduled deliveries to any of these customers or decreases in the prices of products sold to any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
certain of mti s key semiconductor memory customers compete directly with mei in the sale of pc systems  and there can be no assurance that in the future such customers will  as a result of this competition with mei  continue to purchase the company s semiconductor memory products 
a loss of any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
fluctuations in operating results the company s past operating results have been  and its future operating results may be  subject to annual and quarterly fluctuations as a result of a wide variety of factors  including  without limitation  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor memory industry  the introduction and announcement of new products and process technologies by the company or its competitors  pricing pressures  the speed in which the company reduces costs for any particular new product  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  changes in product mix  the cost and availability of raw materials and general worldwide economic conditions 
during the three fiscal quarters ended august   dram market conditions were characterized by excess supply over demand  resulting in declining prices 
any additional price declines for memory products in the future  either due to increased supply or decreased demand  could have an adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company s operating results are also significantly impacted by the operating results of its consolidated subsidiaries  in particular mei 
as dram prices have fallen and as unit shipments of pc systems have increased  mti s consolidated results of operations have been increasingly affected by mei s results of operations 
while sales of pc systems  less sales to mei of mti s semiconductor memory products included therein  constituted approximately of mti s total net sales for fiscal  such sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal constituted approximately of mti s total net sales 
mei s past operating results have been  and its future operating results may be  subject to fluctuations  on a quarterly and an annual basis  as a result of a wide variety of factors  including  but not limited to  the timing of new product introductions by mei and its competitors  fluctuating market pricing for computer and semiconductor memory products  industry competition  fluctuating component costs  inventory obsolescence  critical component availability  seasonal cycles common in the personal computer industry  seasonal government purchasing cycles  the effect of product reviews and industry awards  changes in product mix  manufacturing and production constraints and the timing of orders from and shipments to oem customers 
manufacturing risks and volume production the manufacturing of the company s semiconductor memory products is a complex process and involves a number of precise steps  including wafer fabrication  assembly in a variety of packages  burn in and final test 
efficient production of the company s semiconductor memory products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques 
the company is engaged in ongoing efforts to enhance its production processes to reduce the die size of existing products and increase capacity 
the company has completed the conversion of fab iii to process inch wafers and is continuing the conversion of fab i to process inch wafers  with completion anticipated prior to the end of calendar year there can be no assurance that the company will not experience an interruption of its manufacturing processes or experience decreases in manufacturing yield as a result of conversions of wafer process technology 
wafer fabrication occurs in a highly controlled  clean environment to minimize dust and other yield and quality limiting contaminants 
despite stringent manufacturing controls  equipment does not consistently perform flawlessly and minute impurities  defects in the photo masks  or other difficulties in the process may cause a substantial percentage of the wafers to be rejected or individual circuits to be nonfunctional 
the success of the company s manufacturing operation will be largely dependent on its ability to minimize such impurities and to maximize its yield of acceptable high quality circuits 
in addition  the company s manufacturing yields could be adversely affected in the event of future power outages similar to the power outages that have affected the pacific northwest during calendar year there can be no assurance that the company will not experience decreases in manufacturing yields as a result of any such manufacturing problems 
completion of mti s semiconductor manufacturing facility in lehi  utah is on indefinite hold as a result of the decline in average selling prices for semiconductor memory products 
as of august   mti had invested approximately million in the lehi facility 
the cost to complete the lehi facility is estimated to approximate billion 
there can be no assurance that mti will be able to fund the completion of the lehi manufacturing facility 
the failure by mti to complete the facility would likely result in mti being required to write off all or a portion of the facility s cost  which  if required  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
in addition  in the event that market conditions improve  there can be no assurance that mti will successfully commence manufacturing at the lehi facility in a manner that enables it to take advantage of the improved market conditions 
any such failure to respond to improved market conditions could have a material adverse effect on mti s business and results of operations 
as a result of the significant investment in facilities and equipment associated with the production of dram products and the industry s history of declining average sales prices as products mature  the company must produce and sell its dram products in significant volume and continue to reduce per megabit manufacturing costs in order to achieve profitability 
there can be no assurance that revenues derived from sales of mti s products will be sufficient to cover current fixed costs 
in order to achieve profitability  the company must continue to significantly increase its output of semiconductor memory 
liquidity and future capital needs dram manufacturers generally have substantial ongoing capital requirements to maintain or increase manufacturing capacity 
historically  the company has reinvested substantially all of its cash flow from operations in capacity expansion and improvement programs 
the company s cash flows from operations are significantly affected by average selling prices and variable cost per megabit for the company s semiconductor memory products 
for example  the company estimates that each reduction in average selling price of per megabit reduced the company s cash flows by approximately million in fiscal in the future  to the extent that the company s level of production increases  similar price decreases may have an even more significant impact 
in  the rate of decline in average selling prices for semiconductor memory products surpassed the rate at which the company was able to decrease costs per megabit  and as a result the company s cash flows were significantly adversely affected  particularly in the second half of fiscal in the event that average selling prices were to continue to decline faster than the rate at which the company is able to decrease costs of production  the company may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to sustain operations 
the company anticipates that it will need to spend approximately million in fiscal to continue its capacity enhancement program 
however  due to current market conditions the company may not have sufficient internal sources of liquidity to continue its capacity enhancement program 
as a result  in order to continue its capacity enhancement program as planned  the company may need to secure additional financing from external sources 
as of year end  the company was evaluating a number of financing alternatives 
there can be no assurance that external sources of liquidity will be available to fund the company s ongoing operations or the company s capacity enhancement program 
in addition  cash generated from operations by mei is not readily available or anticipated to be available to finance operations or other expenditures of mti 
the failure to obtain financing would hinder the company s ability to make continued investments in its capacity enhancement program  which could materially adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
the company was not in compliance with one of its financial covenants under its revolving credit agreement at the end of the third fiscal quarter of  at which time the company obtained a waiver 
as of august  the company was in compliance with its covenants and conditions under the revolving credit agreement 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be able to meet the terms of the covenants and conditions or be able to borrow the full amount of the credit facility 
product development from time to time  the company has experienced volatility in its manufacturing yields  as it has encountered difficulties in ramping shrink versions of existing devices or new generation devices to commercial volumes 
the company is continuing the transition of its primary semiconductor memory products from the relatively mature meg dram to the meg dram 
the conversion to the meg dram is expected to occur in late calendar year the company is developing various sdram products which are expected to be ready for volume production in fiscal  as the company expects a gradual transition by computer manufacturers to faster types of dram based main memory  including but not limited to sdram  over the next several years 
during periods of transition to new generation products  including the transition to the meg dram  the company s gross margins have been adversely affected and there can be no assurance that they will not continue to be adversely affected as a result of the continuing transition to the meg dram or the transition to the sdram product 
rapid technological change and intense price competition place a premium on both new product and new process development efforts 
the company s continued ability to compete in the semiconductor memory market will depend in part on its ability to continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes  of which there can be no assurance 
research and development expenses vary primarily with the number of wafers and personnel dedicated to new product and process development 
the company s research and development efforts are currently focused principally on further development of shrink versions of the meg dram 
development efforts are also focused on meg and meg sdram and a move from 
mu process technology to 
mu and 
mu process technology 
other research and development efforts are currently devoted to design of the meg  meg and gig drams  and design and development of new technologies including remote intelligent communications products and flash semiconductor memory products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in shrinking the meg dram as fast as its competitors  or that the company s competitors will not be able to develop and offer meg or meg dram products before the company is able to bring comparable products to market 
the company s ability to reduce costs per megabit of its semiconductor memory products is largely dependent on its ability to design and develop new generation products and shrink versions of existing products and its ability to ramp such products at acceptable rates to acceptable yields  of which there can be no assurance 
in the event that the company is unable to decrease costs per megabit for semiconductor memory products at a rate equal to the rate of decline in selling prices for such products  the company s business and results of operations will be adversely impacted 
competition the company s semiconductor memory operations experience intense competition from a number of substantially larger foreign and domestic companies  including fujitsu  ltd  hitachi  ltd  hyundai electronics  co  ltd  mitsubishi electronic corp  motorola  inc  nec corp  samsung semiconductor  inc  lg semicon  texas instruments incorporated and toshiba corporation 
the company has captured only a small percentage of the semiconductor memory market and may be at a disadvantage in competing against larger manufacturers with significantly greater capital resources or manufacturing capacities  larger engineer and employee bases  larger portfolios of intellectual property  and more diverse product lines that provide cash flows counter cyclical to fluctuations in semiconductor memory operations 
the company s larger competitors also have long term advantages over mti in research and new product development and in their ability to withstand periodic downturns in the semiconductor memory market 
the company believes that its competition has sufficient resources and manufacturing capacity to influence market pricing 
many of the company s competitors have recently added new wafer fabrication facilities  significantly increasing worldwide capacity for the production of semiconductor memory products  resulting in downward price pressures on semiconductor memory products 
intellectual property matters the semiconductor industry has experienced a substantial amount of litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
in the future  litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to the company  to protect trade secrets or know how owned by the company  or to defend the company against claimed infringement of the rights of others 
the company has from time to time received  and may in the future receive  communications alleging that the technology used by the company in the manufacture of some or all of its products may infringe on product or process technology rights held by others 
the company has entered into a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements with third parties  some of which require one time or periodic royalty payments 
it may be necessary or advantageous in the future for the company to obtain additional patent licenses or to renew existing license agreements  some of which expire at the end of calendar year the company is unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on terms acceptable to the company 
failure to obtain or renew such licenses could result in litigation 
any determination that the company s manufacturing processes or products have infringed on the product or process rights held by others could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
further  adverse determinations could result in the company s loss of proprietary rights  subject the company to significant liabilities to third parties  require the company to seek licenses from third parties or prevent the company from manufacturing or selling its products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company intends to continue to pursue patent  trade secret and mask work protection for its semiconductor process technologies and designs 
to that end  the company has obtained certain patents and patent licenses and intends to continue to seek patents on its inventions and manufacturing processes  as appropriate 
the process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive  and there is no assurance that patents will be issued from currently pending or future applications or that  if patents are issued  they will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to the company 
in particular  there can be no assurance that any patents held by the company will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
the company also relies on trade secret protection for its technology  in part through confidentiality agreements with its employees  consultants and third parties 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that the company will have adequate remedies for any breach or that the company s trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by others 
in addition  the laws of certain territories in which the company s products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold may not protect the company s products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
state taxation several states have enacted legislation which would require out of state direct marketers to collect and remit sales and use taxes based on certain limited contacts with the state 
taxation authorities in certain states have  from time to time  solicited information from the company to determine whether the company has sufficient contacts with such states to require payment of sales and use taxes on its pc systems sold to customers in those states 
the company could be required to pay sales and use taxes and income and franchise taxes related to the company s operations in prior periods  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
in addition  the company may be increasing its contacts and presence in various states as it pursues its business strategies 
as a result of its contacts  the company may be required to collect and remit sales and use taxes in the future  which could materially adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
dependence on limited sources of supply raw materials utilized by the company s semiconductor manufacturing operation generally must meet exacting product specifications 
the company generally uses multiple sources of supply  but there are only a limited number of suppliers capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet the company s specifications 
additionally  the availability of raw materials may decline due to the overall increase in world wide semiconductor manufacturing 
although shortages have occurred from time to time and lead times in the industry have been extended on occasion  to date the company has not experienced any significant interruption in operations as a result of a difficulty in obtaining raw materials for its semiconductor manufacturing operations 
interruption of any one raw material source could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
dependence on key personnel the company is dependent upon a limited number of key management and technical personnel 
in addition  the company s future success will depend in part upon its ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel 
the company competes for such personnel with other companies  academic institutions  government entities and other organizations 
in recent periods  the company has experienced increased recruitment of its existing personnel by other employers 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in hiring or retaining qualified personnel 
on september   mti announced that tyler a 
lowrey  previously the chief operations officer and a director of mti  had resigned as a director and will no longer serve as chief operations officer 
there can be no assurance that any of mti s key personnel will remain employed by mti 
any loss of key personnel or the inability to hire or retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
environmental regulations the company is subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations related to the storage  use  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in its manufacturing process 
increasing public attention has been focused on the environmental impact of semiconductor manufacturing operations 
there can be no assurance that changes in environmental regulations will not impose the need for additional capital equipment or other requirements 
any failure by the company to control the use of  or adequately to restrict the discharge of  hazardous substances under present or future regulations could subject mti to substantial liability or could cause its manufacturing operations to be suspended 
such liability or suspension of manufacturing operations could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations
