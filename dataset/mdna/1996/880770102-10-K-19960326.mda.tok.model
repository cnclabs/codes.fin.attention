each of the major product lines of the company semiconductor test systems  circuit board test systems  telecommunications test systems  and backplane connection systems contributed to the increase in sales 
sales of semiconductor test systems grew as semiconductor manufacturers continued to add capacity in response to rising demand for their products 
this capacity expansion was evidenced by a number of new semiconductor manufacturing plants coming on line 
telecommunications test systems sales increased primarily from the growing installation of telephone line test equipment at deutsche telekom in germany 
sales of backplane connection systems increased as a result of greater penetration into the company s high technology commercial customer base 
circuit board test systems sales increased 
as a result of the increase in sales  income from continuing operations more than doubled in  increasing million to million 
incoming orders grew faster than sales in  increasing to billion 
the increase in orders  like the increase in sales  was primarily due to increases in semiconductor test systems orders  which increased 
additionally  circuit board test systems orders increased by due in large part to us government contracts to supply electronic test equipment for the b stealth bomber and for the navy s cass program 
orders for backplane connection systems and telecommunications test systems declined and  respectively 
as a result of the overall increase in orders  the company s backlog grew in  finishing the year at million 
cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  decreased from in to in the improvement was primarily the result of increased utilization of the fixed and semi variable components of the company s overhead structure 
in addition  there was a favorable change in mix as sales of backplane connection systems  whose product margins are generally lower than those of electronic test systems  were lower as a percentage of total company sales 
engineering and development expenses  as a percentage of sales  declined from in to in  as these expenses did not increase at the same rate as sales 
the dollar amount of these expenses grew million in as a result of increased investment in new product development of semiconductor test systems 
selling and administrative expenses decreased to of sales in compared with of sales in  as the dollar volume of these expenses grew by while sales increased 
in  the company incurred merger expenses of million consisting primarily of professional fees related to its merger with megatest 
interest income increased in to million due to an increase in the company s average invested balances and higher interest rates 
interest expense increased from million in to million in as a result of increased borrowing at megatest prior to the merger 
the company s effective tax rate was in compared with in the company utilized certain tax credit and net loss carryforward amounts in to operate below the united states statutory rate of 
in  the effective rate increased as the tax credit and loss carryforwards were no longer available and certain merger expenses were nondeductible for income tax purposes 
the company expects its tax rate to approximate the statutory rate of in compared to sales increased in  to million 
sales increased in each of the company s major product groups 
the increase in sales was primarily due to a increase in sales of semiconductor test systems and to a increase in sales of backplane connection systems 
sales of semiconductor test systems increased as semiconductor manufacturers added capacity to meet rising demand for their products  while sales of backplane connection systems increased due to growth in demand for the high technology products of the company s commercial customer base 
sales of circuit board test systems and telecommunications test systems increased and  respectively  in compared to income from continuing operations increased by million from to on a sales increase of million 
incoming orders grew faster than sales in  increasing to million 
the increase in orders  like the increase in sales  was primarily due to increases in semiconductor test systems and backplane connection systems 
orders for circuit board test systems and telecommunications test systems declined in as a result of the overall increase in orders  the company s backlog grew during to million 
cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  decreased from of sales in to in the improvement was a result of the following two factors 
first  the increase in sales volume permitted increased utilization of certain fixed and semi variable components of the company s overhead structure 
second  there was an unfavorable change in mix as sales of backplane connection systems  whose product margins are generally lower than those of electronic test systems  were higher as a percentage of total company sales 
engineering and development expenses  as a percentage of sales  declined in  compared with the dollar amount of these expenses grew million in as a result of increased investment in new product development of semiconductor test systems 
selling and administrative expenses declined from of sales to as the dollar amount of these expenses grew only while sales increased by 
interest income increased million in as a result of a million increase in the company s average invested balances during the year and as a result of higher interest rates 
interest expense decreased million in as a result of the company s retirement of its convertible subordinated debentures in the fourth quarter of the company s effective tax rate was in compared to in the company was able to operate with an effective tax rate below the united states statutory rate of as a result of the utilization of tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards 
the combined financial results also reflect the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  which resulted in a one time million credit 
the one time credit resulted from the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits of deductible temporary differences and operating loss carryforwards 
in connection with the retirement of the company s outstanding convertible subordinated debentures  the company incurred  in the fourth quarter of  an extraordinary charge of million  net of income taxes  for the costs of the redemption premium of and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balance grew million in following an increase of million in cash flow generated from operations was million in and million in cash of million in and million in was generated from the sale of stock to employees under the company s stock option and stock purchase plans 
a secondary public offering of megatest common stock  completed in october prior to megatest s merger with the company  provided million in additional cash in cash was used to fund additions to property  plant and equipment of million in and million in the company increased its investment in marketable securities by million in in  the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of  shares of the company s stock on the open market 
cash of million in and million in was utilized for this buyback of the company s stock 
long term debt increased by million in after a reduction of million in the increase resulted from borrowing at megatest prior to the merger 
the company believes its cash and cash equivalents balance of million  together with other sources of funds  including marketable securities of million  cash flow generated from operations  and the available borrowing capacity of million under its line of credit agreement  will be sufficient to meet working capital and capital expenditure requirements in in october  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  statement 
statement encourages  but does not require  the recognition of compensation expense for grants of stock  stock options  and other equity instruments based upon new fair value accounting rules the recognition method 
companies that choose not to adopt the recognition method may continue to apply the existing accounting principles however  statement requires companies that choose not to adopt the new fair value accounting rules to disclose pro forma net income and earnings per share amounts under the new fair value method the disclosure method 
the company plans to adopt the disclosure method in and will report the pro forma effect of applying fair value accounting rules to grants of stock based awards on net income and earnings per share in its financial statements 
inflation has not had a significant long term impact on earnings 
if there was inflation  the company s efforts to cover cost increases with price increases could be frustrated in the short term by its relatively high backlog 
certain factors that may affect future results from time to time  information provided by the company  statements made by its employees or information included in its filings with the securities and exchange commission including this form k and the company s annual report to shareholders may contain statements which are not historical facts  so called forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
in particular  statements in item business relating to the company s market share position and the delivery time of unfilled orders  and in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relating to the sufficiency of capital to meet working capital and capital expenditure requirements may be forward looking statements 
the company s actual future results may differ significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below 
each of these factors  and others  are discussed from time to time in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the company s future results are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties 
the company s business and results of operations depend in significant part upon capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors  which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products incorporating semiconductors 
historically  the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of over supply  which often have had a severe effect on the semiconductor industry s demand for test equipment  including systems manufactured and marketed by the company 
the company believes that the markets for newer generations of semiconductors will also be subject to similar fluctuations 
in recent years  the semiconductor industry has experienced significant growth which  in turn  has caused significant growth in the capital equipment industry 
there can be no assurance that such growth can be sustained 
in addition  any factor adversely affecting the semiconductor industry or particular segments within the semiconductor industry may adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
also  the company relies on certain intellectual property protections to preserve its intellectual property rights 
any invalidation of the company s intellectual property rights or lengthy and expensive defense of those rights could have a material adverse affect on the company 
the development of new technologies  commercialization of those technologies into products  and market acceptance and customer demand for those products is critical to the company s success 
successful product development and introduction depends upon a number of factors  including new product selection  development of competitive products by competitors  timely and efficient completion of product design  timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes and product performance at customer locations 
the company faces substantial competition throughout the world  primarily from electronic test systems manufacturers located in the united states  europe and japan  as well as several of the company s customers 
some of these competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources to pursue engineering  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of their products 
certain of the company s competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which may be considered equal or superior to those currently offered by the company 
the company expects its competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics 
new product introductions by competitors could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of the company s existing products 
moreover  increased competitive pressure could lead to intensified price based competition  which could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company derives a significant portion of its total revenues from international sales 
international sales are subject to significant risks  including unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements and policy changes affecting the company s markets  changes in tariffs  exchange rates and other barriers  political and economic instability  difficulties in accounts receivable collection  difficulties in managing distributors and representatives  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  difficulties in protecting the company s intellectual property and potentially adverse tax consequences 
the company s quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues and profitability  including competitive pressures on selling prices  the timing and cancellation of customer orders  changes in product mix  the company s ability to introduce new products and technologies on a timely basis  introduction of products and technologies by the company s competitors  market acceptance of the company s and its competitors products  the level of orders received which can be shipped in a quarter  and the timing of investments in research and development 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  the company may experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect its business  financial condition  operating results and stock price
