at year ends and  the gross notional amount of off balance sheet contracts used in asset and liability management was approximately billion and billion  respectively 
the market value of these off balance sheet contracts was a loss of approximately million at year end and a gain of million at year end at december   the net effect of these hedging transactions decreased the net interest rate differential by basis points  compared to a decrease of basis points at year end net interest income increased million  or  to million in  compared to million in this increase was due to yields on interest earning assets rising faster than the cost of interest bearing funds during the year

the reduction in net interest margin resulting from this program was partially offset by earnings attributable to the increased margin from retail funds that have not increased in cost as rapidly as the rise in market rates

the corporation s strategy includes providing financial services to meet the changing needs of its customers 
the level of activity and revenues related to off balance sheet activities was lower in than in the declines in each of the last two years  when compared to the respective prior year  were attributable primarily to lower levels of customer activity in foreign exchange and derivative products reflecting generally reduced activity in global markets due to the high level of market uncertainty that existed during this period

total operating expenses before restructuring and related charges were million in  million in and million in in addition  the corporation converted the financial reporting of factors and its operations in chile and uruguay to a current basis in the fourth quarter of the conversion resulted in a one time increase to expense of million for the year 
in  a similar conversion of financial reporting of the corporation s hong kong and singapore operations resulted in a one time increase to expenses of million 
other increases in total operating expenses in are attributable primarily to the corporation s expansion into new business areas during the year 
this expansion reflects a full year of operating expenses related to the acquisitions of bullion banking operations  safracorp california and bank leumi le israel canada  as well as the addition of staff in trading  domestic private banking and various support areas 
salaries and employee benefits salaries and employee benefits were million in  million in and million in the level of salaries and benefits was virtually unchanged between and  due to the implementation of project excellence plus  with resultant staff reductions throughout the corporation and lower provisions for employee benefits 
increased levels of staff in new businesses contributed to higher salary expense in employee benefits expenses declined in from  as increased costs for medical  pension and payroll taxes were offset by lower incentive based compensation 
occupancy occupancy costs were million in  million in and million in the increase in is primarily attributable to increased rent expense 
the increase is primarily attributable to the new business areas mentioned above and additional costs incurred for home office expansion 
other expenses all other expenses were million in  million in and million in communication and equipment expenses represent a substantial portion of other expenses and amounted to million  million and million in  and  respectively 
also  professional fees  consisting of consulting  external legal and audit fees  declined to million in from million in and million in all other expenses include premiums for deposit insurance paid to the fdic  which were million in  compared to million in and million in the decline in this expense in was the result of a reduction of the premium rate paid for fdic insurance 
other expenses in also included the effect of adopting statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 which requires that pledges to make charitable contributions be recognized in the period that the funds are unconditionally pledged 
this change in the method of accounting for charitable contributions resulted in a million  one time charge 
costs applicable to other real estate in declined by million from the million recorded in  following an increase from million in sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  this sfas establishes the recognition and measurement criteria for impairment losses on long lived assets  certain identifiable intangibles and goodwill related to those assets to be held and used and for long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be disposed of 
assets to be held and used are reduced to their estimated fair value if the carrying amount is not expected to be recovered 
assets to be disposed of are reduced to the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
the adoption of this sfas is not expected to have a material effect on the corporation s results of operations 
total applicable income taxes total applicable income taxes  which give effect to the taxable equivalent adjustment  declined million in to million  following an increase of million between and the ratio of total applicable income taxes to income before taxes was in  in and in the decline in total applicable income taxes and the lower effective income tax rate in was attributable to lower earnings caused by the provision for restructuring charges and fluctuations in the level of income subject to federal  state and local income taxes 
net income applicable to common stock net income applicable to common stock was million in  compared to the record million in and million in on a fully diluted basis  earnings per common share were in  in and in dividends declared on the corporation s issues of preferred stock and the average annual rates paid were as follows million in at  million in at and million in at 
liability and asset management changes in the level of interest rates and the relationship between rates can affect net interest income 
in general  the corporation s on and off balance sheet assets are selected to match both the maturity and interest rate sensitivity of the corporation s on and off balance sheet liabilities 
the structure of the corporation s liabilities determines the structure of its assets 
this practice has two important implications 
first  liquidity requirements can be met more readily because a large proportion of assets mature when liabilities mature 
second  the impact of changes in the levels of interest rates on the corporation is reduced because assets and liabilities have approximately the same interest rate sensitivity 
diversification is another principle employed in the management of liabilities and assets 
the corporation is active in international banking and  in managing this activity  diversifies risks among many countries and counterparties throughout the world 
liabilities  which are mostly interest bearing deposits and other purchased funds  are obtained from both domestic and international sources 
these sources of funds represent a wide range of depositors  mostly individuals  and various types of deposits 
the corporation also raises funds from institutional and individual investors with a variety of marketable instruments 
the diversification of the corporation s funding sources provides stability of the funding base 
from time to time  the corporation s management may decide deliberately to mismatch on and off balance sheet liabilities and assets in a strategic gap position as a means of managing net interest income 
interest rate sensitivity gaps occur when interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets differ in repricing dates and anticipated maturities 
such decisions reflect management s views on the direction of interest rates and general market conditions 
the gap position is established with marketable securities of high credit quality in liquid markets and is carefully monitored by management 
the corporation uses off balance sheet interest rate derivatives such as interest rate swaps  caps  options and forwards in managing its exposure to interest rate sensitivity resulting from its gap position 
the corporation monitors the near term interest rate sensitivity of its liability and asset positions by quantifying the earnings at risk to simulated changes in interest rates 
a net interest income simulation model measures this sensitivity 
this model utilizes monte carlo simulation  a statistical technique that allows the corporation to build variability around current market conditions 
inputs include the maturity and repricing characteristics of the corporation s on and off balance sheet liability and asset positions as well as assumptions on interest rates  asset prepayments  inter bank spreads and deposit growth 
given the assumptions used  the model s output projects the variance in net interest income over the next year 
the board of directors adopted a limit of of annual net interest income at risk  based on this measured interest rate sensitivity 
results are periodically presented to the asset and liability management committee and to the board of directors 
simulation modeling gives a broader view of net interest income variability than does traditional gap analysis  allowing the corporation to capture more variables that are interest rate sensitive and to explore interrelationships between variables 
to complement the simulation model  the corporation employs traditional gap analysis to provide information on longer term interest rate sensitivity 
the table below illustrates the corporation s interest rate sensitivity gap position at december  and the interest rate sensitivity gap  which is the difference between interest earning assets and liabilities  is presented by repricing period  based upon maturity or first repricing opportunity  along with a cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap 
factors considered are the contractual terms of the underlying obligations  including off balance sheet items such as interest rate swaps and caps  as well as management s estimates of prepayment patterns of mortgage backed securities and interest sensitivity of core deposits 
it is important to note that the table indicates a position at a specific point in time and may not be reflective of positions at other times during the year or in subsequent periods 
major changes in the gap position can be  and are  made promptly as market outlooks change 
in addition  significant variations in interest rate sensitivity may exist within the repricing periods presented in which the corporation has interest rate positions 
repricing period at december  after one after three after seven within year but within years but within years but within after one year three years seven years ten years ten years in millions asset liability interest rate sensitiv ity gap  asset liability cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap  repricing period at december  after one after three after seven within year but within years but within years but within after one year three years seven years ten years ten years in millions asset liability interest rate sensitiv ity gap   asset liability cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap in  the corporation undertook a program to fix its liability costs over a five year time horizon 
changes in interest sensitivity gap positions from to are reflective of the aging of these liability positions  with some balances moving from the year repricing period into the year period 
in addition  towards the end of  the corporation purchased long term assets in order to hedge the anticipated addition of long term deposits in connection with the acquisition of bbi 
this resulted in an increase in the balances  principally in the year repricing period 
the following table presents information related to the expected maturities and weighted average interest rates to be received or paid on the interest rate swap portfolio and other instruments used in asset liability management

the international private banking group establishes relationships with high net worth individuals  on a worldwide basis  who value safety for their funds 
the retail area s customers are from the new york city metropolitan area and florida branch systems of the bank and the california branches of rbc 
in addition to its new york city branches  the bank also has a retail operation in southern florida with eight branches 
rbc is an independent banking subsidiary  servicing the california market with three banking offices in los angeles county  that focuses on domestic private banking and mortgage banking 
its customers invest in a diverse mix of retail time and savings deposits of both short term and long term maturities 
the institutional area s customers are pension funds  money market funds and corporate cash accounts 
the corporation has been successful in selling long term deposits to institutional and corporate investors  thereby generating a source of long term funds 
the corporation continues to invest substantial resources in staff and product development for its domestic private banking group that was formed in the latter part of it is the corporation s view that this specialized group will provide a fourth area with a focus on general banking and lending  trusts and estates  custody and investment management relationships for high net worth individuals

this customer base is a stable source of funding for the corporation 
total average deposits in foreign offices rose to billion in  after increasing to billion in from billion in the following table presents information on the distribution  by type  of the corporation s foreign deposits at december in each of the last three years

the corporation seeks to benefit from favorable movements in the market price of short sales by purchasing the required security at a lower price in the future 
trading account liabilities also include payables for precious metals and unrealized losses related to interest rate swaps  options and other derivative financial instruments  and related premiums received  which are utilized in trading activities 
trading account liabilities were billion at year end  billion at year end and million in in each of the last two years unrealized losses represent a substantial portion of these liabilities in accordance with the reporting requirements of accounting interpretation fin no 
this interpretation requires  among other things  that unrealized gains and losses on forward  swap  option and other financial instruments  resulting primarily from the marking to estimated market value of trading instruments  be reported on a gross basis  except when right of set off criteria are met or a legally enforceable netting agreement with a counterparty exists 
the adoption of this interpretation has resulted in the corporation reporting increased levels of average total assets and total liabilities to reflect the gross up effect of reporting these balances 
short term borrowings the corporation s short term funding sources include federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements  commercial paper issuances  local borrowings in overseas operations and interest bearing precious metals balances

a significant portion of the corporation s interest earning assets are invested in us government agency securities  including mortgage backed and other asset backed securities 
international banking activities also comprise a substantial portion of the corporation s business and involve factors other than the normal credit risk associated with domestic lending 
in determining the creditworthiness of international borrowers  the economic  political and social conditions that affect the borrower s ability to repay obligations must be taken into account 
through country and political analysis and diversification of activities across a wide geographic distribution and within exposure limits set on a country by country basis  the corporation reduces the unique risks of extending international credit 
the corporation endeavors to reflect risk in its pricing policy

average loans in foreign offices declined to billion in  from billion in which was an increase of billion over at year end  the domestic loan portfolio consisted of billion of one four family residential mortgages and billion of commercial real estate loans 
the following tables present loan portfolio information  excluding consumer loans and residential mortgage loans totaling billion  related to maturity distribution and interest rate sensitivity  based on scheduled repayments at december  due after one due in one year through due after year or less five years five years total in thousands domestic commercial and other     real estate commercial     banks and other financial institutions   broker loans   total domestic loans     foreign commercial and other     real estate commercial     banks and other financial institutions     governments and government agencies     broker loans   total foreign loans     total loans     at december   of the loan portfolio presented above was due in one year or less  compared to in of the total loan portfolio due in one year or less  were domestic loans and were foreign loans 
the following table is an analysis  at december   of loans due after one year which have fixed interest rates and those with interest rates that vary directly in relation to the corporation s reference rate  an international money market rate or some other similar variable base rate 
loans with variable rates amounting to billion are due after one year 
fixed rate variable rate total in thousands loans due after one year domestic loans    foreign loans    allowance for possible loan losses the corporation s policy is to maintain an allowance for loan losses that is adequate to absorb all inherent credit losses in the corporation s loan portfolio and other potential credit exposures 
inherent losses are unconfirmed losses that probably exist  based upon known information regarding the credit quality and portfolio characteristics prevailing as of the date of the evaluation 
if future events confirm these losses  these amounts will be charged off against the allowance for loan losses 
the corporation performs a comprehensive and consistently applied analysis of the various factors that affect collectibility that is in accordance with regulatory guidance 
the process is complex and includes several different analyses of credit exposures 
management analyzes its loan portfolio by three main components individually significant loans  homogeneous groups or pools of loans and other segmentations of the portfolio into pools of loans with similar risk characteristics  such as risk classification  type of loan  industry group  collateral  size and maturity and country risk characteristics 
the individually significant loans represent larger  more problematic loans which are individually assessed as to collectibility 
for homogeneous portfolios  principally the consumer retail portfolio  the corporation utilizes the prior year s loss experience to estimate an amount necessary to provide for the upcoming twelve months of expected losses 
for the other segmentations of the portfolio  historical loss rates are calculated for loans with similar characteristics 
these loss rates are updated quarterly and are based upon the loss experience incurred for more than the last five years 
while historical loss rates provide a starting point for the corporation s analysis  historical losses are not by themselves a sufficient basis to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses 
the actual rate selected for the analysis may differ from the calculated loss rate as the historical rate may be adjusted upward or downward to reflect current and anticipated business and economic conditions and other factors which are likely to cause the current portfolio to differ from historical experience 
the corporation s allowance also reflects a margin for the imprecision in the estimates of expected credit losses 
the resultant allowance for loan losses is viewed by management as a single  unallocated allowance available for all credit losses and any segmentation thereof is done only for compliance with reporting requirements 
the following table presents data related to the allowance for possible loan losses and net charge offs for each of the years in the five year period ended december  in thousands balance at beginning of year      charge offs domestic commercial and industri al      installment loans to in dividuals      secured by real estate      foreign      losses on sale  swap and charge off of restructur ing countries debt    total charge offs      recoveries domestic commercial and industri al      installment loans to in dividuals secured by real estate    foreign      total recoveries      net charge offs      provision charged to oper ating expense      allowance of acquired com panies translation adjustment   balance at end of year      primarily restructuring countries debt in the allowance for possible loan losses at year end represented of loans outstanding  net of unearned income  and  at year end the increase in net charge offs in compared to was primarily attributable to a weakness in the domestic chain store sector

the following table presents information related to the corporation s non accrual loans and other non performing assets at december  in each of the last five years

   total non accrual loans      other non performing assets other real estate owned      other non accrual assets   total other non performing as sets      total non accrual loans and other non performing assets      the above table excludes restructured performing loans which amounted to million  million  million  million and million in    and  respectively 
also excluded from the above table are loans past due days and still on accrual status  primarily residential mortgage loans  which amounted to million  million  million  million and million at year end    and  respectively 
at december  in each of the years through  the corporation s allowance for possible loan losses represented approximately    and  respectively  of total non accrual and restructured loans 
the coverage of the allowance for loan losses to non accrual and restructured loans is only one subjective measure of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses that management utilizes 
non accrual domestic loans increased to million in from million in this change was primarily the result of increases in the chain store sector and reductions in the commercial real estate portfolio that were charged off or transferred to the other real estate owned classification 
the decline in total non performing assets between and was primarily attributable to the brazilian debt restructuring settlement that reduced non accrual loans by million 
under this settlement  the corporation received bonds in exchange for substantially all of its non performing outstandings to brazil 
in the second quarter of  the corporation sold all of the brazilian bonds received and realized a gain on the sale of securities of million 
in order to comply with certain regulatory reporting requirements  management has prepared the following allocation of the corporation s allowance for possible loan losses among various categories of the loan portfolio for each of the years in the five year period ended december  in management s opinion  such allocation has  at best  a limited utility 
it is based on management s assessment as of a given point in time of the risk characteristics of each of the component parts of the total loan portfolio and is subject to changes as and when the risk factors of each such component part change 
such allocation is not indicative of either the specific amounts or the loan categories in which future charge offs may be taken  nor should it be taken as an indicator of future loss trends 
in addition  by presenting such allocation  management does not mean to imply that the allocation is exact or that the allowance has been precisely determined from such allocation

outstandings are classified by type of borrower  based on ultimate risk  and are defined as loans  acceptances  interest bearing deposits with banks  investment securities and accrued interest receivable  after deducting cash collateral 
countries where such outstandings exceeded of consolidated total assets of billion  billion and billion at december   and  respectively  were as follows banks and other government commercial financial and official and institutions institutions industrial in millions japan     france    canada   belgium luxembourg   united kingdom   italy germany  brazil australia includes excess of local currency outstandings over local currency liabilities 
the only country with cross border net outstandings exceeding of consolidated total assets which is excluded from the table above was the netherlands with million in and million in at december  in each of the last three years  countries with cross border net outstandings representing between and of consolidated total assets were the netherlands with million  switzerland with million and singapore with million  respectively  in  spain with million in and million in  taiwan with million in and million in  and italy with million in brazil during  the corporation continued to invest in the local brazilian financial markets  principally short term floating rate brazilian central bank and treasury debt issuances as well as short term certificates of deposits issued by prime brazilian banks 
when necessary  the corporation utilized interest rate and foreign currency futures to hedge its local currency position against short term changes 
at december   total cross border net outstandings in brazil investments amounted to approximately million  or of total assets  all of which are on a performing basis 
cross border net outstandings in brazil at december   consisted of approximately million to the public sector  million to the private bank sector and million to the private non bank sector 
during  the corporation increased its investment in cross border outstandings in brazil to capitalize on the spreads available through investments in local currency assets 
additional outstandings were invested in short term fixed income placements with other banks and floating rate government securities 
at december   total cross border net outstandings in brazil consisted primarily of brady bonds and short term investments amounting to approximately million  or of total assets  all of which were on a performing basis 
cross border net outstandings in brazil at december   consisted of approximately million to the public sector  million to the private bank sector and million to the private non bank sector  respectively 
on april   the government of brazil concluded a debt restructuring of its medium and long term debt 
under this settlement the corporation received bonds in exchange for substantially all of its non performing outstandings that had a carrying value of million 
the bonds received were sold in the second quarter of  and the corporation realized a gain of million 
the following table presents an analysis of the changes in aggregate cross border net outstandings discussed above 
year ended december  in millions aggregate outstandings at beginning of year purchases of brazilian government securities and bank placements sales of brazilian government securities and repay ments at maturity other changes interest income accrued collections of accrued interest aggregate outstandings at end of year risk management and control in the interest of reducing uncertainty as to the level of future earnings and its book value  the corporation manages several types of risks  principally credit and market risks 
the corporation seeks to control these risks by diversifying its exposures and activities among many instruments  markets  clients and geographic regions and by limiting risk positions 
the processes and procedures by which the corporation manages its risk profile continually evolve as the corporation s business activities change in response to market and product developments 
the corporation routinely reviews its procedures in order to ensure that they are comprehensive with respect to all major risks and that a consistent approach is followed throughout the organization 
to enhance the environment for the corporation s risk management activities and assist in decision making  significant investments have been made in the training of personnel and in the development of information technology 
proprietary and analytical trading systems have been developed for the corporation s existing and future business 
this control environment is subject to periodic review by management  internal auditors and regulators 
the risk assessment committee of the corporation s board of directors  established in  oversees the identification  measurement and limitation of the risks relating to all activities of  and products offered by  the corporation 
such committee s activities include review of risk management methodologies employed by management 
the committee is supported by the risk assessment and control department  also established in  whose task is to develop and implement risk quantification and reporting mechanisms 
the department also monitors market related risk exposure on a daily basis  reporting to management 
credit risk credit risk arises whenever the corporation owns a commitment of another party  which  if not completed  would result in a loss 
credit risk and exposure to loss are inherent parts of the banking business 
management seeks to manage and minimize these risks through its loan and investment policies  including obtaining collateral  and credit review procedures 
senior management establishes and continually reviews lending and investment criteria and approval procedures that it believes reflect the risk averse nature of the corporation 
the credit review committee of the board of directors periodically reviews and approves the corporation s policies and procedures to define  quantify and monitor the credit and settlement risks arising from the corporation s diverse activities 
global limits are established to control these risks  and it is the responsibility of each operating unit to conduct its business activity within these pre established limits 
any customer credit  currency or transaction exposure that exceeds established limits must be approved by senior management 
management s objective in establishing lending and investment standards is to minimize the risk of loss and provide for income generation through pricing policies 
in the case of foreign investments and loans  management emphasizes investments and loans to  or with guarantees of  governments  government agencies or banks 
in addition  the corporation places particular emphasis on the matching of the maturity and interest rate sensitivity of assets and liabilities 
by this policy  the corporation seeks to minimize the effect of rate changes  largely externally influenced and difficult to control  on the portfolio and to limit its exposure largely to credit risks over which it has more direct control 
one technique which the corporation utilizes to achieve these goals is to enter into interest rate contracts including swaps  caps and collars and currency swaps  each of which is designed to protect against interest rate or currency fluctuations 
management periodically reviews the loan portfolio  particularly non accrual and restructured loans 
the review may result in a determination that a loan should be placed on a non accrual status for income recognition 
in addition  to the extent that management identifies potential losses in the loan portfolio  it reduces the book value of such loans  through charge offs  to their estimated collectible value 
the corporation s policy is to classify as non accrual any loan other than factored trade accounts receivable  consumer installment and residential mortgage loans on which payment of principal or interest is days past due 
in addition  a loan will be classified as non accrual if  in the opinion of management  based upon a review of the borrower s or guarantor s financial condition  collateral value and other factors  payment is questionable  even though payments are not days past due 
when a loan  other than a well secured residential mortgage loan  is classified as non accrual  any unpaid interest is reversed against current income 
the loan remains in a non accrual classification until such time as the loan is brought current  when it may be returned to accrual classification 
when principal and interest on a non accrual loan are brought current  if in management s opinion future payments are questionable  the loan would remain classified as non accrual 
subsequent payments of either interest or principal received on a partially charged off non accrual or restructured loan are first applied to any remaining balance outstanding  until the loan is reduced to its net realizable value  then to recoveries and finally to income 
interest is included in income thereafter only to the extent received in cash 
factored trade accounts receivable that are past due days remain on an accrual basis because the past due interest usually will be charged to and collected from the factoring client 
the large number of consumer installment loans and the relatively small dollar amount of each makes an individual review impracticable 
the corporation charges off any consumer installment loan which is past due days 
residential mortgage loans are placed on non accrual status when the mortgagor is in bankruptcy or foreclosure proceedings are instituted  at which time the loan ceases to accrue interest 
any accrued interest receivable remains in interest income as an obligation of the borrower 
the credit review department provides an independent evaluation of the corporation s credit exposures and assures ongoing credit quality by reviewing individual credits and concentrations  with a focus on operating units where risk is at a higher level  and monitoring of corrective action where necessary 
additionally  the credit review department evaluates adherence to laws and regulations and to policies and established criteria as stated in the corporation s credit policy manual to assure compliance with such standards 
the credit review department also periodically prepares portfolio summaries for review by executive management and the board of directors 
these reports are then submitted for consideration to certain members of executive management who determine the amount of loans to be charged off 
the executive credit committee subsequently reviews the loans to be charged off and ratifies executive management s decision 
rules and formulae relative to the adequacy of the allowance  although useful as guidelines to management  are not final determinants 
in addition  any loan or portion thereof which is classified as a loss by regulatory examiners is charged off 
consistent with its policy of maintaining an adequate allowance for possible loan losses  management generally charges off a loan  or a portion thereof  when a loss is probable 
market risk market risk is the possibility of a decline in value of the corporation s assets net of hedges acquired in the course of its trading activities and asset liability management 
to manage market risk  the corporation establishes limits for interest rate  foreign currency and other market exposures 
an important tool in monitoring exposures and establishing limits for substantially all products offered is the estimation of the potential loss of current and future earnings on existing positions under a range of assumptions within the markets being measured 
the asset and liability management committee provides a forum for reviewing the corporation s liquidity profile and the market risk in its asset and liability management and trading positions 
the asset and liability management committee regularly reviews the corporation s market exposures and analyzes the effects of actual or projected changes in rates  prices or market liquidity on the value of these positions 
such committee also reviews the corporation s liquidity profile by monitoring the differences in maturities between assets and liabilities and by analyzing the future level of funds required based on various assumptions  including its ability to liquidate investment and trading positions and its ability to access the markets for funds 
capital resources and liquidity capital financing policy the corporation s policy is to obtain capital externally when opportunities arise  if the cost of such capital is reasonable and the form is appropriate for the corporation s needs and overall capital structure 
in keeping with this policy  capital has been obtained externally on several occasions  although  at such times  the corporation  relative to other major bank holding companies  was considered to be well capitalized 
the corporation conducts its business through its bank and non bank subsidiaries 
thus  the corporation frequently provides capital and financing to these subsidiaries to support their operations and to permit expansion 
in formulating its dividend policy  the corporation s board of directors considers historical financial results  future prospects and anticipated needs for capital 
the current policy  which is reviewed annually  is to pay out approximately to of the prior year s earnings on a normalized basis 
this policy is intended to provide stockholders with increasing dividend income while allowing the corporation to maintain its desired internal capital generation rate 
future dividends are dependent upon the corporation s financial results  capital requirements and economic conditions in general

the guidelines require a minimum ratio of capital to risk weighted assets including certain off balance sheet activities  such as standby letters of credit and derivative instruments of 
at least half of the total capital ratio is to be composed of common equity  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock  less goodwill and intangible assets subject to certain minimums tier or core capital 
the remainder may consist of limited amounts of subordinated debt  the balance of cumulative preferred stock and the allowance for loan losses tier capital 
as a supplement to its risk based capital ratios  the frb established a minimum leverage ratio of tier capital to average total assets  with tier capital being determined for this purpose in a manner consistent with the risk based capital guidelines 
each of the corporation s banking subsidiaries complies with all applicable regulatory capital requirements 
the corporation s leverage ratio and its risk based capital ratios include the assets and capital of safra republic on a consolidated basis in accordance with the requirements of the frb specifically applied to the corporation 
these ratios do not include the effect on stockholders equity related to the corporation s portfolio of securities available for sale 
in accordance with regulatory guidelines  the corporation excludes rnysc s assets and off balance sheet contracts from the corporation s capital calculations 
the guidelines also require the corporation to deduct one half of its investment in this subsidiary from each of tier and tier capital

in order to insure that funds are available at all times  the corporation devotes substantial resources to projecting the amount of funds which will be required on a daily basis and maintains relationships with a diversity of sources so that funds are available on a global basis 
through its worldwide network  the corporation obtains funds from a large and varied customer base that provides a stable source of domestic demand and consumer deposits and foreign office deposits 
other sources provide short term borrowings  including the sale of commercial paper and long term liabilities in the form of notes and debentures 
liquidity requirements also can be met through the disposition of short term assets that are generally matched to the maturity of liabilities 
liquid assets include cash and due from banks  interest bearing deposits with banks  federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements  trading account assets and precious metals 
average total liquid assets have equaled approximately of average total assets in each of the last three years
