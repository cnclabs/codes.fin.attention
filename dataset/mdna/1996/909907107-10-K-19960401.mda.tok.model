earnings summary for the year ended december   net income increased to a record  net income per share of for the year was up from in united s return on average assets of makes united one of the nation s most profitable regional banking companies 
dividends per share increased from in to a record level of per share in this was the twenty second consecutive year of dividend increases to shareholders 
core earnings  or earnings before taxes  security transactions  cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and the provision for possible loan losses  were strong and increased for compared to these strong core earnings are indicative of the increase in net interest income driven by an increase in average net earning assets with significant growth of in average net loans 
factors contributing to the earnings increase include an improved net interest margin  partially resulting from a  increase in average earning assets from and an overall increase in noninterest income which included fewer losses on the sale of securities 
the favorable impact of the above items was partly offset by increased occupancy expenses and increased income taxes as a result of the higher level of pre tax earnings 
united is in the process of realigning its interest rate sensitivity for to a more interest rate neutral position 
this investment strategy may reduce current earnings  but should enhance united s future earnings momentum 
united s key performance measures  return on average assets and return on average equity  improved significantly from and remained very strong in comparison to industry standards 
united s return on average assets of and return on average shareholders equity of both compare excellently with regional peer grouping ratios of and and national peer group ratios of and  respectively  according to information provided by wheat  first securities  inc united is one of the nation s most profitable regional banking companies 
united has a strong capital position and is well positioned to take advantage of future growth opportunities 
the following discussion explains in more detail the results of operations and changes in financial condition by major category 
net interest income net interest income represents the primary component of united s earnings 
it is the difference between interest and fee income related to earning assets and interest expense incurred to fund these earning assets 
net interest income is impacted by changes in the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as changes in market interest rates 
such changes  and their impact on net interest income in  are explained below 
for the years ended december  and  net interest income approximated  and  respectively 
on a tax equivalent basis the net interest margin was strong at in and in higher average loan volumes of approximately million resulting primarily from an acquisition contributed to the increase in net interest income 
at  united s net interest margin remains well above peer group averages 
total interest income of  increased in over as a result of higher volumes of interest earning assets 
comparing year end to year end  a moderate decrease occurred in consumer loans of while commercial loans and mortgage loans showed increases of and  respectively 
total interest expense increased  or in this increase can be attributed primarily to united s competitive pricing of interest bearing deposits in its markets and continued change in the retail deposit mix as customers shift funds into products offering higher yields 
united s average interest bearing deposits increased by in  while its average long term borrowings decreased and average short term borrowings increased 
united made greater use of short term funds as the federal reserve held short term rates steady at approximately for nearly half of the average cost of funds  which increased from in to in  reflected the general upward trend in market interest rates during provision for possible loan losses united evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis and its loan administration policies are focused upon the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio 
united s process of evaluating the allowance is a formal company wide process that focuses on early identification of potential problem credits and procedural discipline in managing and accounting for those credits 
see note f to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of concentrations of credit risk 
nonperforming loans were  at december  and  at december   an increase of 
the level of nonperforming assets increased as a result of delinquencies on certain large balance commercial creditors and nonperforming assets purchased in a recent acquisition 
the components of nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans and loans which are contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal  but have not been put on a nonaccrual basis 
united has no significant troubled debt restructurings 
loans past due days or more increased  or during  nonaccrual loans increased  or since year end much of the increase in nonaccrual loans was the result of the addition of a single large commercial loan to nonaccrual status 
united is currently negotiating workout terms with the borrowers and will closely monitor the ongoing status 
nonperforming loans represented of total assets at the end of  which is approximately one half of the national peer levels 
at year end and the allowance for possible loan losses was and of total loans  net of unearned income  respectively 
at december  and  the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans was and  respectively 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses of  as of december   is adequate to provide for potential losses on existing loans based on information currently available 
for the years ended december  and the provision for loan losses was  and  respectively 
the slight increase can be attributed to the higher net charge offs and the increase in nonperforming loans during the provision for loan losses charged to operations is based on management s evaluation of individual credits  the past loan loss experience  and other factors which  in management s judgement  deserve recognition in estimating possible loan losses 
such other factors considered by management include growth and composition of the loan portfolio  known deterioration in certain classes of loans or collateral  trends in delinquencies  and current economic conditions 
total net charge offs were  in and  in  which represents and of average loans for the respective years 
united s ratio of net charge offs to average loans is comparable to its peers ratio of in and compared very favorably with its peers ratio of in management is not aware of any potential problem loans  trends or uncertainties which management reasonably expects will materially impact future operating results  liquidity  or capital resources which have not been disclosed 
additionally  management has disclosed all known material credits which cause management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the loan repayments 
management is not aware of any current recommendations by regulatory authorities which  if implemented  would have a material effect on liquidity  capital resources or operations 
effective january   united adopted financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures  collectively sfas as a result of applying the rules prescribed by sfas no 
 certain loans are being reported at the present value of their expected future cash flows using the loan s effective interest rate  or as a practical expedient  at the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
at the time of adoption of sfas no 
 united had approximately  of loans which were considered impaired in accordance with the guidelines prescribed by sfas no 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the allowance for loan losses  the provision for possible loan losses  the charge off policy or the comparability of credit risk 
impaired loans are specifically reviewed loans for which it is probable that the creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the loan agreement 
the specific factors that influence management s judgement in determining when a loan is impaired include the evaluation that the loan is classified as substandard or worse  also the strength of the borrower and the net realizable value of the collateral 
a valuation allowance is required to the extent that the measure of the impaired loans is less than the recorded investment 
a specifically reviewed loan is not impaired during a period of minimum delay in payment  regardless of the amount of shortfall  if the ultimate collectibility of all amounts due is expected 
united defines minimum delay as past due less than days 
sfas does not apply to smaller balance  larger groups of homogeneous loans such as consumer installment  bank card and real estate mortgage loans  which are collectively evaluated for impairment 
impaired loans are therefore primarily business loans  which include commercial loans and income property 
united applies the measurement methods described above to these loans on a loan by loan basis 
smaller balance populations of business loans  loans with a balance of  or less  which are not specifically reviewed in accordance with united s normal credit review procedures  are also excluded from the application of sfas impaired loans are charged off when the impaired loan  or a portion thereof  is considered uncollectible or is transferred to other real estate owned 
consistent with united s existing method of income recognition for loans  interest receipts on impaired loans  except those classified also as nonaccrual  are recognized as interest income using the accrual method of income recognition 
united s method of income recognition for impaired loans that are classified as nonaccrual is to recognize interest income on the cash method of income recognition or apply the cash receipt to principal when the ultimate collectibility of principal is in doubt 
the average recorded investment in impaired loans during the year ended december  was approximately  for the year ended december   united recognized interest income on those impaired loans of approximately  substantially all of which was recognized using the accrual method of income recognition 
the amount of interest income which would have been recorded under the original terms for the above loans was  at december   the recorded investment in loans that were considered to be impaired under sfas no 
was  of which  were on a nonaccrual basis 
included in this amount was  of impaired loans for which the related allowance for credit losses was  and  of impaired loans that did not have an allowance for credit losses 
the impact of adopting sfas was immaterial to the financial condition and operations of united as of and for the year ended december   and had no material impact on the comparability of the credit risk as presented herein 
united has commercial real estate loans  including owner occupied  income producing real estate and land development loans  of approximately  and  as of december  and  respectively 
the loans are primarily secured by real estate located in west virginia  southeastern ohio  and virginia 
the loans were originated by united s subsidiary banks using underwriting standards as set forth by management 
united s loan administration policies are focused on the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio  including commercial real estate loans  in terms of loan approval and credit quality 
it is the opinion of management that these loans do not pose any unusual risks and that adequate consideration has been given to the above loans in establishing the allowance for loan losses 
other income noninterest income has been and will continue to be an important factor contributing to united s profitability 
accordingly  management continues to evaluate areas where noninterest income can be enhanced 
other income consists of all revenues which are not included in interest and fee income related to earning assets 
in  other income  excluding securities transactions  increased when compared to the overall increase in noninterest income of  or is primarily attributed to the absence of net losses on securities transactions incurred in and a  increase in service charges  commissions and fees 
trust income increased  or in this was due to repricing of services and an increased volume of trust business 
service charges  commissions and fees increased by  or in this income consists of charges and fees related to various banking services provided by united 
the increase was primarily due to a combination of increased fees in bankcard accounts and an increased fee structure for sales of checking related products 
securities transactions resulted in a net loss of  in the proceeds from these sales were reinvested in similar securities yielding a higher rate of return 
the net losses from the sales of the securities were fully recovered within the first eight months of there were no securities sales in on january   united adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  sfas no 
which was effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the  of net securities losses for relates primarily to debt securities losses of approximately  which were classified as available for sale 
for further details  see note d to the consolidated financial statements 
on november   the fasb staff issued a special report  a guide to implementation of statement on accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
in accordance with the provision of that special report  united chose to reclassify securities from held to maturity to available for sale 
at the date of the transfer the amortized cost of those securities was  and the unrealized gain on those securities was  which is included in shareholders equity 
this enabled united to take advantage of certain interest rate risk management strategies 
other expense just as management continues to evaluate areas where noninterest income can be enhanced  it strives to improve the efficiency of its operations and thus reduce operating costs 
united s cost control efforts have been very successful with an efficiency ratio of  which is well below the reported by peer group averages 
other expenses include all items of expense other than interest expense  the provision for possible loan losses  and income taxes 
in total  other expenses were flat in  and management was successful in controlling costs 
the income statement reflects a increase in as compared to salaries and employee benefits expense increased  or in as of december  and  united employed and full time equivalent employees  respectively 
net occupancy expense in exceeded levels by  or primarily due to decreased rental income from vacancies and an increase in real property repairs and utilities expense 
remaining other expenses decreased  or in compared to the decrease in other expenses for the year relates primarily to lower data processing fees and fdic insurance expense as a result of the federal deposit insurance corporation s decision to lower deposit insurance premiums from to per in bank insurance fund bif deposits for well capitalized and well managed banks 
the premium change resulted in a refund of approximately  which was received in september the overall decrease in fdic insurance premiums for when compared to was  united s two banking subsidiaries are assessed at the lowest fdic insurance premium rate 
the decrease in fdic insurance premiums and data processing fees was offset by higher advertising  postage  bankcard and nonrecurring legal expenses which included certain merger related expenses for the first commercial acquisition consummated by united during and the pending eagle merger to be consummated during income taxes for the year ended december   income taxes approximated  compared to  for this increase is principally the result of lower levels of tax exempt income and higher levels of pretax income 
united s effective tax rates in these two years were and  respectively 
at december   gross deferred tax assets totaled approximately million 
the allowance for loan losses and various accrued liabilities represent the most significant temporary differences 
based on management s evaluation at december   no valuation allowance has been allocated to deferred tax assets 
fourth quarter results net income for the fourth quarter of was  an increase of from the  earned in the fourth quarter of on a per share basis  fourth quarter earnings were 
per share in and 
per share in net income was higher in than in because of the factors previously discussed herein relative to annual results 
additional quarterly financial data for and may be found in note p to the consolidated financial statements 
the effect of inflation united s income statements generally reflect the effects of inflation 
since interest rates  loan demand  and deposit levels are related to inflation  the resulting changes in the interest sensitive assets and liabilities are included in net interest income 
similarly  operating expenses such as salaries  rents  and maintenance include changing prices resulting from inflation 
one item which would not reflect inflationary changes is depreciation expense 
subsequent to the acquisition of depreciable assets  inflation causes price levels to rise  therefore  historically presented dollar values do not reflect this inflationary condition 
with inflation levels at relatively low levels and monetary and fiscal policies being implemented to keep the inflation rate increases within an acceptable range  management expects the impact of inflation would continue be minimal in the near future 
interest rate sensitivity interest sensitive assets and liabilities are defined as those assets or liabilities that mature or are repriced within a designated time frame 
the principal function of asset and liability management is to maintain an appropriate relationship between those assets and liabilities that are sensitive to changing market interest rates 
united closely monitors the sensitivity of its assets and liabilities on an on going basis and projects the effect of various interest rate changes on its net interest margin 
the difference between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities for specified periods of time is known as the gap 
a primary objective of asset liability management is managing interest rate risk 
at united  interest rate risk is managed to minimize the impact of fluctuating interest rates on earnings 
as shown in the interest rate sensitivity gap table on the following page of this report  united was liability sensitive excess of liabilities over assets in the one year horizon 
united  however  has not experienced the kind of earnings volatility indicated from the cumulative gap 
this is because a significant portion of united s retail deposit base does not reprice on a contractual basis 
management has estimated  based upon historical analyses  that savings deposits are less sensitive to interest rate changes than are other forms of deposits 
the gap table presented herein has been adapted to show the estimated differences in interest rate sensitivity which result when the retail deposit base is assumed to reprice in a manner consistent with historical trends 
see management adjustments in the gap table 
using these estimates  united was asset sensitive in the one year horizon in the amount of  or of the cumulative gap to related earning assets 
the primary method of measuring the sensitivity of earnings to changing market interest rates is to simulate expected cash flows using varying assumed interest rates while also adjusting the timing and magnitude of non contractual deposit repricing to more accurately reflect anticipated pricing behavior 
these simulations include adjustments for the lag in prime loan repricing and the spread and volume elasticity of interest bearing deposit accounts  regular savings and money market deposit accounts 
to aid in interest rate management  united s lead bank  unb  is a member of the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh fhlb 
the use of fhlb advances provides united with a low risk means to match maturities of earning assets and interest bearing funds to achieve a desired interest rate spread over the life of the earning assets 
united bankshares  inc 
and subsidiaries the following table shows the interest rate sensitivity gap as of december interest rate sensitivity gap days total over one year years years total assets in thousands interest earning assets investment and marketable equity securities taxable        tax exempt        loans  net of unearned income        total interest earning assets        liabilities interest bearing funds savings and now accounts    time deposits of  over       other time deposits        federal funds purchased  repurchase agreements and other short term borrowings    fhlb advances    total interest bearing funds        interest sensitivity gap        cumulative gap        cumulative gap as a percentage of total earning assets management adjustments      off balance sheet activities    cumulative management adjusted gap and off balance sheet activities        cumulative management adjusted gap and off balance sheet activities as a percentage of total earning assets additionally  united is using certain off balance sheet instruments known as interest rate swaps  to further aid in interest rate risk management 
the use of interest rate swaps is a cost effective means of synthetically altering the repricing structure of balance sheet items 
the interest rate swap transaction involves the exchange of a floating rate payment based on the one month london inter bank offered rate libor for a fixed rate receipt based on the u 
s 
three year treasury note 
the net pay and receive amount is calculated on an underlying notional amount without the exchange of the underlying principal amount 
the interest rate swap subjects united to market risk associated with changes in interest rates  as well as the risk that the counterparty will fail to perform 
only the interest payments are exchanged  and therefore  cash requirements and exposure to credit risk are significantly less than the notional amount 
at december   the total notional amount of united s interest rate swap was million 
the current maturity of the swap portfolio is one year and one month 
the interest rate swap reduced net interest income by  and  in and  respectively 
for further details  see note l to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources in the opinion of management  united maintains liquidity which is sufficient to satisfy its depositors requirements and the credit needs of its customers 
like all banks  united depends upon its ability to renew maturing deposits and other liabilities on a daily basis and to acquire new funds in a variety of markets 
a significant source of funds available to united are core deposits 
core deposits include certain demand deposits  statement and special savings and now accounts 
these deposits are relatively stable and they are the lowest cost source of funds available to united 
short term borrowings have also been a significant source of funds 
these include federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
repurchase agreements represent funds which are generally obtained as the result of a competitive bidding process 
liquid assets are cash and those items readily convertible to cash 
all banks must maintain sufficient balances of cash and near cash items to meet the day to day demands of customers 
other than cash and due from banks  the available for sale securities portfolio and maturing loans are the primary sources of liquidity 
the goal of liquidity management is to ensure the ability to access funding which enables united to efficiently satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers and meet united s cash needs 
liquidity is managed by monitoring funds availability from a number of primary sources 
substantial funding is available from cash and cash equivalents  unused short term borrowings and a geographically dispersed network of subsidiary banks providing access to a diversified and substantial retail deposit market 
short term needs can be met through a wide array of sources such as correspondent and downstream correspondent federal funds and utilization of federal home loan bank advances 
other sources of liquidity available to united to provide long term as well as short term funding alternatives  in addition to fhlb advances  are long term certificates of deposit  lines of credit  and borrowings secured by bank premises or stock of united s subsidiaries 
united has no intention at this time of utilizing any long term funding sources other than fhlb advances and long term certificates of deposit 
cash flows from operations in of  were higher than the  in as a result of approximately  million increase in net income 
in  investing activities resulted in a source of cash of  as compared to in which investing activities resulted in a use of cash of  the primary reason for the decrease in the use of cash for investing activities is that net loan originations decreased by  in as compared to while the net excess of proceeds from sales  maturities and calls of securities over security purchases decreased from  in to  in for a decrease of  financing activities resulted in a use of cash in of  primarily due to a  decrease in net borrowings from the fhlb of pittsburgh  payment of  of cash dividends to shareholders and a net decreases in deposits of  these uses of cash for financing activities were partially offset by a net increase of  in other short term borrowings 
see the consolidated statement of cash flows in the consolidated financial statements 
united anticipates no problems in its ability to service its obligations over the next months and has no material commitments for capital expenditures 
there are no known trends  demands  commitments  or events that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in united s liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way 
united also has significant lines of credit available to it 
see note i  notes to consolidated financial statements 
the asset and liability committee monitors liquidity to ascertain that a strong liquidity position is maintained 
in addition  variable rate loans are a priority 
these policies should help to protect net interest income against fluctuations in interest rates 
united also seeks to maintain a proper relationship between capital and total assets in order to support growth and sustain earnings 
united s average equity to average asset ratio was in and in united s risk based capital ratio was in and in which are both significantly higher than the minimum regulatory requirements 
united s tier capital and leverage ratios of and  respectively  at december   are also strong relative to its peers and are well above regulatory minimums 
commitments the following table indicates the outstanding loan commitments of united in the categories stated december lines of credit authorized  but unused  letters of credit  past experience has shown that  of the foregoing commitments  approximately can reasonably be expected to be funded within a one year period

factors contributing to the earnings increase included an improved net interest margin  partially resulting from a  increase in average earning assets from  a lower loan loss provision due to improved credit quality and increased earnings from acquisitions 
the favorable impact of the above items was partly offset by increased occupancy expenses  decreased fee income from customer accounts for which a fee is charged and losses from the sale of securities 
united s key performance measures  return on average assets and return on average equity  improved significantly from and remained very strong in comparison to industry standards 
united s return on average assets of made united one of the nation s most profitable regional banking companies 
in the december   bank holding company performance report  which is prepared by the federal reserve board s division of banking supervision and regulation  united was ranked in the th percentile of bank holding companies nationwide in terms of return on average assets for the year ended december  the following discussion explains in more detail the results of operations and changes in financial condition by major category 
net interest income for the years ended december  and  net interest income approximated  and  respectively

united also experienced modest decreases in its overall cost of funds 
at  united s net interest margin was well above peer group averages 
total interest income of  increased in over as a result of higher volumes of interest earning assets 
comparing year end to year end  a moderate decrease in commercial loans of and a slight increase in consumer loans of  which resulted from lower commercial and consumer demand  were offset by significant mortgage loan growth of 
total interest expense decreased in this decrease was primarily the result of lower rates paid on interest bearing funds 
united s average interest bearing deposits increased only slightly or in  while its average long term borrowings increased as united made greater use of these funds in order to meet the demand for mortgage loan products with matching maturities 
the average cost of funds reflected the general downward trend in market interest rates in  falling from in to in provision for possible loan losses united evaluated the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis and its loan administration policies are focused upon the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio 
nonperforming loans were  at december  and  at december   a decrease of

the decrease was attributable to the general improvement in all areas of asset quality and the increased coverage ratio of the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans 
the provision for loan losses charged to operations is based on management s evaluation of individual credits  the past loan loss experience  and other factors which  in management s judgement  deserve recognition in estimating possible loan losses

trust income increased  or in this was due to repricing of services and an increased volume of trust business 
service charges  commissions and fees decreased by  or in this income consists of charges and fees related to various banking services provided by united 
the decrease was primarily due to a combination of decreased activity in customer accounts and a decline in net account analysis fees 
securities transactions resulted in a net loss of  in and a net gain of  in as evidenced by the statement of cash flows  the volume of securities sold increased significantly in the primary reason for this increased sales activity was to restructure a portion of the investment portfolio to reflect current market rates in response to the rising interest rate environment in order to enhance united s future earnings momentum
