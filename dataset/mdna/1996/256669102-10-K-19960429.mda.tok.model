general during  dollar general achieved record sales  record earnings  and record new store growth levels 
in addition  the company recorded the lowest net operating expense to net sales ratio ever achieved 
the company completed the installation of new technology in its ardmore  oklahoma distribution center  a major investment in the company s growth strategy 
the company s commitment to provide consumable  basic merchandise at everyday low prices and to reduce its expense to sales ratio is evidenced by its decision to eliminate a solo direct mail circular in for the eighth consecutive year  the company increased its total store units ending the year with  stores 
the company opened new stores during  the largest number of single year new store openings in the company s history 
despite the start up costs associated with opening these new stores and the initial inefficiencies of the ardmore  oklahoma distribution center  the company increased earnings per share by more than for the ninth consecutive year 
the company opened new stores in compared with in and in the new stores  net of closed stores  added  square feet to the company s total sales space  providing the company with an aggregate of  selling square feet at the end of the year 
in  the average store measured  square feet compared with  in and  in the three states in which the greatest number of new stores were opened during were texas  oklahoma  and north carolina 
the approximate size of the average new store was  square feet  unchanged from in  the company expects to open approximately new stores with texas being the largest growth area 
in  the company also remodeled or relocated stores compared with in and in during the last three years  the company has opened  remodeled  or relocated  stores  accounting for more than of the total stores at year end 
the ardmore distribution center was expanded from approximately  to about  square feet during enabling it to service up to  stores and allowing for future store expansion in the region 
during  the company will begin construction of its fourth distribution facility to support its continued rapid store expansion program 
this facility  to be constructed in south boston  virginia  will measure approximately  square feet  and will use the same technology implemented in the ardmore distribution center 
the construction of this new distribution facility will give the company excess capacity during fiscal which should allow the company to upgrade the technology in its scottsville  kentucky and homerville  georgia distribution centers 
the company will also begin upgrading its merchandising and financial systems through new technology and computer software solutions during additionally  the company is considering upgrading its point of sale systems to capture stock keeping unit sku information 
organizationally  the company is actively pursuing the placement of two key executive officers 
the company has been in search of a chief financial officer cfo since the resignation of its former cfo in august the company intends to hire a president to focus on the day to day operations of the business thereby separating that function from the ceo and allowing the ceo to focus on strategic planning and employee development 
for  the company has converted to a week reporting calendar 
the fiscal year end will be the friday closest to january each year 
fiscal will end january  this will give the company more uniformity in its external and internal reporting 
the company will restate on this adjusted basis for comparative quarterly financial reporting during the only significant shift between quarterly results will be the allocation of advertising costs resulting from ad periods being split between quarters on the week calendar 
results of operations operating results  relative to the company s performance over the past several years  were impaired primarily as a result of the inefficiencies associated with the start up of the ardmore distribution center 
during the first half of  the inefficient distribution of merchandise to stores led to below standard in stock levels for basic merchandise and imbalances in inventory positions resulting in lost sales 
also  some seasonal merchandise for the spring season was distributed to the stores too late for proper presentation  resulting in carryover inventories 
in addition  the retailing environment in general was sluggish during the third and fourth quarters  contributing to increased inventories 
these conditions collectively led to slower inventory turns for as compared with and for and  respectively which required more merchandise to be financed through short term borrowings resulting in higher interest costs 
the company also experienced higher levels of merchandise shrinkage during  which management believes is the result of higher inventory levels in the stores 
total company retail shrinkage was of sales in compared to in and in the company will implement several new shrinkage control programs during  as well as reduce inventory levels  all of which should improve shrinkage results 
the company will continue its program of interim physical inventories for stores that have had high shrinkage history or that have characteristics of high shrinkage stores 
in addition  the company will randomly select a representative sample from all other stores not covered in the above mentioned program to be inventoried throughout results from these store inventories should reveal to management any additional problem areas or trends that can be addressed immediately 
the company bonus program has been modified to place greater emphasis on inventory shrinkage results 
in  the company will accelerate store deliveries from a bi weekly to a weekly schedule 
management believes that the weekly inventory distribution should increase in stock levels and improve inventory turns 
the company does not anticipate a material increase in distribution costs because distribution trailers will carry merchandise to a greater number of stores in a single trip 
furthermore  the accelerated deliveries should reduce the financing cost of inventory 
in  gross margin declined to of sales from in and in as mentioned above  higher store shrinkage primarily contributed to this decline 
because of these shrinkage results  the company will reserve for shrinkage during the first three quarters of at a higher rate than it reserved in customer demand has dictated an intensified focus on everyday low pricing and consumable  basic merchandise  which resulted in the company s sales mix shifting to hardline departments from softline departments during the year hardlines softlines in versus hardlines softlines in 
this led to lower margins on sales of current purchases which also deteriorated the total gross margin percentage 
during  the sales mix should continue to shift towards hardlines 
higher distribution costs associated with the start up of the ardmore distribution center will contribute to lower beginning inventory margins in actual distribution costs during should trend lower as a percent of sales resulting from efficiencies gained through the fully functional ardmore facility 
faster inventory turns through weekly deliveries and more productive distribution facilities support the company s role as a customer driven distributor of consumable basics 
net operating expense as a percent of sales continued to decline during as the company eliminated its november circular 
the company s only direct mail ads in fiscal were in may  august and december the company intends to eliminate its august back to school  solo direct mail circular in another improvement in net operating expense during was lower self insurance expense primarily the result of improved claims prevention and management 
reductions in losses from more focused safety programs should continue to lower expenses as a percentage of sales during also  there was a reduction in employee incentive based compensation expense to reflect lower performance levels 
the company reduced its store labor to sales ratio during the last half of by better managing new store openings and quickly adjusting to below plan sales levels 
higher depreciation resulting from the continued accelerated store growth rate partially offset these gains 
the following table sets forth certain items in the consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 
net sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expense interest expense income before taxes on income provision for taxes on income net income net sales net sales for totaled billion  an increase of  or million more than the level of billion 
the increase resulted from net new stores operating during the year and a same store sales increase of 
the company defines same stores as those stores that were opened before the beginning of the prior fiscal year and that have remained open throughout both the prior and current fiscal years 
while the same store sales increase in was substantial by industry comparisons  it was the first year during the past five years that the company did not achieve double digit growth 
management believes the decline in same store sales growth resulted primarily from operating inefficiencies associated with the start up of its new ardmore distribution center during the first seven months of the year and an overall sluggish retailing environment  especially during the fourth quarter 
the sales mix during shifted in favor of hardlines which comprised of sales compared with in and in as the company focuses more on consumable  basic merchandise  the sales mix should continue to shift to hardlines 
the company retrofitted store layouts during to balance the presentation of apparel and basic merchandise 
the company will continue retrofitting stores in net sales for totaled billion  an increase of  or million more than the level of billion 
the increase resulted from net new stores opened during the year and a same store sales increase of 
gross profit gross profit for was million  compared with million in and million in gross profit as a percent of sales was for and for this basis point decline was primarily a result of higher store inventory shrinkage  lower margins on sales of current purchases  and a lower lifo reserve credit which more than offset higher margins on beginning inventories 
higher inventory levels during the last half of contributed to the higher shrinkage 
lower margins on sales of current purchases resulted primarily from the shift in sales mix to hardlines along with continued price rollbacks 
gross profit as a percent of sales was in and in this basis point increase was principally the result of lower markdowns  an increased lifo reserve credit and higher markups on purchases which more than offset the effect of lower markups on beginning inventories and reduced purchase discounts 
selling  general  and administrative expense during  the company realized a company record low net operating expense to sales of 
selling  general and administrative expense for was million compared with million or of sales in and million or of sales in total selling  general and administrative expense increased primarily from opening and operating net new stores 
the lower operating expense ratio achieved in resulted from i a reduction in employee incentive based compensation expense reflecting lower performance levels  ii lower advertising costs through the elimination of the november solo direct mail circular  and iii lower self insurance expense primarily the result of improved claims prevention and management 
these improvements were partially offset by higher depreciation related to accelerated new store openings and higher rent expense as a percent of sales resulting from lower than anticipated sales volumes 
selling  general and administration expense for increased principally as a result of opening net new stores 
self insurance expense  supplies  advertising costs  health insurance  and utility expense in all declined as a percent of sales as a result of cost controls and significant sales increases 
these decreases more than offset increases in depreciation and incentive compensation 
interest expense in  interest expense increased to million from million in interest expense was million in this significant increase was primarily the result of higher average short term borrowings throughout the year caused by slower inventory turns  which required more merchandise to be financed through short term borrowings rather than through accounts payable

provision for taxes on income the effective income tax rates for  and were  and  respectively
