item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes related thereto presented elsewhere herein 
the discussion of results  causes and trends should not be construed to imply any conclusion that such results  causes or trends will necessarily continue in the future 
ryan  beck is principally engaged in the underwriting  distribution and trading of tax exempt  bank equity and debt securities 
the company also provides consulting  research  and financial services to the banking and thrift industries 
all aspects of the company s business are highly competitive and impacted by regulatory  economic and other factors outside of its control  including the volatility and price levels of securities markets  the demand for investment banking services and interest rate changes 
in addition  a significant portion of the company s expenses  including salaries and benefits  occupancy and communications  are relatively fixed and do not vary with market activity 
consequently  operating results of any individual period should not be considered representative of future performance 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain information regarding the revenues of the company by source selected financial data year ended december  amount percentamount percent amountpercent in thousands principal transactions tax exempt debt securities    taxable debt securities    equity securities    total    commissions tax exempt debt securities 
equity securities    mutual funds    total    investment banking tax exempt debt securities   taxable debt securities equity securities   consulting  placement and valuation fees   total    interest and dividends other 
total    investment banking revenue includes management fees and underwriting fees earned in connection with all underwriting participations and selling concessions earned in connection with the company s participation in tax exempt debt  corporate debt and equity underwritings 
since the various activities of the company are interdependent and substantially the same sales personnel and office facilities are engaged in the generation of the above revenues  the company does not believe that a meaningful allocation of expenses can be made among these operations 
the following tables set forth  for the periods indicated  i items in the company s consolidated statement of earnings as percentages of total revenue and ii the increase or decrease by item as a percentage of the amount for the previous period percentage of total revenues year ended december  revenues principal transactions commissions investment banking interest and dividends other

total revenues during decreased  or to  from  in revenues from principal transactions increased  or to  in from  in this increase can be attributed to an increase of  from trading equity securities  an increase of  from trading corporate debt securities  which was partially offset by a decrease of  from trading tax exempt securities 
the increase in trading revenues attributable to equity and corporate securities reflected greater demand during for exchanging securities in a lower interest rate environment as compared with the decrease in revenue attributable to trading tax exempt securities primarily reflects reduced product availability and lower yields 
revenues from investment banking services decreased  or to  in from  in the comparable period 
this decrease was due to a  decrease in revenues related to consulting  placement and valuation fees and  from underwriting tax exempt debt securities which was partially offset by an increase in revenue from underwriting equity securities and taxable debt securities of  and  respectively 
the decrease in fee income resulted from a reduced number of mutual to stock thrift conversions  including mutual holding companies which closed in as compared to  the smaller size of the transactions which closed in  and decreased fee income from merger and acquisition advisory work 
despite the closing of several large conversion or mutual holding company transactions subsequent to december  which resulted in significant revenues  there is expected to be greater uncertainty with respect to future revenues resulting from thrift conversions or mutual holding company transactions because of increased competition and potential changes in federal regulatory policy regarding thrift conversions 
the reduced fee income from merger and acquisition advisory work is primarily due to the smaller size of many of the company s merger and acquisition transactions in the increase in revenues from underwriting equity securities resulted primarily from the closing of several underwritings for financial institutions seeking additional capital for growth purposes as well as the closing of the ryan  beck banking opportunity trust  series commission revenue increased  or to  in from  in the increase in revenues is primarily due to an increase in mutual fund commissions of  and in equity commissions of  reflecting increased activity in the general stock market 
revenue from interest and dividends increased  or to  in from  in this increase is a result of increased levels of inventory carried during  partially offset by a lower interest rate environment in total operating expenses increased  or to  in from  in this increase is primarily attributed to an increase in floor brokerage  exchange and clearance fees of  or  and interest expense of  or 
the increase in floor brokerage  exchange and clearance fees reflects both increased activity and a rebate of certain clearance costs incurred in connection with transferring to a new clearing agent in the increase in interest expense reflects the cost of carrying higher levels of inventory during compared with net income for the year ended december  was  compared to  during the same period ending december  on a fully diluted basis  earnings per common share increased to per share in from per share in income tax expense and net income for the years ended december  and have been restated by  and  respectively 
total revenues during increased  or to  in from  in revenues from principal transactions decreased  or to  in from  during this decrease can be attributed to a decrease of  from trading corporate debt securities  a decrease of  from trading equity securities  and a decrease of  from trading tax exempt securities 
the decrease in trading revenues attributable to tax exempt and corporate securities reflected greater demand during for exchanging securities in a lower interest rate environment as compared with a weak market for most of the decrease in revenue attributable to trading equity securities primarily reflects reduced investor interest in bank and thrift stocks and an overall weakness in bank and thrift equities 
revenues from investment banking services increased  or to  in the period from  in the comparable period 
this was due to a  increase in revenues related to consulting  placement and valuation fees which was partially offset by a decline in revenue from underwriting equity securities of  a decrease in revenue from underwriting tax exempt debt securities of  and a  decrease in revenue from underwriting taxable debt securities 
the increase in fee income resulted from greater activity in mutual to stock thrift conversions  including mutual holding companies and increased merger and acquisition activity among banks and thrifts 
additionally  the weaker market for financial institution equity securities creates greater uncertainty about future merger and acquisition revenues 
the decrease in revenues from underwriting equity securities results primarily from reduced interest in raising capital by financial institutions which have at present adequate capital 
much of the prior underwriting activity in tax exempt debt securities was due to refinancing activity 
as a result of recent increases in interest rates  refinancing activity declined significantly during and is expected to remain at low levels in the foreseeable future 
commission revenue decreased  or to  in from  in the decrease in revenues includes a decrease in mutual fund commissions of  and in equity commissions of  and is mainly attributable to reduced activity in the general stock market 
revenue from interest and dividends decreased  or to  in from  in this decrease is a result of decreased levels of inventory carried during  partially offset by a higher interest rate environment in total operating expenses increased  or 
to  in from  in this increase is primarily attributed to an increase in other operating expenses of  or partially offset by a decrease in floor brokerage  exchange and clearance fees of  or 
the increase in other operating expenses is a result of an increase in the legal reserve as well as an increase in bad debt expense resulting from recording additional bad debt reserves 
the decrease in floor brokerage  exchange and clearance fees reflects both reduced activity  lower costs and a rebate of certain clearance costs incurred in connection with transferring to a new clearing agent 
liquidity and capital funds as of december   the company s consolidated statement of financial condition reflects an essentially liquid financial position  with most of the company s assets consisting of cash or assets readily convertible into cash 
the company s securities positions in its trading accounts both long and short are  in most instances  readily marketable 
the company finances its business through the use of available capital and short term secured borrowings 
the company maintains a facility pursuant to which it may borrow additional funds on a secured short term basis from its clearing broker 
the amount available for borrowing under this facility is related to the level of securities inventory at the clearing broker which may be pledged as collateral  the borrowing rate for such funds at december  was 
the company may seek to increase its capital position in the future to support additional growth 
the company is subject to the sec s net capital requirements 
the company s regulatory net capital has consistently exceeded such minimum net capital requirements 
as of december   the company had aggregate net capital  after required adjustments  of  which exceeded the minimum net capital requirements by  effects of inflation because the company s assets are largely liquid  and because securities inventories are carried at current market values  the impact of inflation is reflected in its consolidated financial statements 
however  the rate of inflation also affects expenses such as employee compensation  rent  and communications  and such effects may not be readily recoverable through increased commission rates  trading profits or fees 
to the extent that inflation has other adverse effects on prices and activities in the securities markets and  in particular  on interest rate conditions in the credit markets  it may adversely affect the company s financial position and results of operations
