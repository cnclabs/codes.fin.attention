since the emergence of the company from bankruptcy  management believes that it has been able to compete more effectively in the highly competitive consumer electronics and microwave oven industries in the united states and canada by combining innovative approaches to the company s current product line such as value added promotions  and augmenting its product line with higher margin complimentary products 
the company also intends to engage in the marketing of distribution  sourcing and other services to third parties 
in addition  the company intends to undertake efforts to expand the international distribution of its products into areas where management believes low to moderately priced  dependable consumer electronics and microwave oven products will have a broad appeal 
the company has in the past and intends in the future to pursue such plans either on its own or by forging new relationships  including license arrangements  partnerships  joint ventures or strategic mergers and acquistions of companies in similar or complimentary businesses 
in fiscal  the company successfully concluded licensing agreements for existing core business products and new products

short term liquidity 
at present  management believes that future cash flow from operations and the institutional financing noted above will be sufficient to fund all of the company s cash requirements for the next year 
the company s liquidity is impacted by the seasonality of its business

additionally  the company receives the largest percentage of customer returns in the quarter ending march the higher level of returns during this period adversely impacts the company s collection activity during this period  and therefore its liquidity 
the company believes that the agreements with the supplier as noted above and the return to vendor agreements should favorably impact the company s cash flow over their respective terms 
long term liquidity 
the revolving credit facility with the lender imposes financial covenants on the company that could materially affect its liquidity in the future 
however  management believes that the financing noted above and anticipated cash flow from operations in fiscal will provide sufficient liquidity to meet the company s operating and debt service cash requirements on a long term basis 
in november  the company s stockholders approved an amendment to the company s certificate of incorporation increasing the number of authorized shares of preferred stock from one million shares to ten million shares 
such additional shares provide management with the flexibility to take advantage of any opportunities that may occur for which additional capital would need to be raised or shares would be used to acquire a business 
inflation and foreign currency except as disclosed above  neither inflation nor currency fluctuations had a significant effect on the company s results of operations during fiscal  fiscal or fiscal the company s exposure to currency fluctuations has been minimized by the use of us dollar denominated purchase orders  and by sourcing production in more than one country 
however  the strength of the japanese yen in had raised the costs of certain raw materials and subassemblies of the company s suppliers which were passed on to the company in the form of price increases in fiscal the company was not able to recover such price increases from the selling price to its customers due to increased price competition 
however  the company has been able to negotiate lower prices from various sources of supply for certain audio products  commencing in the second half of fiscal and for certain video products commencing in fiscal the weakening of the value of the japanese yen in should enable the company to obtain further cost reductions from its suppliers
