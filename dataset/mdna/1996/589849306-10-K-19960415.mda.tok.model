item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company was founded in and has grown both through internal growth and acquisitions of other computer products distributors and an aggregator 
by  the company had achieved annual revenues of million  principally through internal expansion 
in april  the company acquired microamerica  inc microamerica  another worldwide distributor of microcomputer products  with net sales of approximately million for the year ended december  in the years following the microamerica acquisition  the company s revenues increased from billion in to billion in  partly reflecting substantial growth in both domestic and international sales as the worldwide market for computer products expanded and manufacturers increasingly turned to wholesale distributors for distribution of their products 
in addition  on january   the company completed the acquisition of certain assets of the franchise and aggregation business from vanstar corporation  which resulted in an additional billion in revenue in both and see business the franchise business and aggregation business and the franchise and aggregation business 
in  the company s revenues increased to billion  due to sales growth in existing distribution operations resulting from continued growth in the overall market for hardware and software products and an increase in the number of products certain vendors are selling through distribution 
the company s net income as a percentage of sales  or net margin  declined from and for and  respectively  to a loss of for  primarily due to certain adjustments recorded in the fourth quarter of see fourth quarter adjustments 
prior to these adjustments  the company s net loss as a percentage of sales for was 
this was primarily a result of declining gross profit margins resulting from continued competitive price pressures  an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses associated with the company s increase in net sales  an increase in interest expense and asset securitization fees resulting from higher borrowing levels to finance the company s higher sales levels and investments in warehouse facilities and computer systems 
the company anticipates that it will continue to face intense price competition 
in addition  the company s franchise and aggregation business generates lower gross margins than the company s core distribution business 
in and  the gross margin as a percentage of sales for the franchise and aggregation business was and  respectively  compared to and of net sales  respectively  for the core distribution business 
however  the franchise and aggregation business has lower selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales than the company s existing wholesale distribution business 
in and  the franchise and aggregation business selling  general and administration expenses were and of net sales  compared to and of net sales  respectively  for the company s core distribution business 
see the franchise and aggregation business 
management has undertaken various steps to reduce selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales  through  among other things  the establishment of business process reengineering teams in the united states which are developing improvements to existing practices 
no assurance can be given as to whether such reductions will  in fact  occur or as to the actual amount of any such reductions 
in addition  the company has determined to delay implementation of certain computer systems pursuant to its business plan in order to maximize cash flow 
in  in an attempt to address competitive pressures  the company assessed its cost structure and adopted a restructuring plan 
in the first and second quarters of  the company recorded an aggregate restructuring charge of million 
this restructuring charge primarily included reductions in the number of employees and the consolidation of warehouse facilities 
to the extent gross margins continue to decline and the company is not successful in sufficiently reducing selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales  the company will continue to experience a negative impact on its operating income 
fourth quarter adjustments in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded several large adjustments which reduced operating income by million 
approximately million of the charge resulted from adjustments to trade accounts payable balances 
an additional million charge was taken due to changes made in estimates to certain asset and liability values 
in the course of its business  merisel reconciles its accounts payable balances to statements provided by its vendors 
the accounts payable charge taken in the fourth quarter is related to adjustments for price protection  returns to vendors by merisel and inventory receipt related issues  such as short shipments  identified through the reconciliation process 
in order to minimize further supplier account reconciliation losses  in february merisel began implementing processes and procedures to address current system deficiencies and has engaged the assistance of outside consultants to assist in this process 
management has committed additional resources to assist in collecting a part of the charge that may be determined to be recoverable 
the company s european distribution center experienced system software start up problems which created substantial shipping and receiving errors  and resulted in an additional charge of million in the fourth quarter 
another million charge was taken to expense start up costs 
in addition  the company determined that portions of the carrying values of certain of its long lived assets and identifiable intangibles will not be recovered from their use in future operations 
accordingly  these assets were written down to their fair values as of december   requiring the recognition of impairment losses totaling million 
an adjustment was recorded related to the impairment of intangible assets associated with the company s computerland franchise business due to declining sales growth  margins and earnings  and the resulting negative trend in projected cash flows 
computerland s assets were acquired in january and included intangibles with a net book value of million at december  prior to write down 
fair value of the computerland long lived assets was measured by discounting expected future cash flows  which resulted in a required write down of million 
the company is in the process of converting its north american operations to new computer systems 
the company began designing the systems in early and converted its canadian operations to the new system in august the company has delayed installation of these systems in the united states beyond accumulated expenditures incurred to develop these systems have been significantly in excess of amounts originally expected 
therefore  given the cost overruns  the company s experience in canada  and the decision to delay united states installation beyond  it was determined that the value of these assets had been impaired 
total capitalized costs of these systems totaled million at december  a write down of million was recorded to adjust capitalized development costs to million 
this amount approximates the original budget for the project and represents the company s estimate of the fair value of these assets at december  see note to consolidated financial statements 
in march  the company sold its interest in its wholly owned australian subsidiary  merisel australia pty ltd 
to tech pacific holdings ltd 
under the terms of the agreement  the company received consideration of million in the form of repayment of certain intercompany debt obligations 
the company recognized a million charge as an impairment loss for the writedown of the australian net assets to their net realizable value 
these net assets  after write down  totaled million and were classified in the december  consolidated balance sheet as other current assets 
the sale was made in order to better position the company to achieve its strategic growth objectives  by abandoning its planned expansion into asia and at the same time disposing of an unprofitable business 
prior to the million charge  the australian subsidiary reported a loss of million for adjustments totaling million were booked in the fourth quarter of  primarily due to changes made in estimates to certain asset and liability values

variability of quarterly results and seasonality historically  the company has experienced variability in its net sales and operating margins on a quarterly basis and expects these patterns to continue in the future 
management believes that the factors influencing quarterly variability include i the overall growth in the microcomputer industry  ii shifts in short term demand for the company s products resulting  in part  from the introduction of new products or updates of existing products  and iii the fact that virtually all sales in a given quarter result from orders booked in that quarter 
due to the factors noted above  as well as the fact that the company participates in a highly dynamic industry  the company s revenues and earnings may be subject to material volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
additionally  the company s net sales in the fourth quarter have been higher than in its other three quarters 
management believes that the pattern of higher fourth quarter sales is partially explained by customer buying patterns relating to calendar year end business purchases and holiday period purchases 
as a result of this pattern the company s cash requirements in the fourth quarter have typically been greater

the franchise and aggregation business as a result of the computerland acquisition  merisel  through the computerland franchise business and datago aggregation business  now operates as a master reseller of computer systems and related products from the major microcomputer manufacturers to a network of approximately independently owned computer products resellers  including computerland franchisees and affiliated resellers purchasing through the datago program 
see business the franchise business and aggregation business 
the company acquired the franchise and aggregation business on january  for the eleven months ended december  and the year ended december   the franchise and aggregation business generated net sales for both periods of billion  gross profit of million and million  and income loss from operations of million and million respectively 
the operating loss includes a million write down of intangible assets related to the computerland franchise operations 
see business the franchise business and aggregation business 
before this write down  income from operations was million in this write down was reported as an impairment loss in the income statement 
gross margin and sg a as a percentage of net sales were and in  and and in  respectively  reflecting the lower margins and lower sg a incurred in the master reseller  or aggregator  business as compared to the company s core distribution business 
the franchise and aggregation business operating margin as a percentage of net revenues for was 
the company anticipates downward pressure on gross margins as a result of intense price competition and the effect of revised pricing structure offered to new and existing franchisees 
see business the franchise business and aggregation business 
for the eleven months ended december  and the year ended december   approximately of the franchise and aggregation business revenues were generated from the sale of products from four manufacturers apple  compaq  hewlett packard and ibm 
the loss of any one of these four manufacturers  or a change in the way any of these manufacturers markets  prices or distributes its products  could have a material adverse effect on the franchise and aggregation business operating and financial results 
in  a change by one of these manufacturers has allowed certain of the company s larger customers to purchase product directly from this manufacturer 
specifically  to the extent that one of the leading four manufacturers changes its current system of limiting authorization to sell its products to master resellers  the franchise and aggregation business sales levels would be adversely affected 
the company believes  however  that its distribution business may benefit from such changes 
all of the franchise and aggregation business franchisees are electronically linked for the purpose of order placement and other communications  reducing the need for sales representatives and support personnel in comparison to the company s existing business 
in addition  over of the franchise and aggregation business customers currently finance their orders through floor plan financing companies or pay on a cod basis  reducing the need for credit and collection personnel and reducing financing costs because of improved cash flow 
as a result of the foregoing as well as other factors  master resellers such as the franchise and aggregation business tend to generate both lower gross margins and lower operating expenses as a percentage of sales than those generated by the company in its existing distribution business 
competition among master resellers is intense see business competition  and the franchise and aggregation business may experience downward pressure on its gross margins due to competitive pricing decisions 
under a services agreement with vanstar  vanstar extended credit to the company  and performs a significant portion of the franchise and aggregation business distribution functions for a contractually agreed upon fee through april  as a result of this outsourcing arrangement  the franchise and aggregation business does not directly control the costs of those distribution functions  and therefore will be limited in its ability to lower its costs in response to a lower gross margin environment during the term of the services agreement 
due to this limitation  the services agreement provides that the service fee  as a percentage of sales volume  decreases if the franchise and aggregation business sales volume increases over a specified amount 
notwithstanding this contractual provision  a material decline in the franchise and aggregation business gross margin could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
over of the franchise and aggregation business sales currently are financed on behalf of its customers by floor plan financing companies 
the franchise and aggregation business typically receives payment from these financing companies within three business days from the date of sale  resulting in reduced cash requirements for the franchise and aggregation business as compared to the company s existing wholesale distribution business 
this floor plan financing is typically subsidized for the franchise and aggregation business customers by its manufacturers 
any material change in the availability or the terms of financing offered by such financing companies or in the subsidies provided by manufacturers could require the franchise and aggregation business to provide such financing to its customers  thereby substantially increasing the working capital necessary to operate its business

the increases in inventories and accounts receivable were primarily related to the company s higher sales volumes  especially in december the increase in accounts payable was due to increased purchasing associated with the higher sales volumes 
net cash used for investing activities in was million  consisting of property and equipment expenditures 
the expenditures for property and equipment were primarily for the upgrading of the company s computer systems  expenditures for a new warehouse management system and the upgrading of existing facilities and leasehold improvements

in light of the company s current business plan to maximize its cash flow during fiscal  management does not expect  nor does the business plan assume  that the company will return to profitability until the fourth quarter of the company s amended debt agreements with the lenders under the revolving credit agreement  senior notes and subordinated notes require principal payments of approximately million in the remainder of and million in  based on the amounts outstanding at march  assuming successful implementation of the existing business plan  and that the company does not experience any significant changes to payment terms or product availability from its key vendors  the company believes it can satisfy its amortization requirements in without additional financing or asset sales or debt restructuring 
however  in light of the significant principal payments required in  as well as other obligations described herein  the company will not be able to finance its operations or amortize its debt in without engaging in significant asset sales  refinancing its borrowings  obtaining new sources of financing  or some combination thereof 
while the company believes it will be able to successfully implement its business plan and implement one or more of the foregoing strategies which will enable it to meet its obligations in  there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so 
asset management merisel attempts to manage its inventory position to maintain levels sufficient to achieve high product availability and same day order fill rates 
inventory levels may vary from period to period  due in part to increases or decreases in sales levels  merisel s practice of making large volume purchases when it deems the terms of such purchases to be attractive and the addition of new manufacturers and products 
the company has negotiated agreements with many of its manufacturers which contain stock balancing and price protection provisions intended to reduce  in part  merisel s risk of loss due to slow moving or obsolete inventory or manufacturer price reductions 
the company is not assured that these agreements will succeed in reducing this risk 
in the event of a manufacturer price reduction  the company generally receives a credit for products in inventory 
in addition  the company has the right to return a certain percentage of purchases  subject to certain limitations 
historically  price protection and stock return privileges as well as the company s inventory management procedures have helped to reduce the risk of loss of carrying inventory 
the company offers credit terms to qualifying customers and also sells on a prepay  credit card and cash on delivery basis 
the company also offers financing for its sales to certain of its customers through various floor plan financing companies 
with respect to credit sales  the company attempts to control its bad debt exposure through monitoring of customers creditworthiness and  where practicable  through participation in credit associations that provide credit rating information about its customers 
in certain markets  the company may elect to purchase credit insurance for certain accounts
