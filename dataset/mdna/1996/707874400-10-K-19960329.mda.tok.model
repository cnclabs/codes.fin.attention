the company s principal products are individual fixed  defined benefit accident and health insurance policies covering long term skilled  intermediate and custodial nursing home care  home health care  hospital care and policies that supplement medicare benefits 
the company s underwriting practices rely upon the base of experience which it has developed over twenty years of providing nursing home care insurance  as well as upon available industry and actuarial information 
during recent years  the company has expanded its insurance products to include home health care insurance policies  an important segment of the company s business and of the accident and health insurance industry nationwide 
as the home health care market has developed  the company has encouraged the purchase of both nursing home care and home health care coverage  and has introduced new life insurance products as well  thus providing policyholders with enhanced protection while broadening the company s policy base 
in late  the company introduced an independent living policy which provides coverage over the full term of the policy for services furnished by a homemaker or companion who is not a qualified or licensed care provider 
in  long term nursing home care and home health care policies accounted for approximately of the company s annualized premiums in force and nearly of its consolidated revenues 
the company and the insurers are subject to the insurance laws and regulations of each state in which they are licensed to write insurance 
these laws and regulations govern matters such as payment of dividends  settlement of claims and loss ratios 
premiums charged for insurance products must be approved by state regulatory authorities 
in addition  the company and the insurers are required to establish and maintain reserves with respect to reported and incurred but not reported losses  as well as estimated future benefits payable under the company s insurance policies 
these reserves must  at a minimum  comply with mandated standards 
the company s results of operations are affected significantly by the following factors level of required reserves for policies in force 
the amount of reserves relating to reported and unreported claims incurred is determined by periodically evaluating historical claims experience and statistical information with respect to the probable number and nature of such claims 
claim reserves reflect actual experience through the most recent time period and policy reserves reflect expectations of claims related to a block of business over its entire life 
the company compares actual experience with estimates and adjusts its reserves on the basis of such comparisons 
revisions to reserves are reflected in the company s results of operations through benefits to policyholders expense 
policy premium levels 
the company attempts to set premium levels to ensure profitability  subject to the constraints of competitive market conditions and state regulatory approvals 
deferred acquisition costs 
in connection with the sale of its insurance policies  the company defers and amortizes a portion of the policy acquisition costs over the related premium paying periods of the life of the policy 
these costs include all expenses directly related to the acquisition of the policy  including commissions  underwriting and other policy issue expenses 
the amortization of deferred acquisition costs is determined using the same projected actuarial assumptions used in computing policy reserves 
deferred acquisition costs can be affected by unanticipated termination of policies because  upon such unanticipated termination  the company is required to expense fully the deferred acquisition costs associated with the terminated policy 
the number of years a policy has been in effect 
claims costs tend to be higher on policies which have been in force for a longer period of time 
as the policy ages  it is more likely that the insured will have need for services covered by the policy 
on the other hand  the longer the policy is in effect  the more premium the company will receive 
investment income 
the company s investment portfolio consists primarily of high grade fixed income securities 
income generated from this portfolio is largely dependent upon prevailing levels of interest rates 
a small percentage of the company s investment portfolio is committed to high quality large capitalization common stocks 
other factors which affect the company s results of operations are lapsation and persistency  both of which relate to the renewal of insurance policies  and first year compared to renewal premiums 
lapsation is the termination of a policy by nonrenewal and  pursuant to the company s policy  is automatic if and when premiums become more than days overdue  however  policies may be reinstated  if approved by the company  within six months after the policy lapses 
conversely  persistency represents the percentage of premiums renewed  which the company calculates by dividing the total annual premiums at the end of each year less first year business for that year by the total annual premiums in force for the prior year 
for purposes of this calculation  a decrease in total annual premiums in force at the end of any year would be a result of non renewal of policies  including those policies that have terminated by reason of death  lapse due to nonpayment of premiums  and or conversion to other policies offered by the company 
first year premiums are premiums covering the first twelve months a policy is in force 
renewal premiums are premiums covering all subsequent periods 
quarterly data the unaudited quarterly data for the company for each quarter of and have been derived from unaudited financial statements and include all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring accruals  which the company considers necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for these periods 
such quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of the company s future results of operations

changes in accounting principles 
in the first quarter of the company retroactively adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
under the asset and liability method provided for by sfas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities by applying enacted statutory tax rates 
in  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting and reporting of short duration and long duration contracts 
this statement established the conditions a reinsurance contract must meet in order to be accounted for as such 
in addition  it eliminates the industry practice of reporting financial statement items  net of the effects of reinsurance 
sfas did not impact the company s results of operations  other than the financial statement presentation 
in may  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
refer to liquidity and capital resources for discussion of adoption 
new accounting principles 
in october  statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  was issued 
sfas no 
 which is effective january   provides an alternative method of accounting for stock based compensation arrangements  based on fair value of the stock based compensation determined by an option pricing model utilizing various assumptions regarding the underlying attributes of the options and the company s stock 
the accounting under sfas no 
differs from the existing method of accounting for stock based compensation which is provided in accounting principles board opinion no 
apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
the financial accounting standards board encourages entities to adopt the fair value based method  but does not require the adoption of this method 
for those entities that continue to apply apb  pro forma disclosure of the effects  if adopted  of sfas no 
on net income and earnings per share would be required in the financial statements 
the company will continue to apply apb no 
and  therefore  there will be no impact on the financial position and results of operation 
impact of increases in cost of medical care 
increases in the cost of medical care tend to increase the need for insurance 
many policyholders who once had adequate insurance coverage increased their insurance coverage to provide the same relative financial benefit and protection 
the increases in medical costs lead to accident and health policies requiring higher benefits and an increased need for the products 
consequently  the company offers riders to its insurance policies which provide for increases in policyholder benefits each year in the amount of compounded annually on the anniversary date of the policy for years or to age  whichever occurs first  or for the lifetime of the policyholder  as is mandated in certain states 
the adequacy of premium rates in relation to the level of health claims is constantly monitored by the company and  where appropriate  premium rates on such policies are increased as policy benefits increase 
failure to make such increases commensurate with health care cost increases may result in a loss from health insurance operations 
liquidity and capital resources 
the company s consolidated liquidity requirements have historically been created and met from the operations of the insurers 
the company s primary sources of cash are premiums and investment income 
the primary uses of cash are policy acquisition costs principally commissions  payments to policyholders  investment purchases and general and administrative expenses 
the company invests in securities and other investments authorized by applicable state laws and regulations and follows an investment policy designed to maximize yield to the extent consistent with liquidity requirements and preservation of assets 
at december   the average maturity of the company s bond portfolio was years  and its market value exceeded cost by or  at december   the average maturity of the company s portfolios was years and its market value was below cost by or approximately  the company s equity portfolio exceeded costs by  or in and  or in on december   the company entered into an agreement with corestates bank  na  whereby a loan was extended to the company in an amount of  the proceeds of the loan were contributed to the surplus of ptlic in the form of cash to strengthen its overall capital position 
the company repaid this loan as required by the loan agreement  with a portion of the proceeds of the company s recent public offering of  shares of common stock 
the public offering was consummated on july  and the company realized net proceeds of  including the proceeds from the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option 
on january   the company adopted sfas the cumulative effect of adoption of sfas was an increase in shareholders equity of  net of taxes  for unrealized gains of  in the investment securities available for sale portfolio 
during the year ended december   the company experienced a decrease in unrealized gains of  as of december   shareholders equity was increased by  due to unrealized gains of  in the investment portfolio 
as of december  shareholders equity was decreased by  due to unrealized losses of  in the investment portfolio 
the capital position of the insurers was improved by the contribution of  of the net proceeds of the recent public offering to the capital and surplus of the insurers during the third quarter of during  the company contributed  in cash to ptlic 
during  the company contributed  in bonds to the insurers 
the company believes that the insurers capital and surplus presently meets or exceeds the requirements in all jurisdictions in which they each are licensed 
the company s continued growth is dependent upon its ability to i continue marketing efforts to expand its historical markets  ii continue to expand its network of agents and effectively market its products in states where the insurers are currently licensed and iii fund such marketing and expansion while at the same time maintaining minimum statutory levels of capital and surplus required to support such growth 
management believes that the funds necessary to accomplish the foregoing  including funds required to maintain adequate levels of statutory surplus in the insurers  can be met for at least the next months by funds generated from the company s recent public offering and from operations 
the long term care insurance industry is a subject of pending legislation in congress which  in its present form  provides for a number of modifications of existing law  including the tax deductibility of long term care insurance premiums and the implementation of minimum consumer protection standards to be included in all long term care insurance policies 
see government regulation 
there can be no assurance that such legislation will be enacted or  if enacted  that the current proposals will be included 
the company regularly evaluates potential acquisition opportunities and often makes preliminary inquiries to determine whether potential acquisition candidates might by interested in being acquired by the company 
the company periodically enters into negotiations with respect to such potential acquisition opportunities 
on march   the company signed an agreement with health insurance of vermont  inc hivt providing that the company will acquire hivt by means of a statutory merger with a subsidiary of the company 
completion of the merger is subject to approval of regulatory authorities  and to certain other conditions 
hivt is licensed to conduct business in states  including new jersey  west virginia  kansas  maine and massachusetts 
upon completion of the merger the company would be licensed in all states with the exception of new york 
the company currently has a license application pending in new york 
in the event the company i fails to maintain minimum loss ratios calculated in accordance with statutory guidelines  ii fails to meet other requirements mandated and enforced by regulatory authorities  iii has adverse claim experience in the future  iv is unable to obtain additional financing to support future growth  or v the economy continues to effect the buying power of senior citizens  the company s results of operations  liquidity and capital resources could be adversely affected
