the company cannot control  nor reliably predict which rules the fcc will issue and the effective dates thereof  although management expects future revenue growth from this product line 
sales of marine radio systems are expected to be consistent with past performance 
sales of marine instrumentation systems have declined over the last three years and are expected to stabilize at levels 
gross profit for was  of net sales  as compared to  of net sales in  an increase of  or 
the gross profit on narrowband products for was  of such sales  as compared to  of such sales in margins on narrowband products fluctuate based on product mix  and generally are higher on base station products than on mobile radios 
in the coming years  narrowband sales will likely be comprised of a greater proportion of mobile radios rather than base stations  and thus will likely achieve a lower overall percentage margin than was achieved for the gross profit on marine radio systems for was  of such sales  as compared to  of such sales  an increase of  or 
margins on marine communications products were higher in due to lower overall production costs rather than higher selling prices 
the gross profit on marine instrumentation systems for was  of such sales  as compared to  of such sales  a decrease of  or 
margins on marine instrumentation products were lower due to temporarily increased production costs associated with the move of marine instrumentation production to the mountlake terrace  washington facility 
margins for marine instrumentation are expected to improve in operating expenses including the restructuring charge of  were  of net sales in  as compared to  of net sales in  an increase of  or 
operating expenses excluding the restructuring charge increased  or 
selling expenses increased  due mainly to sales commissions on higher sales volume 
administrative expenses increased  due to higher professional fees  insurance  rent  and taxes other than income 
during the year the company established a special charge of  in connection with a restructuring program designed to improve productivity and permanently reduce costs 
the company decided to move corporate administrative functions and production of its datamarine instrumentation product line to its facility in mountlake terrace  washington 
costs associated with the restructuring included the write down of leasehold improvements  product tooling and equipment to net realizable values  the phase out of certain products  employee termination benefits  and the costs to settle the lease of the massachusetts facility 
the restructuring was announced effective january and is expected to be substantially completed by december  the program is expected to result in the permanent reduction of approximately employees and  square feet of manufacturing and office space 
the massachusetts location will continue to be used as a service facility 
the restructuring charges were comprised of  in write downs of production equipment and leasehold improvements   in write downs of inventory related to discontinued products   in employee termination benefits  and  in lease settlement costs 
of the total amount  represents estimated cash spending 
the resulting elimination of redundant production and administrative costs is expected to reduce future costs  improve cash flow and increase working capital 
no significant future uses of capital are expected to be required as a result of the restructuring 
interest expense for was  as compared to  for interest expense increased primarily as a result of increased prime based rates and balances outstanding 
other income  net  was approximately the same in and the company adopted fas  accounting for income taxes  effective october  upon adoption and at october   full valuation allowances were recorded with respect to the company s deferred tax asset balances due to uncertainty of future taxable income estimates 
during fiscal  the valuation allowance was reduced by  to reflect management s current assessment of the amount of deferred tax assets which are more likely realizable than not 
this assessment is based upon management s current estimates of future taxable income and reflects the substantial growth realized in sales of and order backlog for narrowband land mobile products since their introduction in fiscal  as well as the administrative cost reductions and manufacturing efficiencies achieved as a result of the restructuring activities 
based upon the current assessment  the company recognized a deferred federal income tax benefit of  in the year ended september  net income from continuing operations for was  compared to a loss of  in fiscal compared to net sales for increased by  or  to  from  in the increase in sales for was primarily due to product volume in narrowband products

the increase in operating expenses was related to selling expenses of narrowband products 
interest expense for was  as compared to  in the increase was due to increased prime based lending rates and larger balances 
net loss from continuing operations for narrowed by  to  from  in the decreased loss was primarily the result of increased sales of higher margin narrowband products and flat operating expenses  exclusive of selling costs 
impact of inflation the company s results are affected by the impact of inflation on manufacturing and operating costs 
historically  the company has used selling price adjustments  cost containment programs and improved operating efficiencies to offset the negative impact of inflation on its operations
