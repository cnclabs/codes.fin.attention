fiscal and same store sales exclude sales of taylor as historical branch level data is not available 
pss currently has service centers  of which were opened as start ups and of which resulted from the acquisition of regional and local medical supplies and equipment distributors 
a significant portion of the company s growth occurred recently with the merger of taylor 
in connection with the integration of taylor into pss  the company closed or merged into existing pss service centers of the taylor locations 
additionally  the company merged eight pss service centers into the eight remaining taylor locations  and established two additional service centers in connection with the taylor merger 
pss has grown the number of its sales representatives from in fiscal to in fiscal the company s sales representatives focus on a consultative and comprehensive sales approach with an emphasis on sophisticated diagnostic products 
the company invested approximately million in the training and development of its sales representatives and management in fiscal in addition  the company has implemented iconsm  a four pound  pen top  portable computer system for use by its sales representatives

beginning in fiscal year and continuing through fiscal year  the company refocused its pricing and its customer focused marketing strategies 
based on the company s desire to increase penetration of existing accounts  to increase aggregate sales and gross profit  and to position itself for better penetration of larger physician group practices and various forms of managed care networks  the company in fiscal year reduced its sales prices on its top volume supplies and pharmaceutical products 
also  the company established network plussm  a physician group purchasing program  under which  when a physician office guarantees at least of its purchase volume to pss  then the company will  in return  guarantee the lowest sales prices on certain products as well as certain service guarantees 
to fulfill this guarantee  the company has successfully negotiated lower vendor pricing on its high volume and network plussm products 
despite the lower prices guaranteed to pss network plussm customers  the company has been able to increase its service center sales growth and its aggregate gross profit 
the change in pricing strategy has contributed to reducing the overall gross profit percentage of the company by and in fiscal and  respectively 
despite the decrease in gross profit percentage  the company has maintained its operating profit margin in fiscal and improved its operating profit margin by in fiscal  excluding the effect of merger costs in fiscal year and restructuring charges in fiscal year the improved profitability is primarily the result of lower servicing and operating costs as a percentage of net sales due to i greater penetration of its existing customer base  ii expansion through acquisition rather than start ups which initially entail greater start up costs as a percentage of net sales  and iii expanding its marketing focus to penetrate larger group practices and managed care networks with lower selling and service requirement costs 
management believes the company s current gross profits are consistent with the company s long term strategy 
the following is management s discussion and analysis of certain additional factors which have affected the company s financial position and operating results during fiscal years   and  giving retroactive effect to the merger with taylor

same store sales growth approximated for fiscal year the first year performance goals as set forth in the abbott agreement were met with pss realizing approximately million in incremental net sales of abbott products during fiscal year excluding taylor  company acquisitions and start ups added to the growth in fiscal year net sales with approximately million of net sales resulting from the acquisition of nine local and regional medical suppliers and million of net sales generated by four company start ups  one of which was merged into an acquired taylor location during fiscal year gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  for the fiscal year ended compared to the fiscal year ended the increase in gross profit dollars is attributable to the sales growth described above 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was and for the fiscal years ended and  respectively 
the decrease in gross profit percentage as a percentage of net sales is attributable to the penetration by the company into larger physician group practices that require more competitive pricing but entail lower selling and servicing costs 
the decrease in gross profit percentage is also attributable to lower margins on diagnostic products distributed under the abbott agreement 
margins under the abbott agreement are scheduled to increase annually based on achievement by the company of certain performance goals as stipulated therein 
for the fiscal year ended  the company sold approximately million of abbott product with a gross profit percentage of 
also the company s gross profits include first year reimbursements by abbott for gross profit on direct sales by abbott to pss customers as set forth in the abbott agreement 
these reimbursements totaled million during fiscal year effectively raising gross profit by 
the abbott sales  net of direct reimbursements  negatively impacted the company s gross profit percentage by 
also positively impacting gross profits are vendor performance incentives  in addition to the abbott direct sales reimbursements  earned by pss through the achievement of certain predetermined company purchase and sales levels 
these performance incentives totaled million and million for the fiscal years ended and  respectively
