item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides additional information regarding the financial condition and the results of operations for the company for each of the years ended december   and this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein 
selected consolidated financial information net income for the year ended december  was million  reflecting a net increase of million or a increase compared to net income of million for the year ended december  the earnings per share of for the year ended december  increased or compared to the earnings per share of for the year ended december  earnings performance for the year ended december  reflected gains in net interest income and an increase in noninterest income 
these positive factors were partially offset by an increase in provision for loan losses and noninterest expenses 
a more detailed description of the results of operations is included in the material that follows 
during august  texas state bank completed the rgc roma branch acquisitions which included the purchase of million in loans and the assumption of approximately million in deposit liabilities of these banking locations 
this transaction was accounted for as a purchase  therefore  the results of operations of the two banking locations are included in the consolidated financial statements of the company from the date of acquisition 
purchase accounting adjustments for the purchase of loans and the assumption of deposit liabilities of these banking locations were immaterial 
on march   the company acquired  through merger  mid valley bank  weslaco  texas 
simultaneously with the acquisition of mid valley bank  both the surviving bank in that merger transaction and harlingen state bank  harlingen  texas  a subsidiary of the company  merged with and into texas state bank and the former weslaco and harlingen banks became banking locations of texas state bank 
the mid valley bank merger was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  certain income statement and balance sheet comparisons during calendar and and at year end and  respectively  may not be appropriate 
analysis of results of operations net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest earned on assets and interest expense incurred for the funds supporting those assets 
the largest category of earning assets consists of loans 
the second largest category of earning assets is investment securities  followed by federal funds sold 
for analytical purposes  income from tax exempt assets  primarily securities issued by state and local governments or authorities  is adjusted by an increment which equates tax exempt income to interest from taxable assets 
earning assets are financed by consumer and commercial deposits and short term borrowings 
in addition to these interest bearing funds  assets also are supported by interest free funds  primarily demand deposits and shareholders equity 
variations in the volume and mix of assets and liabilities  and their relative sensitivity to interest rate movements  determine changes in net interest income 
taxable equivalent net interest income was million for the year ended december   an increase of million or compared to the year ended december   and taxable equivalent net interest income of million for the year ended december   increased million or compared to the year ended december  both net interest income and the yield on earning assets were reduced by interest foregone on nonaccrual and renegotiated loans 
if interest on those loans had been accrued at the original contractual rates  additional interest income would have approximated   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the net yield on total interest earning assets  also referred to as interest rate margin  represents net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
since a significant portion of the company s funding is derived from interest free sources  primarily demand deposits and shareholders equity  the effective rate paid for all funds is lower than the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities alone 
as the following table illustrates  the interest rate margin of for the year ended december  increased basis points compared to for the year ended december  while the interest rate margin of for the year ended december  increased basis points compared to for the year ended december  the increase in the interest rate margin for the year ended december  is reflective of the shift in the mix of interest earning assets to loans from lower yielding investment securities  including federal funds sold  which contributed to an increase in yield on interest earning assets during the year 
the mix of interest earning assets was changed by total average loans of million increasing million or  total average investment securities of million increasing  or and average federal funds sold of million increasing million or 
the increase in loan yield reflects the general increase in average interest rates in compared to the increase in investment securities yield resulted from lower yielding investment securities maturing and the reinvesting of the proceeds into higher yields 
the increase in interest on deposits during the year ended december  resulted primarily from increased volume and the higher average rate paid compared to the previous year 
the following table presents for the last three calendar years the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest earning assets and the resultant yields  as well as the average interest bearing liabilities  expressed both in dollars and rates 
average balances are derived from average daily balances and the yields and costs are established by dividing income or expense by the average balance of the asset or liability 
income and yield on interest earning assets include amounts to convert tax exempt income to a taxable equivalent basis  assuming a effective income tax rate

personnel expense of million for the year ended december  increased  or compared to year ended december  levels of million

net occupancy expense of million for the year ended december  increased  or compared to  for the year ended december   and net occupancy expense of  for the year ended december  increased  or when compared to a net occupancy expense of  for the year ended december  the increase for the year ended december  is primarily attributable to the occupancy expenses associated with the rgc roma branch acquisitions 
equipment expense of million for the year ended december  increased  or compared to million for the year ended december  and equipment expense of million for the year ended december  increased  or when compared with million for the year ended december  the equipment expense increase noted during the year ended december  is primarily attributable to equipment obtained in the rgc roma branch acquisitions and equipment acquired to service the company s increasing customer base

analysis of financial condition balance sheet composition the company continues to experience growth in total assets  deposits and loans attributable in the opinion of management  in part to the vitality of the rio grande valley economy and in part to the rgc roma branch acquisitions 
the recent devaluation of the mexican peso relative to the us dollar has reduced retail sales to mexican nationals 
however  the effects of nafta and the devaluation have also increased cross border trade and industrial development including activity at twin manufacturing plants located on each side of the border referred to as maquiladoras which benefit the rio grande valley economy 
management does not believe that the recent mexican financial problems will materially adversely affect the company s growth and earnings prospects 
average interest earning assets of million increased million or for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  and million or for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  management s continued focus on lending has resulted in average loans increasing million or to million for the year ended december  compared to december  levels of million  while average investment securities of million increased  or for the year ended december  compared to december  levels of million

average interest bearing deposits increased million or to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  levels of million 
demand deposits also increased million or for the year ended december  to million compared to the year ended december  levels of million partially as a result of the increase in public funds from several local municipalities and independent school districts

at december   cash and due from banks was million  million less than at december  investment securities in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
statement  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
statement established standards of financial accounting and reporting for investments in equity securities that have a readily determinable fair value and for all investments in debt securities 
at acquisition  the bank is required to classify debt and equity securities into one of three categories held to maturity  trading or available for sale 
at each reporting date  the appropriateness of the classification is reassessed 
investments in debt securities are classified as held to maturity and measured at amortized cost in the consolidated balance sheet only if management has the positive intent and ability to hold those securities to maturity 
securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading and measured at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet with unrealized holding gains and losses included in earnings 
investments not classified as either held to maturity or trading are classified as available for sale and measured at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet with unrealized holding gains and losses reported in a separate component of shareholders equity until realized 
effective december   the company adopted statement  which caused various investment securities to be reclassified from held to maturity to available for sale 
all treasury and agency bonds with a maturity of two years or less from december   all floating rate bonds and two small equity securities were reclassified to available for sale 
during  management continued classifying bonds purchased with a final maturity of two years or less as available for sale 
during  management has classified bonds purchased with a final maturity of three years or less as available for sale 
all other bonds have been classified as held to maturity 
future purchases of investment securities will be classified as available for sale or held to maturity at time of purchase as determined by the investment committee 
on october   the fasb decided to grant to all entities a one time opportunity during the period from approximately the middle of november to december   to reconsider their intent and ability to hold securities accounted for as held to maturity under statement this opportunity allowed entities to transfer securities from the held to maturity category to available for sale or trading without calling into question their intent to hold other debt securities to maturity 
on december   the bank transferred approximately million in held to maturity securities to the available for sale category resulting in no change to shareholders equity per share 
as a result of this transfer  all other securities are classified as available for sale

loans the company manages its credit risk by establishing and implementing strategies and guidelines appropriate to the characteristics of borrowers  industries  geographic locations and products 
diversification of risk within each of these areas is a primary objective 
policies and procedures are developed to ensure that loan commitments conform to current strategies and guidelines 
management continues to refine the company s credit policies and procedures to address the risks in the current and prospective environment and to reflect management s current strategic focus 
the credit process is controlled with continuous credit review and analysis  and by review by internal and external auditors and regulatory authorities 
the company s loans are widely diversified by borrower and industry group 
the company has collateral management policies in place so that collateral lending of all types is approached  to the extent possible  on a basis consistent with safe and sound standards 
valuation analysis is utilized to take into consideration the potentially adverse economic conditions under which liquidation could occur 
collateral accepted against the commercial loan portfolio includes accounts receivable and inventory  marketable securities  equipment and agricultural products 
autos  deeds of trust  life insurance and marketable securities are accepted as collateral for the installment loan portfolio 
management of the company believes that the company has benefitted from increased loan demand due to passage of nafta and the strong population growth in the rio grande valley 
more recently  the devaluation of the mexican peso relative to the us dollar has reduced retail sales to residents of mexico 
however  the effects of nafta and the devaluation have also increased cross border trade and industrial development including activity at twin manufacturing plants located on each side of the border referred to as maquiladoras which benefit the rio grande valley economy 
management believes the current mexican financial problems will not have a material adverse effect on the company s growth and earnings prospects 
total loans of million for the year ended december  increased million or compared to the year ended december  levels of million and increased million or for the year ended december  compared to levels of million at december  the increase in total loans for the year ended december  is primarily attributable to the rgc roma branch acquisitions  funding a large leveraged employee stock ownership trust loan and management s efforts to improve the earnings mix of earning assets by increasing loan volume 
the increase in commercial loans in general  and commercial tax exempt loans in particular  for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the funding of a million employee stock ownership trust loan which is collateralized by stock and assets of the employer and approximately million of cash and cash equivalent assets 
excluding this loan  total commercial loans at december  represented an increase of million  or  compared to levels at december   and total loans at december  represented an increase of million  or  compared to levels at december  a substantial portion of the increase in loans classified as real estate commercial mortgage loans consists of loans secured by real estate and other assets to commercial customers 
the increase in total loans for the year ended december  is primarily due to the acquisition of mid valley bank 
the following table presents the composition of the loan portfolio at the end of each of the last five years december  loan portfolio composition in thousands commercial      commercial tax exempt  total commercial loans      agricultural      real estate construction      commercial mortgage      agricultural mortgage      family mortgage      consumer      total loans      the contractual maturity schedule of the loan portfolio at december  is presented in the following table loan maturities december  after one one year year through after or less five years five years total in thousands commercial     commercial tax exempt     agricultural    real estate construction    commercial mortgage     agricultural mortgage     family mortgage     consumer    total     variable rate loans     fixed rate loans     total     as shown in the preceding table  loans maturing within one year totaled million at year end the company s policy on maturity extensions and rollovers is based on management s assessment of individual loans 
approvals for the extension or renewal of loans without reduction of principal for more than one twelve month period are generally avoided  unless the loans are fully secured or are revolving lines subject to annual analysis and renewal 
nonperforming assets the bank has several procedures in place to assist in maintaining the overall quality of its loan portfolio 
the bank has established underwriting guidelines to be followed by its officers and monitors its delinquency levels for any negative or adverse trends  particularly with respect to credits which have total exposures of  or more 
nonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans  loans for which the interest rate has been renegotiated below originally contracted rates and real estate or other assets that have been acquired in partial or full satisfaction of loan obligations 
at december   five loan relationships in excess of  totaling million accounted for of the total nonaccrual loans 
these five nonaccrual credits are secured primarily by real estate  and management believes that it is unlikely that any material loss will be incurred on disposition of the collateral 
the remaining nonaccrual loans represent loans of less than  each 
the company s policy generally is to place a loan on nonaccrual status when payment of principal or interest is contractually past due days  or earlier when concern exists as to the ultimate collection of principal and interest 
at the time a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  interest previously accrued but uncollected is reversed and charged against current income 
loans which are contractually days or more past due  which are both well secured or guaranteed by financially responsible third parties and in the process of collection  generally are not placed on nonaccrual status 
the amount of such accruing loans days or more past due for the years ended december   and totaled   and  respectively 
the increase in accruing loans days or more past due at december  as compared to december  is partly attributable to two credits over  included in the category  both of which are in the process of collection 
nonperforming assets of million at december  decreased million or compared to december  levels of million and decreased  or for the year ended december  compared to december  levels of million 
management actively seeks buyers for all other real estate 
see noninterest expense above 
the ratio of nonperforming assets plus accruing loans days or more past due as a percent of total loans and other nonperforming assets at december  decreased to from at december  due primarily to the reduction in other nonperforming assets and the addition of million of performing loans from the rgc roma branch acquisitions 
management is not aware of any borrower relationships that are not reported as nonperforming where management has serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms which would cause nonperforming assets to increase materially 
effective january   the company adopted statement and the amendment thereof  statement under statement  a loan is considered impaired when  based upon current information and events  it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
statement requires that an impaired loan be valued utilizing i the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate of the loan  ii the fair value of the underlying collateral  or iii the observable market price of the loan 
statement amended statement by expanding the related disclosure requirements and permitting use of existing methods for recognizing interest income on impaired loans 
at december   the company had a million recorded investment in impaired loans for which there was a related allowance for loan losses of  at december   there were no impaired loans for which there was no related allowance for loan losses 
the average level of impaired loans during the year ended december  was million 
the company recorded interest income of  on its impaired loans during the year ended december  an analysis of the components of nonperforming assets for the last five years is presented in the following table december  nonperforming assets dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans      renegotiated loans nonperforming loans      other nonperforming assets primarily other real estate      total nonperforming assets      accruing loans days or more past due total nonperforming assets and accruing loans days or more past due      nonperforming loans as a of total loans nonperforming assets as a of total loans and other nonperforming assets nonperforming assets as a of total assets nonperforming assets plus accruing loans days or more past due as a of total loans and other nonperforming assets interest income that would have been recorded for the year ended december  on nonaccrual and renegotiated loans had such loans performed in accordance with their original contractual terms and been outstanding throughout the year ended december   or since origination  if held for only part of that year  was approximately  for the year ended december   the amount of interest income actually recorded on nonaccrual and restructured loans was approximately  management regularly reviews and monitors the loan portfolio to identify borrowers experiencing financial difficulties 
management believes that  at december   all such loans had been identified and included in the nonaccrual  restructured or days past due loan totals reflected in the table above 
management continues to emphasize maintaining a low level of nonperforming assets and returning nonperforming assets to an earning status 
allowance for loan losses management analyzes the loan portfolio to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the appropriate provision required to maintain an adequate allowance 
in assessing the adequacy of the allowance  management reviews the size  quality and risks of loans in the portfolio and considers factors such as specific known risks  past experience  the status and amount of nonperforming assets and economic conditions 
a specific percentage is allocated to total loans in good standing and additional amounts are added for individual loans considered to have specific loss potential 
loans identified as losses are charged off 
in addition  the loan review committee of the bank reviews the assessments of management in determining the adequacy of the bank s allowance for loan losses 
based on total allocations  the provision is recorded to maintain the allowance at a level deemed appropriate by management 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  there can be no assurance that future additions to the allowance will not be necessary 
the allowance for loan losses at december  was million  which represents an increase of million or as compared to the allowance for loan losses at december  management believes that the allowance for loan losses at december  adequately reflects the risks in the loan portfolio 
various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses

in december  the mexican government announced a devaluation of the mexican peso relative to the united states dollar  and the mexican peso has since continued to decline relative to the dollar 
the company does not anticipate any negative impact on foreign deposits due to these recent devaluations of the peso 
the increase in foreign deposits is primarily attributable to mexican deposits obtained with the rgc roma branch acquisitions

insufficient liquidity can result in higher costs of obtaining funds  while excessive liquidity can lead to a decline in earnings due to the cost of foregoing alternative investments 
the ability to renew and acquire additional deposit liabilities is a major source of liquidity 
the company s principal sources of funds are primarily within the local markets of the bank and consist of deposits  interest and principal payments on loans and investment securities  sales of loans and investment securities and borrowings 
see previous discussion regarding the maturity dates for loans  investment securities and deposits 
asset liquidity is provided by cash and assets which are readily marketable  or which can be pledged  or which will mature in the near future 
these include cash  federal funds sold and us government backed securities 
at december   the company s liquidity ratio  defined as cash  us government backed securities and federal funds sold as a percentage of deposits  was compared to at december  and compared to at december  the company s liquidity ratio has declined as a result of management s efforts to improve the company s earnings mix by increasing loan volume 
liability liquidity is provided by access to core funding sources  principally various customers interest bearing and noninterest bearing deposit accounts in the company s trade area 
the company does not have or nor does it solicit brokered deposits 
federal funds purchased and short term borrowings are additional sources of liquidity 
these sources of liquidity are short term in nature and are used  as necessary  to fund asset growth and meet short term liquidity needs 
during  funds for million of investment purchases and million of net loan growth came from various sources  including a net increase in deposits of million  million in proceeds from sale of investment securities  million in proceeds from maturing investment securities and million of net income 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia requires that federal bank regulatory authorities take prompt corrective action with respect to any depository institution which does not meet specified minimum capital requirements 
the applicable regulations establish five capital levels which require or permit the frb and other regulatory authorities to take supervisory action 
the relevant classifications range from well capitalized to critically undercapitalized 
the classifications are generally determined by applicable ratios of the institution  including tier i capital to risk weighted assets  total capital to risk weighted assets and leverage ratios 
based on texas state bank s capital ratios at december   texas state bank was classified as well capitalized under the applicable regulations 
as a result  the company does not believe that the prompt corrective action regulations have any material effect on the activities or operations of the company or texas state bank 
the principal sources of liquidity for the company during were the proceeds from the sale of million shares of common stock and interest income of  from the bank 
the funds received were used primarily to pay common stock dividends and other expenses 
the company is dependent on dividend and interest income from the bank and the sale of stock for its liquidity 
applicable frb regulations provide that bank holding companies are permitted by regulatory authorities to pay cash dividends on their common or preferred stock if consolidated earnings and consolidated capital are within regulatory guidelines and the bank is classified as well capitalized for purposes of fdicia 
the funds management policy of the company and the bank is to maintain a reasonably balanced position of rate sensitive assets and liabilities to avoid adverse changes in net interest income 
changes in net interest income occur when interest rates on loans and investments change in a different time period from that of changes in interest rates on liabilities  or when the mix and volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities change 
the interest rate sensitivity gap represents the dollar amount of difference between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities within a given time period gap 
a gap ratio is determined by dividing rate sensitive assets by rate sensitive liabilities 
a ratio of indicates a perfectly matched position  in which case the effect on net interest income due to interest rate movements would be zero 
rate sensitive assets maturing within one year exceeded rate sensitive liabilities with comparable maturities at december  by million 
management monitors the rate sensitivity gap on a regular basis and takes steps when appropriate to improve the sensitivity 
the ratio of cumulative rate sensitivity gap to total assets at a period of twelve months or less was of interest earning assets at december  the following table summarizes interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities by maturity at december  december  over interest rate sensitivity analysis months months months years years total dollars in thousands loans       investment securities available for sale       held to maturity       federal funds sold   total interest earning assets       savings   money market checking and savings accounts   time deposits       federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements total interest bearing liabilities       rate sensitivity gap       cumulative rate sensitivity gap      ratio of cumulative rate sensitivity gap to total assets ratio of cumulative rate sensitive interest earning assets to cumulative rate sensitive interest bearing liabilities rate sensitive interest earning assets less rate sensitive interest bearing liabilities 
effects of inflation financial institutions are impacted differently by inflation than are industrial companies 
while industrial and manufacturing companies generally have significant investments in inventories and fixed assets  financial institutions ordinarily do not have such investments 
as a result  financial institutions are generally in a better position than industrial companies to respond to inflationary trends by monitoring the spread between interest costs and interest income yields through adjustments of maturities and interest rates of assets and liabilities 
in addition  inflation tends to increase demand for loans from financial institutions as industrial companies attempt to maintain a constant level of goods in inventory and assets 
as consumers of goods and services  financial institutions are affected by inflation as prices increase  causing an increase in costs of salaries  employee benefits  occupancy expense and similar items 
capital resources shareholders equity of million for the year ended december  reflects a net increase of approximately million or compared to shareholders equity of million for the year ended december  this net increase was primarily attributable to earnings for the net increase in shareholders equity reflects dividends paid on common stock of million which included  declared december  and paid on january  on march   the board of directors of the company adopted a resolution calling for redemption on april  of all issued and outstanding preferred stock  including the company s first series convertible preferred stock  series convertible preferred stock and series convertible preferred stock herein collectively called the preferred stock at a redemption price of per share plus all accrued and unpaid dividends through the date fixed for redemption 
the preferred stock was convertible into shares of common stock for each share of preferred stock held 
effective april   shares of preferred stock were redeemed and  shares of preferred stock were converted into  shares of common stock 
the risk based capital standards as established by the frb apply to texas regional and texas state bank 
the numerator of the risk based capital ratio for bank holding companies includes tier i capital  consisting of common shareholders equity and qualifying cumulative and noncumulative perpetual preferred stock  and tier ii capital  consisting of other preferred stock  reserve for possible loan losses and certain subordinated and term debt securities 
beginning on december   goodwill is deducted from tier i capital 
at no time is tier ii capital allowed to exceed tier i capital in the calculation of total capital 
the denominator or asset portion of the risk based capital ratio aggregates generic classes of balance sheet and off balance sheet exposures  each weighted by one of four factors  ranging from to  based on the relative risk of the exposure class 
ratio targets are set for both tier i and total capital tier i plus tier ii capital 
the minimum level of tier i capital to total assets is and the minimum total capital ratio is 
the frb has guidelines for a leverage ratio that is designed as an additional evaluation of capital adequacy of banks and bank holding companies 
the leverage ratio is defined to be the company s tier i capital divided by its risk adjusted total assets 
an insured depository institution is well capitalized for purposes of the fdicia if its total risk based capital ratio is equal to or greater than  and tier i risk based capital ratio is equal to or greater than  and tier i leverage capital ratio is equal to or greater than 
the company s tier i risk based capital ratio was approximately and at december  and  respectively 
the company s total risk based capital ratio was approximately and at december  and  respectively 
the company s tier i leverage capital ratio was and  at december  and  respectively 
based on capital ratios  the company is within the definition of well capitalized for frb purposes at december  the following table presents the company s risk based capital calculation december  risk based capital dollars in thousands total shareholders equity  before unrealized gains or losses on securities available for sale   less goodwill and other deductions   total tier i capital   total tier ii capital   total qualifying capital   risk adjusted assets including off balance sheet exposure   tier i risk based capital ratio total risk based capital ratio leverage capital ratio current accounting issues effective january   the company adopted statement and the amendment thereof  statement under statement  a loan is considered impaired when  based upon current information and events  it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
statement requires that an impaired loan be valued utilizing i the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate of the loan  ii the fair value of the underlying collateral  or iii the observable market price of the loan 
statement amended statement by expanding the related disclosure requirements and permitting use of existing methods for recognizing interest income on impaired loans 
loans which were restructured prior to the adoption of statement and which are performing in accordance with the renegotiated terms are not required to be reported as impaired 
loans restructured subsequent to the adoption of statement are required to be reported as impaired in the year of restructuring 
thereafter  such loans can be removed from the impaired loan disclosure if the loans were paying a market rate of interest at the time of restructuring and are performing in accordance with their renegotiated terms 
for loans covered by statement  the company makes an assessment for impairment when and while such loans are on nonaccrual status or when the loan has been restructured 
when a loan with unique risk characteristics has been identified as being impaired  the amount of impairment will be measured by the company using discounted cash flows  except when it is determined that the sole remaining source of repayment for the loan is the operation or liquidation of the underlying collateral 
in such case  the current fair value of the collateral  reduced by costs to sell  will be used in place of discounted cash flows 
at the time a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  interest previously recognized but uncollected is reversed and charged against current income 
subsequent interest payments received on nonaccrual loans are either applied against principal or reported as income  depending upon management s assessment of the ultimate collectability of principal 
in management s opinion  the adoption of statement and statement did not have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
in october  fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
statement  accounting for stock based compensation 
statement establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for stock based employee compensation plans 
statement encourages entities to adopt a fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation plans which requires an estimate of the fair value of stock options or other equity instruments to which employees become entitled when they have rendered requisite service or satisfied other conditions necessary to earn the right to benefit from the instruments 
compensation cost is then determined based on the fair value estimate and is recognized over the service period  which is usually the vesting period 
statement also requires that an employer s financial statements include certain disclosures about stock based employee compensation arrangements regardless of the method used to account for them 
the accounting requirements of statement are effective for transactions entered into in fiscal years that begin after december  in management s opinion  implementation of statement should have no material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements
