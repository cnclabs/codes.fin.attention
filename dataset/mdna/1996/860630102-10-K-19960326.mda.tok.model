the company faces increasing competition from other financial institutions such as commercial banks  thrifts  and investment firms 
certain financial services  traditionally provided only by securities firms  are increasingly being provided by these other financial institutions 
the business environment for the securities industry during was one of the most prosperous in recent years 
more investors  larger holdings  and more active participants fueled record market activity and prices 
individuals continued to evolve from savers to investors as lower interest rates and slow growth in the us economy boosted the equity markets 
historically  a significant source of the company s investment banking revenues originated from oklahoma municipal securities issuances 
during  the company s municipal investment banking business was significantly impaired by the negative publicity surrounding a formal investigation by the securities and exchange commission into certain municipal bond issues managed by the company s oklahoma public finance department 
during  this investigation was completed and resulted in the company consenting to a final judgement whereby  among other things  the company paid approximately million in disgorgement and prejudgement interest and  in fines 
however  also during  the municipal finance industry continued to experience pressure on its profit margins due to a decline in the number of underwritings and the narrowing of underwriting spreads 
additionally  in december of  the company was approached by a group of investors primarily former employees of the company offering to purchase the company s operations in oklahoma and several retail sales offices in texas 
on may   the sale was consummated with capital west financial corporation capital west

prior to its completion in  the plan resulted in the closing or downsizing of office locations and termination of approximately officers and employees 
during  the company focused on its retail investment and fee based money management services and intends to increase its reliance on these services for its revenues

commissionable revenues commissions  principal transactions  sale of investment company shares  unit investment trusts  and insurance products decreased in the aggregate  in this decrease was primarily due to the reduction in the number of investment executives which resulted from the sale of the company s oklahoma based operations and to the net loss of investment executives  primarily in the early part of  due to the restructuring plan of the number of investment executives decreased by to at december   from at december  despite this decline  average production per investment executive increased  to  from  management is continuing its effort to recruit investment executives with above industry average performance records 
principal transactions decreased  to  from  largely as a result of decreased fixed income trading activity 
investment banking decreased only slightly in   to  from  public finance related income decreased significantly   to  from  due to the negative publicity surrounding the sec s investigation into certain municipal finance underwritings by the company s oklahoma city public finance department and the reduced number of transactions by municipalities experienced industry wide 
these decreases were offset by an increase in corporate finance related investment banking revenue which increased  to  from  largely as a result of increased public offerings  particularly for financial institutions and real estate investment trusts reits 
in addition  underwriting and syndicate participation fees and profits on trading new underwriting issues decreased  primarily as a result of the aforementioned decreased municipal finance activity 
interest income increased  to  from  and net interest interest income less interest expense decreased  the revenue increase is primarily due to higher customer borrowings which resulted from increased retail investor activity experienced industry wide 
because of the generally corresponding increase in borrowings by the company to finance the purchase of marketable securities and underwrite new securities issues  the net interest retention percentage decreased from to 
other revenue increased  to  from  primarily as a result of increases in managed account fees  money market distribution fees  clearing revenues  and realized gains on sale of investments  which increased approximately million    and  respectively 
managed account fees increased because of the introduction of the managed account program in late management expects the managed account fees to continue to grow  which are generated by charging a fixed rate for managing investment portfolios of customers 
realized gain on sale of investments increased primarily due to sales of investments held by the company s venture capital subsidiary 
money market distribution fees increased because of higher levels of customer funds invested in money market funds and the company s switch to omnibus processing of these funds 
clearing revenues increased as a direct result of the clearing for capital west securities  inc  the broker dealer subsidiary of capital west  which began in june total expenses decreased  to  from  with the exception of commissions and floor brokerage and interest expense  all expense categories decreased for the year as a result of the sale of the oklahoma based operations and the downsizing and restructuring plan implemented in the fourth quarter of the company charged  to operations related to this plan in the fourth quarter of there were no expenses related to that plan charged to operations in employee compensation and benefits decreased  to  from  investment executives aggregate compensation decreased  directly attributable to the decrease in aggregate revenue production 
profitability and production based incentive compensation increased  due to increased profitability and achievement of production goals 
salaries and benefits decreased  to  from  total full time and part time salaried employees decreased by to from commissions and floor brokerage increased  to  from  as a result of increased agency commissions 
communications and office supplies  occupancy and equipment rental  and promotional expenses decreased  to  from   to  from  and  to  from  respectively 
interest expense increased  to  from  due primarily to increased levels of short term borrowings by the company and its customers and increased average borrowing rates 
the average level of short term borrowings from banks for the year was  as compared to  for the average interest rate charged for these borrowings was for as compared to for the company s borrowings increased due to decreased available capital which resulted primarily from the operating loss in other operating expenses decreased  to  from  included in the caption other operating expenses are legal fees which increased  due to continuing litigation surrounding certain municipal bond issues and transactions completed by the company s former oklahoma city based public finance department 
management expects legal fees to decrease in provision for litigation and bad debts decreased  to  from  in the provision in includes an amount for doubtful collection related to notes and advances receivable of former employees and provision for settlements of oklahoma suits 
the larger provision in included doubtful collection of employee note receivables and advances of  as compared to for  the company had a net loss of  or per primary share  on revenues of  during the twelve month period ended december   the company had net income of  or per primary share  on  in revenues 
this  decrease in total revenues was the result of the aforementioned general market conditions and the changes in the company s operations 
revenues declined from in every major revenue category except interest income and investment advisory fees 
commissionable revenue commissions  principal transactions  sale of investment company shares  unit investment trusts  and insurance products in the aggregate decreased  from this decrease occurred despite significant efforts to upgrade and add to the retail sales force 
every major commissionable product area had decreased revenues from levels 
the taxable fixed income  syndicate  and mutual fund areas were off by   and  respectively  primarily due to the generally decreased market activity caused by increasing interest rates 
principal transactions  which includes inventory gains and losses as well as commissionable sales credits  was lower in primarily due to losses in the company s equity inventories and substantially lower profits in the fixed income inventories 
these decreased trading results occurred in traditional products  as the company does not carry complex derivative products or significant amounts of low priced equities penny stocks 
in terms of both amount and percentage  the largest decrease in revenues during occurred in the investment banking area 
investment banking revenues  which includes managed fixed income and equity underwriting  financial advisory  placement  and mergers and acquisition services  decreased  from levels 
reflecting the historical cyclicality and volatility of the securities markets  the investment banking area of the company had one of its worst years in following its best year ever in this trend was generally consistent industry wide 
the most significant reason for the company s decrease in this area was the sharp fall off in business in the municipal finance sector 
saw a record level of activity as municipal issuers took advantage of low and declining interest rates to refinance and restructure outstanding issues and issue new debt 
saw a reversal of that interest rate trend which eliminated the benefits of refundings that were unable to be accomplished earlier and made new issuances more costly 
in addition to the significantly less favorable conditions in the industry generally  the company suffered additional decreases in business because of the activities related to its oklahoma city based municipal finance operation 
historically  the company has been a major underwriter of oklahoma municipal issues 
in  in addition to the generally lower issuances of municipal debt  the company s revenue generation from oklahoma issues decreased substantially in part because of negative publicity relating to the sec s investigation of the company s involvement in transactions in certain oklahoma municipal securities 
during  the negative publicity related to the investigation significantly impaired the ability of the company to generate investment banking revenues from its oklahoma operations and was a significant factor in the company s decision to pursue the sale of both its retail and investment banking businesses in oklahoma 
although affected somewhat by the negative publicity from oklahoma  it is encouraging to note that the st 
louis based municipal investment banking group performed better than the industry in general during whereas industry sources reported a decline in municipal issuances in  the st 
louis based group s revenues were off only 
interest income increased   and net interest interest income less interest expense increased  the revenue increase is due to two factors higher average customer borrowings and higher interest rates charged to customers resulting from the increases caused by the federal reserve s interest rate hikes 
because of the generally corresponding rise in both rates charged to customers and the company s borrowing rates  the net interest retention percentage decreased from in to in other revenues  which consists primarily of investment advisory fees and account service fees  increased  
the most significant component of this increase was from investment advisory fees 
on december   the company acquired todd investment advisors  inc todd  an asset management company located in louisville  kentucky 
during  todd s fees added  to the company s investment advisory business 
total expenses decreased  from  to  while employee compensation and benefits  a major component of total expenses  decreased significantly  almost all other expense categories increased 
in addition  the company charged to expenses  in the fourth quarter related to a restructuring and downsizing plan approved by the parent company s board of directors see note p of notes to consolidated financial statements filed herein 
employee compensation and benefits decreased  from  to  largely as a result of decreased variable compensation which decreased  from  to  as a direct result of decreased commissionable revenue and profitability 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in salaries and benefits which increased  from  to  as a result of the additional home office revenue support staff and the opening of new branch locations 
the additions were made to facilitate revenue growth and to continue the firm s efforts to expand its retail branch system and to increase administrative expertise in key areas 
commission and floor brokerage decreased  from  to  as a result of decreased commissionable revenue 
communication and supplies and occupancy and equipment rental increased  from  to  and  from  to  respectively  as a direct result of additional branch offices opened in travel and promotion decreased  from  to  as a result of the decreased general business environment 
interest expense increased  from  to  as a result of the company s increased borrowing rates 
the company s short term borrowings bore interest at a weighted average of at december   compared to a weighted average of at december  other expenses increased  from  to  largely as a result of the increase in professional fees which increased  primarily as a result of the ongoing sec investigation into certain municipal bond issues managed by the oklahoma city based public finance department 
provision for litigation and bad debt increased  largely as a result of reserving for doubtful collection of employee notes receivable and advances of  in the fourth quarter  the company charged to expenses  for restructuring and downsizing unprofitable and potentially unprofitable areas of the firm 
included in the costs are  net lease commitments for closed and reduced office locations   for approximately terminated employees severance and extended benefits  and reserve for uncollectible notes receivable   for leasehold improvements related to closed offices  and  for contractual commitments 
the plan of restructuring and downsizing was completed during five months ended december  compared with five months ended december  results of operations for the five month transition period ended december   compared to the same five month period of the previous year reflected favorable market conditions experienced by the industry as total revenues increased slightly to  from  a modest increase over a strong five month period of the previous year 
total expenses  however  were up or  to  from  reflecting the costs associated with management s commitment to growth and the pursuit of other sources of revenues to mitigate market downturns 
accordingly  net income after tax decreased  to  from  for the five month transition period compared to the previous year s five month period 
commissionable revenue commissions  principal transactions  sales of investment company shares  unit investment trusts  and insurance products for the five month transition period ended december   increased  to  from  as a result of favorable markets for equity products  mutual funds  life insurance  and annuity products 
the increase also resulted from an increase in the number of experienced full time investment executives  which increased to at december   from at december  sale of investment company shares mutual funds increased to  from  in s five month period as a result of the continued demand for this product as retail investors sought alternatives to low interest bearing depository products offered by banking institutions 
the increase was also reflective of the continued demand for these products industry wide 
principal transactions decreased to  from  primarily as a result of a decrease in sales of taxable fixed income products  principally mortgage backed securities  which were made less attractive because of low coupon rates 
sales of insurance products increased to  from  from the previous five month period largely as a result of the increased demand for annuity and life insurance products precipitated by the tax law changes 
sales of unit investment trusts increased to  from  in the same period of the previous year largely as a result of management s continued emphasis to provide proprietary offerings and the retail investor s continued demand for this product 
other revenues decreased to  from  in the previous year largely as a result of the recognition of a one time gain of  on the sale of a partnership investment in november investment banking revenue decreased  from the comparable five month period in indications are that the public finance portion of investment banking  which was the most significant portion of investment banking and which experienced excellent business conditions over the past two years  may not reach levels achieved historically in future periods 
total expenses increased largely as a result of the increase in employee compensation and benefits which increased  to  from  the variable portion of compensation and benefits increased  to  from  as a result of an increase in commissionable revenues and bonuses paid for production and profitability of certain functions 
salaries and the other fixed portions of compensation and benefits increased  to  from  as a result of annual salary adjustments approximately firm wide  increases in the number of branch offices  an increase in the number of investment executive trainees whose salaries are fixed during their training period  and an increase in the number of professional staff in key areas of revenue production and direct support such as investment banking  trading  and research 
in addition  staff was added to bolster the firm s focus on developing alternative sources of revenues 
communication and supplies  rent and depreciation  and travel and promotion increased  to  from   to  from  and  to  from  respectively  as a result of the increase in the number of branch offices opened during the period 
the company added four offices over the previous year s total 
interest expense decreased  to  from  as a result of more favorable borrowing rates 
provision for bad debt and litigation decreased  to  from  due largely to a decrease in the amount of settlements paid for claims by customers which decreased  from the  in liquidity and capital resources the company s assets are highly liquid  consisting mainly of cash or assets readily convertible into cash 
these assets are financed primarily by the company s equity capital  customer credit balances  short term bank loans  proceeds from securities lending  long term notes payable  and other payables 
changes in securities market volumes  related customer borrowing demands  underwriting activity  and levels of securities inventory affect the amount of the company s financing requirements 
during the year ended december   cash and cash equivalents decreased  cash used for operating activities totaled  due primarily to increases in operating receivables as a result of increased borrowing by customers and a decrease in operating payables resulting mainly from a decline in stock loaned 
the decrease in cash used for operating activities was funded by short term borrowings which increased by  during  stifel  nicolaus obtained a revolving subordinated note agreement in the amount of  the note will be used to finance underwritings should the need arise 
at december   stifel  nicolaus had an advance of  against this revolving subordinated note 
the company has  in receivables from investment executives and other employees who terminated employment with the company 
the company intends to vigorously pursue collection of these receivables and does not anticipate that the outcome of these activities will adversely affect liquidity or capital resources 
management believes that funds from operations and available informal short term credit arrangements of  at december   and the available revolving subordinated debt of  at december   will provide sufficient resources to meet its present and anticipated financing needs 
stifel  nicolaus company  incorporated  the company s principal broker dealer subsidiary  is subject to certain requirements of the securities and exchange commission with regard to liquidity and capital requirements see note e of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december   stifel  nicolaus had net capital of approximately  which exceeded the minimum net capital requirements by approximately  inflation the company s assets are primarily monetary  consisting of cash  securities inventory  and receivables 
these monetary assets are generally liquid and turn over rapidly and  consequently  are not significantly affected by inflation 
however  the rate of inflation affects various expenses of the company  such as employee compensation and benefits  communications  and occupancy and equipment  which may not be readily recoverable in the price of its services 
recent accounting pronouncements the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  in the five month transition period ended december  the standard requires  among other provisions  that companies adjust their deferred tax asset or liability to reflect current rates and recognize the effect of the change in operations 
the adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company deals in listed options and other products such as collateralized mortgage obligations which derive their values from the price of some other security or index 
the company does not deal in complex derivative financial instruments  such as futures  forwards  and swaps  and therefore has no disclosure requirements in accordance with the financial accounting standard board s statement  disclosure about derivative financial instruments and fair value of financial instruments 
the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued statements of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets to be disposed of  and sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  both effective in fiscal years beginning after december  management does not believe adoption of these standards will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements
