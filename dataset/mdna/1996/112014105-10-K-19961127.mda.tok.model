management believes the existing cash and short term investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the company s expected liquidity and capital needs for the coming year 
factors affecting future operating results broderbund operates in a rapidly changing environment that is subject to many risks and uncertainties 
some of the important risks and uncertainties which may cause the company s operating results to differ materially and or adversely are discussed below and in the company s form k for the fiscal year 
fluctuations in operating results the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  significant fluctuations in operating results due to a variety of factors  including but not limited to  the rate of growth of the consumer software market  market acceptance of the company s products or those of its competitors  the timing of new product introductions  expenses relating to the development and promotion of new product introductions  changes in pricing policies by the company or its competitors  projected and actual changes in platforms and technologies  timely and successful adaptation to such platforms or technologies  the accuracy of forecasts of consumer demand  product returns  market seasonality  the timing of orders from major customers and order cancellations  and changes or disruptions in the consumer software distribution channels 
although the company s business has generally been highly seasonal  with net revenues and operating income generally highest in the first fiscal quarter during the calendar year end holiday selling season  lower in the second fiscal quarter  and lowest in the seasonally slow third and fourth fiscal quarters  during fiscal  the company anticipates that its results may differ from that seasonal pattern with results more heavily weighted to the second half of the fiscal year when several new entertainment products are scheduled to be released 
the company also believes that the market conditions which resulted in the year over year decline in revenues and profitability experienced in the last two quarters of fiscal will continue for at least the next two fiscal quarters 
without growth in net revenues in the next two quarters  the company s increasing operating expenses would cause net income to decline when compared to the same period in the previous year 
any significant shortfall in net revenues and earnings from the levels expected by securities analysts and stockholders could result in a substantial decline in the trading price of the company s common stock 
there can be no assurance that the company s stock price will remain at or near its current level 
moreover  the company s stock is subject to the volatility generally associated with technology stocks and may also be affected by broader market trends or the results reported by other market participants 
industry and competition recent data indicates a slowdown in growth of end user demand for consumer software and hardware during and there can be no assurance that such demand will not continue to slow or to decline 
in addition  the intense competition in the consumer software business continues to accelerate as an increasing number of companies  many of which have financial  managerial and technical resources greater than those of the company  offer products that compete directly with one or more of the company s products 
as a result  an increasingly large number of products are competing for limited shelf space 
in response to increasing product and price competition  the company has reduced the price of some of its products  including its best selling series  the print shop  which places negative pressures on net revenues and gross margins 
there can be no assurance that product prices will not continue to decline as competition increases  and if such conditions persist  the company s net revenues and profitability could be materially and adversely affected 
further  there can be no assurance that sales of the company s existing products will continue to sustain market acceptance and to generate significant levels of revenue in subsequent quarters or that a shortfall in revenue from any product could be replaced in a timely manner 
in addition  sales of products on older platforms and in certain product lines have declined  and there can be no assurance that sales of these products will not decline further or experience lower than expected sales levels 
because a significant portion of the company s expense levels are fixed and based on its expectations regarding future revenues  operating results would be disproportionately adversely affected by a decrease in sales or failure to meet the company s sales expectations 
in addition  competition for creative talent  including independent developers  has also intensified  and the attraction and retention of key personnel has become increasingly difficult 
products and platforms the company s future success will depend in large part on its ability to develop and release new products on a timely basis and to achieve widespread market acceptance for such products 
there can be no assurance that expected new product introductions will not experience material delays  that new products introduced by the company will achieve any significant degree of market acceptance  or that such acceptance will be sustained for any length of time 
in addition  because the company expects that the cost of developing and introducing new products will continue to increase  the financial risks associated with new product development will increase as will the risks associated with material delays in the introduction of such new products 
the substantial year over year decline in myst revenues during the second half of fiscal was not fully replaced  and there can be no assurance that the shortfall from the continuing decline in myst revenues will be replaced in a timely manner or that myst ii s introduction will occur in fiscal or that it will achieve widespread market acceptance 
in addition  the company believes that electronic or internet products and services will become an increasingly important platform and distribution media  the company s failure to timely and successfully adapt to and utilize such technologies could materially and adversely affect its competitive position and its fiscal results 
distribution the distribution channels through which consumer software products are sold have been characterized by intense competition and continuing uncertainties and there can be no assurance that distributors and retailers will continue to purchase the company s products or provide the company s products with adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support 
in addition  certain distributors and retailers have experienced business difficulties and there can be no assurance such difficulties for these or additional distributors and retailers will not continue which could have an adverse effect on the operating results and financial condition of the company 
the company also permits distributors and retailers to return products under certain circumstances  and the company believes that the rate of product returns will increase as competition in the distribution channel increases and as mass merchants  office and warehouse stores become an increasing percentage of the company s sales 
the company establishes allowances based on estimated future returns of product after considering various factors  and accordingly  if the level of actual returns exceed management s estimates  it could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results 
further  there is increasing pressure from distributors and retailers to obtain marketing and promotional funds and discounts in connection with access to shelf space  in store promotion and sale of products which has an adverse impact on the company s net revenues and profitability  and there can be no assurance that these pressures will not continue or increase
