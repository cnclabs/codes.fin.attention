the new properties were acquired for an aggregate cost of approximately million including the estimated development costs of the two properties under construction  are located in states  will contain approximately  leasable square feet and are leased under triple net leases  with an average initial lease term of years 
the weighted average annual unleveraged return on the cost of the new properties including the estimated cost of properties under construction is estimated to be  computed as estimated contractual net operating income which in the case of a triple net leased property is equal to the base rent or  in the case of properties under construction  the estimated base rent under the lease for the first year of each lease  divided by total acquisition and estimated development costs 
no assurance can be given that the actual return on the cost of the new properties will not differ from the foregoing percentage

listing of the common stock on the nyse 
the common stock was authorized for listing on the nyse under the symbol o and commenced trading on the nyse on october  business objectives and strategy general 
the company s primary business objective is to generate a consistent and predictable level of ffo per share and distributions to stockholders 
additionally  the company generally will seek to increase ffo per share and distributions to stockholders through both internal and external growth  while also seeking to lower the ratio of distributions to stockholders as a percentage of ffo in order to allow internal cash flow to be used to fund additional acquisitions and for other corporate purposes 
the company pursues internal growth through i contractual rent increases on existing leases  ii rental increases at the termination of existing leases when market conditions permit  and iii the active management of the company s property portfolio  including selective sales of properties 
the company generally pursues external growth through the acquisition of additional properties under long term  triple net lease agreements with initial contractual base rent which  at the time of acquisition  is in excess of the company s estimated cost of capital 
investment philosophy 
realty income believes that the long term ownership of an actively managed  diversified portfolio of retail properties under long term  triple net lease agreements should produce consistent  predictable income and the potential for long term capital appreciation 
under a triple net lease agreement  the tenant agrees to pay a minimum monthly rent and all property expenses taxes  maintenance  and insurance plus  typically  future rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index or additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenant s gross sales above a specified level 
page the company believes that long term leases  coupled with the tenants assuming responsibility for property expenses  produce a more predictable income stream than many other types of real estate portfolios  while continuing to offer the opportunity for capital appreciation 
investment strategy 
in identifying new properties for acquisition  realty income focuses on providing expansion capital to middle market retail chains by acquiring  then leasing back  their retail store locations 
the company classifies retail tenants into three categories venture  middle market  and upper market 
venture companies are those which typically offer a new retail concept in one geographic region of the country and operate between five and retail outlets 
in general  these retail chains are thinly capitalized and are in the process of solving distribution  marketing  concept  geographic adaptation  and other problems associated with a new  growing company 
middle market retail chains are those which typically have to retail outlets  operations in more than one geographic region  success through one or more economic cycles  a proven  replicable concept  and an objective of further expansion 
the upper market retail chains typically consist of companies with or more stores which operate nationally in a mature retail concept 
they generally have strong operating histories and access to several sources of capital 
realty income focuses on acquiring properties leased to emerging  middle market retail chains which the company believes are more attractive for investment because i they generally have overcome many of the operational and managerial obstacles that tend to adversely affect venture retailers  ii they typically require capital to fund expansion but have more limited financing options compared to upper market retailers  iii historically  they generally have provided attractive risk adjusted returns to the company over time  since their financial strength has in many cases tended to improve as their businesses have matured  iv their relatively large size compared to venture retailers allows them to spread corporate expenses among a greater number of stores  and v compared to venture retailers  middle market retailers typically have the critical mass to survive if a number of locations have to be closed due to underperformance 
acquisition strategy 
realty income seeks to invest in industries that are dominated by independent local operators and in which several well organized regional and national chains are capturing market share through service  quality control  economies of scale  mass media advertising  and selection of prime retail locations 
the company executes its acquisition strategy by acting as a source of capital to regional and national retail chain stores in a variety of industries by acquiring  then leasing back  their retail store locations 
page relying on executives from its acquisitions  portfolio management  finance  accounting  operations  capital markets  and legal departments  the company undertakes stringent research and analysis in identifying appropriate industries  tenants  and property locations for investment 
in selecting real estate for potential investment  the company generally will seek to acquire properties that have the following characteristics freestanding  commercially zoned property with a single tenant  properties that are important retail locations for national and regional retail chains  properties that are located within attractive demographic areas relative to the business of their tenants  with high visibility and easy access to major thoroughfares  properties that can be purchased with the simultaneous execution or assumption of long term  triple net lease agreements  providing the opportunity for both current income and future rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index or through the payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenant s gross sales above a specified level  and properties that can be acquired at or below their appraised value at prices generally ranging from  to million 
portfolio management strategy 
the active management of the property portfolio is an essential component of the company s long term strategy 
the company continually monitors its portfolio for changes that could affect the performance of the industries  tenants  and locations in which it has invested 
realty income s executive committee meets at least monthly to review industry and tenant research  due diligence  property operations and portfolio management 
this monitoring typically includes ongoing review and analysis of i the performance of various tenant industries  ii the operation  management  business planning  and financial condition of the tenants  iii the health of the individual markets in which the company owns properties  from both an economic and real estate standpoint  and iv the physical maintenance of the company s individual properties 
the portfolio is analyzed on an ongoing basis with a view towards optimizing performance and returns 
while the company generally intends to hold its triple net leased properties for long term investment  the company believes that opportunities may exist to increase ffo through the active management of its portfolio of triple net lease properties 
the company intends to pursue a strategy of identifying properties page that may be sold at attractive prices where the reinvestment of the sales proceeds is expected to generate a higher cash flow to the company 
while the company intends to pursue such a strategy  it will only do so within the constraints of the rules regarding reit status 
capital strategy 
the company utilizes its million  unsecured acquisition credit facility as a vehicle for the short term financing of the acquisition of new properties 
when outstanding borrowings under the acquisition credit facility reach a certain level generally in the range of to million  the company intends to refinance those borrowings with the net proceeds of long term or permanent financing  which may include the issuance of common stock  preferred stock or convertible preferred stock  debt securities or convertible debt securities 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effect any such refinancing or regarding the terms on which any such refinancing may be accomplished 
the company believes that it is best served by a conservative capital structure  with a majority of its capital consisting of equity 
as of december   the company s total indebtedness was approximately of its total assets 
competitive strategy 
the company believes that to utilize its investment philosophy and strategy most successfully  it must seek to maintain the following competitive strategy size of investment properties the company believes that smaller  to  retail triple net leased properties represent an attractive investment opportunity in today s real estate environment 
due to the complexities of acquiring and managing a large portfolio of relatively small assets  the company believes that these types of properties have not experienced significant institutional participation or the corresponding yield reduction experienced by larger income producing properties 
the company believes the less intensive day to day property management required by triple net lease agreements  coupled with the active management of a large portfolio of smaller properties by the company  is an effective investment strategy 
investment in new industries while specializing in smaller properties  the company will seek to further diversify its portfolio among a variety of industries 
the company believes that diversification will allow it to invest in industries that are currently growing and have characteristics the company finds potentially profitable 
these characteristics include  but are not limited to  industries dominated by local operators where national and regional chain operators can gain substantial market share and dominance through more page efficient operations  as well as industries taking advantage of major demographic shifts in the population base 
for example  in the early s  realty income targeted the fast food industry to take advantage of the country s increasing desire to dine away from home  and in the early s  it targeted the child day care industry  responding to the need for professional child care as more women entered the work force 
diversification diversification of the portfolio by industry type  tenant and geographic location is key to the company s objective of providing predictable investment results for its stockholders 
as the company expands it will seek to further diversify its portfolio 
management specialization the company believes that its management s specialization in small properties operated under triple net lease agreements is important to meeting its objectives 
the company plans to maintain this specialization and will seek to employ and train high quality professionals in this specialized area of real estate ownership  finance and management 
technology the company intends to stay at the forefront of technology in its efforts to efficiently and economically carry out its operations 
the company maintains a sophisticated information system that allows it to analyze its portfolio s performance and actively manage its investments 
in addition  the company maintains record keeping on an optical disc storage and retrieval system which gives it ready access to records on a cost efficient and timely basis 
the company believes that technology and information based systems will play an increasingly important role in its competitiveness as an investment manager and source of capital to a variety of industries and tenants

although the company intends to operate so that it will continue to qualify as a reit  the highly complex nature of the rules governing reits  the ongoing importance of factual determinations and the possibility page of future changes in the company s circumstances preclude any assurance that the company will so qualify in any year 
for any taxable year that the company fails to qualify as a reit  it would not be entitled to a deduction for dividends paid to its stockholders in calculating its taxable income 
consequently  distributions to stockholders would be substantially reduced and could be eliminated because of the company s increased tax liability 
should the company s qualification as a reit terminate  the company may not be able to elect to be treated as a reit for the subsequent five year period  which would substantially reduce and could eliminate distributions to stockholders for the years involved
