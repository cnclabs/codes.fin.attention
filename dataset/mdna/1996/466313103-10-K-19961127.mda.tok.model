item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company provides high volume turnkey manufacturing services using surface mount technology for leading electronics oems in the personal computer  disk drive and peripherals  communications and automotive industries 
in turnkey manufacturing  unlike manufacturing on consignment  the company is responsible for procuring the components utilized in the manufacturing process 
the component procurement responsibility requires the company to provide significant working capital  materials management  purchasing  receiving inspection and stockroom management 
this approach transfers the economic risks of materials cost fluctuations  excess scrap and inventory obsolescenceto the company 
the company believes that turkey manufacturing generates higher net revenue than consignment manufacturing due to the generation of revenue from materials as well as labor and manufactuing overhead  but also results in lower gross margins than consignment manufacturing because the company generally realizes lower gross margins on material based revenue than on manufacturing based revenue 
the company s annual and quarterly operating results are affected by a number of factors 
the primary factors affecting operating results are the level and timing of customer orders  fluctuations in materials costs and the mix of materials costs versus labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
the level and timing of orders placed by a customer vary due to the customer s attempts to balance its inventory  design changes  changes in a customer s manufacturing strategy  acquisitions of or consolidations among customers  and variation in demand for a customer s products due to  among other things  product life cycles  competitive conditions and general economic conditions 
in the past  changes in orders from customers have had a significant effect on results of operations due to corresponding changes in the level of overhead absorption 
other factors affecting the company s annual and quarterly operating results include price competition  the company s level of experience in manufacturing a particular product  the degree of automation used in the assembly process  the efficiencies achieved by the company in managing inventories and fixed assets  the timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased sales  customer product delivery requirements and shortages of components or labor 
operating results are also affected by the level of capacity utilization of manufacturing facilities  indirect labor and selling  general and administrative expenses 
accordingly  gross margins and operating income margins have generally improved during periods of high volume and high capacity utilization 
jabil generally has idle capacity and reduced operating margins during periods of lower volume production 
the company has continued to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of its net revenue 
significant reductions in sales to any of the company s large customers would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
in the past  including fiscal year some of the company s customers have terminated their manufacturing arrangement with the company  and other customers have significantly reduced or delayed the volume of manufacturing services ordered from the company 
there can be no assurance that present or future customers will not terminate their manufacturing arrangements with the company or significantly change  reduce or delay the amount of manufacturing services ordered from the company 
any such termination of a manufacturing relationship or change  reduction or delay in orders could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition
