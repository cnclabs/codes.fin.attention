due to actions by the federal communications commission the fcc  relating to the reinstitution of rate regulation  as hereinafter described  the rate structure of the cable television industry  including the company s business  has been negatively affected 
in view of the continuing changes and recently published revisions to the fcc rate regulations  the company is currently unable to assess the full impact of the cable act upon its future financial results 
the company implemented new rate and service offerings whereby subscribers are given the choice of buying certain programming services individually on a per channel basis or as part of a package of premium services at a discounted price a la carte service offerings 
several of the company s systems  along with numerous other cable operators  received specific inquiries from the fcc regarding their implementation of this method of offering cable services 
in its decisions on the inquiry letters  the fcc admitted that previous guidelines which cable operators  including the company  relied upon may have been confusing 
during december  the fcc responded to certain of the letters of inquiry related to a la carte service offerings 
the fcc has  through such responses  effectively determined that a la carte service offerings limited to six channels or less will be considered new product tiers under the fcc rules see regulation 
a la carte service offerings in systems serving approximately of the company s subscribers qualify as new product tiers 
a la carte service offerings in excess of six channels have not been given new product tier status and it is the intent of the fcc to treat such offerings as regulated tiers of cable programming service  retroactively to the date of initial regulation 
such treatment  affecting approximately of the company s primary basic subscribers  would result in further reductions in the company s rates for such services as well as refunds for previously provided services 
the company has appealed this determination to the fcc 
on august  the fcc released an order seeking comment on a proposed resolution of pending basic and cable programming service tier rate complaints in several los angeles area cable systems served by century 
the proposed resolution also calls for the fcc to reconsider the letter of inquiry ruling adopted by the fcc with respect to century s los angeles and beverly hills  california systems in december if finally adopted by the commission  the proposed resolution would require century to adjust its rates for its basic and cable programming services tiers and make approximately  in subscriber refunds 
under the terms of the proposed resolution  local franchising authorities could opt out of the specified refunds and decide basic service tier refunds and rates based on the terms of the letter of inquiry  as reconsidered 
during july and august  further adjustments to the company s rates were made in certain of the company s cable television systems pursuant to the fcc s second revision to its rate formula 
as a result  the company experienced a further decrease in the regulated portion of its services for the fiscal year ended may  under the regulatory price cap mechanism established by the fcc  a portion of the decline was offset in part  by allowable rate increases during fiscal such increases relate to adjustments for the annual change in the gross national producers price index as well as certain increases in programming fees  the addition of new channel service and so called external costs as delineated in the rules 
the bulk of such price adjustments became effective during the first quarter of the current fiscal year 
on february   congress passed s  the telecommunications act of act  which was signed into law by the president 
the new law will alter federal  state and local laws and regulations regarding telecommunications providers and services  including the cable television industry 
the act substantially deregulates except for basic service cable service rates over a three year period 
implementing regulations of the act are currently being written 
the effect that the act will have on the company cannot be determined at this time

in order to meet its obligations with respect to its debt and preferred stock obligations  it is important that centennial continue to improve operating cash flow

the pcs business is expected to be highly competitive with the two existing cellular telephone providers as well as the other mta pcs license holder 
there is no assurance that the pcs business will generate cash flow or reach profitability 
even if operating cash flow does increase  it is anticipated that cash generated from centennial s cellular telephone operations and pcs business will not be sufficient in the next several years to cover interest  the preferred stock dividend requirements that commence in fiscal and required capital expenditures

investments australian pay television during fiscal  and fiscal the company has invested  through a wholly owned subsidiary  approximately  in its australian pay tv investments  including approximately  in east coast pay television pty limited  an australian company ect 
ect is pursuing opportunities to own operate and invest in  pay television services in australia 
australia is considered to be an emerging pay television market 
the investment was effected through the acquisition by the company of convertible debentures and ordinary shares of ect representing a economic interest in ect 
the company has the right to designate five of the seven directors of ect and to approve certain corporate transactions 
the company has also entered into long term management agreements with ect 
ect  through a wholly owned subsidiary  owns satellite subscription broadcast license a satellite license a  one of three such licenses that may be granted by australian authorities prior to july the license allows for direct to home dth satellite television broadcasting and allows ect to offer four channels of programming via dth 
australis media limited australis  another pay television company in australia  owns satellite subscription broadcast license b license b  the second of the three licenses currently available for dth services  allowing for the dth broadcast of four channels of programming 
ect and australis have entered into agreements pursuant to which ect will offer its four license a channels for distribution individually or as part of a combined package with license b programming in a package of services known as the galaxy package 
license a and license b programming are to be distributed via dth  microwave multipoint distribution systems mds and via cable 
the galaxy package will be distributed by australis through dth and mds in the six largest so called capital cities in australia as well as western australia and in distinct regional areas outside the capital cities by its franchisees 
ect is a franchisee of australis in regions covering approximately  households 
the license a and license b programming are distributed over common infrastructure subject to a long term agreement between ect and australis the infrastructure utilization agreement or the iua 
among other terms  the iua provides ect with a participation in  and the right to maintain a interest in the net cash flow as defined therein of australis 
the initial interest of the interest was determined based upon the proportional relationship of each company s investment in australian pay tv at that time a million  australis and a million ect 
the interest may be adjusted proportionately downward depending upon the extent to which ect at its sole option elects to fund a specified portion ie up to its then interest of those funds expended by australis in the pay television business in australia 
before ect is required to make such an election and any resulting contribution or recalculation of the interest certain conditions precedent must be met 
it is ect s position that it is not yet required to make an election to make a contribution toward such expenditures since certain conditions precedent have not been met by australis 
australis has asserted that as of january  ect s interest has decreased from to approximately due to ect s failure to contribute funds approximately 
there can be no assurance that this dispute will be resolved in ect s favor  nor that  after reviewing the relevant information  ect will elect to contribute its share of the funding 
to the extent ect elects to contribute its share of the funding under the iua  funds from various sources of external financing would be required 
there is no assurance that if ect would otherwise elect to make such a contribution  that such external financing would be available  and if so available  would be on terms favorable to ect 
ect  australis and australis other franchisee have acquired control of substantially all of the currently issued licenses which can be used for transmission of pay television programming via mds in australia 
ect owns or controls all of the currently issued licenses which entitle it to transmit pay television programming via mds in most of coastal new south wales and all of tasmania including wollongong  hobart and newcastle  australia and surrounding areas the ect franchise areas and has entered into a franchise agreement with australis the franchise agreement pursuant to which it has the exclusive right and is obligated for at least a fifteen year period with an option to renew for an additional ten years to deliver in each of the ect franchise areas any subscription broadcast service supplied by australis  including the galaxy package 
the ect franchise areas contain approximately  households or approximately of all australian households 
programming for the license a package is provided by xyz  a joint venture in which the company holds a interest 
the company s interest in xyz is derived through the company s joint venture with united international holdings  inc uih  a leading international provider of pay television services which holds interests in the two other franchisees of australis 
the above noted structure is pursuant to a series of agreements entered into by the company  uih and foxtel  a joint venture between telstra corporation limited  the government owned australian national telecommunications carrier  and the news corporation limited  a major international media and entertainment company 
programming provided by xyz includes the discovery channel  a documentary channel  red  a music video channel  nickelodeon  a children s and family channel  and arena  a general entertainment channel 
in addition  xyz is developing two additional channels channels and which it will seek to have included in the galaxy package 
ect has entered into a long term agreement with foxtel a competitive cable television provider pursuant to which foxtel has agreed to distribute the license a package  as well as channels and throughout australia over foxtel s cable television network 
ect receives a monthly per subscriber fee from foxtel for the license a package 
foxtel  owns the remaining of xyz 
pursuant to arrangements between ect and foxtel  ect is prohibited from granting any third party the right to distribute the license a package and channels and by cable television in australia without the prior consent of foxtel 
however  ect has retained the non exclusive right to distribution of the license a package by cable television in the east coast franchise areas 
in addition  if foxtel supplies any foxtel channels for distribution by galaxy  foxtel must authorize galaxy to provide the same channels to the franchisees for distribution by mds transmission and dth satellite in the franchise areas 
these arrangements with foxtel provide for fixed per subscriber prices as well as minimum subscribers by january  foxtel is presently meeting the minimum guarantee 
the company has also acquired an approximate economic interest in australis for approximately  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the investment was written off by the company based upon its then assessment of the financial position of australis see below 
ect requires substantial capital to operate  construct  expand and to invest in the australian pay tv business as well as funding operating losses and debt service 
all of ect s australian pay tv business activities are considered to be in the start up or early development phase of operations 
ect must continue to seek various sources of external financing to meet its current and future financial needs  which may include bank financing  joint ventures and partnerships  investments by third parties and public and private placements of debt and equity securities 
since commencement of its operations in the australian pay tv business  ect has been funded by capital contributions and short term debt facilities from its principal security holders including the company  and third party bank financings 
ect s principal uses of capital have been to invest in and develop its pay tv infrastructure and to fund operating losses 
specifically  ect has i invested approximately  to acquire its interest in satellite license a  ii invested approximately  to acquire certain mds licenses covering the geographic areas located in the ect franchise areas  and iii invested approximately  to build out the network infrastructure and establish offices in its principal areas of operation 
in addition  since fiscal  ect has required approximately  for operating activities 
ect has generated negative cash flow from operating activities as a result of startup costs associated with constructing and marketing multichannel television and telecommunications service as well as establishing the organizational infrastructure required for the operation of the australian pay tv business 
in order to generate operating cash flow  ect s revenue must exceed operating expenses 
increases in revenue will be dependent upon continued growth in the number of subscriptions and maximizing revenue per subscriber 
ect is in the process of developing its core managerial  administrative and marketing functions and is continuing the construction of its pay tv network in its existing markets 
the australian pay tv business is expected to be highly competitive with two potential cable television providers having announced plans for distribution of video services throughout continental australia 
there can be no assurance that ect will generate sufficient cash flow to meet its needs and  accordingly  there can be no assurance that profitability will be achieved in the foreseeable future 
the company expects that the australian pay tv business will continue to be capital intensive 
at may   ect had  of property  plant and equipment placed in service 
ect expects to spend approximately  over the next five years to expand its mds and satellite networks  and market and distribute services in the ect franchise areas 
in order to fund these commitments  ect must raise additional capital either from public or private placements of its equity or debt securities  investments by third parties  joint ventures and partnerships or bank borrowing 
although ect has been able to obtain financing for its operations to date  there is no assurance such financings will be available to it in the future  or if available  on terms favorable to ect 
in this regard the company and the other security holders of ect are currently negotiating an agreement to put in place those organizational and structural changes in ect necessary to raise additional capital for investment in the australian pay tv marketplace 
it is anticipated that on completion  ect will seek to raise additional capital 
there is no assurance that such agreement will be concluded  or if concluded  that ect will raise sufficient funding for all of its business needs 
under the franchise agreement and iua  ect is dependent on the efforts of australis in the development of the pay television industry in australia 
the company has become aware that australis financial position has significantly deteriorated to the point where its ability to survive as a going concern is in doubt 
ect s financial position and a result  the company s investment in ect may be materially and adversely affected if australis were to become insolvent 
the company s pay television subscriber business is dependent on acceptance of the galaxy package as a well known national product as well as the infrastructure established by australis  including the national marketing and subscriber management service 
if australis were to become insolvent  and as a result  were not able to provide infrastructure services  subscriber management systems and other related services for ect  ect would need to develop such services on its own  which could be on economic terms to ect less favorable than those now available from australis 
in addition  ect understands that under this circumstance  ect may be required to seek replacement programming currently provided by australis which may be on less favorable terms than those provided by australis 
additionally  ect could be required to continue to provide the license a package to australis  while the obligation of australis to provide the license b package  either by itself or as part of the galaxy package  to ect as a franchisee could be avoided  and certain agreements  including the iua and the franchise agreement  could be modified or voided by a bankruptcy liquidator if determined to be unprofitable 
existing obligations of australis under these agreements could be subject to reorganization claims and preferences 
moreover  if australis were unable to expand its subscriber base  the distribution of ect s license package a throughout australia may be inhibited 
further in the event of any such insolvency ect may be required to pay australis portion of the satellite lease payments for the transmission of the license a and b packages since ect is jointly and severally liable for those payments 
the incremental cost to ect for the australis portion of their obligation would be approximately  per annum 
australis has recently announced a recapitalization plan which includes the introduction of additional equity and the transfer of certain assets to a joint venture with optusvision a competitive cable provider 
the plan is subject to lender  shareholder  and regulatory approvals as well as an additional debt offering to be completed by october  ect is currently reviewing the plan to determine the impact  if any  on its business and the extent to which certain consents requested by australis will be accommodated 
ect has been given no assurance that the plan  as proposed  will receive the necessary approvals or that the contemplated debt offering will be successful 
the company is currently unable to predict the ultimate resolution of these matters 
at may  the remaining net book value of its investments in the various aspects of australian pay tv aggregated  the company will continue to assess the impact  if any  of the above noted matters on the carrying value of its investments in the australian pay tv businesses 
foreign currency exchange rate risks  hedging the company s monetary assets and liabilities are subject to foreign currency exchange risk as certain equipment purchases and payments for certain operating expenses  such as programming expenses  are denominated in currencies other than their own functional currency 
in addition  certain of the company s subsidiaries have notes payable and notes receivable which are denominated in a currency other than their own functional currency or intercompany loans payable linked to the u 
s 
dollar 
in general  the company does not execute hedge transactions to reduce its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks 
accordingly  the company may experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings with respect to its holdings solely as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  which include foreign currency devaluations against the dollar 
the company may also experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings related to these monetary assets and liabilities 
in general  exchange rate risk to the company s commitments for equipment purchases and operating expanses is generally limited due to the insignificance of the related monetary asset and liability balances  however  exchange rate risk to the company of these notes payable and notes receivable and debt linked to the u 
s 
dollar have and will continue to impact its reported earnings 
australia generally does not restrict the removal or conversion of local or foreign currency  however  there is no assurance this position will continue

on december   centennial announced that its board of directors authorized the repurchase  from time to time  of up to  shares of centennial s class a common stock  depending on prevailing market conditions 
centennial has made no such purchases to date 
recent legislative development the telecommunications act of the telecommunications act of act  was enacted into law on february  this new law will alter federal  state and local laws and regulations regarding telecommunications providers and services  including the company and the cable television and other telecommunications services provided by the company 
the following is a summary of certain provisions of the act which could materially affect the growth and operation of the cable television industry and the cable and telecommunications services provided by the company 
as noted below  there are numerous rulemakings to be undertaken by the federal communications commission fcc which will interpret and implement the provisions discussed below 
it is not possible at this time to predict the outcome of such rulemakings 
cable rate regulation rate regulation of the company s cable television services is divided between the fcc and local units of government such as states  counties or municipalities 
the fcc s jurisdiction extends to the cable programming service tier cpst  which consists largely of satellite delivered programming excluding basic tier programming and programming offered on a per channel or per program basis 
local units of governments commonly referred to as local franchising authorities or lfas are primarily responsible for regulating rates for the basic tier of cable service bst  which will typically contain at least all television broadcast stations except superstations and public access  educational and government peg channels 
equipment rates are also regulated by lfas 
the fcc retains appeal jurisdiction from lfa decisions 
cable services offered on a per channel or per program only basis remain unregulated 
the act eliminates cpst rate regulation as of march  in the interim  cpst rate regulation can be triggered only by an lfa complaint to the fcc 
an lfa complaint must be based upon more than one subscriber complaint 
prior to the act  an fcc review of cpst rates could be occasioned by a single subscriber complaint to the fcc 
the act does not disturb existing or pending cpst rate settlements between the company and the fcc 
the company s bst rates remain subject to lfa regulation under the act 
existing law precludes rate regulation entirely wherever a cable operator faces effective competition 
the act expands the definition of effective competition to include any franchise area where a local exchange carrier or affiliate provides video programming services to subscribers by any means other than through direct broadcast satellite dbs  or any multichannel video provider using the facilities of a local exchange carrier or other multichannel video provider provides such service 
there is no penetration minimum for the local exchange carrier to qualify as an effective competitor  but it must provide comparable programming services at least channels including some television broadcast signals in the franchise area 
under the act  the company will be allowed to aggregate  on a franchise  system  regional or company level  its equipment costs into broad categories  such as converter boxes  regardless of the varying levels of functionality of the equipment within each such broad category 
the act will allow the company to average together costs of different types of converters including non addressable  addressable  and digital 
the statutory changes will also facilitate the rationalizing of equipment rates across jurisdictional boundaries 
these favorable cost aggregation rules do not apply to the limited equipment used by bst only subscribers 
cable uniform rate requirements 
the act immediately relaxes the uniform rate requirements by specifying such requirements do not apply where the operator faces effective competition  and by exempting bulk discounts to multiple dwelling units  although complaints about predatory pricing may be made to the fcc 
upon a prima facie showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the discounted price is predatory  the cable system operator will have the burden of proving otherwise 
system sales 
the act eliminates the existing three year holding requirement with respect to the sale of cable television systems 
cable system definition 
the act changes the definition of a cable system so that competitive providers of video services will only be regulated and franchised as a cable system if they use public rights of way 
cable pole attachments under the act  investor owned utilities must make poles and conduits available to cable systems under delineated terms 
electric utilities are given the right to deny access to particular poles on a nondiscriminatory basis for lack of capacity  safety  reliability  and generally accepted engineering purposes 
the current method for determining rates charged by telephone and utility companies for cable delivery of cable and non cable services will continue for five years 
however  the act directs the fcc to establish a new formula for the rental rate for poles used by cable operators who provide telecommunications services which will result in higher pole rental rates for such cable operators 
any increases pursuant to this formula may not begin for years and will be phased in equal increments over years through this new fcc formula does not apply in states which certify they regulate pole rents 
pole owners must impute pole rentals to themselves if they offer telecommunications or cable services 
cable operators need not pay future make ready on poles currently contacted if the make ready is required to accommodate the attachments of another user  including the pole owner 
cable entry into telecommunications the act declares that no state or local laws or regulations may prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the ability of any entity to provide any interstate or intrastate telecommunications service 
states are authorized to impose competitively neutral requirements regarding universal service  public safety and welfare  service quality  and consumer protection 
the act further provides that cable operators and affiliates providing telecommunications services are not required to obtain a separate franchise from lfas for such services 
the act prohibits lfas from requiring cable operators to provide  or prohibiting them from providing  telecommunications service or facilities as a condition of a grant of a franchise  franchise renewal  or franchise transfer  except that lfas can seek institutional networks as part of such franchise negotiations 
the act states that traditional cable franchise fees may only be based on revenues related to the provision of cable television services 
interconnection and other telecommunications carrier obligations 
to facilitate the entry of new telecommunications providers including cable operators  the act imposes interconnection obligations on all telecommunications carriers 
all carriers must interconnect their networks with other carriers and may not deploy network features and functions that interfere with interoperability 
existing local exchange carriers lecs also have the following obligations good faith negotiation with those seeking interconnection  unbundling  equal access and non discrimination requirements  resale of services  including resale at wholesale rates with an exception for certain low priced residence services to business customers  notice of changes in the network that would affect interconnection and interoperability  and physical collocation unless shown that practical technical reasons  or space limitations  make physical collocation impractical 
the fcc had six months from the date of enactment to complete all actions necessary to establish regulations needed to effectuate this section 
the act also directs the fcc  within one year of enactment  to adopt regulations for existing lecs to share infrastructure with qualifying carriers 
under the act  individual interconnection rates must be just and reasonable  based on cost  and may include a reasonable profit 
cost of interconnection will not be determined in a rate of return proceeding 
traffic termination charges shall be mutual and reciprocal 
the act contemplates that interconnection agreements will be negotiated by the parties and submitted to a state public service commission psc for approval 
a psc may become involved  at the request of either party  if negotiations fail 
if the state regulator refuses to act  the fcc may determine the matter 
if the psc acts  an aggrieved party s remedy is to file a case in federal district court 
the act requires that all telecommunications providers including cable operators that provide telecommunications services must contribute equitably to a universal service fund usf  although the fcc may exempt an interstate carrier or class of carriers if their contribution would be minimal under the usf formula 
the act allows states to determine which intrastate telecommunications providers contribute to the usf 
telephone company entry into cable television the act allows telephone companies to compete directly with cable operators by repealing the telephone company cable cross ownership ban and the fcc s video dialtone regulations 
this will allow lecs  including the bell operating companies  to compete with cable both inside and outside their telephone service areas 
if a lec provides video via radio waves  it is subject to title iii broadcast jurisdiction 
if a lec provides common carrier channel service it is subject to title ii common carrier jurisdiction 
a lec providing video programming to subscribers is otherwise regulated as a cable operator including franchising  leased access  and customer services requirements  unless the lec elects to provide its programming via an open video system 
lec owned programming services will also be fully subject to program access requirements 
the act replaces the fcc s video dialtone rules with an open video system ovs plan by which lecs can provide cable service in their telephone service area 
lecs complying with fcc ovs regulations will receive relaxed oversight 
the act requires the fcc to act on any such ovs certification within ten days of its filing 
only the program access  negative option billing prohibition  subscriber privacy  eeo  peg  must carry and retransmission consent provisions of the communications act of will apply to lec provided ovs 
franchising  rate regulation  consumer service provisions  leased access and equipment compatibility will not apply 
cable copyright provisions will apply to programmers using ovs 
lfas may require ovs operators to pay franchise fees only to the extent that the ovs provider or its affiliates provide cable services over the ovs 
ovs operators will be subject to lfa general right of way management regulators 
such fees may not exceed the franchise fees charged to cable operators in the area  and the ovs provider may pass through the fees as a separate subscriber bill item 
the act requires the fcc to adopt  and the fcc has adopted  regulations prohibiting an ovs operator from discriminating among programmers  and ensuring that ovs rates  terms  and conditions for service are reasonable and nondiscriminatory 
further  the fcc is to adopt regulations prohibit a lec ovs operator  or its affiliates  from occupying more than one third of the system s activated channels when demand for channels exceeds supply  although there are no numeric limits 
the act also mandates ovs regulations governing channel sharing  extending the fcc s sports exclusivity  network nonduplication  and syndex regulations and controlling the positioning of programmers on menus and program guides 
the act does not require lecs to use separate subsidiaries to provide incidental interlata video or audio programming services to subscribers or for their own programming ventures 
buyouts 
while there remains a general prohibition on lec buyouts of cable systems any ownership interest exceeding percent  cable operator buyouts of lec systems  and joint ventures between cable operators and lecs in the same market  the act provides certain exceptions to this prohibition 
a rural exemption permits buyouts where the purchased system serves an area with fewer than  inhabitants outside an urban area 
where a lec purchases a cable system  that system plus any other system in which the lec has an interest may not serve or more of the lec s telephone service area 
additional exceptions are also provided for such buyouts 
the act also provides the fcc with the power to grant waivers of the buyout provisions in cases where i the cable operator or lec would be subject to undue economic distress  the system or facilities would not be economically viable  or the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the effect of the transaction in meeting community needs 
the lfa must approve any such waiver 
electric utility entry into telecommunications the act provides that registered utility holding companies and subsidiaries may provide telecommunications including cable notwithstanding the public utilities holding company act 
electric utilities must establish separate subsidiaries  known as exempt telecommunications companies and must apply to the fcc for operating authority 
it is anticipated that large utility holding companies will become significant competitors to both cable television and other telecommunications providers 
miscellaneous reforms cross ownership  must carry 
the act eliminates broadcast cable cross ownership restrictions  but leaves in place fcc regulations prohibiting local cross ownership between television stations and cable systems and directs the fcc to reexamine the need for these rules 
the act repeals the network cable cross ownership rules  but empowers the fcc to adopt rules to ensure carriage  channel positioning and non discriminatory treatment of non affiliated broadcast stations by cable systems affiliated with a broadcast network 
the satellite master antenna television and multichannel multipoint distribution system cable cross ownership restrictions have been eliminated for cable operators subject to effective competition 
the act preserves must carry rights for local television broadcasters  and establishes new audience standards based on commercial publications which delineate television markets based on viewing patterns 
the fcc is directed to grant or deny must carry requests within days of a complaint being filed with the fcc 
cable equipment compatibility  scrambling requirements 
the act directs an fcc equipment compatibility rulemaking emphasizing that narrow technical standards  mandating a minimum degree of common design among televisions  vcrs  and cable systems  and relying heavily on the open marketplace  should be pursued  competition for all converter features unrelated to security descrambling should be maximized  and adopted standards should not affect unrelated telephone and computer features 
the act directs the fcc to adopt regulations which assure the competitive availability of converters navigation devices from vendors other than cable operators 
the act provides that the fcc s rules may not impinge upon signal security concerns or theft of service protections 
waivers will be possible where the cable operator shows the waiver is necessary for the introduction of new services 
once the equipment market becomes competitive  fcc regulations in this area will be terminated 
cable provision of internet services 
transmitting indecent material via the internet is made criminal by the act 
this provision is under judicial review 
however  on line access providers are exempted from criminal liability for simply providing interconnection service  they are also granted an affirmative defense from criminal or other action where in good faith they restrict access to indecent materials 
the act further exempts on line access providers from civil liability for actions taken in good faith to restrict access to obscene  excessively violent or otherwise objectionable material
