item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
acquisitions in september  the company significantly increased its scientific and technical staff  patent application portfolio  current product offerings  research and development programs  research and manufacturing facilities and its customer base by acquiring bioxytech sa now oxis sa and international bioclinical  inc ibc together the acquired businesses 
both acquisitions were completed through the exchange of stock  and were accounted for as purchases  accordingly  the acquired assets and liabilities were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition 
ibc was merged into the company 
oxis sa operates as a subsidiary of the company 
in july  in a transaction which was also accounted for as a purchase  the company acquired therox pharmaceuticals  inc therox through an exchange of stock 
therox was merged into a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the acquisition of therox provided the company with a technology portfolio complementary to its novel therapeutics for treatment of free radical associated diseases together with university partnerships and seven patents 
because the acquisitions have been accounted for as purchases  the company s consolidated results of operations include the operating results of the acquired businesses from the dates of acquisition only 
therefore  the results of operations of the acquired businesses are included in the consolidated statements of operations from september   and the results of therox s operations are included in the consolidated statements of operations from july  costs relating to the acquisitions and the company s more complex corporate structure and the increased research and development investments have placed significant demand on the company s limited financial resources 
see financial condition  liquidity and capital resources below 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources during the company s working capital deficit increased from  at december   to  at december  this increase in the company s working capital deficit resulted primarily from the effect of the net loss for  less non cash charges of  offset by proceeds from issuance of stock  and long term debt 
shareholders who hold  of notes that are included in current liabilities at december  have commitments to invest an amount at least equal to the note balances in equity securities of the company 
during march the company is negotiating with these shareholders terms for converting these notes to stock of the company 
if all such notes are converted to company stock  the company s working capital deficit will be reduced by  cash and certificates of deposit declined from  at december   to  at december  the company expects to continue to report losses in the near term as the level of expenses is expected to continue to exceed revenues 
the company must raise additional capital during the first half of failure to raise such additional capital would cause the company to severely curtail or cease operations 
for more information concerning the company s ability to continue as a going concern  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
while the company believes that its new products and technologies show considerable promise  its ability to realize significant revenues therefrom is dependent upon the company s success in developing business alliances with biotechnology and or pharmaceutical companies that have the required resources to develop and market certain of these products 
these is no assurance that the company s effort to develop such business alliances will be successful 
further  bovine superoxide dismutase sales of recent years to sanofi winthrop inc of revenues are not expected to continue 
sanofi winthrop announced in october that a second phase iii trial on its drug  dismutec a coupled form of oxis bovine superoxide dismutase to treat head trauma failed to show statistically significant improvements between the treatment and control groups 
although the company is currently seeking additional funds through a private placement described below  it cannot predict the source  terms  amount  form  and or availability of additional capital to fund its operations to the end of the current year 
the company has engaged an agent to assist on a best efforts basis to raise up to  in the first quarter of through the sale of its series c preferred stock 
on march   the company announced the first closing of the offering  with proceeds of  from the sale of series c preferred stock 
even if the company is able to sell the entire  of series c preferred stock  it expects that additional capital will be required during to continue operating in accordance with its current plans 
however  no assurances can be given that the company will successfully raise the needed capital 
if the company is unable to raise additional capital during the remainder of  it would endeavor to extend its ability to continue in business through the reduction of personnel and facility costs  by slowing its research and development efforts  and by reducing other operating costs  however  no assurances can be given that it will be able to do so 
results of operations the company s sales for the past three years consisted of the following diagnostic and research assays   bovine superoxide dismutase bsod for research and human use    palosein r bsod for veterinary use    other    total sales    diagnostic and research assays are products acquired with the acquisitions of ibc and oxis sa 
sales of these products for represent sales from september through the end of the year 
the entire year s sales of diagnostic and research assays are included in the company s sales for reductions of bulk bsod sales to sanofi winthrop and to the company s german licensee in were offset by an increase in sales to the company s spanish licensee  resulting in a slight increase in bulk bsod sales in in bulk bsod sales to sanofi winthrop declined further  and there were no sales to the company s german licensee 
these decreases were partially offset by a further increase in sales to the spanish licensee 
since no further sales of bsod to either sanofi winthrop or the company s german licensee are anticipated  future sales of bulk bsod are largely dependent on the needs of the company s spanish licensee 
although the spanish licensee has continued to purchase bsod in the first quarter of  the company has received no further firm orders for bsod beyond what has been shipped in the first quarter of thus  the company s sales of bulk bsod for and beyond are uncertain and difficult to predict and no assurances can be given with respect thereto 
sales of palosein r  which was reintroduced to the us market in and is sold primarily to veterinary wholesalers in the united states  increased from  in to  in and  in as a result of an active direct mail marketing campaign  which the company intends to continue 
royalty income in declined to  from  in as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company anticipates that royalties from licensees of its bsod products will be minimal in the future because of the recent regulatory developments in europe 
a further decline in royalties in was offset by a fee generated from an agreement to license rights to the company s technology for the rapid detection of antibiotic resistance 
costs and expenses cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased from in to in this increase in cost was partially due to the inclusion  in  of sales and cost of products of the businesses acquired in september the cost of those products includes the amortization of acquired technology  in and  in 
in addition  the cost of bulk bsod sales in was higher than usual due to a significant sale at less than the company s historic profit margin 
cost of sales as a percent of product sales declined from in to in in the cost of the company s diagnostic and research assays declined slightly as a result of increased volumes  and the cost of bulk bsod sales also declined from the level 
research and development costs increased from  in to  in and  in the increases were primarily due to the cost of the research and development activities associated with pharmaceutical technologies acquired in the september and july business acquisitions 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased from  in to  in this increase was due to the inclusion of general and administrative costs of the acquired businesses after the september acquisitions  other current expenses relating to the acquisitions  increases in insurance coverage  and increased marketing costs relating to palosein r and new products from the acquisitions 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased further in to  the increase in was due primarily to the inclusion for the entire year of general and administrative costs of the businesses acquired in  further increases in sales and marketing costs relating to palosein r and the new products from the acquisitions  and increased legal fees and other expenses relating to the company s ongoing need to raise capital and more complex corporate structure 
expenses included charges of  and  to operations for and  respectively  reflecting the write off of purchased in process technology  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest income and expense interest income decreased and interest expense increased in both and as the company liquidated certificates of deposit and borrowed funds pursuant to short term and long term interest bearing obligations to finance increased research and development efforts 
net loss the company incurred net losses in  and in the company recorded non recurring costs and expenses of  
per share relating to a contest for control of the company 
the loss includes a  
per share charge to operations for the write off of purchased in process technology related to the acquisitions of oxis sa and ibc 
similarly  the loss includes a  
per share charge to operations for the write off of purchased in process technology related to the acquisition of therox 
excluding these unusual charges  the company would have incurred a net income of  or 
per share for  a net loss of  or 
per share for  and a net loss of  or 
per share for increased research and development expenditures and selling  general and administrative expenses from the businesses acquired late in the third quarter of and increased research and development expenditures relating to the acquisition of therox early in the third quarter of contributed to the increased losses 
the company expects to incur a substantial net loss for if additional capital is raised through further sales of securities see financial condition  liquidity and capital resources  the company plans to continue to invest in research and development activities and incur sales  general and administrative expenses in amounts greater than its anticipated near term product margins 
if the company is unable to raise sufficient additional capital  it will have to cease  or severely curtail  its operations 
in this event  while expenses will be reduced  expense levels  and the potential write down of various assets  would still be in amounts greater than anticipated revenues
