item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  is incorporated herein by reference 
significant customers the company s customers are diverse and varied in size as well as location 
the distribution services are provided point to multi point so that the company is not dependent on any one  or a few customers 
the company does not have any individual customers who accounted for or more of its consolidated revenues in  or backlog the company generally does not have a significant backlog at any time because the company normally can deliver and install new location systems within the delivery schedule requested by customers generally within two weeks related to the ntn network  with a similar delivery and installation pattern for the learnstar system 
at december   the company had a backlog of uninstalled location systems of approximately new locations which were installed in january and february  for other distribution platforms  there is no backlog because services are generally distributed point to multi point and the company does not have to provide specific equipment to the customer  making it relatively simple to add new customers 
products provided to retail outlets are not backlogged since the selling season for any given video product is generally limited and production time to create any additionally needed copies is very short 
the company uses a number of fulfillment houses to duplicate disks and cd rom s 
government contracts the company provides its distribution services to a small number of government agencies usually military base recreation units  however the number of government customers is small compared to the overall customer base 
contracts with government agencies are provided under the same terms and conditions as other corporate customers and are not subject to renegotiation at the election of the government agency 
competitive conditions the interactive entertainment industry is in its formative stage  but currently may be divided into three major segments media distribution services such as on line services  telephone companies and cable television companies and hospitality s ntn network  equipment providers such as computer and peripheral equipment manufacturers  and content and programming providers  such as movie studios  ntn  and software publishers 
the company does not act as a direct provider of equipment to consumers 
the company operates as a media distribution service through its own ntn network 
also  the company is a program provider to an array of other media distribution services to consumers utilizing a variety of equipment 
ntn has a growing number of competitors in the programming segment of the interactive entertainment industry 
the company s programming content is not dependent upon  and consequently not bound by  any particular technology or method of distribution to the consumer 
the company s programming is  therefore  readily available to consumers on a wide variety of entertainment and media services including the ntn network  on line services including america online  genie  and the imagination network  and cable television  including gte mainstreet  which is available to households in certain regions 
the interactive television industry is still in its infancy 
few companies have developed the technological capabilities to broadcast interactive entertainment to large audiences that can compare to the nature and scope of programming broadcast on the ntn network 
although few companies  if any  have products or services identical to those provided by ntn  the company does compete with other companies for total entertainment dollars in the marketplace 
the company s programming competes generally with broadcast television  pay per view  and other content offered on cable television 
on other mediums  the company competes with other content and services available to the consumer through on line services 
the company s programming is interactive in nature but is distinguished from other forms of interactive programming by its simultaneous multi player format and the two way interactive features 
presently  the technological capabilities of transmitting entertainment products to the consumer exceed the supply of quality programming and services available on the existing delivery systems 
the company is able to utilize the wide variety of services available for transmission of entertainment products to the consumer by forming strategic alliances with service providers to supply the company s programs for re transmission 
the company s programming thus becomes available to the consumer over a multitude of media platforms and delivery systems 
hospitality 
currently  hospitality has no competitors that furnish live  multi player interactive entertainment in a similar scope and nature as provided by hospitality 
although hospitality has no direct competitors  it does compete for total entertainment dollars in the marketplace 
other forms of entertainment provided in public eating and drinking establishments include music based systems and cable and pay per view television 
however  evidence provided by customers indicates that patrons are inclined to stay longer and consume more food and drink when hospitality s interactive games are offered as the main source of entertainment 
accordingly  hospitality customers generally tend to view hospitality services as a profit generator rather than a cost center 
home 
in home s market  the consumer has a plethora of entertainment options from which to choose  ranging from cable television to telephone based services to computer on line providers 
home offers the only live  multi player games and services which are broadcast to multiple interactive platforms in the home today 
however  home competes for a share of the total home entertainment dollars against broadcast television  pay per view and other content offered on cable television 
home also competes with other programming available to consumers through on line services such as aol and prodigy 
cable television  in its various forms  provides consumers the opportunity to make viewing selections from anywhere between to free and pay channels  thus limiting the amount of time devoted to any particular channel 
for the most part  cable television is predominantly a passive medium  and does not offer the viewer the opportunity to participate in its programming  and even less frequently  does it offer programming designed for active participation 
on line services  such as aol  can provide literally thousands of options for content and entertainment  however  such on line services have traditionally been confined to that company s subscriber base 
interaction among viewers is thus limited to the particular program as offered only on the specific on line service 
the company  on the other hand  offers consumers the opportunity to participate and compete against other viewers who are seeing the identical program over several different technological media  including interactive television  personal computers and or the ntn network 
learnstar 
products and services to education customers utilizing the learnstar system were sold beginning in the company competes with some established businesses which offer educational products  however  the majority of existing products in the marketplace are passive  rather than interactive 
such companies include jostens learning  ccc and the eduquest division of ibm 
the competitive advantage of the learnstar system is that it provides an easy to use  two way interactive learning method  is very competitively priced and requires less equipment than traditional systems 
moreover  the learnstar system is adaptable to the particular needs of the individual users and is designed such that it can be used for local  regional  and national competitions on a mass basis utilizing existing satellite technology 
although the market for providing learning services to schools is mature  the company believes that the market for advanced educational products which use computers  interactive software and satellite technology is embryonic 
iwn 
the us gaming industry is growing at a rapid pace 
in  americans wagered over billion on legal commercial gaming compared to billion in a survey showed that of american adults wagered in one or more types of government approved gambling last year 
in  the total handle for pari mutuel was billion  of which billion was horse racing 
in comparison  billion was spent at the cinema and billion was spent on spectator sports 
one of the reasons for the growth in gaming has been the favorable regulatory and legislative environment 
many states have accepted gaming as a means to raise tax revenue and encourage economic development 
there are approximately pari mutuel facilities in the us  and seven states have legalized account based telephone wagering  including new york and connecticut  which allow interstate telephone wagering 
pari mutuel wagering is the fourth largest segment in the gaming industry 
analysts estimate that in approximately billion was wagered on us thoroughbred horse racing  compared with billion in while the overall growth of the pari mutuel handle has been stagnant over the last five years  particularly when compared to the significant growth in the overall gaming industry  the shift from on track wagering to off track betting is an important trend 
with the total us thoroughbred horse racing handle in the billion range  off track betting increased from billion in to billion in to billion in off track betting is allowed in of the states where pari mutuel wagering is legal and is an increasingly important source of revenue for racetracks and state governments 
iwn s homestretch tm product is intended to leverage the trend to off track wagering by allowing fans to place wagers from virtually anywhere to their account at the racetrack 
iwn will eventually compete for total entertainment dollars in the market place 
within the gaming and wagering industry  competition for the pari mutuel wagering dollar comes from expanded alternative gaming opportunities 
outside the industry  pari mutuel wagering competes with all forms of entertainment vying for consumer spending dollars 
potential competitors in the interactive pari mutuel wagering and gaming market include company description on demand services originally part of united video 
developed a proprietary set top box to deliver interactive television racing and wagering 
simulcast racing network plans to broadcast a pay per view racing channel with interactive wagering 
gaming and entertainment plans to offer the hotel and sports bar markets television closed circuit pay per view and sports fantasy leagues with participant wagering 
new world 
the video game and entertainment software industry is very competitive 
competitive factors include access to licenses  brand name recognition  product features and quality  access to distribution channels and price 
new world competes with other developers of pc and video game entertainment software 
competitors vary in size from small companies with limited resources to very large companies such as microsoft  broderbund software and electronic arts 
the industry has evolved into a very large and fragmented market in which new world is a small competitor 
most of the industry leaders produce cd rom titles and most have greater financial and marketing capabilities than new world 
however  the market is still relatively young  especially for cd rom technology  and is likely to continue to grow rapidly as pc s increase their household penetration 
with the entrance of motion picture  cable and tv companies  competition in the interactive entertainment and multimedia industries will likely intensify in the future 
moreover  new technologies  such as on line networks and the internet  provide computer users an alternative to video games and entertainment software  but also offer companies like new world an opportunity to deliver product via new media 
the company seeks to compete by providing high quality products at reasonable prices  thereby establishing a favorable reputation among frequent buyers  thus providing repeat sales on sequels and other products manufactured and or distributed by the company

the company works closely with independent user groups in an attempt to develop enhancements and new services and products in response to customer needs 
government regulations compliance with federal  state and local laws have not had a material effect upon the company s capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position to date 
the company does not anticipate that it will have to incur any material expenses in the future in order to comply with federal  state or local laws because of the nature of its current services and products 
gaming laws in many states currently restrict the ability of individuals to place wagers off site from a regulated wagering facility 
the ability of iwn to carry out its business objective will be dependent upon enabling legislation in states and other countries 
employees the company and its subsidiaries employ approximately people on a full time basis and people on a part time basis  and utilizes independent contractors on a project basis 
in addition  ntn retains a number of non affiliated programming and systems consultants 
it is expected that as the company expands  additional employees and consultants will be required

throughout the company s history  the principal component of its revenues has been derived from distribution services from locations in the hospitality industry restaurants  bars and hotels 
management believes that this component will continue to grow in total revenues within the next year  but may decline as a percentage of the company s total revenues 
to increase the number of locations  the company has taken several steps 
it increased its sales staff to accommodate the growth in and the anticipated growth in the company offers sales and technical support to its independent distributors  who are responsible for marketing the company s services to potential locations 
in  the company will continue to attend national and regional hospitality industry trade shows and has increased its budget for advertising in trade publications 
in  the company enhanced its graphics capabilities and obtained additional advertising revenues from national advertisers

in addition  the company has commenced the development of marketing materials and a direct mail campaign for corporate training services 
to enhance the company s capabilities for use in special events and corporate training  the company has developed a system that allows up to playmakers tm to be used at a single event 
revenues from sales of equipment used in locations has historically been a material component of the company s revenue 
potential growth in this area  however  is largely dependent on the company s success in increasing the number of locations and the business of the company s foreign licensees 
management believes that another market segment with potential for long term growth is the market for interactive television services in the home 
the company expects to remain a provider of specialized programming to networks operated by other organizations  such as cable networks  computer on line systems and wireless or telephone based communication networks 
the company expects to deliver the video portion of its programming directly to cable television systems  with viewer responses using equipment developed by others 
in light of this  the company expects that any significant revenues from home use of the company s services will be dependent upon an expansion in the overall home viewer market for home interactive information and entertainment services 
the company maintains excellent working relationships with major providers of home interactive information and entertainment services 
as the market for home interactive information and entertainment services expands  the company will seek to capitalize on this market 
revenues to date from in home programming have not been significant 
the company has plans to expand its penetration in the education sector as well 
currently  the learnstar system is operational at over schools throughout the nation 
in  the company will focus efforts to expand into additional schools in many states 
revenues from these sources have not been significant in the past and no assurance can be given that plans to expand the education market will be successful 
revenues from product sales of interactive software and video games have been fairly consistent over the past few years 
in  the company plans to expand its available products through the publication of software developed by independent sources and by continuing to internally create new games and products 
further  the company intends to publish products on additional technological platforms such as the sony playstation and other similar type entertainment systems 
further  the company intends to offer its services and products to new media platforms such as on line services and the internet 
although there can be no assurance that the company will prove to be successful in implementing its marketing and expansion plan  management believes that the company s prospects have been materially improved by the growth of the core business units and increased customer awareness 
the company has several lawsuits pending as previously described in legal proceedings 
there can be no assurance that any or all of the described actions will be decided in favor of the company 
the company believes  based in part on the advice of outside  independent counsel  that the costs of defending and prosecuting these actions will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations and that any adverse outcome of the litigation involving in also will not result in a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operation  or the company s position in the interactive industry 
in march  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas 
sfas requires that impairment losses for long lived assets be recognized if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  without interest  is less than the carrying amount of the asset 
the standard also requires that assets designated to be disposed of are to be recorded at the lower of the asset carrying value or fair value less cost to sell 
the company has not adopted sfas the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no
