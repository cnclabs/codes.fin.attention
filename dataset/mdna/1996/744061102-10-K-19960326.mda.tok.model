risk risk is integral to insurance but  as is customary in the insurance business  risk exposure is kept within acceptable limits 
the company s subsidiaries retain no more than  of life insurance and  of accidental death benefits for any single life 
excess coverages are reinsured externally 
at december   approximately billion  or approximately percent of total life insurance in force  was reinsured with nonaffiliated insurance companies 
the company would become liable for the reinsured risks if the reinsurers could not meet their obligations 
the company s life insurance affiliates in many cases require evidence of insurability before issuing individual life policies including  in some cases  a medical examination or a statement by an attending physician 
home office underwriters review that evidence and approve the issuance of the policy in accordance with the application if the risk is acceptable 
some applicants who are substandard risks are rejected  but many are offered policies with higher premiums or restricted coverages 
as of december   approximately percent of life insurance in force was represented by risks which were substandard at the time the policy was issued 
the majority of individual health insurance is providian direct insurance business and written without evidence of insurability  relying on safeguards such as product design  limits on the amount of coverage  and premiums which recognize the resultant higher level of claims

as a diversified financial services company  many of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature and thus are sensitive to changes in the interest rate environment 
additional information about interest rate risk is included in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
regulation insurance the business of the company s insurance subsidiaries is subject to regulation and supervision by the insurance regulatory authority of each state in which the subsidiaries are licensed to do business 
such regulators grant licenses to transact business  regulate trade practices  approve policy forms  license agents  approve certain premium rates  establish minimum reserve and loss ratio requirements  review form and content of required financial statements  prescribe the type and amount of investments permitted  and assure that capital  surplus and solvency requirements are met 
insurance companies can also be required under the solvency or guaranty laws of most states in which they do business to pay assessments up to prescribed limits to fund policyholder losses or liabilities of insolvent insurance companies 
they are also required to file detailed annual reports with supervisory agencies  and records of their business are subject to examination at any time 
under the rules of the national association of insurance commissioners the naic  a self regulatory organization of state insurance commissioners  insurance companies are examined periodically by one or more of the supervisory agencies 
item continued the naic adopted  in december of  a risk based capital for life and or health insurers model act the model act which was designed to identify inadequately capitalized life and health insurers 
the model act defines two key measures i total adjusted capital  which equals an insurer s statutory capital and surplus plus its asset valuation reserve  plus half its liability for policyholder dividends  and ii risk based capital 
risk based capital is determined by a complex formula which is intended to take into account the various risks assumed by an insurer 
the naic adopted a similar  though more elaborate model act for property casualty insurers in december of should an insurer s adjusted capital fall below certain prescribed levels defined in terms of its risk based capital  the model act provides for four different levels of regulatory attention company action level triggered if an insurer s adjusted capital is less than but greater than or equal to of its risk based capital  requires the insurer to submit a plan to the appropriate regulatory authority that discusses proposed corrective action 
regulatory action level triggered if an insurer s adjusted capital is less than but greater than or equal to of its risk based capital  authorizes the regulatory authority to perform a special examination of the insurer and to issue an order specifying corrective actions 
authorized control level triggered if an insurer s adjusted capital is less than but greater than or equal to of its risk based capital  authorizes the regulatory authority to take whatever action it deems necessary 
mandatory control level triggered if an insurer s adjusted capital falls below of its risk based capital  requires the regulatory authority to place the insurer under its control 
since the total adjusted capital levels of the company s insurance subsidiaries currently exceed all of the action levels as defined by the naic s model acts  these model acts currently have no impact on the company s operations or financial condition 
although the federal government does not directly regulate insurance business  except with respect to medicare supplement plans  legislation and administration policies concerning premiums  age and gender discrimination  financial services and taxation  among other areas  can significantly affect the insurance business
