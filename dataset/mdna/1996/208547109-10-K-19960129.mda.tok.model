product license revenues increased to  in fiscal compared with  in fiscal  which was up from product license revenues of  in fiscal the fiscal increase was due to higher levels of sales in both of the company s product lines 
broken out by product line  product license revenue attributable to products in the company s workstream dfs product line increased to  in fiscal compared with  in fiscal  which was up from revenues of  in fiscal the increase was due to a resurgence in demand in the semiconductor industry for the company s workstream and workstream open products  as well as commercial availability of the company s new workstream dfs application servers 
throughout  the semiconductor industry expanded rapidly  and many industry observers expect it to continue to do so in license revenues attributable to the flowstream product line increased to  in fiscal compared with  in fiscal  which was down from revenues of  in fiscal the increase in fiscal from fiscal was due to a higher level of acceptance of the flowstream product in the pharmaceutical industry  which historically has not used packaged computer systems to track plant floor operations and is therefore in the early stages of adopting such systems 
the fiscal product license revenue figure for flowstream included million in non refundable prepaid license fees associated with a major agreement signed by the company with honeywell automation and control 
excluding this transaction  flowstream revenues were up in fiscal from net revenues of  in fiscal the company does not expect product license revenues to grow at the percentage levels reached in  as future growth will be compared with relatively stronger periods than in earlier years 
in addition  future growth could be negatively affected if the semiconductor industry slowed its expansion  or if the pharmaceutical industry  which has not yet adopted computer automated manufacturing on a wide scale  does not develop into a strong market for the company s flowstream product line 
finally  competition is expected to increase  and there can be no assurance that competitive pressures will not have a material effect on the company s business 
additional competitors entering the market could result in customer deferral of purchasing decisions for the company s products in the near term  as prospective customers evaluate competitive products 
the company s product license revenue historically has been concentrated in a relatively small number of customers and its products have a high average selling price

the company anticipates maintenance revenues associated with its workstream dfs and flowstream product lines will continue to increase in the near term due to the higher volume of product licenses sold in recent quarters which are scheduled to commence maintenance terms 
the decrease in services revenues from fiscal to fiscal primarily was due to a reduction in custom programming revenues 
development revenues

the results of these development contracts and porting projects are expected to become standard products upon completion of the work 
development revenues can vary significantly from period to period  depending upon the number of contracts which have been entered into 
in addition  the timing and scope of development projects can change during the period of development  making it difficult to accurately forecast the level of development revenues beyond the near term 
based on current projects planned  development revenues in fiscal are expected to remain approximately constant with fiscal levels
