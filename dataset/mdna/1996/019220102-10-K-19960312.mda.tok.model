insurance premiums are established before the amount of losses and loss settlement expenses  or the extent to which inflation may affect such expenses  is known 
consequently  the company attempts to anticipate the impact of inflation in establishing premiums 
inflation is implicitly considered in the determination of reserves for losses and loss settlement expenses since portions of the reserves are expected to be paid over extended periods of time 
the importance of continually reviewing reserves is even more pronounced in periods of extreme inflation
