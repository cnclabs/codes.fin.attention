inflation inflation can be expected to have an impact on the company s operating costs 
the effect of inflation has been minimal since however  a prolonged period of inflation would adversely affect the company s results of operations unless freight rates could be increased proportionately 
seasonality the nature of the company s primary traffic appliances  automotive parts  paper products  electrical equipment  and packaged foodstuffs causes it to be distributed with relative uniformity throughout the year 
however  operating costs and earnings have historically been affected adversely during the fourth quarter by inclement weather conditions that reduce efficiencies 
these cost increases include the effect of higher fuel prices that are generally experienced during the fourth quarter and repairs typically scheduled during idle time experienced during the holiday seasons  thus increasing maintenance costs during this period
