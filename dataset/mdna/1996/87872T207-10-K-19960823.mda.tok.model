the common equivalent shares increased during fiscal by approximately  shares 
of this increase  approximately  shares was attributable to shares issuable upon the exercise of options  which shares were antidilutive in fiscal and therefore were excluded from total common and common equivalent shares outstanding for that year 
including such options  common and common equivalent shares decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  due to treasury stock purchases and terminated employee stock option forfeitures and surrenders partially offset by stock options granted

the million from financing activities is largely attributable to the exercise of options with respect to million shares of the company s common stock during the fiscal year 
the company used a net of million in cash for operations primarily due to increased sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to fiscal and the resulting increase in receivables 
cash generated by operations has still been substantial and more than adequate for the company s cash needs 
in addition  the company s significant amount of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities has provided ample liquidity to handle the company s operating cash requirements during temporary shortfalls in cash from timing issues 
at the end of fiscal the company had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
tsc s net working capital increased to million on may   from million on may  this increase is primarily due to increased receivables of million and increased cash and cash equivalents of million 
net receivables were million and million at may  and  respectively 
the increase in receivables is primarily the result of the increase in revenues 
receivables are net of million and million in allowance for doubtful receivables at may  and  respectively 
it is currently anticipated that cash and marketable securities will be used for general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures  treasury stock purchases and expansion of tsc s business as opportunities arise  including the possibility of additional acquisitions 
tsc has no specific plans with respect to additional acquisitions and none have been identified  but tsc might consider additional acquisition prospects if they were attractive to tsc and complementary to its existing business 
there can be no assurance  however  that tsc will successfully identify  complete  or integrate any additional acquisitions

at may   the company was in compliance with these financial ratio requirements 
as of may   no borrowings were made under the facility 
the company intends to renew the facility upon its expiration 
all share and per share data have been adjusted to reflect the effect of the company s three for two stock split effective july  impact of inflation and backlog inflation should not have a significant impact on tsc s income to the extent tsc is able as it has been to date to raise its consulting rates commensurate with its staff compensation rates 
because the majority of tsc s contracts may be terminated on relatively short notice  tsc does not consider backlog to be meaningful 
page assumptions underlying certain forward looking statements and factors that may affect future results in the next few years  the company expects growth in both revenues and profits to continue at rates higher than the estimated industry growth rate of percent source dataquest  although not at the exceptional rates posted in fiscal this lower growth rate should enable the company to improve its profit margins which have not been at targeted levels during the last two years due to the impact of the employee retention program instituted in the third quarter of fiscal  the significant increase in sales and marketing expenses and the impact of recruiting and assimilating into the organization the large number of people hired in the last two years 
the company faces a number of risks in continuing to expand  even at growth rates lower than the percent experienced in fiscal the major risks are those of staffing and the delivery of a quality product that meets client specification 
tsc has a reputation for delivering its consulting assignments on time and in accordance with the contracted specifications 
tsc s projects provide significant business benefits to the client 
in order to meet its client commitments  the company must be able to recruit the consulting and project management personnel required 
each year  it must also be able to train and assimilate the large number of people that are required to support this growth rate 
additionally  there must be a continuing stream of new projects so that staff completing a given client assignment can be reassigned to new projects 
additionally  the recruiting and staff assignment process must be geographically focused 
because of the project based nature of the company s work and the fact that many of the projects undertaken by the company are large projects  there is the risk of a material impact on operating results because of the unanticipated suspension or cancellation of a large project 
the suspension or cancellation of a project could result in a drop in revenues  the need to reassign staff  a potential dispute with a client regarding monies owed for consulting work and expenses  and a lessening of tsc s reputation 
tsc operates in a rapidly changing and highly competitive market 
additional risks not discussed herein may emerge from time to time 
the company cannot predict such risks or assess the impact  if any  such risks may have on its business 
consequently  the company s various forward looking statements  made  or to be made  should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results
