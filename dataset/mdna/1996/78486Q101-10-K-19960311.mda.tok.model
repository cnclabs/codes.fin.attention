net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest earnings assets and interest bearing liabilities  referred to as volume change 
net interest income is also affected by changes in yields earned on interest earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  referred to as rate change 
the following table sets forth changes in interest income and interest expense for each major category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the table also reflects the amount of change attributable to volume and rate changes for the years indicated 
changes relating to investments in municipal securities are presented on a fully taxable equivalent basis using the federal statutory rate of in  and compared to compared to increase decrease due to increase decrease due to change in change in volume rate total volume rate total dollars in thousands interest income federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell     investment securities     loans       increase in interest income       interest expense money market  now and savings deposits     time deposits federal funds purchased increase in interest expense      increase in net interest income       net interest income  on a fully taxable equivalent basis  totaled million in  an increase of million  or  from the million total in the increase in net interest income was the result of a million  or  increase in interest income  offset by a million  or  increase in interest expense over the comparable prior year period 
in  net interest income  on a fully taxable equivalent basis  increased million  or  compared to the million earned in this increase was primarily attributable to an million increase in interest income compared to due to growth in average loans and the effect of rising market interest rates throughout the million increase in interest income  as compared to  was the result of a million favorable volume variance and a million favorable rate variance 
the favorable volume variance resulted from a million  or  increase in average interest earning assets over the comparable prior year period 
this increase was comprised of loans  which increased million  and lower yielding liquid investments in federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell  which increased million  and was offset by a million decrease in investment securities due to maturities and paydowns 
though average loans in increased from the prior year due to commercial loan growth of million  average loans were negatively impacted during by the initial public offering ipo market  as the company experienced an unusually large amount of loan payoffs in connection with a number of its clients completing public stock offerings 
the increase in average federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell resulted from significant growth in the company s deposits  and management s decision to invest excess funds in short term liquid investments due to the relatively flat interest rate environment during much of the increase in market interest rates throughout and the early part of also contributed to the growth of interest income in interest income in increased million  as compared to  due to a basis points increase in the average yield on interest earning assets 
of this increase  million was attributable to loans  as the average yield on loans increased to in  up from in this increase in the average yield on loans during was related to the aforementioned increase in market interest rates  as a substantial portion of the company s loans are prime rate based 
interest income increased million from to the growth in average interest earning assets during resulted in a million favorable impact on interest income as compared to average interest earning assets increased million  or  to million in  compared to million in during  average loans increased million  or  from due to increased loan demand resulting from improving economic conditions  increased marketing efforts by the company  and a general slowing in the marketplace for ipos compared to the prior year 
average investment securities increased and average federal funds sold decreased in compared to as a result of management s decisions in late and early to invest excess funds in longer term investment securities as opposed to federal funds sold 
rising market interest rates throughout contributed to a million increase in interest income over  as the average yield on interest earning assets in increased basis points over the average yield 
total interest expense in increased million from the total in due to increases in both the volume of and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the million  or  increase in average interest bearing liabilities during was concentrated in higher rate money market deposits  and resulted in a million increase in the cost of funding during changes in the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities also had an unfavorable impact on interest expense as compared to the prior year 
the rising interest rate environment during and early led to a million increase in interest expense  as the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased basis points from to average interest bearing liabilities in were flat compared to  resulting in little change in interest expense for as compared to provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is based on management s evaluation of the adequacy of the existing allowance for loan losses in relation to total loans  and on management s continuous assessment of the inherent and identified risk dynamics of the loan portfolio resulting from reviews of selected individual loans and loan commitments 
the provision for loan losses was million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the million  or  increase in as compared to was related to an increase in nonperforming loans during the million  or  decrease in the provision for loan losses from to reflected management s election to charge off million in nonperforming loans at year end for a more detailed discussion of credit quality and the allowance for loan losses  see the item section entitled financial condition credit quality and the allowance for loan losses 
noninterest income the following table summarizes the components of noninterest income for the past three years years ended december  dollars in thousands disposition of client warrants    letter of credit and foreign exchange income    deposit service charges    investment gains losses  other total noninterest income    noninterest income increased million  or  in as compared to this growth was primarily attributable to a million increase in income from the disposition of client warrants  as the company exercised warrants held in some of its clients which completed public stock offerings  and a million decrease in losses incurred through the sales of investment securities 
noninterest income decreased million  or  in as compared to the decrease in noninterest income from to was primarily due to a million decline in income from the disposition of client warrants  as well as a million increase in losses incurred through the sales of investment securities 
the company has historically obtained rights to acquire stock in the form of warrants in certain nonpublic clients as part of negotiated credit facilities 
the receipt of warrants does not change the loan covenants or other collateral control techniques employed by the company to mitigate the risk of a loan becoming nonperforming 
interest rates  loan fees and collateral requirements on loans with warrants are similar to lending arrangements where warrants are not obtained 
the timing and amount of income from the disposition of client warrants typically depends upon factors beyond the control of the company  including the general condition of the capital markets  and therefore cannot be predicted with any degree of accuracy and is likely to vary materially from period to period 
letter of credit fees  foreign exchange fees and other trade finance income totaled million in  an increase of million  or  from the million earned in  and an increase of million  or  from the total in the growth in this category of noninterest income reflects a concerted effort by management to expand the penetration of trade finance related services among the company s client base 
deposit service charges were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these service charges decreased million  or  from to  and million  or  from to clients compensate the company for depository services either through earnings credits computed on their demand deposit balances  or via explicit payments recognized as deposit service charges 
as interest rates rose during and early  the earnings credits were higher  thus lowering the amount of explicit deposit service charges 
the company incurred million in losses through sales of investment securities during  a million  or  decrease from the prior year 
the securities sold during were primarily mortgage backed securities 
the million in securities losses realized during resulted from the sale of million of the company s available for sale investment portfolio and included mortgage backed securities  as well as us treasury and us agencies securities 
all sales of investment securities were conducted as a normal component of the company s interest rate risk and liquidity management activities 
noninterest expense noninterest expense in totaled million  a million  or  increase from noninterest expense was million in  a million  or  decrease from management closely monitors the level of noninterest expense using a variety of financial ratios  including the efficiency ratio 
the efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of noninterest expense  excluding costs associated with other real estate owned  by adjusted revenues  defined as the total of net interest income and noninterest income  excluding income from the disposition of client warrants and gains or losses incurred through sales of investment securities 
this ratio reflects the level of operating expense required to generate of operating revenue 
the company s efficiency ratio improved to in  down from in and in the following table presents the detail of noninterest expense and the incremental contribution of each line item to the company s efficiency ratio years ended december  percent of percent of percent of adjusted adjusted adjusted amount revenues amount revenues amount revenues dollars in thousands compensation and benefits    professional services    occupancy    equipment    fdic deposit insurance    data processing services  corporate legal and litigation   client services   other    total excluding cost of other real estate owned    cost of other real estate owned   total noninterest expense    compensation and benefits expenses were million in  a million  or  increase over the total of million 
total compensation and benefits expenses were million in the number of average full time equivalent fte staff employed by the company during was compared with and in and  respectively

professional services expenses were million in  a million  or  decrease from the million incurred in total professional services expenses in were million  or  lower than the million incurred in the level of these expenses during each of the past three years reflects the extensive efforts undertaken by the company to build its infrastructure 
occupancy and equipment expenses totaled million in  an increase of million  or  compared to the prior year total of million 
total occupancy and equipment expenses in increased million  or  from the million incurred in the most significant component of the increase from to was related to certain non recurring costs incurred in connection with the company s move into a new headquarters facility 
these non recurring costs included both the disposal and purchase of premises and equipment 
the move into the new facility was completed in the fourth quarter of the increases in occupancy and equipment expenses from to and to are also related to investments in office space  computer equipment and other costs associated with the company s growth in personnel during those periods 
fdic deposit insurance expense was million in  a million  or  decrease from the total in  and a million  or  decrease from the total in this decrease in from the expense levels of the past two years resulted from a reduction in the bank s assessment rate in the third quarter of due to completion of the recapitalization of the bank insurance fund 
the bank s assessment rate beginning january  was further reduced from the rate in effect for the fourth quarter of see item business supervision and regulation premiums for deposit insurance 
data processing services expenses were million in  a decrease of million  or  from these expenses totaled million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in data processing services expenses in as compared to the total incurred in and was due to million of non recurring data processing conversion costs 
corporate legal and litigation expenses in totaled million  a million  or  decrease from the million incurred in  and a million  or  decrease from the million incurred in the and legal and litigation expenses incurred by the company included a significant amount of expenditures associated with the defense of a shareholder class action lawsuit filed against the company in june this lawsuit was settled in the third quarter of client services expenses include courier expenses and related costs of loan and deposit operations 
these expenses have declined from the total of million  to million in and million in  due to an increase in reimbursements from clients and a decline in client deposits related to the title and escrow industry  for which client services were provided 
other expenses in totaled million  a significant increase from the million and million incurred in and  respectively 
the increase compared to the prior two years was related to increased travel and other miscellaneous expenses resulting from the company s growth in staff and increased business development efforts 
the net costs associated with other real estate owned oreo were minimal in  as gains from the sales of oreo properties slightly exceeded the costs of maintaining all of the company s oreo properties 
the net costs of oreo decreased million  or  from to  and million  or  from to  as the company s credit quality improved and a number of oreo properties were liquidated 
the improvement in credit quality and the sales of oreo properties reduced the company s average oreo balance from million in  to million in and million in the costs associated with oreo include maintenance expenses  property taxes  marketing costs  net operating expense or income associated with income producing properties  property write downs  and gains or losses on the sales of such properties 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate was in  compared to in and in the reduction in the company s effective tax rate  as compared to  was attributable to adjustments in the company s estimate of its tax liabilities 
the increase in the effective rate for  as compared to  primarily relates to a decline in the level of interest income from non taxable investments relative to total taxable income 
financial condition the company s total assets were billion at december   an increase of million  or  compared to billion at december  federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell totaled million at december   an increase of million  or  compared to the million outstanding at the prior year end 
this increase resulted from significant growth in the bank s deposits  and management s decision to invest excess funds in short term investments due to the relatively flat interest rate environment at the end of investment securities the following table details the composition of investments at december   and december  dollars in thousands us treasury us    us agencies and corporations discount notes and bonds    collateralized mortgage obligations    mortgage backed securities   commercial paper   obligations of states and political subdivisions    other equity securities    total    investment securities totaled million at december   which represented a million  or  increase over the december  balance of million 
the increase in investment securities was related to the company s liquidity management activities  as a portion of the growth in the bank s deposits during was invested in notes issued by us agencies as well as commercial paper  rather than in federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell 
the company sold collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage backed securities with an amortized cost of million in  and us treasury and agencies securities as well as mortgage backed securities with an amortized cost of million in all investment securities sold in and were classified as available for sale  and all sales were conducted as a normal component of the company s interest rate risk and liquidity management activities 
investment securities held by the company at december  that were issued by a single party  excluding the us government and us government agencies and corporations  and exceeded of the company s shareholders equity at year end  consisted solely of million in commercial paper issued by us lease capital corporation 
the following table provides the remaining contractual principal maturities and fully taxable equivalent yields on investment securities 
the weighted average yield is computed using the amortized cost of available for sale securities  which are reported at fair value 
expected remaining maturities of collateralized mortgage obligations will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations with or without penalties 
other equity securities were included in the table below as maturing after ten years 
maturing in after one after five one year year to years to total or less five years ten years weighted weighted weighted weighted fair average fair average fair average fair average december  value yield value yield value yield value yield dollars in thousands us treasury securities    us agencies and corporations discount notes and bonds    collateralized mortgage obligations   commercial paper   obligations of states and political subdivisions    other equity securities  total     after ten years weighted fair average december  value yield us treasury securities us agencies and corporations discount notes and bonds collateralized mortgage obligations  commercial paper obligations of states and political subdivisions other equity securities  total  collateralized mortgage obligations cmos pose risks not associated with fixed maturity bonds  primarily related to the ability of the mortgage borrower to prepay the loan without penalty 
this risk  known as prepayment risk  may cause the cmo to remain outstanding for a period of time different than that assumed at the time of purchase 
when rates decline  prepayments generally increase causing the average expected remaining maturity of the cmo to decrease 
conversely  if interest rates rise  prepayments tend to decrease  lengthening the cmo s average expected remaining maturity 
loans the composition of the loan portfolio as of december  net of unearned income  for each of the past five years is as follows december  dollars in thousands commercial      real estate term      real estate construction      consumer and other      total loans      total loans at december  were million  a million  or  increase compared to the million outstanding at december  though total loans at december  were higher than at the prior year end  loan balances throughout were negatively impacted by the ipo market  as the company experienced an unusually large amount of loan payoffs in connection with a number of its clients having completed public stock offerings 
these loan payoffs primarily affected the company s commercial loan portfolio 
consumer and other loans at year end were significantly higher than at the prior year end  as the company began offering personal lines of credit to executives of its clients in late the following tables set forth the maturity distribution of the company s loans reported on a gross basis at december   for fixed and variable rate commercial and real estate construction loans december  after one year and one year through after or less five years five years total dollars in thousands fixed rate loans commercial     real estate construction total fixed rate loans     variable rate loans commercial     real estate construction   total variable rate loans     upon maturity  loans satisfying the company s credit quality standards may be eligible for renewal 
such renewals are subject to the normal underwriting and credit administration practices associated with new loans 
the company does not grant loans with unconditional extension terms 
commercial loans to clients served by the company s technology and special industries groups are generally secured by business and personal assets 
client credit needs are typically in the range of million to million  and advance rates do not typically exceed of estimated collateral values 
the company s technology group focuses on commercial lending to companies within a variety of technology and life sciences industries  such as semiconductors  electronics  software  communications  peripherals  medical devices  biotechnology and others 
the company s technology group serves clients across the nation 
these clients are generally not affected by local economic cycles as much as they are influenced by the global market conditions for their industry s products or services 
lenders in the company s special industries group sig serve clients in a variety of middle market commercial enterprises  primarily in northern california 
the company s strategy is to identify under served niches where a strong opportunity exists to serve targeted clients  generally those with credit needs under million  by developing a high level of knowledge of the target market and its business cycles and risks 
in and  the company identified the wine industry and religious institutions as two new niches  and in has identified a niche within the entertainment industry 
the company has commenced lending operations related to all three of these new niches 
within sig  the company s real estate division is selectively involved in lending operations related to real estate construction projects  including owner build to suit residences and pre leased commercial buildings 
in addition  the real estate division supports other bank lending groups with its expertise in real estate lending 
real estate term loans are usually made to clients of the technology or special industries groups to finance commercial real estate to be operated by the client 
loan to value ratios of real estate loans generally do not exceed of the estimated value of the underlying real estate 
while a substantial percentage of the company s commercial loans originate within the technology group  such loans are made to both emerging growth and middle market companies in a variety of industries  as well as to industry executives  and no particular industry sector as identified by standard industrial codes represents a significant concentration within the loan portfolio 
loan administration responsibility for the company s loan policies resides with the company s board of directors 
this responsibility is managed through the approval and periodic review of the company s loan policies 
the board of directors delegates authority to the directors loan committee to supervise the loan underwriting  approval and monitoring activities of the company 
the directors loan committee consists of outside board of directors members and the company s chief executive officer 
under the oversight of the directors loan committee  lending authority is delegated to the chief credit officer and the company s internal loan committee consisting of the chief credit officer  lending division managers  and loan administrators 
requests for new and existing credits which meet certain size and underwriting criteria may be approved outside of the company s internal loan committee by designated division managers or team leaders jointly with a loan administrator 
credits exceeding million must be approved by the directors loan committee  as stipulated in the federal reserve bank s regulatory consent order 
the loan approval and committee system is administered by the company s credit administration group 
loan administrators assigned to each lending division report to the chief credit officer  who also acts as chair of the internal loan committee 
in response to the significant increase in nonperforming assets and loan charge offs during  management began an extensive review of the company s loan policies and procedures  portfolio management practices  and credit review process during the fourth quarter of that year 
the company also hired experienced loan administrators and loan review officers in an effort to restore and maintain a high level of asset quality in its loan portfolio 
credit quality and the allowance for loan losses lending money involves an inherent risk of nonpayment 
through the administration of loan policies and monitoring of the portfolio  management seeks to reduce such risks 
the allowance for loan losses is an estimate to provide a financial buffer for losses  both identified and unidentified  in the loan portfolio 
management regularly reviews and monitors the loan portfolio to determine the risk profile of each credit  and to identify credits whose risk profiles have changed 
this review includes  but is not limited to  such factors as payment status  the financial condition of the borrower  borrower compliance with loan covenants  underlying collateral values  potential loan concentrations  and general economic conditions 
potential problem credits are identified and  based upon known information  action plans are developed 
management has established an evaluation process designed to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
this process attempts to assess the risk of losses inherent in the portfolio by segregating the allowance for loan losses into three components specific  loss migration  and general 
the specific component is established by allocating a portion of the allowance to individual classified credits on the basis of specific circumstances and assessments 
the loss migration component is calculated as a function of the historical loss migration experience of the internal loan credit risk rating categories 
the general component is an unallocated portion that supplements the first two components and includes management s judgment of the effect of current and forecasted economic conditions on the company s borrowers abilities to repay  an evaluation of the allowance for loan losses in relation to the size of the overall loan portfolio  an evaluation of the composition of  and growth trends within  the loan portfolio  consideration of the relationship of the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans  net charge off trends  and other factors 
while this evaluation process utilizes historical and other objective information  the classification of loans and the establishment of the allowance for loan losses  relies  to a great extent  on the judgment and experience of management 
an analysis of the allowance for loan losses for the past five years is as follows december  dollars in thousands beginning balance      charge offs commercial     real estate    consumer and other total charge offs      recoveries commercial    real estate   consumer and other total recoveries    net charge offs recoveries     provision for loan losses      ending balance      net charge offs recoveries to average total loans the following table displays the allocation of the allowance for loan losses among specific classes of loans as of december    and december  percent of percent of percent of percent of amount total loans amount total loans amount total loans amount total loans dollars in thousands commercial     real estate term  real estate construction  consumer and other  unallocated  n a  n a  n a  n a total     the company did not allocate the allowance for loan losses among specific classes of loans prior to the allowance for loan losses was million at december   an increase of million  or  compared to the million balance at december  this increase was due to the company contributing million in additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses in response to an increase in nonperforming loans during the year  and to the company realizing net loan recoveries of million in compared with million in net charge offs during loan recoveries in included million from a real estate client relationship that had been charged off in net loan charge offs in included the partial charge off of loans to two commercial borrowers totaling million 
net loan charge offs in and and the million provision for loan losses during were directly influenced by certain events in the third and fourth quarter of the real estate division incurred several large charge offs stemming from declines in appraised values of real estate collateral 
construction time and delays imposed by bankruptcy and foreclosure proceedings hampered efforts to gain control and effectively dispose of collateral in a timely manner 
these delays contributed to a reduction in market values as the deteriorating condition of san francisco bay area real estate markets caused sales prices to decline rapidly during in addition  several special industries group commercial clients filed for protection under bankruptcy laws  contributing to an impairment of the company s collateral and resulting in loan charge offs 
in general  management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate as of december  however  future changes in circumstances  economic conditions or other factors could cause management to increase or decrease the allowance for loan losses as deemed necessary 
nonperforming assets consist of loans that are past due days or more but still accruing interest  loans on nonaccrual status  and oreo 
the table below sets forth certain relationships between nonperforming loans  nonperforming assets and the allowance for loan losses december  dollars in thousands nonperforming assets loans past due days or more   nonaccrual loans      total nonperforming loans      oreo      total nonperforming assets      nonperforming loans as a percent of total loans oreo as a percent of total assets nonperforming assets as a percent of total assets allowance for loan losses      as a percent of total loans as a percent of nonaccrual loans as a percent of nonperforming loans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 in substance foreclosure loans have been reclassified from oreo to nonaccrual loans 
the reclassified amounts are   and  at december   and  respectively 
there were no in substance foreclosure loans at december  nonperforming loans totaled million at december   an increase of million  or  from the million balance at december  this increase was concentrated in two commercial credits  each of which management believes  based on currently known information  is adequately secured with collateral and specific reserves and one of which continues to remain current in its payments 
the significant improvement in nonperforming loans during and  compared to the level at the end of  reflects the concerted efforts of management to improve the company s credit discipline and processes and to strengthen its credit administration group staffing 
in addition to the loans disclosed in the foregoing analysis  management has identified three loans with principal amounts aggregating approximately million  that  on the basis of information known by management as of december   were judged to have a higher than normal risk of becoming nonperforming 
the company is not aware of any other loans at december  where known information about possible problems of the borrower casts serious doubts about the ability of the borrower to comply with the loan repayment terms 
oreo totaled million at december   a decrease of million  or  from the million balance at december  this decrease resulted from sales and paydowns related to oreo properties 
the company transfered two loans with a reported value of million to oreo in deposits the company s deposits are primarily obtained from emerging growth and middle market businesses  including both venture capital backed and publicly financed companies  professional service firms  and business executives  located in the market areas served by the company 
the company does not obtain deposits from conventional retail sources

a significant portion of the increase in deposits during was concentrated in higher rate money market products  which increased million  or  from december  the growth in deposits during was attributable to the successful marketing efforts of the company 
time certificates of deposit in amounts of  or more totaled million at december  as previously noted  the company seeks deposits from client businesses within its target markets and does not accept brokered deposits 
no material portion of the company s deposits has been obtained from a single depositor and the loss of any one depositor would not materially affect the business of the company 
interest rate sensitivity management interest rate sensitivity is a measure of the exposure of the company s future earnings due to changes in interest rates 
if assets and liabilities do not reprice simultaneously and in equal volumes  the potential for such exposure exists 
it is management s objective to achieve a modestly asset sensitive position  such that the net interest margin of the company increases as market interest rates rise and decreases when rates decline 
one quantitative measure of the mismatch between asset and liability repricing is the interest rate sensitivity gap analysis 
all interest earning assets and funding sources are classified as to their expected repricing or maturity date  whichever is sooner 
within each time period  the difference between asset and liability balances  or gap  is calculated 
positive cumulative gaps in early time periods suggest that earnings will increase if interest rates rise 
negative gaps suggest that earnings will decline when interest rates rise

not stated column consists of nonaccrual loans of million  offset by unearned income of million  at december  management has historically maintained a positive cumulative gap position 
this results from a significant portion of the company s loans being prime rate based  while a significant percentage of funding sources are derived from noninterest bearing demand deposits 
another contributor to the asset sensitivity of the company  in a rising interest rate environment  is that changes in the company s money market deposit rates tend to lag changes in the prime rate 
by year end  the company was somewhat more asset sensitive than at the end of  as evidenced by larger cumulative gaps in all time periods from one day to one year 
should interest rates stabilize or decline in future periods  it is reasonable to assume that the company s net interest margin  as well as net interest income  may decline correspondingly 
liquidity management regularly reviews general economic and financial conditions  both external and internal  and determines whether the positions taken with respect to liquidity and interest rate sensitivity are appropriate 
the objectives of liquidity management are to provide funds  at an acceptable cost  to meet loan demand and depositors needs  and to service other liabilities as they come due 
the company assesses the likelihood of projected funding requirements by reviewing historical funding patterns  current and forecasted economic conditions and individual client funding needs 
one measure management uses to assess the company s liquidity is the level of liquid assets relative to total deposits 
liquid assets include cash and due from banks  federal funds sold  securities purchased under agreement to resell  and investment securities maturing within one year 
at december   the company s liquid assets as a percentage of deposits were compared to at december  the year end percentage was greater than the prior year end percentage due to a million increase in liquid assets 
this increase in liquid assets resulted from significant growth during in the bank s deposits  and management s decision to invest excess funds in short term investments due to the relatively flat interest rate environment at the end of as an additional source of funds  the company has negotiated federal funds borrowing lines with correspondent banks  and maintains borrowing capacity with the federal reserve bank of san francisco 
these arrangements  coupled with the ability to pledge qualifying investment securities and borrow against their fair value  provide the company with the temporary liquidity to address clients funding requirements in the unlikely event of substantially higher than projected fundings 
at december   the company s percentage of available liquid assets  defined as liquid assets plus federal funds borrowing lines and the borrowing capacity at the federal reserve bank of san francisco  to total deposits plus a portion of available unused commitments and letters of credit  was compared to at the prior year end 
the increase in the year end percentage was due to the aforementioned increase in liquid assets and additional federal funds borrowing lines obtained by the company during capital resources management seeks to maintain adequate capital to support anticipated asset growth and credit risks  and to ensure that the company and the bank are in compliance with all regulatory capital guidelines 
the primary source of new capital for the company has been the retention of earnings 
aside from current earnings  an additional source of new capital for the company has been proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the company s employee benefit plans  including the company s and stock option plans  the employee stock ownership plan  and the employee stock purchase plan 
shareholders equity was million at december   an increase of million  or  from the million balance at december  this increase was due to earnings of million  million in capital generated through employee benefit plans during  and a decrease in the net after tax unrealized loss on available for sale investments of million from the prior year end 
the company does not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of december  the company paid nominal cash dividends on its common stock from to in order to qualify the common stock as an eligible investment for institutional investors requiring a cash yield 
the board of directors of the company indefinitely suspended plans to pay further cash dividends in the third quarter of in response to the net loss and level of nonperforming assets in the third quarter of the company is currently precluded from paying cash dividends without prior regulatory approval 
the following table presents the relationship between significant financial ratios years ended december  return on average assets divided by average equity as a percentage of average assets equals return on average equity times earnings retained equals internal capital growth the company and the bank are subject to capital adequacy guidelines issued by the federal reserve board 
under these guidelines  the minimum total risk based capital requirement is of risk weighted assets and certain off balance sheet items for a well capitalized depository institution 
at least of the total risk based capital ratio must consist of tier capital  defined as tangible common equity  and the remainder may consist of subordinated debt  cumulative preferred stock  and a limited amount of the allowance for loan losses 
the federal reserve board has established minimum capital leverage ratio guidelines for state member banks 
the ratio is determined using tier capital divided by quarterly average total assets 
the guidelines require a minimum of for a well capitalized depository institution 
in addition to the foregoing requirements  the bank is also subject to a capital requirement established by the california state banking department 
under the regulatory consent order with the california state banking department  the bank must maintain a minimum tangible equity to assets ratio of 
the bank s tangible equity to assets ratios were and at december  and  respectively 
the company s risk based capital ratios were in excess of regulatory guidelines for a well capitalized depository institution as of december   and capital ratios for the company are set forth below december  total risk based capital ratio tier risk based capital ratio tier leverage ratio the improvement in the company s total and tier risk based capital ratios from december  to december  is attributable to asset growth during primarily occuring in lower risk weighted assets  and also an increase in tier capital 
the increase in tier capital resulted from the aforementioned net income and capital generated through the company s employee benefit plans 
the decrease in the company s total and tier risk based capital ratios from december  to december  primarily resulted from the growth in loans outstanding and in the level of loan commitments
