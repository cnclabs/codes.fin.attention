item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following section presents management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the company and its subsidiaries for the last three fiscal years 
it should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes found later in this document 
when necessary  reclassifications have been made to prior years data throughout the following discussion and analysis for purposes of comparability with data 
summary net income for was  as compared to a net loss of  for and a net loss of  in net income per share was

and 
in and  respectively 
the financial condition of the company has improved in and consequently the company reported net income in this year after having reported significant losses for each year since due to significant loan loss provisions and other real estate owned oreo expenses resulting from high levels of problem assets 
the connecticut economy from to experienced recessionary conditions which negatively affected local real estate values 
since many of the company s loans were in part collateralized by real estate  the decline in real estate values eroded the company s collateral and resulted in loans being charged off  placed on nonaccrual status or foreclosed 
during and  the company made significant progress in reducing its exposure to such problem assets substantially through a bulk loan sale in  ongoing workout efforts and loan charge offs 
the ratio of nonaccrual loans  oreo  restructured loans and loans past due days or more to total assets declined from as of december  to as of december  and as of december  the company s major source of revenue  net interest income  declined moderately by during to  net interest income was  in and  in the decline in net interest income for the twelve month period ending december  is primarily related to an increase in the company s overall funding cost  particularly the rate that the company paid for its time deposits 
during  the company paid an average of for total time deposits as compared to for consequently  the company s net interest margin declined basis points from in to in although the company s loan loss provision  necessitated by the evaluation of the quality of the loan portfolio and net charge offs of  in   in and  in  resulted in significant net losses during and  asset quality has improved in and the level of loan loss provisions has declined 
the provision for loan losses was  in   in and  in the company s operating expenses decreased from to after having increased from to the decrease in operating expense in is primarily related to the reduction in costs associated with maintaining and disposing of the company s oreo properties which declined from  in to  in and  in in addition  the cost of the company s fdic deposit insurance and other general insurances have declined as the company s financial condition has improved 
overall insurance expense has declined from  in to  in and  in the company anticipates that the expenses related to problem assets as well as its insurance expense will continue to decline during  although not to the extent experienced in prior years 
in order to reduce balance sheet risk  maintain adequate liquidity levels and improve its regulatory capital levels  the company focused on containing the overall growth of total assets 
total assets were  as of december  as compared to  as of december  and  as of december  the company s loan portfolio remained stable with total loans of  as of december  and  as of december  although the overall level of the loan portfolio remained relatively stable during the past two years  the composition of the portfolio has changed moderately 
the percentage of commercial and commercial mortgage loans to total loans decreased from as of december  to as of december  these higher risk loans were replaced during with residential mortgage originations of  the investment portfolio  consisting primarily of us government securities  was  and  as of december  and  respectively 
the company recorded an income tax benefit of  in consisting of a  tax benefit from the reduction of the deferred tax asset valuation reserve  offset by a  provision for minimum federal and state taxes currently payable 
a more detailed discussion of the company s operating results follows 
regulatory matters on september   the bank voluntarily agreed to the issuance of an order to cease and desist the order with the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
the order required the bank to take specific action to correct certain deficiencies addressed as a result of the fdic s examination of the bank as of february  in addition to requiring the bank to maintain a tier leverage capital ratio of or more  the order required the bank to take a series of actions designed to improve its financial condition and operating results and to augment its capital position 
these requirements and the bank s response thereto included  but were not limited to  increasing the loan loss reserve  charging off classified loans and improving asset quality  and addressing concerns regarding liquidity and reliance on volatile funds 
since  both the company and the bank have been examined several times by each of its regulators 
the bank has always placed the highest priority in complying with the provisions of the order and the recommendations of the examiners 
however  since the bank had experienced significant net operating losses in the years through  it found that it could not comply with the capital requirements of the order 
therefore  on february   the bank submitted to the fdic a capital restoration plan outlining the steps the company and the bank intended to take to achieve adequate capital levels 
on july   the company successfully completed its rights offering of common stock to existing shareholders and standby purchasers 
the rights offering resulted in the issuance of  new shares of common stock at a subscription price of per common share 
net proceeds amounted to  and the company contributed that amount to the bank in a manner qualifying as tier capital 
the bank  as of december   was in compliance with every provision of the order 
during the second quarter of  the company incurred a net loss of  which reduced both the bank s and the company s tier leverage capital ratios below the order s minimum tier leverage requirement of 
this quarterly net loss was primarily related to an  bulk loan sale of problem assets 
although the loan sale resulted in the bank and the company not complying with the capital requirements of the order  management believes that the bulk sale of problem assets significantly improved the quality of the company s loan portfolio 
consequently  the bank  as required by the order  filed a capital restoration plan with the fdic during the third quarter of the plan was accepted by the fdic and called for restoration of the bank s capital ratios through future earnings 
as of december   the company and the bank were adequately capitalized as defined by normal regulatory standards and management believed it was in compliance with every provision of the order except that its tier leverage capital ratio of fell short of the requirement 
on may   the fdic  after completion of a joint examination of the bank with the connecticut banking department  based on the bank s improved overall financial condition  removed the order and issued the memorandum  which the bank voluntarily agreed to enter into 
the memorandum requires  among other things  that the bank achieve certain tier leverage and total risk based capital requirements 
the bank must have a tier leverage capital ratio of at least by june  and by june  also the bank must maintain a total risk based capital ratio of at least throughout the existence of the memorandum 
as of december   both the company s and the bank s tier leverage ratios were 
in addition  both the bank s and the company s total risk based capital ratios were as of december  the memorandum also required the bank to charge off certain loans and develop and implement a written problem loan reduction program to continue to reduce its level of problem loans 
in addition  the memorandum prohibits the payment of dividends without prior fdic consent and requires the bank to review  monitor and update certain loan and liquidity policies 
as of december   the bank was in compliance with every provision of the memorandum 
net interest income net interest income  which is the major source of income for the company  is the difference between the interest earned on loans and other investments and the interest paid on deposits and other sources of funds 
net interest income decreased  or  to  in from  in this compares to an increase of  or  from  in to  in the decrease in net interest income during is primarily attributed to a slightly greater reliance on time deposits for funding in and the higher cost associated with funding these deposits as compared to the percentage of average time deposits to total deposits and other borrowings increased from in to in the average rate paid on time deposits increased basis points from in to in conversely  the average level of core deposits which consist of money market  now  and savings accounts core deposits  a lower costing source of funds  as a percent of total average deposits and other borrowings declined from in to in the increase in net interest income during can in part be attributed to an increase in average earning assets of  or  a reduction of basis points on interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings and a decrease in interest income foregone relating to nonperforming assets 
net interest margin decreased basis points from in to in  and increased basis points  from in to in although national economic conditions have improved  the condition of the connecticut economy continues to lag behind national trends 
accordingly  if local economic conditions continue to struggle  the competition for quality lending opportunities and for core and time deposits will be strong 
therefore  the company believes that any improvement in its net interest margin during will be difficult to achieve

the wall street prime rate of interest increased from as of december  to in february before eventually returning to at the end of most of the company s commercial loans are either directly tied to the wall street prime rate of interest or an internal company index whose movement closely follows movements in the wall street prime 
as a result of an increase in market rates  the company s average yield on commercial loans increased basis points from in to in the average yield on total loans increased from in to in the increase in interest income during can primarily be attributed to an increase in the average loan portfolio of and an increase in overall interest rates during the total yield on average earning assets increased slightly from as of december  to as of december  although the average loan portfolio increased  from  as of december  to  as of december   the growth in the company s loan portfolio was primarily related to the residential mortgage and consumer portfolios where interest rates are generally lower than the commercial portfolio 
the percentage of commercial and commercial mortgage loans to total loans declined from as of december  to as of december  consequently  despite a rising interest rate environment during  the average loan yield increased only basis points from to from december  to december  as a result of a softer loan demand  increased loan competition and the company s goal to reduce the risk in its balance sheet and to increase its risk based capital ratios  more funds were directed in to the company s investment portfolio

the average rate paid on time deposits under  increased from in to in  an increase of basis points 
due to the increased competition for core deposits and business accounts and relationships  which often generate a stable base of core deposits  the company had to rely more heavily on time deposits as a source of funds 
total average time deposits increased from  in to  in although less significant with regard to its impact on the company s overall cost of funds  the rates paid on core deposits also increased due to competitive market conditions 
the company s average level of core deposits decreased  from  in to  in unlike  interest expense decreased to  in from  in the decline in interest expense is attributed to the lower level of average interest bearing liabilities  the stable cost of the bank s core deposit base and the effects of a lower interest rate environment

   provision for loan losses and risk elements in the loan portfolio the provision for loan losses charged to operations reflects management s analysis of the loan portfolio and determination of an adequate allowance for loan losses to provide for probable losses in the loan portfolio 
the potential for loss in the portfolio reflects the risks and uncertainties inherent in the extension of credit 
types of loans the following table sets forth the composition of the company s loan portfolio as of the end of the last five fiscal years 
december  dollars in thousands loans commercial      real estate construction   commercial mortgage      residential mortgage      consumer      total loans      allowance for loan losses      net loans      the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan loss is based upon management s assessment of risk elements in the portfolio  factors affecting loan quality and assumptions about the economic environment in which the company operates 
the company utilizes a loan grading system  based upon fdic parameters  and utilizes that assessment of the overall quality of the loan portfolio in the process of determining an adequate allowance for loan loss level 
this system involves an ongoing review of the commercial and real estate loan portfolios  with added emphasis on the company s larger commercial credits and nonperforming loans 
various factors are involved in determining the loan grade  including the cash flow and financial status of the borrower  the existence and nature of collateral  and general economic conditions and their impact on the borrower s industry 
these reviews are dependent upon estimates  appraisals and judgments  which can change quickly due to economic conditions and the company s perceptions as to how these conditions affect the collateral securing its current and past due loans as well as the borrower s economic prospects 
in each reporting period  the allowance for loan losses is reviewed based on the most recent loan grading data and is adjusted to the amount necessary  in the company s judgment  to maintain adequate allowance for loan loss levels 
in  the company retained an independent management consultant to review the company s overall loan grading process and to perform individual loan reviews 
the results of the evaluation generally agreed with management s assessments of the quality of its loan portfolio 
although the real estate market and general economic conditions in connecticut have improved from their depressed levels  the connecticut economy continues to underperform when compared to the national economic recovery 
the connecticut economy has had limited job creation over the past twelve months which has slowed its overall economic recovery compared to other new england states and the nation 
these conditions have negatively impacted the company s borrowers with respect to debt service and have contributed to the company s need to charge off certain loans and place additional loans on nonaccrual status during   and the loan loss allowance decreased  or  from  at december  to  at december  and decreased  or  from  at december  to  at december  however  the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to nonaccrual loans  restructured loans and accruing loans past due days or more increased to at december  from at december  and at december  the ratio of the loan loss allowance to total loans was at december   as compared to and at december  and  respectively

the company anticipates that the level of net loan charge offs will not be as great as the level of charge offs experienced by the company in as of december   nonaccrual loans were  as compared with  as of december   and  as of december  as of december   approximately  of the nonaccrual portfolio were collateralized partially by commercial or residential real estate or business assets and approximately  of nonaccrual loans were unsecured 
the company is actively pursuing a workout plan for the orderly disposition of these loans 
the company believes that its allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb any potential reduction of the net carrying value in the nonaccrual portfolio

exceptions to placement on nonaccrual status that extend beyond days must be approved by the board of directors loan committee 
any installment or consumer loan that attains a day past due status will be placed on nonaccrual regardless of collateral value or collection proceedings 
previously accrued interest income on loans placed on nonaccrual  which has not been collected  is reversed from current period interest income 
nonaccruing loans are returned to accrual status when principal and interest become current and collectibility is reasonably assured 
at december   loans totaling  were accruing past due days 
the amount of accrued but uncollected interest associated with accruing loans past due days or more was  in   in and  in at december   and  the company had restructured loans in its loan portfolio of   and  respectively 
these were accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by debtors and creditors for troubled debt restructurings 
the company recognizes interest income on restructured loans at reduced  renegotiated rates 
the company earned an average yield of  and on restructured loans in  and  respectively 
the decline in restructured loans from to was primarily due to the company s bulk loan sale 
troubled debt restructured loans entered into after january  are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas 
the company has adopted sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  effective january  the new accounting standard requires that impaired loans  which are defined as loans where it is probable that a creditor will not be able to collect both the contractual interest and principal payments  be measured at the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or  as a practical expedient  at the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent  when assessing the need for a loss accrual 
the adoption of the standard resulted in an additional loan loss provision of  which was recorded in the first quarter of as of december   the company s recorded investment in loans that are considered to be impaired under sfas was  of which  were on a nonaccrual status and  were classified as troubled debt restructured loans 
the remaining  of loans classified as impaired  which are also classified as potential problem loans  have either experienced slight delinquency problems or collateral deterioration but continue to meet the contractual terms of the loan 
the company has also identified several additional potential problem loans in the amount of  as of december  potential problem loans are defined as loans where known information about possible credit problems of borrowers causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms 
these accruing loans have generally experienced delinquency problems during the last several quarterly periods or management believes that the borrowers potentially may avail themselves of bankruptcy protection 
however  they continue to be less than days delinquent as of december  if these credits continue to have financial difficulties  they could be classified as nonaccrual loans and become potential loan charge offs in future quarterly periods

the following table sets forth information on nonaccrual  restructured and past due ninety days or more other than nonaccrual loans and oreo as of december      and determined in accordance with the company s policy in effect for the respective years 
interest income was not recognized on nonaccrual loans for the years ending december   and if such loans had been accruing the entire year under their original terms  approximately  of interest income would have been earned during at december   the company had restructured loans in its loan portfolio of  the amount of interest income on such restructured loans included in net income during was  if such loans had been accruing the entire year under their original terms  approximately  of additional interest income would have been earned during nonaccrual loans  other real estate owned  restructured loans and loans past due days or more in thousands december  nonaccrual loans commercial      real estate construction commercial      residential consumer total nonaccrual loans      other real estate owned     total nonperforming assets      restructured loans      accruing loans past due days or more    allowance for loan losses      ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets ratio of nonperforming assets  restructured loans and accruing loans past due days or more to total assets ratio of nonperforming assets to total loans and oreo ratio of nonperforming assets  restructured loans  and accruing loans past due days or more to total loans and oreo ratio of allowance for loan losses to nonaccrual loans  restructured loans  and loans past due days or more ratio of nonaccrual loans  restructured loans  and loans accruing past due days or more to shareholders equity and allowance or loan losses during the mid s  the bank  like a number of other connecticut institutions  grew rapidly by accumulating deposits and aggressively lending into a healthy economy 
the emphasis on lending did not include  however  a similar commitment to loan underwriting policies  documentation and credit administration 
these lending practices  coupled with the subsequent dramatic downturn in the local economy beginning in the late s led to an excessive level of nonperforming loans and the need to make successive  substantial provisions to the allowance for loan losses 
in late and continuing into  a substantially new management team made a thorough analysis of the then current procedures  policies and resources relating to the bank s lending  credit standards  documentation and risk assessment  and determined that all of these areas required significant improvement 
this process was accelerated in as a result of the order 
throughout this time period  the company s management responded to the changing economic situation 
for example  during and  aggregate loans charged off were million and million  respectively  which amounts were greater than the balances of the allowance for loan losses at the beginning of each of those years 
significantly declining real estate values in the company s market area during these periods  among other things  caused the financial deterioration of borrowers whose businesses are linked to the real estate market and led to deterioration in real estate collateral values that caused additional unanticipated charge offs 
this deterioration continued for a longer period than originally anticipated 
unforeseen bankruptcies of certain borrowers due primarily to the impact of the worsening economy additionally contributed to the significant charge offs 
during  the company made significant progress in reducing its exposure to such problem assets substantially through a bulk loan sale  ongoing workout efforts and loan chargeoffs 
continued progress was made in in improving the company s overall asset quality 
therefore  the ratio of nonperforming assets  restructured loans and accruing loans past due days or more to total assets decreased to at december  from at december  and at december  the company has not made loans to borrowers outside the united states 
at december   there were no concentrations exceeding of total loans 
a concentration is defined as amounts loaned to multiple borrowers engaged in similar activities which would cause them to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions 
although the company makes loans on an unsecured basis  it should be noted that the company prefers not to lend to even its most creditworthy borrowers on an unsecured basis 
accordingly  the company accepts residential and commercial real estate as collateral for a commercial loan 
the source of collateral does not always correlate with the borrower s use of the loan proceeds 
to this extent  serious declines in real estate values in the company s market area would negatively affect the collateral securing its commercial and real estate loans but not necessarily impact the borrower s ability to meet the terms of the loan 
summary of loan loss experience for the periods indicated  the following table summarizes changes in the allowance for loan losses as a result of loans charged off and recoveries on loans previously charged off  and additions to the allowance for loan losses which have been expensed

the loan loss allowance is determined by assigning reserve coverages commensurate with the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio  as established by the loan grading process 
provisions are charged to income in an amount sufficient to maintain the allowance at a level consistent with management s assessment of the risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allocation of the allowance for loan losses reflects management s estimate of possible credit losses based on the loss potential associated with specific loans  subjective assessment of risk characteristics in the portfolio and historical loss experience 
this allocation should not be regarded as an indication of future losses or that losses will occur in these proportions 
prior to  the company had not attempted to allocate specific portions of the allowance to specific loan categories 
the allowance should be considered in its entirety and is available for credit losses across the entire portfolio 
the following table summarizes the allocation of the company s allowance for losses by loan type for the years ended december  and december  december  amount percent amount percent dollars in thousands commercial   real estate construction commercial   residential consumer unallocated total   management  after careful consideration of the above factors  is of the opinion that the allowance for loan losses as of december  is adequate 
however  due to the slow recovery of the connecticut economy  it is difficult to predict how the future economy may impact the company s loan customers 
if economic conditions continue to slowly improve during  management believes that the level of its nonaccrual loans could continue to decline throughout nevertheless  nonaccrual loans will continue to impact the level of the company s profitability in future quarterly periods 
the nature of the connecticut economy will continue to influence the levels of loan charge offs  nonaccrual loans and the allowance for loan losses  and management will appropriately adjust the allowance as considered necessary to reflect future changes in risk 
the bank was most recently examined jointly by the fdic and state banking department as of december  the company s financial statements reflect the results of these examinations as communicated to the bank by the regulators 
other income the company s core business operations generate various types of non interest income  such as service charges on deposit accounts  commissions and fees  and other service charges 
in addition  non interest income is derived from other sources  such as the gain or loss on the sale of assets  which may vary in type from period to period 
the company consistently evaluates its service charges to insure competitiveness as well as collection efficiency

this decline can be attributed to a substantial reduction in oreo properties held and more stabilized real estate values 
insurance expense also decreased  or  which was primarily attributed to lower fdic deposit insurance expense 
the increase in operating expenses during can be primarily attributed to higher salary and benefits expense which increased due to merit salary increases for the bank s staff and additional full time equivalent positions primarily related to its loan origination functions 
during  certain operating expenses associated with the management of the bank s nonperforming assets ie  insurance  legal and other professional fees remained high 
operating expenses  exclusive of oreo expense  decreased  or  during as compared to an increase of  or  in and a decrease of  or  during the following discussion highlights the larger operating expenses and those with large year to year variances salaries and employee benefits salaries and employee benefits of  in were stable when compared with  in the company s average full time equivalent positions held was which was reduced from in compensation related to the company s mortgage program loans sold or retained  which is paid on a per loan closed basis  decreased to  as of december  as compared to  for the same period due to a decline in mortgage origination volume 
salary and benefit costs increased from  in to  in the increase during is partially attributed to an increase in the company s average full time equivalent positions which increased from in as compared to in the increase in full time equivalent positions during is primarily related to increased loan volume in its origination functions 
in addition  mortgage origination compensation increased to  as of december  as compared to  for the same period due to an increase in volume 
other than any additional employees associated with a potential expansion of its branch network  the company does not expect full time equivalent positions to increase during  but will remain sensitive to continuing its high level of service to its customers 
oreo expense oreo expense totaled  in   in and  in these amounts reflect losses on sales and writedowns of oreo properties  as well as costs related to general property maintenance such as property taxes  insurance and utilities 
the company incurred losses on the disposition of oreo of  in  as compared to  in and  in in addition  the carrying values of oreo properties were written down  in   in  and  in maintenance costs for oreo properties amounted to   and  in  and  respectively 
the decrease in holding costs in as compared to is primarily due to a decrease in the number of properties held in and the change in the nature of these properties 
the increase in holding costs in as compared to is primarily due to an increase in expenses related to the subdivision of two parcels of land 
oreo properties are carried at the lower of carrying value of the related loan  or fair value of oreo properties at date acquired through foreclosure less the cost to dispose 
fair value is determined using the company s most recent appraisal or a more recent broker s valuation 
in order to facilitate the sale and ultimate disposition of oreo  the bank may finance the sale of a property at market rates to qualified  creditworthy borrowers 
the bank adheres to the standards as set forth in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for sales of real estate  relating to oreo property sales 
the company values its oreo properties based on an asset by asset review and on the assumption that an active market exists for those properties 
the company s primary valuation technique is to derive values from available comparable sales data and not from other evaluation criteria such as discounted cash flows 
in making the assumption that an active market exists for oreo properties  the company has made the determination that the properties are salable in approximately one year and has valued each property at an amount which the company anticipates will permit the sale of such property in approximately one year 
although the company actively markets all oreo properties for sale  no assurance can be given that properties will actually sell in approximately one year  such sales being dependent upon relevant market conditions which will vary from property to property  including the number of comparable properties available for purchase at the time  the availability of financing  and the stability or trends of real estate values in the area 
the company anticipates an increase in the number of oreo properties held during the early part of with the completion of foreclosure proceedings on several problem loans currently on a nonaccrual status 
however  the company anticipates its oreo expense should continue to decline during  although not to the same extent as in prior years 
see note  of notes to consolidated financial statements 
professional fees professional fees  which include legal  accounting and consulting fees  were  in  a decrease from  in and  in the high level of professional fees during the past three years is primarily related to legal fees associated with the workout of nonperforming assets 
with the decline in nonperforming assets during  it is anticipated that loan workout related expenses should continue to decline in the future 
however  the company has outsourced its internal audit and loan review functions in  the cost of which will offset any savings incurred due to a declining level of problem loans 
insurance expense insurance expense decreased significantly during to  from  in and decreased from  in during and  insurance expense declined  and  over the prior years  respectively 
the decreases during and can be attributed to lower premiums paid for fdic insurance as well as a decrease in the company s general insurance premiums 
during  the bank paid net fdic insurance premiums of  and premiums for other insurance of  as compared to levels of  and  respectively  and levels of  and  respectively 
the bank was assessed fdic insurance premiums of per of deposits during under the fdicia  the fdic has adopted regulations establishing a risk based assessment for insurance premiums pursuant to which higher insurance rates are charged to institutions that pose greater risks to the deposit insurance funds 
in setting assessments  the fdic is required to take into account the revenue needs of the insurance fund and to set the assessments in a manner that will be sufficient to maintain the fund s designated reserve ratio 
these provisions of fdicia have affected the company s january  and july  insurance premiums 
although the company s rights offering during the third quarter of increased its capital level to well capitalized as defined by its regulator  the bank did not benefit from a decrease in risk based premiums until the bank s risk assessment category was determined as of june  therefore  the bank paid fdic premiums of per of deposits in january  per of deposits in july and per of deposits in january during  the fdic s bank insurance fund was over reserved and  consequently  deposit premiums were lowered and premium rebates were given to banks in the third quarter of based on deposits reported in the first quarter of the company was given a rebate of  in the third quarter of because of the bank s improved risk classification and generally lower deposit premiums assessed for all banks  the bank s premiums were reduced from 
per of deposits in january to 
per of deposits in july to 
per of deposits in october in january  the bank was as assessed a rate of 
per of deposits but the company cannot predict if this rate will change throughout income taxes effective january   the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes sfas which requires the asset liability method of accounting for income taxes 
the adoption of sfas had no effect on the company s accumulated deficit as of january  as the deferred tax asset arising from net operating loss carryforwards was fully reserved 
at december  and  the company s deferred tax asset was reduced by a valuation allowance due to uncertainty of future profitability 
the company s current income tax expense of   and  for the years ended december    and represents provisions for state minimum taxes 
due to operating losses for each respective year  minimum taxes were payable primarily at the state level 
the company recorded an income tax benefit of  in consisting of a  tax benefit from the reduction of the deferred tax asset valuation reserve  offset by a  provision for minimum federal and state taxes currently payable 
due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  only minimum taxes are currently payable for federal and state purposes 
during  as a result of increased earnings that are expected to continue in the future  the company reduced the valuation allowance by  to approximately of the deferred tax asset 
this reduction of the valuation allowance is based on estimated future taxable income for the company feels that its projections provide adequate support for reducing the valuation allowance in as of december   the company still had a valuation reserve of  that can be reduced to some extent in future periods if profitable operations continue 
due to net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million expiring in and million expiring in for federal and state purposes respectively  the company expects to pay only minimum taxes again in for further information on income taxes  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s rights offering in had the potential for limiting the company s ability to take advantage of certain tax loss carryforwards 
section of the internal revenue code of imposes an annual limitation on a company s ability to utilize tax loss carryforwards if an ownership change within the meaning of section occurs 
the company did not experience an ownership change as a result of the rights offering 
future changes in the ownership of the company s stock could subject the company to the annual limitation on the use of the tax loss carryforwards 
notwithstanding that the company has not experienced an ownership change as a result of the rights offering  utilization of the tax loss carryforward is limited to the extent that the company generates sufficient taxable income in the carryforward period 
liquidity the primary focus of the company s liquidity management is to match cash inflows and outflows with funds provided by the company s market for deposits and loans 
the company s objective is to maintain adequate cash which is invested in federal funds 
during  the average balance of federal funds sold was  in the event that the company needs to borrow cash to manage its overnight or short term position  the company can borrow up to of its assets  as of december  on an overnight basis from the federal home loan bank of boston fhlb and has access to a  federal funds line of credit with a commercial correspondent bank 
as of december   the company had no outstanding overnight borrowings at the fhlb 
in addition  the company has access to  in short term funds via reverse repurchase agreements with a brokerage firm 
the bank also has the ability to borrow term advances from one week to twenty years from the fhlb 
its total term advance line is  of which  was outstanding as of december  in order to utilize the additional borrowing capacity of  approximately  of additional collateral would need to be pledged 
the company s investment portfolio also provides a secondary source of liquidity 
the liquidity process is monitored by the company s asset liability committee alco  which meets regularly to implement its asset liability and funds management policy 
alco s role is to evaluate liquidity and interest rate risk and their impact on earnings 
the committee developed a reporting system that integrates the current interest rate environment of the national and local economy with the maturities and the repricing schedules of both the assets and liabilities of the company 
the objective of alco is to manage the company s assets and liabilities to provide an optimum and stable net interest margin and to facilitate a constant level of net interest income 
as of december   the company s liquidity ratio  as defined by the fdic s criteria  was compared to as of december  and as of december  the liquidity ratio is defined as the total of cash  short term investments and other marketable assets  divided by total deposits and short term liabilities 
management believes that its liquidity position is adequate as of december  effective january   the company adopted the provisions of the statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas 
under sfas  debt securities classified as held to maturity are reported at amortized cost 
debt and equity securities not held for trading activities or to maturity are reported at fair value with unrealized gains or losses excluded from income and reported as a separate component of shareholders equity 
in order to classify securities as held to maturity  management must have the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity 
during  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a pronouncement allowing companies to make a one time repositioning of their portfolios  offering the ability to transfer securities from the held to maturity portfolio to the available for sale portfolio 
the company availed itself of this opportunity and transferred  par value of corporate bonds from its held to maturity portfolio to its available for sale portfolio 
as of december  and  and  respectively  of the company s total investment portfolio is classified as available for sale 
the adoption on january  and ongoing compliance with sfas has not had an adverse effect on the company s net interest margin  regulatory capital ratios or ability to meet its liquidity obligations 
interest rate sensitivity the company concentrates its efforts on evaluating interest rate risk and appropriately adjusts for changes in rates and maturities of its assets and liabilities 
the company s objective is to provide stable net interest income 
the following table illustrates the ratio of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities as they mature and or reprice within the indicated periods 
as of december   the company s rate sensitive assets repricing or maturing approximately equalled its rate sensitive liabilities during the first ninety days 
this results from having approximately of the company s loan portfolio available to reprice within thirty days 
in an increasing rate environment  asset sensitivity enhances earnings potential  whereas liability sensitivity would negatively impact earnings 
in contrast  in a declining rate environment  asset sensitivity would negatively impact earnings  whereas liability sensitivity enhances earnings potential 
the company s rate sensitive assets closely approximate  within  its rate sensitive liabilities between the periods of one month to twelve months 
the company is liability sensitive beyond one year which is primarily due to its core deposits  which are considered stable and not easily influenced by changes in interest rates 
at december   the amount of the company s cumulative gap with respect to assets and liabilities maturing or repricing within one year was  more assets than liabilities repricing a positive gap position  representing a positive cumulative gap to total rate sensitive assets 
the company s alco manages the gap position on an ongoing basis to assure an interest rate risk not to exceed more than a change in net interest income for a one year period 
if interest rates were to immediately increase by basis points  the negative impact on the company would be within alco s tolerance level 
the following table sets forth the distribution of the repricing of the company s earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at a single point in time  as of december  the table shows the interest rate sensitivity gap ie  interest rate sensitive assets less interest rate sensitive liabilities  the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap  the interest rate sensitivity gap ratio ie  gap divided by total rate sensitive assets and the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio 
the table also sets forth the time periods in which interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities will mature or may reprice in accordance with their contractual terms 
however  the table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the net interest margin since the company s repricing of various categories of assets and liabilities is subject to competitive pressures and the needs of the company s customers 
the company s interest rate sensitivity position is adjusted as alco s assessment of the interest rate outlook and other factors are modified 
as the company increases its total assets  the overall business plan provides for matching its assets and liabilities to reduce interest rate risk and liquidity risk

the company has assumed that of demand and savings deposits will not be withdrawn in less than one year based on its analysis of industry experiences and the rate of runoff of such deposits 
maturities and sensitivities of loans to changes in interest rates the company s loan portfolio  as of december   is comprised of variable and fixed interest rate obligations 
commercial loans  which comprise approximately of the portfolio  are demand or time obligations with rates tied to the prime rate of interest 
commercial real estate loans  which constitute approximately of the total loan portfolio  are made for fixed terms and generally reprice within one to three years 
consumer loans  which constitute of the loan portfolio  consist primarily of fixed rate automobile loans with an average contractual life of approximately four years and home equity loans that are tied to the prime rate of interest 
residential real estate loans  which constitute of the loan portfolio  are comprised of variable rate loans which reprice within one year of the residential portfolio and fixed rate loans 
the following tables present the maturity distribution and interest sensitivity of total loans by category at december  based on the original contractual terms 
demand loans are included in the due in one year or less category 
renewal requests by business entities are granted if the customer is deemed creditworthy 
this determination is made in substantially the same manner as new applications for extension of credit 
both maturity date and interest rate terms of renewals are based on review of the customer s credit needs  and current and future economic conditions

it includes the principal amount of commercial lines of credit due within one year on which the principal balance may or may not be reduced during the year and which lines may  based on the bank s credit evaluation  be extended for additional periods 
at this time  the company is unable to predict how much of the disclosed amount will actually be paid during the year 
based on experience  the company assumes that an insubstantial amount of such principal will be paid down during the year and  as such  will not serve as a principal source of liquidity for the company s operations 
cash flows the company generated a negative aggregate cash flow of  as of december  as compared to a positive aggregate cash flow of  as of december  and a negative aggregate cash flow of  as of december  the company had net income of  in as compared to net losses of  and  for and  respectively  and cash flows provided by operating activities were   and  for the respective periods 
this was due in part to the fact that reported earnings were affected by significant non cash charges  including provisions for loan losses and writedowns on oreo 
net cash used by financing activities in was  primarily due to a decrease in federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements 
a net decrease in time deposits when comparing year end to  was offset by an increase in proceeds from fhlb advances for the same period 
net cash provided by financing activities in was  primarily due to an increase in core deposits  time deposits and net borrowed funds of   and  respectively

capital resources the company and the bank are subject to the capital adequacy rules of several regulators 
effective december   each federal banking agency issued final rules to carry out the prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia 
the regulations adopted  among other things  defined capital measures and the capital thresholds for each of the five capital categories established in the statute and established a uniform schedule for filing of capital restoration plans by undercapitalized institutions 
the following table identifies generally the capital measures and thresholds defined under the fdic and federal reserve board rules total risk tier risk based ratio based ratio tier leverage ratio well capitalized or above or above or above adequately capitalized or above or above or above undercapitalized under or under or under significantly undercapitalized under or under or under critically undercapitalized a ratio of tangible equity to total assets equal to or under to qualify as well capitalized or adequately capitalized  the financial institution must meet the requirements of all three capital measurements 
undercapitalized and significantly undercapitalized institutions will be categorized as such if the institution fails to meet any of the three capital measurements 
the risk based capital guidelines establish a measurement of capital adequacy by relating a banking organization s capital to its financial risks  both on and off balance sheet 
as of december   and  the company s total risk based capital ratio was  and  respectively 
the second capital measure is the tier risk based ratio  which includes only core capital as it measures the relationship to risk weighted assets 
as of december   and  the company s tier risk based ratio was  and  respectively 
the third capital adequacy measure is the ratio of tier or core leverage capital using the same definition of capital as used in the risk based guidelines to average total assets 
the company s tier leverage ratio was  and as of december   and  respectively 
as of december   based on the above criteria  the company falls within the adequately capitalized category 
as of december   and  the bank s total risk based capital ratio was  and  respectively  while its tier risk based capital ratio was  and  respectively  and its tier leverage ratio was  and  respectively 
as of december   based on the above criteria  the bank falls within the adequately capitalized category 
the reporting of debt and equity securities not held for trading activities or to maturity for the purposes of calculating tier capital for the company and the bank differs from reporting under sfas under final fdic regulations  net unrealized losses for equity securities that are available for sale are included in the calculation of tier capital 
all other net unrealized gains or losses on available for sale securities are excluded from the definition of tier capital 
as of december  and  tier capital was reduced  and  to reflect the unrealized depreciation on the company s equity securities held as available for sale 
the company s undivided profits losses component of shareholders equity has decreased from  as of december  to  as of december  and has increased to  as of december  under connecticut law  the company may declare and pay cash dividends only out of unreserved and unrestricted undivided profits 
the company suspended payment of its quarterly cash dividends during the company s ability to pay cash dividends in future quarters is restricted until such funds are available therefor 
fdicia requires each federal banking agency to revise its risk based capital standards for insured institutions to ensure that those standards take adequate account of interest rate risk  concentration of credit risk and risks of non traditional activities  and reflect the actual performance and expected risk of loss on multi family residential loans 
regulations adopted by the federal reserve board  the fdic and other bank regulatory agencies to implement this provision require the regulators to take account of  among other factors  interest rate risk  concentration of credit risks and risks of nontraditional activities  in setting individual minimum capital requirements for institutions 
such regulations may  however  further increase the regulatory capital requirements which are applicable to the company and the bank 
impact of inflation and changing prices the company s financial statements have been prepared in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effect of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
notwithstanding this  inflation can directly affect the value of loan collateral  in particular real estate 
sharp decreases in real estate prices  as discussed previously  have resulted in significant loan losses and losses on oreo 
inflation  or disinflation  could continue to significantly affect the company s earnings in future periods
