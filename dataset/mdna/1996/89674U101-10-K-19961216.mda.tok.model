item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
dca has a suggested retail price to the consumer of per bottle 
o the euro collections alternative designer fragrance line  which has lower price points than the dca line  is also marketed in the traditional retail chain stores both in the united states and latin america 
the euro line  first introduced in  is the predominant fragrance line of the company and until fiscal had been the company s principal brand in the wholesale market 
to strengthen the euro collection s franchise in retail stores  its packaging was redesigned in the latter part of fiscal in order to enhance its image and position 
euro fragrances have suggested retail prices of to per bottle 
o the premiere editions line is a budget price brand that is oriented toward dollar stores and other budget price retailers 
this line of alternative designer fragrances was newly re staged at the end of fiscal by increasing the bottle size and redesigning all packaging 
sales of the redesigned product began in early fiscal at the same price point as previously sold  providing increased value in comparison to competition 
the consumer can purchase fragrances in this line in a suggested retail price range of to per bottle 
o in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company developed a new designer alternative fragrance line  royal selections  designed to recapture a significant part of the wholesale trade class 
royal selections carries a price below that of major competition  with unsurpassed quality packaging  bottles  and fragrances 
this line was introduced at the beginning of fiscal and sells to consumers at a suggested retail price of approximately to 
page in fiscal  the company sold the remaining inventory of two other fragrance brands euro elegance and club exclusif  which were subsequently discontinued 
the company believes that to successfully market a fragrance product line  one must identify a market niche and then fill that niche with a value priced  quality product presented in attractive bottles  cartons and displays 
all of the company s fragrance lines feature quality glass bottles and caps designed in various unique shapes and styles 
the company s fragrances are packaged in colorful cartons designed with the latest technology to appear attractive to the consumer 
all fragrances are designed by the company s and the sheth group s expert perfumers as alternatives to some of the most popular  nationally branded  designer fragrances 
they are sold  however  at a fraction of the original designer fragrance s retail price to satisfy the needs of the consumers in specific niche markets 
prior to the introduction of new or improved fragrances  market evaluation and consumer testing is conducted by the company with selective testing also done by independent outside laboratories 
the company believes that the success of these products is dependent on the company correctly identifying the needs of a particular market niche and then  ultimately  on the consumers acceptance of the product 
life cycles of products vary significantly  with some being successfully marketed for more than five years  whereas other products may fail to gain consumer acceptance and be discontinued within a shorter period of time 
the company believes that the success of the company s products in the market place is largely dependent on the amount and quality of retail advertising and promotion original designers give to their brands  the appeal of the scent itself  and the merchandising and trial programs that the company develops to accelerate consumer awareness 
each of the company s four fragrance product lines has  or will have  companion products  which are discussed below in other products 
the company anticipates revenue growth in all fragrance lines in fiscal as the company strengthens its marketing programs and targets specific products to specific market niches 
the streamlining and upgrading of the euro collections and premiere lines  and increased consumer acceptance of the dca line are expected to contribute to such revenue growth 
based on preliminary sales demand in the first quarter of fiscal  the newly introduced royal selections fragrance line is also expected to favorably contribute to sales growth 
other products the company markets numerous complementary products within each fragrance line such as deodorant sticks  dusting powders  shaker talcs  trial travel sizes and gift sets 
in most cases  these companion products are marketed as designer alternatives and are value priced significantly below the prices of the national brands 
certain of these toiletry products  or variations thereof  also are marketed under the company s everscent and simply you brand names 
the company markets under the brand names of dca and gina cosmetics  proprietary lines of cosmetics including nail  lip color  eye products  and other cosmetic items  all of which are manufactured by related parties 
cosmetics sold under the dca line are premium quality lip and nail products designed as alternatives to original designer products 
the dca products are sold primarily in chain stores at prices significantly less than the original designer s price 
cosmetic products under the gina cosmetics line are geared to price conscious consumers and are primarily marketed in the wholesale class of trade and in dollar stores 
during fiscal  the company discontinued all roxy and apple cosmetics lines  except for the apple lip and eye cosmetic pencils  and as of august   had sold most of the non pencil inventory 
the apple line of lip and eye cosmetic pencils  which is manufactured by the company  is marketed and distributed in assorted colors and sizes 
private label cosmetic pencils are also produced for selected customers  including an affiliate of the core sheth families 
new  redesigned  or replacement cosmetics  except for cosmetic pencils  are developed by the company s suppliers at the request of the company 
the company believes that like fragrances  selecting the right cosmetic products for a particular market segment and acceptance by the consumer play a large role in the success or failure of any particular product 
page the company believes that revenues for both the complementary products to the fragrance lines and cosmetics will increase in fiscal such growth is expected to result from increases in the existing lines and the addition of new products customers the company distributes its products to more than  customers  including wholesalers  distributors  drug and grocery chains  mass merchandising chains and specialty chain stores located primarily in north and south america 
these customers represent over  outlets for the company s products 
the company markets its products through company sales personnel located in various markets and through a network of independent sales representatives 
the company has invested heavily in developing the mature us retail markets and in starting to develop the emerging mass markets in latin america 
the company believes that the customer base in the mass latin american markets  which appear to fit the company s target customer profile  presents an excellent opportunity for future growth 
the company has focused the expansion of the customer base in the us on creating and repositioning products to better meet the needs of its existing channels of distribution and in gaining entrance into certain new channels 
a major focus of investment in fiscal has been on developing customer bases in the most populous countries in latin america mexico and brazil 
this development was facilitated by establishing sales and distribution operations in those countries in fiscal and  respectively 
the company services other countries in latin america through regional and national distributors within the various countries 
an entity of the core sheth families is the national distributor in argentina 
these distributors are supplied by the company s texas distribution center that also services the united states and canadian markets 
sales to customers in the united states were   and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
for the years ended august    and  million of net sales  million of net sales  and million of net sales  respectively  were exported directly to foreign customers or sold through the company s subsidiaries in mexico and brazil 
certain of the sales to us customers are ultimately resold outside of the us the amount of these indirect export sales cannot be determined as the company does not have access to its customers sales information 
as a significant portion of the company s products is sold directly or indirectly into the latin american market  there are certain factors such as political and economic conditions that could have an adverse effect on these sales 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations potential adverse effects on results of operations for future periods for a specific discussion of those risks 
the north and south america markets will continue to be the focus of the company s marketing strategy as other core sheth families affiliates distribute similar products throughout the rest of the world 
the company does anticipate some increase in sales outside north and south america in fiscal  primarily in the newer royal selections and dca product lines  and principally to core sheth families affiliates 
the company is not dependent upon a single or a few customers  and the loss of a single or a few customers would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
in fiscal   and no single customer accounted for more than seven percent of the company s total sales 
suppliers at present  the company purchases the glass containers for its fragrances from european glass manufacturers 
if these products were unavailable from one of these suppliers  the company believes that it could purchase such products from other suppliers without any significant delays 
in addition  the company purchases specially blended fragrance compounds principally from a core sheth families affiliate in france 
in the event that the supplier was unable to provide the compounds  the company could suffer page minor manufacturing delays until the primary suppliers could be replaced by another core sheth families affiliate or a secondary source 
the company s ability to satisfy sales orders for its fragrance products is directly dependent on its ability to manufacture these products 
if the company were physically unable to manufacture its products  and inventory and demand levels were normal  the effect on the company would in general be minimal as core sheth families affiliates and others have similar manufacturing facilities available to support the company 
however  in instances where demand for fragrances was strong and the company had inadequate inventory levels  the company would be adversely impacted 
the inability to manufacture cosmetic pencils at its texas facility until a secondary source could be located would have relatively minor adverse effect 
the company is dependent on the supply of cosmetics  other than cosmetic pencils  from core sheth families affiliates 
if any of these companies were to cease or be unable to supply these cosmetic products  the lack of such products could have an adverse effect on the company until secondary suppliers could be located 
patents and trademarks the company and a core sheth families affiliate own or have applied for  substantially all of the product name trademarks for the fragrance and cosmetic products sold by the company 
the company is dependent on the continued use of these trademarks  however  the cessation of the company s right to use such trademarks of the core sheth families affiliate would not have a materially adverse effect on the company s business 
backlog of orders the company had no substantial backlog of orders at the end of fiscal years  and raw materials the company s raw material inventories support the fragrance and cosmetic pencil manufacturing operations 
the principal components of that inventory are currently purchased from limited or single sources of supply 
management believes the cessation of supply for the fragrance components from any of the primary suppliers could be replaced by a core sheth families affiliate or a secondary source with minimal difficulties 
environmental laws in the opinion of management  compliance by the company with federal  state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment has had no material effect upon the company s capital expenditures  earnings or competitive condition 
the company has reformulated certain of its products to meet the requirements of the california air resources board  see legal proceedings 
competition in the fragrance and cosmetics industry the fragrance and cosmetics industry is characterized by intense competition  particularly in the us while pricing and terms are the principal factors in competition  product quality  presentation  merchandising and advertising programs  and customer service incorporating available inventories and prompt delivery are also very important additional competitive features in the overall industry 
principal competitors in designer alternative fragrances include jean philippe fragrances  inc  paris designs  inc  and parfums de coeur  and in budget cosmetics  artmatic usa cosmetics  wet n wild  and jordana cosmetics corporation 
while the company is a significant participant in the value oriented designer alternative fragrance market and has had historically many of the resources of the core sheth families available to it  the company is a relatively small participant in the total fragrance and cosmetics industry 
many of the other companies in the industry  including virtually all large mass advertised brand manufacturers such as revlon  l oreal  coty  and proctor and gamble are well established and have been in existence for a significantly longer period of time than the company 
such page companies have higher leverage and resources such as financial  marketing  research  manufacturing  and personnel  substantially greater than the company will have available in the foreseeable future 
historically  however  these large manufacturers have not sought to compete in the same value oriented markets in which the company participates 
inventory the company maintains finished goods inventory at its texas  mexico and brazil warehouse facilities to meet the demands of its customers 
raw material and work in process inventories related to manufacturing of fragrances and cosmetic pencils are located at the pleasanton  texas manufacturing facility 
seasonality the company s business has historically been subject to seasonal factors relating to calendar year end holidays  which has resulted in increased net sales in the first and fourth quarters of the company s fiscal year 
the company believes that with its range of products  distribution channels  and promotional activity  it should over time be able to reduce some of the differences between quarters  however  the nature of the fragrance market will result in a continuation of the pattern 
employees the company employs approximately people as regular employees 
additionally  during peak production periods the company utilizes temporary or seasonal employees to augment its workforce 
during the past two fiscal peak production periods the company has utilized up to seasonal employees 
none of the company s employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and management believes that the company s relationship with its employees is satisfactory 
item properties the company owns a manufacturing plant that consists of a  square foot facility on a acre site in pleasanton  texas 
that facility has approximately  square feet of office space 
the company is currently leasing approximately  square feet of storage  shipping  and office space for its san antonio distribution center 
the lease has an annual rate of  subject to adjustments  and expires in february the san antonio corporate offices  design studio  and laboratory occupy approximately  square feet of office space 
the leases have a current annual rate of  subject to adjustments  and expire in january the company also leases approximately  square feet of sales office space in new york city and  square feet of office and distribution space in mexico and brazil

page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations within the following discussion and analysis  financial information relating to fiscal years and reflects the financial results of the combined entities of tristar and eurostar  which were merged on august  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the combination was treated in a manner similar to a pooling of interests 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal tristar markets and distributes products to wholesalers  distributors  chain stores  specialty chains  mass merchandisers  and independent retail stores in various markets throughout north and south america 
net sales for the fiscal year ended august  were  an increase of  compared to net sales of  in the fiscal year ended august  the increase is primarily attributable to the development of the drug and grocery chain market utilizing the new dca product line as well as increased sales in mexico  brazil  and other us chains  specialty chains  and mass merchandisers 
somewhat offsetting these increases was a loss of sales in the rest of latin america and in the us wholesale channel 
the loss in the us wholesale channel was primarily due to increased competition  a maturation of that market  a decrease in purchases by customers who ultimately distributed the company s products into latin america  and as a result of repositioning the euro collections fragrance line outside of the wholesale channel in the latter part of fiscal in anticipation of the introduction of the new royal selections fragrance line into that channel in early fiscal the company believes that sales will increase in all channels of distribution in fiscal primarily as a result of increased customer and consumer acceptance of the dca product line introduced in fiscal  the repositioning of the euro collections fragrance line into the retail store channel and out of the wholesale channel  the successful introduction of the new royal selections fragrance line into the wholesale channel in the first quarter of fiscal  and the redesign and reintroduction of the budget premiere fragrance line 
sales in latin america are expected to benefit from the combined actions of repositioning of the euro collections fragrance line and the introduction of the royal selections line 
overall  the company s direct exports decreased to  of net sales  in fiscal compared to  of net sales  in fiscal the decrease in direct exports is largely due to political and economic uncertainties in certain latin america countries 
in brazil  the company initiated the development of formal channels of distribution after establishing sales and warehouse facilities in early fiscal the company believes that the brazilian market presents a strategic opportunity for growth in sales in the future 
during fiscal  the company experienced an increase in the sales that were lost in mexico after the economic and political effects of the nuevo peso devaluation in fiscal  which severely affected the purchasing power of the mexican population 
after the devaluation  the company embarked on a strategy to formalize distribution of the euro collections line in mexico servicing retail outlets primarily through the company s warehouse in mexico city 
while sales growth was achieved under this distribution strategy  the economic and political pressures continued in fiscal and limited such growth 
the company believes that sales growth will continue in fiscal sales in the rest of latin america were down in comparison to fiscal  primarily as a result of economic and political conditions in several of those countries 
included in export sales were sales of  in fiscal and  in fiscal to core sheth families affiliates 
see business suppliers and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
approximately two thirds of the growth in sales resulted from increased sales in the fragrance lines 
the new dca fragrance line along with higher sales in the two discontinued fragrance lines  club exclusif and euro elegance  contributed to the growth in sales 
the discontinued lines were sold at prices significantly below list  therefore generating additional sales  but at reduced margins 
the euro collections line and the premiere line remained essentially constant in comparison to fiscal levels 
sales growth outside the fragrance lines was principally realized in increased cosmetic pencil sales and in sales of the new dca cosmetic line 
page of the net sales in fiscal  approximately  or  resulted from the sale of products purchased from related parties as finished goods 
for fiscal  comparable numbers were  or  in addition  fragrance and other products manufactured and sold by the company included certain components that were purchased from related parties 
the cost of those components approximated of cost of sales in fiscal years and see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
tristar s gross profit both in dollar terms and as a percentage of sales declined in fiscal as compared to fiscal comparable numbers were  or  in fiscal and  or  in fiscal several factors which contributed to this decline were the sale of discontinued product and product lines at selling prices below normal  manufacturing variances attributable to costs associated with the introduction and manufacturing of a new product line  manufacturing variances associated with the extension of production efforts to meet market demands  and the write down of certain inventories to market 
the company believes that gross profit as a percentage of sales in fiscal will improve over the fiscal levels as manufacturing costs are expected to decrease and sales of discontinued products are expected to be lower in fiscal the company believes that gross profit in fiscal will be negatively impacted by manufacturing variances associated with the extension of production efforts to meet market demands during the peak season the first quarter 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased in fiscal to  from the fiscal level of  the increase can be attributed to expenses associated with the introduction of the new dca product line  costs to develop new channels of distribution  costs to enter those channels  growth in support of existing sales channels  and increased support in other functions within the company 
as a percentage of sales  sg a was in fiscal compared to in fiscal fiscal sg a included expenses incurred in the relocation of the pencil manufacturing operations from south carolina to texas and an expense of  to reduce the book value of the plant and surrounding land in south carolina to their estimated net realizable value 
management believes that sg a will decrease in dollar terms and as a percentage of sales in fiscal as the company builds on its investments in products and markets developed in fiscal  and limits significant expenditures on new products and markets 
interest expense increased by  in fiscal from the level of  this increase is primarily attributable to increased average short term borrowings 
the company believes that interest expense will be higher in fiscal due to expected increased borrowing levels under the revolving credit line as the company strives to improve its market position in the united states and latin america 
fiscal expenses included merger related expenses of  litigation expenses arising from events related to the shareholder litigation of  and  of expenses related to the amortization of the warrant valuation asset 
these respective expenses in fiscal were   and in fiscal  the company received a court approved distribution of  from the proceeds of an executive liability and indemnification policy owned by the company 
in addition  a distribution of  of interest earned was received 
the distribution of  of the total has been contested by two other claimants under the policy 
see legal proceedings insurance policy reimbursement at page the company recorded income tax expense net of income tax benefits of  of  in fiscal which compared to an expense of  in fiscal the fiscal amount reflected the reduction of the deferred tax assets  to zero as a result of management s reassessment of the realizability of the asset under the guidelines of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
while management believes that the company will ultimately realize the benefit of the asset  the uncertainty of when those benefits will be realized  precludes reflecting the asset on the financial statements as of august  the company recorded a net loss of  or per share for fiscal in fiscal  the company recorded net loss of  or per share 
page potential adverse effects on results of operations for future periods the results for fiscal could be adversely affected by each or all of the following factors mexican market 
the market for the company s products continues to be negatively impacted as a result of the devaluation of the mexican nuevo peso in december and the subsequent economic and political instability 
these factors sharply reduced the purchasing power of the mexican consumer and therefore the demand for the company s products was adversely affected 
any future significant deterioration of the peso s value would be expected to further adversely affect the company s sales in mexico and also the collectability of accounts receivable 
the company believes that some of its customers based in the united states sell the company s products as well as the products of other companies to purchasers who  in turn  may attempt to import goods into mexico without full payment of applicable mexican taxes and customs duties 
enhanced enforcement efforts by mexican authorities may have an adverse effect on the company s sales to such customers 
latin america economies 
growth in sales  or even the maintenance of existing sales levels  in certain latin american countries depends to a large extent on the economic health and political stability of those countries 
any deterioration in the economic or political stability in such countries could adversely affect sales 
supply of products 
the company s ability to manufacture and to satisfy consumer demand for fragrances is dependent on the supply of certain components from single sources 
any inability of these vendors to meet the company s requirements could have an adverse effect on the company s results until an alternative source could be found and or developed 
in addition  the company is dependent on the supply of cosmetic products  other than cosmetic pencils  from core sheth families affiliates 
if such affiliates were to cease or be unable to supply these cosmetic products  the lack of these products would have an adverse effect on the company until a secondary supplier could be located 
new markets 
the company continues to develop and expand sales and marketing operations in latin america 
in the process  the company incurs significant expenses in order to establish a marketing presence and an economically viable amount of sales 
there is no assurance that the company will be successful in those endeavors nor that it will recover its initial expenses and start up costs 
in addition  certain countries from time to time impose strict import restrictions and high levels of taxes on imports  all of which could affect the success of sales and marketing activities and also affect the profitability of such activities 
limitations on working capital 
the company experienced a limitation of working capital availability in the latter part of fiscal primarily as a result of investments in foreign markets with benefits of those investments not projected to accrue to the company in the immediate future  investments in the development and introduction of the new dca product line  the cost of entry into the marketing channel where the new dca product line is currently being sold  and losses incurred on operations unrelated to the new dca product line 
the restricted availability resulted in the maximization of borrowings under the company s credit facility and in delaying payments to certain vendors primarily affiliates of the core sheth families beyond customary terms 
while management does not anticipate such an event  a severe recurrence in the future could restrict the company s ability to purchase components 
the inability to purchase certain components could reduce the company s ability to manufacture product with a resultant negative impact on sales and results of operations 
at this time  it is not known whether  or to what degree  the above factors will have a material adverse impact on the company s fiscal results 
page results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for the fiscal year ended august  were  a decrease of  compared to net sales of  in the fiscal year ended august  this decrease was primarily attributable to the impact of economic and political conditions on customers in mexico 
tristar marketed and distributed products to wholesalers  distributors  chain stores  mass merchandisers  and independent retail channels in various markets throughout north and south america 
the company experienced a loss of sales in fiscal in the wholesale channel  primarily because of the decrease in sales in mexico  and  to a much lesser extent  from a general decrease in the market demand in that channel as it matured 
the other channels grew in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily in latin america excluding mexico as the company appointed additional distributors and in the us as the company continued to expand its marketing efforts in the chain store and mass merchandising channels 
the independent retail channel continued to remain a small part of the company s sales 
overall the company s direct exports increased to  of net sales in fiscal compared to  of net sales in fiscal the increase in direct exports was largely due to the increase in activity in latin america  excluding mexico  as the company continued to expand in those markets 
in fiscal  the market for the company s products in mexico decreased substantially as a result of economic and political conditions 
those conditions  which included the devaluation of the nuevo peso in december  severely affected the purchasing power of the mexican population 
both direct sales to customers in mexico and indirect sales into mexico product distributed into mexico by u 
s 
based customers declined substantially in fiscal as compared to fiscal  although the precise volume of indirect sales cannot be determined as customers do not provide such information to the company 
export sales of cosmetic pencils to a core sheth families affiliate increased in fiscal to  from  in fiscal see suppliers and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
distribution in the u 
s 
markets is believed to have remained relatively constant between fiscal and fiscal as sales to u 
s 
customers include product that is ultimately destined for countries outside the u 
s  as noted above  it is not possible to determine precisely the amount of sales that ultimately remain in the u 
s 
marketplace 
however  it is believed that while there was a decline in the wholesale market in the us  the growth in the chain store and mass merchandising channels compensated for such decreases 
in fiscal  the euro collections fragrance line  the company s largest revenue producer  was adversely affected by the decline of direct sales into mexico  as this was the primary product line purchased by mexican customers  by the general decline in the wholesale channel  and by the maturation of this product line 
offsetting a significant portion of the decline was a growth in the sales of this product line into the balance of latin america 
in addition  in fiscal  lower sales were realized in the cosmetics lines  cosmetic pencil line  and premiere fragrance line 
partially offsetting these decreases was a growth in selected toiletry products introduced in fiscal of the net sales in fiscal  approximately  or  resulted from the sale of products purchased from related parties as finished goods 
for fiscal  comparable numbers were  or  in addition  fragrances and other products manufactured and sold by the company included components that were purchased from related parties 
the cost of those components approximated of cost of sales in fiscal and in fiscal see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information and business suppliers 
for additional information on products  channels of distribution  customers  and suppliers  see business under item tristar s gross profit both in dollar terms and as a percentage of sales declined in fiscal as compared to fiscal comparable numbers were  or  in fiscal and  or  in fiscal gross profit in dollar terms decreased as a result of lower sales in fiscal and increased cost of product 
the page major cause of this decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales can be attributed to the decreased purchasing power of the us dollar in certain foreign markets where components are purchased and to increased packaging costs 
in addition  the margin percentages were affected by the mix of product manufactured and sold in fiscal compared to fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses sg a decreased in fiscal to  from the fiscal level of  the decrease can be attributed to restructuring and reduced marketing promotions and advertising production costs in fiscal the expenses involved in closing the south carolina distribution center and the costs of selective headcount reductions increased fiscal sg a expenses 
offsetting the decreases in fiscal were continued expansion of marketing activities and selective hiring of new personnel  especially in support of the expansion of latin america markets 
as a percentage of sales  sg a was on a lower sales amount in fiscal compared to in fiscal fiscal sg a included expenses incurred in the relocation of the pencil manufacturing operations from south carolina to texas and an expense of  to reduce the book value of the plant and surrounding land to their estimated net realizable value 
interest expense increased  in fiscal from the level of  this increase was attributable to several factors including an increased prime rate in fiscal  increased average short term borrowings  and a change in the mix of long term debt such that interest rates increased 
fiscal expenses included merger related expenses of  litigation expenses arising from events related to the shareholder litigation of  and  of expenses related to the amortization of the warrant valuation asset
