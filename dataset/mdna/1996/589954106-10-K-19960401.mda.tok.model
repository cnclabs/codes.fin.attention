item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction the company is a self liquidating  finite life real estate investment trust 
see item above 
the company s principal asset is a portfolio of twenty four industrial and commercial properties  which are carried at the lower of depreciated cost or net realizable value 
this section should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and supplementary data listed in item below 
unless otherwise defined in this report  or unless the context otherwise requires  the capitalized words or phrases used in this section either a describe accounting terms that are used as line items in such financial statements  or b have the meanings ascribed to them in such financial statements and the notes thereto 
discussion of known trends  events and uncertainties the adverse economic climate for commercial real estate  which has persisted for over the last several years  has begun to show signs that rental rates and property values have stabilized and in selected markets have actually improved 
notwithstanding a stabilizing real estate market  tenants may or may not continue to renew leases as they expire or may renew on less favorable terms 
conditions differ in each market in which the company s properties are located 
because of the continuing uncertainty of future economic developments in each market  the impact these developments will have on the company s future cash flow and results of operations is uncertain 
inflation  inflationary expectations and their effects on interest rates may affect the company in the future by changing the underlying value of the company s real estate or by impacting the costs of financing the company s operations 
the company s policy of negotiating leases on a triple net basis or modified gross basis  whenever possible  is designed to help protect the company against some of the increased costs that might otherwise result from inflation 
one of the requirements for reit qualification is that five or fewer shareholders cannot own more than of the total value of a company s outstanding stock at any time during the last half of the taxable year the five or fewer rule 
for purposes of this rule under the law as it existed before  domestic pension trusts were treated as a single individual 
due to fluctuations in the fair market value of its preferred stock relative to its common stock  the company failed to satisfy the five or fewer rule and therefore did not qualify as a reit for the years ended december  and these fluctuations were due in part to i recent declines in real estate values and ii the preferred shareholders liquidation preference 
as a result of the loss of reit status  the company was taxed as a regular corporation for the years ended december  and  however  the loss of reit status did not have a material tax impact on the company because the company did not have any taxable income in or beginning with the tax year  the five or fewer rule was modified to allow reits to look through to the beneficiaries of a domestic pension trust and treat each beneficiary as owning stock in the company in proportion to the beneficiary s actuarial interest in the domestic pension trust 
this new look through rule allowed the company to again satisfy the five or fewer rule and again elect reit status beginning in the tax year 
during  the company engaged cs first boston as its financial advisor to explore future strategic opportunities available to the trust 
in that regard  the company s board of directors is considering all options that may be available  which include liquidation of the company s assets  conversion of the company to an infinite life reit with accompanying changes to the self liquidating policy  or other options 
the company currently has no properties for sale and no plans to liquidate its property portfolio in the near term 
the company has determined that a soil settlement problem at the east maricopa property in phoenix  arizona is far more serious than originally understood 
outside consultants have indicated that if the soil under the building continues to settle  a portion of the building may be uninhabitable within a year 
the company is currently negotiating with the building s tenant regarding an early termination of its tenancy so that the company can undertake a repair of the building 
in addition  the company is pursuing a lawsuit against the entity from which it purchased the property as well as a third party consultant 
the company has not provided for any valuation reserves or accruals to rectify the settlement problem because those amounts are not currently determinable 
the property represents less than one percent of the company s investments in real estate 
liquidity and capital resources the company s main sources of liquidity are i cash flows from operating activities  ii funds from operations  iii cash reserves  and iv net proceeds from the sale of the company s real properties 
secondary sources of liquidity may include i proceeds from the issuance of additional shares of stock  and ii proceeds from secured and unsecured debt 
a summary of the company s historical cash flows is as follows cash flows provided by year ending december  used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    in addition to cash flows and net income  management and industry analysts generally consider funds from operations to be one additional measure of the performance of an equity real estate investment trust reit because  together with net income and cash flows  funds from operations provides investors with an additional basis to evaluate the ability of the company to incur and service debt and to fund acquisitions and other capital expenditures 
however  funds from operations does not measure whether cash flow is sufficient to fund all of the company s cash needs including principal amortization  capital improvements  and distributions to shareholders 
funds from operations also does not represent cash generated from operating  investing or financing activities as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
funds from operations should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
funds from operations represents net income loss before extraordinary items  adjusted for depreciation on real property and amortization of tenant improvement costs and lease commissions  gains from the sale of property  equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated joint ventures and net realizable value nrv provisions 
the company s pro rata share of the funds from operations of the unconsolidated joint venture is also included in the company s funds from operations 
prior to  the company made certain non cash rent adjustments to funds from operations 
to conform with the industry definition of funds from operations  these years have been restated to exclude these non cash rent adjustments 
funds from operations as disclosed by other equity reits may not be comparable to funds from operations as determined by the company 
a reconciliation of the company s net income loss to funds from operations is as follows year ending december  net income loss    reconciling items depreciation and amortization    gains losses from sale of property  extraordinary item  funds from operations  including nrv provisions    nrv provisions    funds from operations  excluding nrv provisions    management considers funds from operations  excluding nrv provisions  to represent one of the appropriate operating performance measures of an equity reit 
management considers nrv provisions to reflect adjustments of real estate values based upon rising or falling market conditions which  although indicative of impairment of the company s investment  do not necessarily correlate to ongoing operating results 
the company s principal applications of its cash resources are i operating expenses related to real estate operations  general and administrative expenses  interest expense  and legal costs  ii capital improvements  iii principal payments under one of its long term debt facility see discussion below and mortgage notes payable  and iv payment of distributions to its shareholders
