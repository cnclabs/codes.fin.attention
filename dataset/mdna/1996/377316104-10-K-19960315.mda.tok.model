glatfelter company and subsidiaries overview the company classifies it sales into two product groups printing papers  and tobacco and other specialty papers 
the spring grove  pennsylvania and neenah  wisconsin mills produce printing and other specialty papers 
the pisgah forest mill hereinafter referred to as the ecusta division or ecusta produces printing  tobacco and other specialty papers 
most of the company s printing paper products are directed at the uncoated free sheet portion of the industry 
strong demand for these papers into the third quarter of led to an increase in printing paper sales volume and prices 
the demand for printing papers weakened towards the end of the third quarter and incoming orders remained low during the fourth quarter of it is generally believed that this decline was driven by abnormally high customer inventory levels 
prices for many of the company s printing paper products declined marginally during this time 
sluggish conditions are expected to continue in this market during the first quarter of as customers deplete their inventories  the company is cautiously optimistic that a steadier buying pattern will develop in the second quarter of and will remain for the balance of the year 
market conditions affecting the company s tobacco and other specialty papers products group improved during although competition for domestic and foreign tobacco paper sales remained intense  this portion of the paper industry was buoyed by a lack of capacity increases 
domestic cigarette consumption was approximately the same in compared to while international cigarette consumption continued to grow 
these favorable market conditions enabled ecusta to sell more tobacco paper products in  improve the product sales mix and increase selling prices for many tobacco paper products 
favorable conditions are expected to continue during a significant portion of ecusta s sales  however  are made to a limited number of major tobacco companies 
the current legal and regulatory pressures on that industry could have an adverse effect on the future tobacco paper sales and profitability of ecusta 
under such conditions  the company would attempt to replace any lost sales and profitability with lightweight printing and other specialty papers 
compared to net sales in increased  or  over the company s sales volume also increased in compared to overall demand for the company s products was very strong into the third quarter of the demand for printing papers weakened towards the end of the third quarter and incoming orders remained below normal levels during the fourth quarter of strong market conditions resulted in significant price increases during the first nine months of  tempered somewhat by a marginal decline during the fourth quarter of printing paper sales increased by  or  in compared to the annual average net printing paper selling price increased in from due to the significant increase in demand for printing papers as well as the company s ability to offset increased raw material costs  particularly for market pulp  pulp substitutes and wastepaper 
the increased demand for printing papers resulted in a increase in sales volume in compared to weakening demand resulted in some marginal price decreases during the fourth quarter of despite these decreases  the average selling price during the fourth quarter of was higher than the average selling price during the fourth quarter of net tobacco and other specialty paper sales increased  or  in compared to the company had a increase in tobacco paper sales volume in over an increase in worldwide demand for tobacco paper products in general and flax based tobacco papers specifically  and a lack of industry capacity increases allowed the company to sell more tobacco paper volume and improve its sales mix 
these factors also resulted in a slight increase in the average tobacco paper selling price in compared to other specialty paper sales decreased by in compared to as increased average selling prices were more than offset by a decrease in sales volume 
increased sales volumes and selling prices led to a significant increase in operating profit in compared to profit from operations  before unusual items  interest income and expense and taxes was  compared to  in the increase in average selling prices more than offset the increase in cost of products sold resulting in an increase in gross margin from in to in the cost of products sold on a per unit basis increased primarily as a result of higher costs for market pulp  pulp substitutes and wastepaper 
these cost increases more than offset i the ability of the company to spread its fixed manufacturing costs over more tons of products manufactured during compared to  and ii the favorable impact of lower depreciation expense of approximately  during compared to increased depreciation expense at the spring grove mill  due primarily to the completion of the pulpmill modernization project in the fourth quarter of  was more than offset by a reduction in depreciation at ecusta in of approximately  compared to the decrease in ecusta s depreciation resulted from the writedown of the net assets of ecusta in the fourth quarter of selling  general and administrative expenses were  higher in than in this increase occurred primarily from higher profit sharing and incentive related expenses during compared to selling  general and administrative expenses were and of net sales for and  respectively 
interest on debt in increased  over the company capitalized  of interest expense in no interest expense was capitalized during the increase in interest on debt was also due to a higher variable interest rate on the company s interest rate swap management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations p

cost of sales increased primarily due to increased depreciation 
depreciation increased due to the completion of the pulpmill modernization project during the fourth quarter of this project  undertaken primarily for environmental reasons  resulted in an increase in total pulp production capacity at the mill 
the corresponding reduction in volume of purchased market pulp resulted in increased profitability at spring grove during profit from operations at the neenah mill showed an increase of  in compared to net sales increased  in due to a significant increase in sales volume and average selling price 
neenah s profit from operations was negatively impacted by a significant increase in the cost of wastepaper 
wastepaper costs decreased during the second half of and by the end of had returned to historical levels 
profit from operations at ecusta increased  in compared to net sales increased  in  primarily due to an increase in average selling price due to an improved sales product mix and ecusta s ability to offset increased raw material costs  particularly for market pulp 
ecusta s increase in raw material costs was more than offset through a combination of price increases and by a decrease of approximately  in depreciation costs  due to the writedown of the net assets of ecusta in the fourth quarter of ecusta s profitability was also significantly enhanced through comprehensive cost reduction efforts 
compared to overall demand for the company s products increased significantly in the second half of  particularly in the fourth quarter  which led to several price increases for certain printing paper grades 
net sales for the year increased  in over net sales in the fourth quarter of were  higher than in the fourth quarter of printing paper sales decreased  or in compared to the annual average net printing paper price decreased in from due to the supply of uncoated free sheet papers exceeding demand during the first half of significant increases in demand  particularly in the fourth quarter of  led to price increases for certain printing paper grades 
the average net selling price in the fourth quarter of was higher than in the third quarter of and higher than in the fourth quarter of net tobacco and other specialty paper sales increased  or  in compared to other specialty paper sales increased in over with a increase in sales volume and a increase in average net selling price 
increased competition and cost cutting measures taken by ecusta tobacco paper customers put severe pressure on tobacco paper prices 
aggressive pricing by the company resulted in a increase in tobacco paper sales volume in over  primarily to export customers  but a decrease in average net selling price 
despite the increase in sales  operating profits slipped significantly in from profit from operations  before unusual items  accounting changes  interest income and expense and taxes was  compared to  in  a decrease 
a decrease in average net selling price and increases in the cost of products sold caused a decrease in gross margin from in to in the cost of products sold increased as a result of higher costs for market pulp and wastepaper and higher depreciation costs  primarily as a result of the completion of the spring grove pulpmill modernization project 
the company s gross margin was also negatively impacted by unplanned mill downtime at the spring grove and neenah mills during the first quarter of and above normal downtime at the spring grove mill during the third quarter of due to the complex integration of equipment required by the pulpmill modernization project 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  lower in than in this expected decrease occurred primarily in salaries  wages and other compensation expenses resulting from the company s restructuring efforts 
profit sharing and incentive expenses were also lower in than in due to lower earnings 
interest on debt in increased  over this increase is due primarily to a full year of interest expense in related to the company s march issuance of  principal amount of its notes and an increase in interest expense related to short term borrowings in in addition  during the third quarter of  the company ceased capitalizing interest on expenditures relating to the spring grove pulpmill modernization project  resulting in a significant increase in net interest expense 
results by mill the company s spring grove mill showed a decline in its profits from operations of  in compared to net sales were relatively flat in compared to as an overall improvement in average net selling price offset a slight decline in sales volume 
the primary reason for the decline in profits from operations was an increase in depreciation expense resulting from the completion of the spring grove pulpmill modernization project 
profit from operations at the neenah mill showed a decline of  in compared to net sales increased  in as a increase in volume more than management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations p

glatfelter company and subsidiaries offset a decrease in average net selling price 
neenah s profit from operations was negatively impacted by an increase in the cost of wastepaper  particularly in the fourth quarter of profit from operations at ecusta declined  in compared to resulting in an operating loss for the year 
net sales increased  in as an increase in sales volume was offset somewhat by a decrease in average net selling price 
ecusta s profit from operations was most negatively impacted by a sharp increase in the cost of purchased pulp and its inability to pass the increased costs onto its customers  particularly tobacco paper customers  due to severe competitive pressures 
unusual charges during  the company closely monitored the ecusta division and continued its efforts to maximize utilization of ecusta s assets by attempting to direct sales volume to its more profitable grades and by controlling costs 
despite these efforts  ecusta experienced a operating loss before an unfavorable lifo inventory charge  unusual items  interest expense and taxes of  ecusta continued to be negatively impacted by the continuing trend of declining domestic tobacco consumption  a trend which was expected to continue 
increased competition for foreign tobacco paper sales also negatively impacted ecusta s profitability 
based on ecusta operating results  which indicated that market conditions were unlikely to improve significantly in the near future  the company determined that its efforts to return ecusta to an acceptable level of profitability would not be successful 
as a result  the company decided to evaluate other strategic alternatives 
as part of its consideration of such alternatives  the company solicited offers to buy the ecusta division during the fourth quarter of in january  the company rejected all offers which it received to buy the ecusta division because the offers were less than the company s valuation of the net assets 
nevertheless  as a result of these offers  as well as the company s revised valuation of the net assets of ecusta  the company concluded that the fair value of the net assets was less than the book value 
accordingly  during the fourth quarter of  the net assets of ecusta were written down to fair value  resulting in a  charge to pre tax earnings 
this writedown had no cash impact on the company 
the company concluded that asset impairment recognition was required as the revised projected undiscounted future cash flows of the ecusta division were less than the carrying value 
in developing the revised projections  the company considered actual results and the company s conclusions concerning future market conditions and the resulting impact on prices 
to determine the fair value of the ecusta division s net assets  the company projected the present value of future cash flows using a discount rate 
the resulting fair value  which exceeded the offers received  was used to determine the amount of the writedown 
the writedown of ecusta s net assets reduced depreciation expense in by approximately  and will result in reduced depreciation in subsequent periods by declining amounts 
during the fourth quarter of  the company also identified impaired assets at its spring grove and neenah mills  resulting in a pre tax charge of  this writedown primarily related to solid waste disposal assets  specifically  a sludge combustor at the neenah mill and an unused landfill at the spring grove mill 
during the fourth quarter of  the company identified more economical means  acceptable to the appropriate environmental agencies  by which to dispose of its solid waste at these locations and concluded that the significant additional expenditures necessary to make the assets operational were not prudent  resulting in unusable assets 
financial condition liquidity during  the company s cash and cash equivalents increased by  this increase in cash and cash equivalents was due to cash generated by operations of  which was largely offset by  for the funding of capital related projects  the payment of  for dividends  the repayment of  of short term bank borrowings and the purchase of  of common stock for the treasury 
the company expects to meet all its near term and long term cash needs from a combination of internally generated funds  cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and existing bank lines of credit 
the company s interest rate risk is limited to its level of variable rate borrowings 
in march  the company issued  principal amount of its notes and immediately entered into an interest rate swap agreement having a total notional principal amount of  under the agreement  the company receives a fixed rate of and pays a floating rate london interbank offered rate libor plus sixty basis points  as determined at six month intervals 
the floating rate is for the six month period ending february  although the company can pay to terminate the swap agreement at any time  the company intends to hold the swap agreement until its march  maturity 
the cost to the company to terminate the agreement fluctuates with prevailing market interest rates 
as of december   the cost to terminate the swap agreement was approximately  capital resources during  the company expended  for capital projects including  relating to projects completed during most of these expenditures were for maintenance related capital  however  approximately  was expended for environmental capital projects and approximately  was expended for the spring management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations p

glatfelter company and subsidiaries grove mill s pulpmill modernization project and turbine generator installation 
these projects were both completed in the fourth quarter of capital spending in is expected to increase as certain projects originally planned to begin in are now expected to commence during environmental matters the company is subject to loss contingencies resulting from regulation by various federal  state  local and foreign governmental authorities with respect to the environmental impact of air and water emissions and noise from its mills as well as its disposal of solid waste generated by its operations 
in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations  the company has incurred substantial capital and operating expenditures over the past several years 
the company anticipates that environmental regulation of the company s operations will continue to become more burdensome and that capital expenditures will continue and operating expenditures will continue  and perhaps increase  in the future 
in addition  the company may incur obligations to remove or mitigate any adverse effects on the environment resulting from its operations  including the restoration of natural resources  and liability for personal injury and damage to property  including natural resources 
management s current assessment  after consultation with legal counsel  is that such expenditures are not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity  but there can be no assurance that its reserves will be adequate or that such an effect will not occur at some future time 
effects of changing prices the moderate levels of inflation during recent years have not had a material effect on the company s net sales  revenues or income from operations 
although the replacement cost of assets increases during inflationary periods  earnings and adequate cash flow may be maintained through an increase in selling prices
