net interest income was million in compared to million in and million in the following is an analysis of the average balance sheets and net interest income for each of the three years in the period ended december  first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis average balance sheets and net interest analysis dollar amounts in thousands average income yield or average income yield or average income yield or balance expense rate a balance expense rate a balance expense rate a assets interest earning assets time deposits with banks     investment securities       federal funds sold     loans b c  net of unearned income       total interest earning assets       noninterest earning assets cash    reserve for loan losses    other assets    total noninterest earning assets    total assets    liabilities and shareholders equity interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand deposits       savings deposits       time deposits       short term borrowings       long term debt    total interest bearing liabilities       noninterest bearing liabilities and capital noninterest bearing demand deposits    other liabilities    shareholders equity    total noninterest bearing funding sources    total liabilities and shareholders equity    net interest income and net yield on interest earning assets    a yields on interest earning assets have been computed on a tax equivalent basis using the federal income tax statutory rate 
b income on nonaccrual loans is accounted for on the cash basis  and the loan balances are included in interest earning assets 
c loan income includes net loan fees 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis both interest income and interest expense increased as volumes increased 
average interest earning assets increased million in average loans increased million in and were supported by deposit growth and maturities of investment securities 
during average investment securities decreased million  primarily as a result of the sale of million of us treasury securities  the proceeds of which were used to pay off short term borrowings 
the investment securities sold had an average yield of while the short term borrowings had an average cost over the remainder of the year of 
this transaction increased net interest income by thousand in the sale of us treasury securities during also had a favorable impact on total investment yields during the year as the securities sold had a lower yield compared to other securities in the portfolio 
both asset yields and the cost of funds increased in asset yields  on a tax equivalent basis  increased basis points during while the cost of funds increased basis points 
conversely  during both asset yields and cost of funds decreased 
asset yields decreased basis points in while the cost of funds decreased basis points 
during loan yields increased basis points when compared to the year ended december   but may have reached their peak 
after improving each quarter of and  loan yields declined during the fourth quarter of loan yields may decline further as the portfolio is impacted by declining interest rates and innovative loan product offerings which bear lower introductory interest rates 
these loan products are designed to initiate relationships in the early stages of a customer s financial life cycle so they may be developed thereafter with more traditional banking products and services 
any initial earnings reduction related to the new products are expected to produce long term profitable relationships and loan yields 
prepayments of mortgage backed securities mbs remained steady during and have not been significantly impacted by declining interest rates 
the primary risk of owning mbs relates to the uncertainty of prepayments of the underlying mortgages 
interest rate changes have a direct impact on prepayment speeds 
as interest rates increase  prepayment speeds generally decline  resulting in a longer average life of a mbs 
conversely as interest rates decline  prepayment speeds increase  resulting in a shorter average life of a mbs 
using computer simulation models  the corporation tests the average life and yield volatility of all mbss under various interest rate scenarios on a continuing basis to insure that volatility falls within acceptable limits 
the corporation holds no high risk securities nor does the corporation own any securities of a single issuer exceeding of shareholders equity other than us government and agency securities 
average interest bearing deposits increased million during as a result of declines of million in interest bearing demand deposits and savings accounts combined with increases of million in time deposits 
time deposits increased primarily in the to month maturity range 
since renewal rates were higher than the expiring rates for most of  these deposits experienced a rate increase of basis points compared to deposit costs increased basis points during while deposit costs declined basis points during although the cost of funds increased more rapidly than earning asset yields during  loan growth throughout the year maintained the margin 
net interest margin net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis as a percentage of average earning assets  was during compared to in and in the corporation s use of computer modeling to manage interest rate risk is described in the interest sensitivity section of this discussion herein 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis the following table shows the effect of changes in volumes and rates on interest income and interest expense 
analysis of year to year changes in net interest income dollar amounts in thousands change from change from total change due change due total change due change due change to volume to rate change to volume to rate interest earning assets time deposits with banks securities      federal funds sold loans       total interest income       interest bearing liabilities deposits       short term borrowings      long term debt total interest expense       net interest income      the provision for possible loan losses is an amount added to the reserve against which loan losses are charged 
the amount of the provision is determined by management based upon its assessment of the size and quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the reserve in relation to the risks inherent within the loan portfolio 
the provision for possible loan losses was million in compared to million in and the provision for possible loan losses increased in as a result of growth in the portfolio as a whole  combined with charge offs and increased delinquencies of consumer installment and revolving credit loans 
net charge offs against the reserve for possible loan losses were million  or of average total loans in this compared to million in and million in net charge offs were and of average total loans in and  respectively 
although charge offs as a percentage of average total loans increased for in comparison to prior periods  this increase has not exceeded peer averages 
in response to charge offs during the fourth quarter of in the amount of million  of which more than half were loans to individuals  the provision for possible loan losses in the fourth quarter of was million 
for an analysis of credit quality  see the credit review section of this discussion 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis the following table presents an analysis of the consolidated reserve for possible loan losses for the five years ended december  dollars in thousands summary of loan loss experience loans outstanding at end of year      average loans outstanding      reserve for possible loan losses balance  beginning of year      addition as result of acquisition  loans charged off commercial  financial and agricultural    loans to individuals      real estate construction real estate commercial real estate residential lease financing receivables total loans charged off      recoveries of loans previously charged off commercial  financial and agricultural loans to individuals real estate construction real estate commercial real estate residential lease financing receivables total recoveries    net loans charged off      provision charged to expense      balance  end of year      ratios net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding reserve for possible loan losses as a percentage of average loans outstanding total other operating income declined million in to million from million reported in and can be compared to million in net securities losses of thousand in compared to securities gains of million in resulted in a decrease of million 
the securities losses during resulted from the sale of million of securities  primarily us treasury securities classified as available for sale 
as previously described in this discussion  the proceeds from the sale of million of these us treasury securities were used to pay off short term borrowings 
this transaction is expected to result in a net improvement in net interest income in excess of the net loss on the sale 
since the short term borrowings were at a variable rate  the exact benefit is not determinable until after the securities would have matured 
during million of securities classified as held to maturity were sold at a net gain of thousand 
all but one security were called and were sold within three months of the call date 
the remaining security was sold because of a significant deterioration of the issuer s creditworthiness 
also during  the corporation sold  shares of federal home loan mortgage corporation common stock with a book value of thousand for a gain of million in anticipation of a market value decline if interest rates continued to rise 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis during marketable equity securities with a book value of million were sold for a million gain 
the remaining securities transactions during and were primarily the sales of us treasury securities  us government agency securities maturing within a year and proceeds were reinvested in us treasury securities and us government agency securities with maturities of years 
although the market values of assets managed increased during  trust income decreased by thousand  primarily as a result of lower income on estates than in prior periods 
trust income decreased thousand during as the market value of assets managed declined  reflecting the turbulent bond and stock markets  thereby reducing the billing basis for many of the trust accounts 
service charges on deposits increased for all periods reported  primarily as a result of increased average total deposits 
total other operating expenses increased million to million in and compared to million and million in and  respectively 
results for the period included merger costs of million 
employee costs during were million  an increase of million over the level of million 
included in employee costs for were early retirement settlements and other benefit adjustments of million 
excluding early retirement settlements and other benefit adjustments  employee costs increased during primarily because of an increase in the number of full time equivalent employees in customer service areas and the cost of employee insurances and hospitalization 
employee costs as a percentage of average assets was in up from in and in salary levels are generally maintained through attrition management programs 
cost savings for can be anticipated in hospitalization expenses as a result of converting to a managed health care plan beginning in january employee costs will also be impacted positively as various functional areas of the corporation  such as accounting  human resource and marketing are redesigned to more efficiently support the new organizational structure resulting from the merger of eight commercial bank subsidiaries into a single operating unit during net occupancy expense and furniture and equipment increased thousand in as a result of increased utilization of leased equipment 
as various operational areas of the organization such as loan processing are redesigned for greater efficiency  leased equipment is being used until long term equipment requirements can be identified 
leased equipment although increasing costs over the short term will allow for flexibility in systems design and save costs over the long term as furniture and equipment will not be purchased until the process redesign has been completed 
net occupancy expense and furniture and equipment increased in as the costs of maintenance and repairs decreased and depreciation increased as the process of automating loan documentation and the branch network progressed 
this upgrade is expected to improve platform productivity and reduce loan documentation risks 
the deposit insurance assessment from the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic decreased by million in to million from million and million in and respectively 
since the fdic bank insurance fund has reached its regulatory cap the assessment rate for banks was reduced from per of deposits to per of deposits effective june  for the corporation s commercial bank subsidiary will be assessed the minimum fdic assessment of thousand 
as a result of the savings and loan insurance fund remaining underfunded  congress could enact an additional one time pretax assessment against the thrift deposits of the corporation during while the amount and likelihood of the assessment is uncertain the impact could be as much as million 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis other operating expenses decreased thousand in to million and can be compared to million in and million in the period contained merger related expenses in the amount of million 
after adjusting the total for the million of merger costs deducted  other operating expenses really increased by million in and decreased by thousand in the amortization of core deposit intangibles decreased thousand in and in as the intangibles related to mergers which occurred in and became fully amortized in the primary cost increases which occurred in included the collection of loans or the disposition of real estate acquired in lieu of loan repayment 
additional expenses of thousand were also incurred during as a result of the conversion of computer systems of recently acquired subsidiaries to those of the corporation and conversion of a new trust processing system by the corporation s trust subsidiary 
stationery and supplies expense increased by thousand during primarily as a result of the merger of eight commercial bank subsidiaries which caused some supplies to become obsolete 
aggressive marketing of innovative products and specialized customer services during caused increases in advertising  promotions and printing expenses totalling thousand 
postage costs increased thousand in as a result of rate increases 
restructuring costs had an impact on legal and professional fees which increased by thousand during as organizational changes were evaluated and implemented 
income tax expense was million during representing a decrease of million over the total of million and compared to million in taxable income decreased million during while taxable income increased million in the corporation s effective tax rate decreased to in from in and compares to in the most significant factor for the decrease in the effective rate compared to is related to the nondeductibility of merger expenses incurred in for income tax purposes 
liquidity liquidity is a measure of the corporation s ability to efficiently meet normal cash flow requirements of both borrowers and depositors 
in the ordinary course of business  funds are generated from deposits primary source and the maturity or repayment of earning assets  such as securities and loans 
as an additional secondary source  short term liquidity needs may be provided through the use of overnight federal funds purchased  borrowings through the use of lines available for repurchase agreements  and borrowings from the federal reserve bank 
additionally  all of the banking subsidiaries are members of the federal home loan bank and may borrow up to ten percent of their total assets at any one time 
the sale of earning assets may also provide an additional source of liquidity 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis the corporation s long term liquidity source is a large core deposit base and a strong capital position 
core deposits are the most stable source of liquidity a bank can have due to the long term relationship with a deposit customer 
deposits increased in and included million in core deposits 
non core deposits  which are time deposits in denominations of thousand or more represented of total deposits at december  non core deposits increased by million in primarily as a result of an increase in public funds 
time deposits of thousand or more at december   and had remaining maturities as follows maturity distribution of large certificates of deposit dollar amounts in thousands amount percent amount percent amount percent remaining maturity months or less    over months through months    over months through months    over months    total    net loans increased million during primarily in the categories of consumer loans and real estate loans secured by residential properties 
in combination these categories represented over of the loan growth during  reflecting a strengthening of consumer loan demand 
below is a schedule of loans by classification for the five years ended december  loans by classification dollar amounts in thousands amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent commercial  financial  agricultural and other      real estate construction      real estate commercial      real estate residential      loans to individuals      net leases      gross loans and leases      unearned income      total loans  and leases net of unearned income      an additional source of liquidity are marketable securities that the corporation holds in its investment portfolio 
these securities are classified as securities available for sale 
while the corporation does not have specific intentions to sell these securities  they have been designated as available for sale because they may be sold for the purpose of obtaining future liquidity  for management of interest rate risk or as part of the implementation of tax management strategies 
as of december   securities available for sale had an amortized cost of million and a market value of million 
gross unrealized gains were million and gross unrealized losses were million 
based upon the corporation s historical ability to fund liquidity needs from other sources  the current available for sale portfolio is deemed more than adequate  as the corporation does not anticipate a need to liquidate the investments until maturity

interest sensitivity the objective of interest rate sensitivity management is to maintain an appropriate balance between the stable growth of income and the risks associated with maximizing income through interest sensitivity imbalances 
while no single number can accurately describe the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income  interest rate sensitivity positions  or gaps when measured over a variety of time periods may be helpful 
an asset or liability is considered to be interest sensitive if the rate it yields or bears is subject to change within a predetermined time period 
if interest sensitive assets isa exceeds interest sensitive liabilities isl during a prescribed time period  a positive gap results 
conversely  when isl exceeds isa during a time period  a negative gap results 
a positive gap tends to indicate that earnings will be impacted favorably if interest rates rise during the period and negatively when interest rates fall during the period 
a negative gap tends to indicate that earnings will be affected inversely to interest rate changes 
in other words  as interest rates fall  a negative gap should tend to produce a positive effect on earnings and when interest rates rise  a negative gap should tend to affect earnings negatively 
the primary components of isa include adjustable rate loans and investments  loan repayments  investment maturities and money market investments 
the primary components of isl include maturing certificates of deposit  money market deposits  savings deposits  now accounts and short term borrowings 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis interest sensitivity continued the following table lists the amounts and ratios of assets and liabilities with rates or yields subject to change within the periods indicated as of december  and dollar amounts in thousands cumulative days days days days loans     investments     other interest earning assets     total interest sensitive assets     certificates of deposit     other deposits   short term borrowings     total interest sensitive liabilities     gap     isa isl gap total assets cumulative days days days days loans     investments     other interest earning assets     total interest sensitive assets     certificates of deposit     other deposits   short term borrowings     total interest sensitive liabilities     gap     isa isl gap total assets first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis final loan maturities and rate sensitivity of the loan portfolio excluding consumer installment and mortgage loans and before unearned income at december  were as follows dollar amounts in thousands within one one to after year years years total commercial and industrial     financial institutions real estate construction     real estate commercial     other     totals     loans at fixed interest rates   loans at variable interest rates   totals   the corporation has not experienced the kind of earnings volatility indicated from the gap analysis 
this is because assets and liabilities with similar contractual repricing characteristics may not reprice at the same time or to the same degree 
therefore  to more precisely measure the impact of interest rate changes on the corporation s net interest margin  management simulates the potential effects of changing interest rates through computer modeling 
the corporation is then better able to implement strategies which would include an acceleration of a deposit rate reduction or a lag in a deposit rate increase 
the repricing strategies for loans would be inversely related 
the analysis at december  indicated that a basis point movement in interest rates in either direction would not have a significant impact on the corporation s anticipated net interest income over the next twelve months 
credit review maintaining a high quality loan portfolio is of great importance to the corporation 
the corporation manages the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio through the use of prudent lending policies and procedures and monitors risk through a periodic review process provided by external auditors  internal auditors  regulatory authorities and our loan review staff 
these reviews include the analysis of credit quality  diversification of industry  compliance to policies and procedures  and an analysis of current economic conditions 
in the management of its credit portfolio  the corporation emphasizes the importance of the collectibility of loans and leases as well as asset and earnings diversification 
the corporation immediately recognizes as a loss all credits judged to be uncollectible and has established a reserve for possible credit losses that may exist in the portfolio at a point in time  but have not been specifically identified 
the corporation s written lending policy requires certain underwriting standards to be met prior to funding any loan  including requirements for credit analysis  collateral value coverage  documentation  and terms 
the principal factor used to determine potential borrowers creditworthiness is business cash flows or consumer income available to service debt payments 
secondary sources of repayment  including collateral or guarantees  are frequently obtained 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis the lending policy provides limits for individual and bank committees lending authorities 
in addition to the bank loan approval process  requests for borrowing relationships which will exceed one million dollars must also be approved by the corporation s credit committee 
this committee consists of a minimum of three members of the corporation s board of directors 
commercial and industrial loans are generally granted to small and middle market customers for operating  expansion or asset acquisition purposes 
operating cash flows of the business enterprise are identified as the principal source of repayment  with business assets held as collateral 
collateral margins and loan terms are based upon the purpose and structure of the transaction as set forth in loan policy 
commercial real estate loans are granted for the acquisition or improvement of real property 
generally  commercial real estate loans do not exceed of the appraised value of property pledged to secure the transaction 
repayment of such loans are expected from the operations of the subject real estate and are carefully analyzed prior to approval 
real estate construction loans are granted for the purposes of constructing improvements to real property  both commercial and residential 
on site inspections are conducted by qualified individuals prior to periodic permanent project financing  which is generally committed prior to the commencement of construction financing 
real estate loans secured by family residential housing properties are granted subject to statutory limits in effect for each bank regarding the maximum percentage of appraised value of the mortgaged property 
residential loan terms are normally established in compliance with secondary market requirements 
residential mortgage portfolio interest rate risk is controlled by secondary market sales  variable interest rate loans and balloon maturities 
loans to individuals represent financing extended to consumers for personal or household purposes  including automobile financing  education  home improvement  and personal expenditures 
these loans are granted in the form of installment  credit card  or revolving credit transactions 
consumer creditworthiness is evaluated on the basis of ability to repay  stability of income sources  and past credit history 
since all identified losses are immediately charged off  no portion of the reserve is restricted to any individual credit or groups of credits  and the entire reserve is available to absorb any and all credit losses 
however  for analytical purposes  the following table sets forth an allocation of the reserve for possible loan losses at december according to the categories indicated allocation of the reserve for possible loan losses dollar amounts in thousands commercial  industrial  financial  agricultural and other      real estate construction real estate commercial      real estate residential      loans to individuals      lease financing receivables unallocated      total      reserve as percentage of average total loans first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis the unallocated portion of the reserve for possible loan losses increased during in both total dollars and as a percentage of the total reserve 
various factors impacted this increase but most notably were an amount set aside to provide for loan growth and an increase in net charge offs in the fourth quarter of which reduced the balances for which a specific reserve had been allocated 
other than those described below  there are no material credits that management has serious doubts as to the borrower s ability to comply with the present loan repayment terms 
the following table identifies nonperforming loans at december a loan is placed in a nonaccrual status at the time when ultimate collectibility of principal or interest  wholly or partially  is in doubt 
past due loans are those which were contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal payments but are well secured and in the process of collection 
renegotiated loans are those which terms have been renegotiated to provide a reduction or deferral of principal or interest as a result of the deteriorating financial position of the borrower 
nonperforming and impaired assets and effect on interest income due to nonaccrual dollar amounts in thousands loans on nonaccrual basis      past due loans      renegotiated loans    total nonperforming loans      nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans reserve as percentage of nonperforming loans other real estate owned      gross income that would have been recorded at original rates   interest that was reflected in income net reduction to interest income due to nonaccrual the reduction of income due to renegotiated loans was less than thousand in any year presented 
the ratio of the reserve for possible loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans has steadily increased over the past five years strengthening the reserve s ability to absorb credit losses 
at december  the ratio of the reserve for possible loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans remains lower than the corporation s peers and although this ratio is an indicator of the strength of the reserve for possible loan losses it does not in itself measure loan loss reserve adequacy 
other factors to be considered include historical loan losses and nonperforming loan levels 
these measurements were favorable when compared to peer group levels over the past five years 
management believes that the reserve for possible loan losses and nonperforming loans remains safely within acceptable levels 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis effective january  the corporation adopted financial accounting standards board statement no 
accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan fas no 
 as amended by statement no 
accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures fas no 

this statement addresses the accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan by specifying how allowances for credit losses related to certain loans should be determined

capital resources equity capital increased million in to million 
dividends declared decreased equity by million  an increase over the period as the dividend rate was increased 
the retained net income remains in permanent capital to fund future growth and expansion 
payments by the corporation s employee stock ownership plan esop to reduce debt it incurred to acquire the corporation s common stock for future distribution as employee compensation  net of additional advances  and fair value adjustments to unearned esop shares  increased equity capital by thousand 
the market value adjustment to securities available for sale increased capital by million as market values rebounded 
amounts paid to fund the discount on reinvested dividends and optional cash payments reduced equity by thousand 
the cost of purchasing treasury shares decreased equity by million while proceeds from the reissuance of treasury shares to provide for stock options exercised increased equity capital by thousand during a capital base can be considered adequate when it enables the corporation to intermediate funds responsibly and provide related services while protecting against future uncertainties 
the evaluation of capital adequacy depends on a variety of factors  including asset quality  liquidity  earnings history and prospects  internal controls and management caliber 
in consideration of these factors  management s primary emphasis with respect to the corporation s capital position is to maintain an adequate and stable ratio of equity to assets 
the federal reserve board has issued risk based capital adequacy guidelines which went into effect in stages through the risk based capital standard is designed principally as a measure of credit risk 
these guidelines require at least of a banking organization s total capital be common and certain other core equity capital tier i capital  assets and off balance sheet items must be weighted according to risk  the total capital to risk weighted assets ratio be at least  and a minimum leverage ratio of tier i capital to total assets 
the minimum leverage ratio is not specifically defined  but is generally expected to be percent for all but the most highly rated banks  as determined by a regulatory rating system 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis capital resources continued the table below presents the corporation s capital position at december  percent amount of adjusted in thousands assets tier i capital  risk based requirement  total capital  risk based requirement  minimum leverage capital  minimum leverage requirement  inflation and changing prices management is aware of the impact inflation has on interest rates and therefore the impact it can have on a bank s performance 
the ability of a financial institution to cope with inflation can only be determined by analysis and monitoring of its asset and liability structure 
the corporation monitors its asset and liability position with particular emphasis on the mix of interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to reduce the effect of inflation upon its performance 
however  it must be remembered that the asset and liability structure of a financial institution is substantially different from an industrial corporation in that virtually all assets and liabilities are monetary in nature  meaning that they have been or will be converted into a fixed number of dollars regardless of changes in general price levels 
examples of monetary items include cash  loans and deposits 
nonmonetary items are those assets and liabilities which do not gain or lose purchasing power solely as a result of general price level changes 
examples of nonmonetary items are premises and equipment 
inflation can have a more direct impact on categories of noninterest expenses such as salaries and wages  supplies and employee benefit costs 
these expenses are very closely monitored by management for both the effects of inflation and increases relating to such items as staffing levels  usage of supplies and occupancy costs
