see the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s programs are operated pursuant to fixed per diem contracts based upon program occupancy and management contracts  including management contracts with not for profit entities  as well as various third party payor reimbursement contracts 
the company recognizes revenues under all contracts as the services are performed 
under certain cost based reimbursement contracts  certain costs may be subject to audit and adjustment as determined through negotiations with government or third party payor representatives 
under these contracts  contract revenues are recorded at amounts that are expected to be realized 
in addition  the company recognizes revenue from its consulting and development services as they are performed 
the contribution from operations  in general  is lower in the initial stages of a program s development primarily due to costs associated with staffing requirements needed to obtain licensing prior to admitting students into a program as well as costs incurred during the period prior to the achievement of stable program occupancy 
the company s contribution from operations as a percentage of revenue is greater under some of its contractual arrangements with unaffiliated not for profit entities because the not for profit entity is responsible for certain elements of operating the program and incurs some of the costs 
therefore  in these instances  the company earns its margin on a lower base of costs and revenues
