certain trends and uncertainties the company has historically operated with very little backlog 
there are no long term supply agreements with customers  and as a result  revenues in any quarter are dependent upon orders that are received and shipped during that quarter 
further  a large percentage of any quarter s system shipments are recorded in the last month of the quarter 
consequently  quarterly revenues and operating results will depend on the volume and timing of new orders received during a quarter  which are difficult to predict 
failure to receive adequate amounts of new orders could adversely affect revenues and operating results  and such shortfalls may not be known until very late in any quarter 
for quality control  ease of development  and purchasing efficiencies  the company has elected to purchase certain components from one supplier 
although the company has been able to obtain supplies of these components in a timely manner  the interruption in supply of any of these components could have an adverse impact on the company s revenues and operating results 
while the company believes that other suppliers could provide required components in the event of an interruption in supply  a change in suppliers could cause a delay in manufacturing and a possible loss of sales  which would adversely affect operating results 
the market for the company s stock is highly volatile 
any variance in operating results from analysts expectations  or changes in estimated results by industry analysts could have an adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock in a given period 
furthermore  in recent years the market prices of securities of many high technology companies have experienced extreme fluctuations  in many cases for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the company s stock 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company had a current ratio of to  and working capital of  compared to a current ratio of to and working capital of  at december  cash and cash equivalents were  at december  compared to total cash and temporary investments of  at december  the decline in cash and equivalents during was primarily the result of the non recurring acquisition costs of the tsl merger of approximately  capital expenditures of  and increases in accounts receivable and inventory 
accounts receivable increased by over  from  principally due to an increase in international sales during the year  which typically have longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection 
inventory increased by approximately  primarily due to the stocking of additional components in anticipation of sales increases in future quarters 
the company believes the increase in each of these areas to be in line with the business growth experienced in and the backlog of orders at the end of the year 
the increases in accounts receivable and inventory were funded through increases in accounts payable and other accrued expenses  and the liquidation of temporary investments 
the company believes that receivables and inventory will increase at rates proportional to revenue increases 
the company maintains a  line of credit that is used from time to time to fund short term cash requirements 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this line as of december  the company regularly invests excess funds in short term securities  such as bankers acceptances  government obligations and variable rate demand notes  having maturities up to one year 
management believes that restricting investments to these types of securities maximizes financial flexibility and minimizes exposure to interest rate and market risks 
the company utilizes these investments as a source of liquidity  to the extent that cash requirements exceed short term cash receipts 
the company expects to invest approximately  in capital expenditures during  but it has no significant capital commitments 
the company believes that working capital on hand  funds provided from future operations  and its current line of credit will be sufficient to fund the company s capital requirement for at least the next year 
inflation inflation has not had a material impact on the company s results of operations 
because of the competitive nature of the computer industry  the costs of parts used in the company s products have remained relatively stable
