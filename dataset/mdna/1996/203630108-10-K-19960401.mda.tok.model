money lent for consumer loans may be expensive and time consuming to recover in the event of default 
community continues to use the same loan underwriting criteria and loan review process that has reduced non performing assets to the lower levels that have been maintained over the past few years

residential mortgage loans are originated and underwritten according to federal and state regulations and generally in accordance with secondary market guidelines 
if possible  community sells most of its fixed rate residential mortgage loans on the secondary market 
as a general rule  the maximum loan to value ratio is of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price of the property up to with private mortgage insurance as secondary market requirements permit

liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measure of community s ability to meet its cash needs at a reasonable cost 
cash needs arise primarily as a result of funding lending opportunities  the maturity of liabilities such as borrowings and the withdrawal of deposits 
asset liquidity is achieved through the management of earning asset maturities  loan amortization  deposit growth and access to borrowed funds 
management believes that funding sources are adequate to meet commitments and ongoing obligations 
the holding companys funding requirements are limited and are adequately satisfied by dividends from concord and by its interest bearing cash deposit with concord 
dividends paid from concord to community are limited to the extent necessary for concord to comply with regulatory capital guidelines

also  during fiscal community experienced a shift in the mix of deposits from the lower cost savings deposits to the higher cost time certificates of deposit

non interest income total non interest income amounted to  for fiscal compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal exclusive of loan and security gains  non interest income steadily increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal to  in fiscal this represented a increase in versus the level earned in fiscal the increases resulted primarily from steady growth in deposit fee and loan servicing income 
growth in service chargeable deposit accounts and increases in selected service fees  implemented during fiscal  were the reasons for the increases in deposit fee income 
continued growth in mortgage loans serviced for others since the beginning of fiscal resulted in a corresponding increase in fee income 
loan sale gains decreased to  in fiscal compared to the higher levels of  and  earned during fiscal and  respectively  due to reduced residential mortgage origination volume caused by the decline in demand for refinancings as market rates have risen 
offsetting a portion of this decline experienced in fiscal was the adoption of sfas no 
accounting for mortgage servicing rights  an amendment of fasb statement no 
this was effective july  and resulted in an increase of  in gains on the sale of loans for fiscal also  community s opportunities to realize security gains diminished since fiscal as market rates rose 
gains on the sale of securities declined from  in fiscal to  in fiscal to  in fiscal non interest expense total non interest expense increased by to  in fiscal from  experienced during fiscal primarily due to major investments made by community to expand its business lines and product distribution system 
total non interest expense for fiscal represented a decrease of from  in fiscal this reduction was primarily the result of lower expenses related to non performing assets 
during the fiscal year ended june   community experienced increases in salaries and benefits and occupancy and equipment expenses primarily due to expanding major business lines and product distribution system 
during fiscal  community opened a new full service branch office at the steeplegate mall located in concord  new hampshire  opened a remote automated teller machine in tilton  new hampshire  expanded its indirect auto dealer financing programs and established a municipal services department 
also impacting salaries and benefits during fiscal were additional benefits expense related to pension and the establishment and funding of a k benefit plan 
offsetting a portion of the increased non interest expense was a reduction in other non interest expense during fiscal which was primarily due to reduced legal and other expenses related to the resolution of problem loans 
income taxes there was no income tax expense in as a result of the decrease in the deferred income tax asset valuation reserve established on july  in  and to a lesser extent in  income tax expense was partially offset by further decreases in the valuation reserve 
at june   community had a net deferred tax asset of  which included a valuation reserve of  which primarily related to certain state tax temporary differences 
the realization of the net deferred tax asset may be based on utilization of carrybacks to prior taxable periods  anticipation of future taxable income  and the utilization of tax planning strategies 
management has determined that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset can be realized by carrybacks to federal taxable income in the three year carryback period and by expected future taxable income
