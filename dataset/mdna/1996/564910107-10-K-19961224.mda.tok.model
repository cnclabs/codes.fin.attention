to date  management believes inflation has not had a material impact on the company s operations 
factors affecting future performance in addition to other information contained in this form k  the following factors should be carefully considered 
recent operating losses liquidity the company has incurred operating losses of  and  for the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
at september   the company s accumulated deficit was  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to operate profitably or achieve sustained profitability in the future 
the company has used cash during fiscal years and to fund strategic investments  in particular substantial expenditures for new product development  and operating losses 
for the fiscal years ended september  and the company s product development expenditures were approximately  and  respectively 
during  the company currently intends to make similar investments in product development 
the company s objective is to fund these investments primarily with cash from improved operations 
the company s ability to generate cash from operations depends upon  among other things  revenue growth  completion and market acceptance of new products  success in enhancing and selling its current as based families of products  improvements in operating productivity  and payment terms and collection of accounts receivable 
the company continues to focus its resources on the protean  mapics xa  prism and avantis product families 
the company s ability to successfully continue this strategy will impact its future results of operations and liquidity position 
the continuation of this strategy will depend upon  among other things  its ability to maintain and enhance its major product lines  to develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments  and to satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements 
there can be no assurance that the company s operations will generate sufficient cash to finance its activities 
until operations improve to meet its cash requirements  the company will need to rely on existing cash resources and borrowings under its credit facility 
the company currently anticipates that its available cash and borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund operations in if  however  such sources prove insufficient in  or over the longer term  the company will be required to make changes in operations or seek additional debt or equity financing 
there can be no assurances that additional debt or equity financing will be available or available with terms acceptable to the company 
variability of quarterly results the company s sales cycle typically ranges from three to twelve months  and the cost of acquiring marcam s software and associated computer hardware  and of training system users  represents a significant expenditure for customers 
the company s relatively long sales cycle and variable average revenue per transaction  together with fixed short term expenses  such as product development expenditures  can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter  if projected revenues are not realized in the expected period 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future or that its levels of profitability will not vary significantly among quarterly periods 
further  it is possible that in some future quarters the company s revenues or operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock could be materially adversely affected 
new products and technological change the market for the company s software products is characterized by rapid technological advances  evolving industry standards in computer hardware and software technology  changes in customer requirements  and frequent new product line introductions and enhancements 
the company s future success will depend on its ability to enhance its current product lines and to develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments  satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and achieve market acceptance 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing  on a timely and cost effective basis  product enhancements or new products that respond to technological advances by others  or that its new products will achieve market acceptance 
the company is currently facing the challenges of a product and technology transition 
in particular  many of the company s software products such as prism and mapics are designed to operate on ibm proprietary hardware  including ibm s as computer systems 
the company must continue to invest in enhancements and support for these products in a cost effective manner 
the company s newest products are designed to be platform independent and utilize advanced object technology 
products embodying this technology are just beginning to be introduced into the existing erp marketplace 
although the company believes that its new object technology products will enjoy increased acceptance by users in the erp marketplace  there can be no assurance that such products will be accepted by users to a significant degree or at all 
major new product enhancements and new products can require long development and testing periods to achieve market acceptance 
in addition  software programs as complex as those offered by the company may contain errors which are undetected when the products are first introduced or as new versions are released that  despite testing by the company  are discovered only after a product has been installed and used by customers 
there can be no assurance that errors will not impair the market acceptance of these products or adversely affect the company s operating results 
the company has from time to time experienced problems with customers not being able to install or implement certain of the company s new product releases and with product performance  including problems related to product functionality  product response time and program errors 
currently  marcam is not aware of any product implementation issues which have not been addressed or are not currently being addressed by marcam 
there can be no assurance that the problems encountered by customers installing and implementing new releases or with the performance of the company s products will not arise in the future  and if such problems arise  that such problems will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
relationship with and dependence on ibm a substantial majority of marcam s software license revenues is derived from products designed to operate on ibm s proprietary as series of computers 
marcam s current business is therefore affected by ibm s success in designing and marketing these computer systems 
international activities a material portion of the company s business comes from outside the united states 
risks inherent in the company s international business activities include imposition of government controls  restrictions on the export of critical technology  political and economic instability including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs and taxes  difficulties in staffing and managing international companies  longer accounts receivable collection cycles and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations 
effective patent  copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every foreign country in which the company sells its products 
the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations could be materially adversely effected by any of these risks 
dependence on proprietary technology marcam s success is heavily dependent upon its proprietary software 
marcam relies on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright  and trademark laws  and non disclosure and license agreements  to protect its products 
marcam enters into confidentiality and or license agreements with its employees  distributors  customers and potential customers  and limits access to and distribution of its software  documentation  and other proprietary information 
there can be no assurance that steps taken by marcam in this regard will be adequate to deter misappropriation or independent third party development of its technology 
although the company believes that its products and technology do not infringe any existing proprietary rights of others  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert such claims against the company in the future or that such future claims will not be successful 
the company could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources with respect to the defense of any claims relating to proprietary rights  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  parties making such claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages  as well as injunctive or other equitable relief  which could effectively block the company s ability to make  use  sell  distribute or market its products and services in the us or abroad 
such a judgment could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the event a claim relating to proprietary technology or information is asserted against the company  the company may seek licenses to such intellectual property 
there can be no assurance  however  that such a license could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to the company 
the failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could preclude the sale  manufacture or distribution of the company s products and  therefore  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the cost of responding to any such claim may be material  whether or not the assertion of such claim is valid 
competition the market of application software to support manufacturers and distributors is highly competitive 
some of marcam s current and potential competitors have significantly greater development  marketing and capital resources than marcam 
in addition  most of marcam s existing and potential customers have a variety of software developed by their management information systems departments 
marcam s success depends  in part  on its ability to persuade existing and potential customers to replace or augment their internally developed software with marcam s products  and there can be no assurance that marcam will be able to accomplish this objective 
attraction and retention of key personnel marcam believes that its success will depend in large part on its ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial  and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense 
none of marcam s employees are bound by an employment agreement 
all key employees  however  are bound by a non competition agreement which extends for one year after termination of their employment with marcam 
there can be no assurance that marcam will be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel it requires to continue to grow and to operate profitably 
possible volatility of stock price the stock market from time to time experiences extreme price and volume fluctuations  particularly in the high technology sector 
in addition  factors such as announcements of technological innovations or new products by marcam or its competitors  quarterly financial releases  as well as market conditions in the computer software or hardware industries  may have a significant impact on the market price of marcam s common stock 
marcam s common stock has experienced  and may in the future exhibit  price volatility because of factors related  as well as unrelated  to marcam s operating performance
