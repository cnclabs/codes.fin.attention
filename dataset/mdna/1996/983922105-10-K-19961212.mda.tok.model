actual results could differ materially from those projected in the trend analysis and other forward looking statements contained herein  as a result of the risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report 
results of operations in thousands change change net sales    net sales versus pc card and parallel port product sales 
net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily due to increased net sales of lan adapters  modems and multifunction lan and modem cards combo cards collectively client products  which connect portable pcs to networks  the internet and on line services such as america online 
net sales of client products increased to million in from million in primarily due to growth in overall market demand for local and wide area network connectivity products and an increase in unit sales of its client products by its distributors in each of the last five quarters 
the growth in channel sell through may be indicative of several factors an increased growth rate in shipments of portable pcs  which in turn require network connections  a more competitive pricing strategy first adopted by the company during fiscal  continuing increased market acceptance of the company s third generation combo card  which was introduced in july  and increased sales of the company s modem only pc card product  which was introduced in september unit shipments of client products increased in over but average selling prices declined due to increased competition in the pc card lan adapter market and to the continued shift in product mix to pc card versions from higher margin parallel port versions 
the company s credit card ethernet modem and creditcard ethernet adapter accounted for and  respectively  of sales and and  respectively  of sales 
netaccess product sales 
the netaccess family of products includes remote access server products sold to original equipment manufacturers oems and through two tier distribution channels 
netaccess products increased to of net sales in from of net sales in the company believes revenues from netaccess products will increase in fiscal due in part to a growing customer base and the reintroduction of the multiport modem product line in late fiscal the netwave wireless lan product line  which was sold in august  accounted for of net sales in and of net sales in international sales 
total international sales shipments to customers located outside the us decreased as a percentage of total sales to in from in however  international sales of pc cards increased as a percentage of total pc card sales to in from in pc card sales in europe and asia pacific grew at a faster rate than in the us during primarily because of greater market growth in asia and shorter delays in as compared to between initial shipment of new products in the u 
s and the shipment of internationally approved versions of such products 
net sales versus net sales decreased in compared to due primarily to the company s efforts to reduce channel inventories that had built up in the second half of fiscal and the first half of fiscal and due to a loss of market share in the pc card market 
unit sales of lan adapter products increased only in compared to in addition  overall average selling prices in declined from due primarily to the increased competition in the pc card lan adapter market and to a shifting mix of products from parallel port versions to pc card versions 
the decline in average selling price was partially offset by an increase in in revenues derived from the higher priced combination ethernet modem products  which were originally introduced in february in thousands change change gross profit    percentage of net sales gross profit consists of net sales less cost of sales  which includes product costs materials  labor  manufacturing overhead and royalty payments to licensers of software incorporated into the company s products and provisions for excess and obsolete inventory and warranty expense 
the increase in gross profit as a percent of net sales in compared to was primarily attributable to increased revenue and the resulting decrease in fixed costs as a percentage of total cost of sales  as well as the favorable impact of cost reduction efforts including the successful transition of all the company s pc card production to its own manufacturing facility in penang  malaysia 
these positive margin impacts were partially offset by the increased portion of sales represented by pc card products  which have lower gross profit margins than the company s parallel port products  and to selling price reductions on pc card products 
in addition  start up expenses related to the malaysian manufacturing facility had a negative impact on gross margins in the first half of fiscal while the in house manufacturing facility is expected to continue to have a positive impact on cost reduction efforts  the proportion of revenues derived from the combo and modem only pc cards  which have lower gross profit margins compared to lan pc cards and netaccess products  have negatively impacted overall gross margins and may continue to offset improvements from manufacturing and design efficiencies if such revenue mix changes continue 
in addition  cost reduction could be offset by continued pricing pressure 
the decline in gross profit as a percent of net sales in compared to was primarily attributable to product mix changes toward pc card products as well as competitive selling price reductions on pc card products 
lower than expected revenues and the resulting greater portion of fixed costs in relation to total cost of sales also contributed to the decline in gross profit margins 
the results also include an million inventory reserve charged to cost of sales  related primarily to excess wireless lan and remote access products 
in thousands change change research and development    percentage of net sales research and development expenses decreased in in absolute dollars as a result of more focused product development efforts  including reduced spending on netwave products  and decreased significantly as a percentage of sales due to higher sales levels 
research and development expenses increased in in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales as the company expanded headcount and expenditures for engineering materials  equipment  software development and outside services  all related to the development of a significant number of new products 
although the company has reduced the planned breadth of certain product line expansion efforts  total expenditures for research and development expenses are likely to increase in as compared to in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales  due to planned expenditures on product enhancements and new product introductions 
in thousands change change sales and marketing    percentage of net sales sales and marketing expenses decreased in from as a result of consolidation of certain sales operations  reduced overall promotional spending due to a more focused product line  and reduced headcount through employee attrition 
sales and marketing expenses increased substantially in as compared to primarily due to additions in sales and marketing personnel  additional advertising for new products  and higher promotional expenditures related to increased competition in the pc card market  efforts to reduce higher than normal levels of channel inventories  and activities to launch new remote access and wireless lan products 
sales and marketing expenses for fiscal are currently expected to increase in absolute dollars to support planned new product introductions 
in thousands change change general and administrative    percentage of net sales general and administrative expenses increased in each of and  primarily due to continued expansion of information systems hardware and software and amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets related to the acquisition of pri 
amortization included in general and administrative expenses totaled  and  in and  respectively 
it is currently expected that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars in fiscal to support growth within the overall organization 
in thousands change change in process research and development and other nonrecurring charges   n a percentage of net sales nonrecurring charges of   net of tax benefit of  in related to the sale of the netwave product line 
nonrecurring charges of   net of tax benefit of  in consisted primarily of write offs of  of in process research and development purchased from pri that had not yet reached technological feasibility and accordingly was charged to the company s operations 
additional nonrecurring charges in related to the sale of certain assets  the write off of lease obligations on excess and idle facilities  and severance payments related to a reduction in workforce 
total operating expenses 
excluding nonrecurring charges  total operating expenses were  in compared to  in a decrease 
such decrease was primarily due to more focused product development activities  a reduction in certain promotional spending and reduced headcount through employee attrition 
excluding nonrecurring charges  total operating expenses in increased by compared to due to the significant expansion of the company s product offerings and the acquisition of pri in june product line expansion efforts required more development expenditures as well as significant increases in sales and marketing expenditures 
in thousands change change other income expense  net  n a percentage of net sales net other income or expense includes interest income from the investment of available cash  early payment discounts earned by the company offset by early payment discounts taken by customers  foreign currency transaction gains or losses  and interest expense on notes payable and capital leases 
interest income was   and  in  and  respectively 
the net other expense for as compared to net other income earned for was due primarily to lower interest income and higher interest expense in as a result of reduced cash balances and borrowings under credit facilities 
interest expense is expected to increase in as a result of borrowings required to fund capital expenditures 
net other expense in includes a charge of  for the early termination of the lease on the company s previous corporate headquarters facility

risk factors the market for portable pc lan adapters has grown rapidly since the personal computer memory card international association pcmcia introduced a standard form factor for pc card originally pcmcia lan adapters in companies with greater name recognition in the pc  desktop lan adapter and pc card modem industries and with greater financial resources now have a significant presence in the pc card adapter market 
as a result  the company s net sales and gross profit margins have been and could continue to be adversely impacted by several competitive factors  including increased price competition  new product introductions by competitors  promotional efforts by competitors  any reduction in the company s percentage market share of the pc card adapter markets  and the levels of inventories in the company s distribution channels 
although competition is expected to remain intense  the company believes its share of the pc card lan adapter market stabilized in  primarily because of a more competitive pricing strategy for pc card products adopted during fiscal  the success of its combination ethernet lan and modem pc card  and the introduction of several new pc card products in late fiscal  including the company s fast ethernet pc cards which began shipments in june  its cardbus ethernet adapter which began shipping in october  and its fourth generation combo cards which began shipping in september the company believes that the market for pc card lan adapters  modems and combo cards will continue to be price competitive for the long term and thus could continue to result in lower gross profit margins than the company has earned from such products in the past 
the company believes its current product costs are competitive  and continues to redesign its products for cost savings 
in addition  the company s manufacturing facility  which began volume production in early fiscal and is now producing all of the company s pc card products  is operating at a greater efficiency level than in the first half of fiscal however  there can be no assurances that cost reductions achieved through increased manufacturing efficiencies will keep pace with competitors cost reductions or will be sufficient in the event of anticipated competitive price reductions to allow price reductions required to maintain or increase market share without adversely affecting gross profit margins 
the company generally ships products within one to six weeks after receipt of orders and therefore its sales backlog is typically minimal 
accordingly  the company s expectations of future net sales are based largely on its own estimate of future demand and not on firm customer orders 
if net sales do not meet expectations  the company may not be able to reduce expenses commensurately in the near term  and profitability would be adversely affected 
the company s net sales may be affected by its distributors decisions as to the quantity of the company s products to be maintained in their inventories 
at the end of september  the company believes its distributors had what the company considers to be normal levels of inventory overall 
however  there can be no assurance that distributors will not choose to reduce inventory levels nonetheless  which would adversely affect net sales 
there can be no assurances that new products that the company may introduce will achieve market acceptance or sell through to end users in sufficient quantities to make them viable for the long term 
in addition  the company may have difficulty in establishing its presence in markets in which it does not have significant brand recognition  such as remote access 
the company introduced a line of modem only pc card products late in fiscal  utilizing existing technologies from its combo cards and modem based remote access products 
while the pc card modems generally have lower gross profit margins than pc card lan adapters  increased sales volume from modems would have a positive impact on coverage of fixed manufacturing costs  which in time could partially offset the generally lower margins on modem products 
while product areas such as remote access and isdn are expected to contribute higher gross profit margins  any sales growth achieved in these areas may not exceed sales growth  if any  in pc card products  and therefore any positive impact on overall gross margins may be limited 
because all pc card products are being manufactured at the company s own facilities  interruptions in supply of products could occur if the company is unable to accurately forecast or react to changes in product demand  which in turn could adversely affect future sales 
interruptions could also occur due to political or economic changes in malaysia 
in summary  gross profit margins are impacted by a number of factors  including the rate of sales growth  competitive pricing pressures  the mix of product sales  component and manufacturing costs  and shipment of new products  which often have lower margins until market acceptance and increased volumes permit component cost reductions and manufacturing efficiencies 
frequent product transitions also increase the risk of inventory obsolescence and interruptions of sales 
historically  netaccess and previously pri has focused its sales and development efforts on the oem market and has recorded limited sales to date in the end user market 
there can be no assurances that the company will be able to successfully develop the end user market for isdn products or be able to compete effectively with other companies that have significantly greater resources than the company and which have recently entered the isdn market 
the company s corporate headquarters  research and development facilities and other critical business operations are located near major earthquake faults 
operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake 
a number of additional factors could have an impact on the company s future operating results 
the industry in which the company operates is characterized by rapid technological change and short product life cycles 
while the company has historically been successful in developing leading technology for its products  ongoing investment in research and development will be required to maintain the company s technological position  and the company could be required to increase the rate of such investments depending on competitive factors 
many of the company s competitors have greater financial and technical resources than the company 
it is also possible that networking capability could be included in the pc itself or in extension modules to pcs  which could cause a reduction in the demand for add on networking devices 
the company s results are also dependent on continued growth in the underlying market for portable networking products as well as the company s ability to retain its market share 
the company is aware that competitors have duplicated certain functionality of the company s products 
there can be no assurance that the company s patents  copyrights  trademarks and other efforts to protect its intellectual property will prevent duplication of the company s technology or that they will provide a competitive advantage 
the company is also aware that there can be no assurance that a patent issued to the company would be upheld as valid if litigation over a patent were initiated 
the company believes that  due to the rapid pace of technological change in the lan communications industry  the company s success is likely to depend more upon continued innovation  technical expertise  marketing skills and customer support and service than legal protection of the company s proprietary rights 
with the proliferation of new products and rapidly changing technology in the pc card and remote access server markets  there is a significant volume of patents or similar intellectual property rights held by third parties 
given the nature of the company s products and development efforts  there are risks that claims associated with such patents or intellectual property rights could be asserted by third parties 
these risks may include the following the cost of licensing a given technology if the company believes it may be prudent to secure such rights  the claimant may not offer such a license on terms acceptable to the company  the cost of litigation or settlement of such claims could be substantial regardless of the merits of the allegations  the company may not prevail in the event of litigation  if the company did not prevail in litigation  it could be required to pay significant damages  and or to cease sales and production of infringing products  and only make future sales of a noninfringing design 
such a claim was asserted in march in relation to the company s creditcard ethernet products 
based on the specific allegations made  the facts known at this time  and the investigation and evaluation by the company and its outside intellectual property counsel regarding the allegations  management does not currently believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations in the event that the third party continues to pursue this matter 
the company currently includes software licensed from third parties in certain of its ethernet modem  modem only  token ring and remote access products  which  in the aggregate  accounted for of revenues in fiscal the company s operating results could be adversely affected by a number of factors relating to this third party software  including failure by a licensor to promote or support the software  delays in shipment of the company s products as a result of delays in the introduction of licensed software or errors in the licensed software  excess customer support costs or product returns experienced by the company due to errors in licensed software  or termination of the company s relationship with such licensors 
because of frequent technology changes and rapid industry growth  the cost and availability of components used to manufacture the company s products may fluctuate 
some components  including custom chipsets  are available from only one supplier 
any interruptions in these supply sources or limitations on availability could impact the company s ability to deliver its products and in turn adversely affect future earnings 
liquidity and capital resources the company s operating activities provided cash of approximately million in  primarily as a result of income from operations and income tax refunds received offset in part by increases in accounts receivable and inventory and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the company s capital expenditures of million were for leasehold improvements at new facilities  equipment related to increased headcount  manufacturing equipment and leasehold improvements at the malaysian manufacturing facility  and information systems hardware and software 
the company has no material fixed commitments for capital expenditures but is evaluating a lease versus buy decision for its malaysian manufacturing facility 
if the company purchases the facility  it would result in an increase in capital expenditures of approximately million and the issuance of long term debt to finance the purchase 
the company has a domestic credit facility that permits borrowings up to million at the prime rate plus at september  
advances under the agreement are based on eligible accounts receivable and inventories and are secured by all us based assets of the company 
as of september   there was  outstanding under this agreement  which expires in december the company also has a credit facility in malaysia totaling million with interest rates ranging from to over the bank s reference rate to at september  
as of september   there was  outstanding under both the revolving credit and term loan provisions of this facility and  in demand notes outstanding under this agreement 
the company had approximately  in borrowings available under its credit facilities as of september  the company expects to replace its domestic credit facility with a new facility for at least the same amount and at terms similar to or more favorable than its existing facility 
the company believes that cash on hand  borrowings available under its existing facilities or from other financing sources and cash provided by operations will be sufficient to support its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  there can be no assurances that future cash requirements to fund operations will not require the company to seek additional capital sooner than the twelve months  or that such additional capital will be available when required on terms acceptable to the company
