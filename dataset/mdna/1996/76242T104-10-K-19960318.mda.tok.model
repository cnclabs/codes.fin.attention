item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition rhone poulenc rorer inc rpr or the company is one of the largest research based pharmaceutical companies in the world 
rpr was formed in by the combination of rorer group inc and substantially all of the human pharmaceutical business of rhone poulenc sa rp  based in paris  france 
rp owns approximately two thirds of rpr s common stock and controls the company 
strategic business developments through recent selected acquisitions and alliances  the company has sought to solidify its position in targeted therapeutic areas and to strengthen its geographic presence in strategic markets in the second quarter of  the company acquired from rp the businesses of cooperation pharmaceutique francaise cooper and rhodia farma  a pharmaceutical business in brazil 
cooper has an extensive pharmacy distribution network in france and promotes the company s self medication products 
rhodia farma strengthens the company s presence in brazil and increases access to other south american markets 
the acquisitions of entities under common control were treated for accounting purposes on an as if pooling basis and  accordingly  rpr restated its first quarter and full year results to include the accounts of cooper and the brazilian business as of april  and january   respectively 
earnings per share for the restated periods reflect pro forma adjustments giving effect to interest on indebtedness and preferred dividends relative to the acquisition transactions 
the discussion that follows reflects the effect of such restatements 
in september  the company s armour pharmaceutical company subsidiary armour completed the formation of a global joint venture centeon with behringwerke ag behring  a subsidiary of germany s hoechst ag  in the plasma proteins business 
armour and behring have complementary plasma proteins offerings and geographic strengths which position the joint venture as a global market leader 
the joint venture s board of directors was formally established on january  at which time joint control and profit sharing provisions took effect 
in the fourth quarter of  the company acquired the uk based pharmaceutical company fisons plc fisons 
fisons has a strong respiratory product portfolio with established positions in the us  europe and japan 
the combination of fisons with rpr creates the fourth largest company worldwide in asthma allergy with a comprehensive range of complementary products  expanded presence in major geographic markets and innovative inhalation delivery technologies 
two months of fisons pharmaceutical operations are included the company s results 
management anticipates that the impact of fisons will be earnings neutral in and accretive in in the fourth quarter of  the company also acquired the remaining outstanding shares that it did not own of applied immune sciences  inc ais  a pioneer in cell therapy 
the acquisition of ais enhances the company s ability  through its gencell division  to develop and commercialize ex vivo cell and gene therapies and provides increased access to vector research 
industry trends in recent years  the worldwide pharmaceutical industry has been affected by government and private payor initiatives to reduce pharmaceutical prices and limit the volume of prescriptions written by physicians 
in certain cases  companies may be able to negotiate terms or conditions which can minimize the effect of legislation on revenues 
the degree to which pharmaceutical companies are individually affected depends upon each company s product portfolio and its ability to manage in the environment specific to each country 
in the us  payment of rebates to state medicaid programs  as required by existing legislation  reduced the company s sales by million in  million in and million in even without major government mandated health care reform and government intervention  the us marketplace continues to experience growth and consolidation of managed care organizations which  on behalf of payors  seek to reduce health care costs 
rpr  along with most pharmaceutical manufacturers  has reorganized its sales and marketing organizations to adapt to managed care initiatives 
in france  the company s largest market  the government has continued its efforts to reduce the nation s health care deficit through such initiatives as special levies on pharmaceutical manufacturers coupled with compliance with individual three year convention agreements and encouragement of more widespread generics offerings 
in the company s other major markets  including germany  the uk  italy and japan  national governments exert controls over pharmaceutical prices either directly  or by controlling admission to or levels for  government reimbursement or by limiting overall profitability levels 
in germany  a two year government moratorium on price increases was lifted in elsewhere  in japan  a government imposed biannual price reduction takes effect in april whether initiated by governments or by private payors  the above measures tend to restrict future revenue and profit growth derived from existing products and  as a result  companies in the industry must look increasingly to achieve profitability objectives through more rapid commercialization of highly innovative therapies  integrated prescription  over the counter and generic product strategies  aggressive cost reduction  mergers or strategic alliances with others and creative marketing solutions to meet the needs of payors
