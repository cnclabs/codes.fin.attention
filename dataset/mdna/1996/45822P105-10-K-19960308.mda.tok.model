item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  at page  for a discussion of accounting developments 
in addition  the staff of the u 
s 
securities and exchange commission has questioned certain of the current accounting practices of the electric utility industry regarding the recognition  measurement  and classification of nuclear decommissioning costs for nuclear generation facilities in the financial statements of electric utilities 
in response to these questions  the financial accounting standards board has agreed to review the accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs 
if current electric utility industry accounting practices for such decommissioning are changed the annual provisions for decommissioning could increase and the estimated cost for decommissioning could be recorded as a liability rather than as accumulated depreciation 
wpsc does not believe that such changes  if required  would have an adverse effect on results of operations due to its current and future ability to recover decommissioning costs through customer rates 
the pscw certified new straight line depreciation rates which became effective january  concurrent with the implementation of new customer rates 
the result was a reduction in annual depreciation expense of approximately million 
regulatory assets represent probable future revenue associated with certain costs which will be recovered from customers through the ratemaking process 
regulatory liabilities represent costs previously collected that are refundable in future rates 
at december   regulatory assets and liabilities amounted to million and million  respectively 
based on prior and current rate treatment of such deferred charges  management believes it is probable that wpsc will continue to recover these costs from ratepayers 
pursuant to a pscw rate order  effective january   wpsc is to recover approximately million of deferred regulatory costs each year 
dividend restrictions 
wpsc is restricted by a pscw order to paying normal common stock dividends of no more than of the previous year s common stock dividend without prior notice to the pscw 
also  wisconsin law prohibits wpsc from making loans to the company and its non regulated subsidiaries and from guaranteeing their obligations 
effective january   a special common stock dividend of  was declared by wpsc to be paid to the company  the parent holding company 
the special dividend will allow wpsc s equity capitalization ratio to remain at approximately  as approved by the pscw for ratemaking 
the dividend was paid in january g 
capital requirements the company s subsidiary  wpsc  requires large investment in capital assets 
most of the company s significant capital requirements relate to wpsc construction expenditures 
anticipated construction expenditures for wpsc for are million and construction expenditures for and combined are anticipated to total million 
the million of construction expenditures includes million for electric construction  million for nuclear fuel  million for gas construction  and million for other construction expenditures 
wpsc also anticipates million of expenditures related to unit trains to be leased through wpsc s subsidiary wps leasing 
the company has no plans in   or for permanent financing  although project financing may occur in the non utility subsidiaries

item legal proceedings sheboygan gas plant 
in november  wpsc was notified by the dnr that it may be a prp for environmental contamination found on property next to the sheboygan river previously used by wpsc for the gasification of coal in the city of sheboygan  wisconsin the sheboygan ii gas plant 
wpsc last used the property for this purpose in approximately in  the property was sold and is now owned by the city of sheboygan 
the dnr has offered wpsc the opportunity to investigate and remediate the property under an agreement with wisconsin as opposed to having the site handled by the epa as part of the larger sheboygan river and harbor superfund site 
wpsc  the city of sheboygan  and wisconsin have negotiated an agreement for performing the work  and therefore  wisconsin  and not the epa  will be handling this matter 
an initial study was completed on the site which confirmed the presence of contaminants that appear to be related to the sheboygan ii gas plant 
a phase ii investigation was recommended by the environmental consultant to determine more precisely the scope of the contamination and to determine if any contamination is migrating from off site and whether sediments are impacted 
this phase ii investigation has been substantially completed 
wpsc and the city of sheboygan will negotiate an allocation of the costs associated with cleanup of the site 
based on the phase ii study  it is believed that the cost of cleanup for the sheboygan ii gas plant site could be as much as million 
the estimates presented above do not take into consideration any recovery from insurance carriers or other third parties which wpsc is pursuing 
oshkosh gas plant 
in april  wpsc received an order from the dnr directing it to complete an investigation and implement remedial activities on property owned by wpsc in the city of oshkosh  wisconsin 
previously  wpsc had operated a manufactured gas plant on the property from until a challenge to the order was filed on may   and wpsc and the dnr have negotiated the terms of a consent order 
an environmental consultant conducted an investigation in late and a more detailed investigation in  with sediment sampling conducted in based on these investigations  the cost of remediation is estimated to be as much as million 
the city of oshkosh has claimed that contaminated groundwater from the former gas plant property has migrated onto city owned land 
wpsc has agreed to stay the statute of limitations that may be applicable to the city of oshkosh s claim in order to avoid the filing of a lawsuit by the city of oshkosh 
wpsc is continuing to evaluate the validity of the city of oshkosh s claim as additional data is received 
the estimates presented above do not take into consideration any recovery from insurance carriers or other third parties which wpsc is pursuing

overview of compared to earnings per share increased from in to in the most significant reasons for this change were higher electric margins due to burning less expensive low sulfur coal and increased sales volume 
compared to electric operations electric margins increased by million see table below  or  due primarily to increased sales volumes and decreased coal costs which were partially offset by a wisconsin retail rate reduction effective january  electric margins revenues    fuel and purchases    margins    sales kwh    the public service commission of wisconsin pscw allows wpsc to pass on to its customers  through a fuel adjustment clause  changes in the cost of fuel and purchased power within a specified range 
wpsc is required to file an application to adjust rates either higher or lower when costs are plus or minus from forecasted costs 
electric operating revenues increased million  or 
electric revenues were higher due to a increase in kilowatt hour kwh sales 
this was partially offset by a decrease in retail wisconsin rates that took effect on january  residential and commercial and industrial kwh sales increased and  respectively  due to warmer summer weather and customer growth 
wholesale kwh sales decreased 
due primarily to lower demand by wpsc s largest wholesale customer 
electric fuels and purchases decreased million  or 
coal related costs decreased million  or  due to burning less expensive low sulfur coal 
however  this was partially offset by increased coal fired generation of million  or  and higher purchased power of million  or  due to warmer weather and increased plant outages resulting from maintenance at certain plants 
gas operations gas margins increased by million see table below  or  due to wpsc customer growth and colder weather and increased sales attributable to wps energy services  inc esi  an energy marketing subsidiary which began operations in esi s sales reduced overall margin per therm for the company  since the margin on commodity sales is lower than the margin on wpsc s gas distribution sales 
gas margins revenues    purchase costs    margins    volume therms    the pscw allows wpsc to pass on to customers  through a purchased gas adjustment clause  changes in the cost of gas 
gas operating revenues increased million  or 
the million increase is comprised of a million increase in revenues attributable to sales by esi and an offsetting decrease of million at wpsc due to lower gas costs 
gas purchased for resale showed a net increase of million  or 
gas purchases increased million due to esi s sales and were offset by lower gas costs at wpsc of million 
other revenues other operating revenues increased 
million from this represents consulting  construction  and investment revenue from esi and wps power development  inc pdi  a company organized to participate in the development of electric generation projects and to provide services to the unregulated electric power generation industry 
other other operating expenses increased million  or 
the majority of this increase is attributable to increased operating expenses at esi and pdi 
depreciation and decommissioning expense increased million or 
there were two primary factors for this increase 
the first factor was an increase in decommissioning funding of million that was reflected in customer rates which became effective january  the second factor was additional decommissioning expense recorded to offset a million gain on the decommissioning portfolio discussed below and million in higher trust earnings 
there were three significant nonrecurring items impacting other income in first  a million pretax gain was realized on the decommissioning portfolio from the sale of certain investments 
second  million in insurance proceeds was received as the result of the death of a retired wpsc executive 
third  these gains were partially offset by a million loss resulting from cancellation of the rhinelander energy center project 
compared to electric margins declined by million  or  primarily due to reduced electric rates 
electric operating revenues decreased million  or  primarily due to a reduction in wisconsin retail rates which took effect january  electric revenues also were reduced 
in may as a result of reduced fuel costs 
these decreases were partially offset by a increase in kwh sales 
residential and commercial and industrial kwh sales increased page and  respectively  due to a warmer summer and customer growth 
wholesale kwh sales increased 
electric fuels and purchases increased million  or  reflecting increased sales  offset in part by reduced production costs 
electric production fuels decreased million  or  even though generation was up 
this decrease in fuel costs per kwh of was primarily the result of purchasing less expensive coal on the spot market 
purchased power costs were higher by million  or 
this was the result of a increase in kwh purchases due to the severe cold weather in the first quarter of the year which forced wpsc to purchase expensive spot market electricity  and the soo line railroad strike during the second half of the year which impacted wpsc s ability to operate its coal fired units 
gas margins increased by million  or  due to customer growth 
maintenance expense decreased million  or  due to lower maintenance activity at the kewaunee nuclear power plant kewaunee and due to less electric transmission and distribution maintenance 
depreciation and decommissioning expenses decreased million  or 
the primary cause was a rate order from the pscw which took effect january  reducing the annual depreciation provision by an estimated million 
this was offset by higher decommissioning expense of approximately million 
federal and state income taxes decreased million  or  due to lower earnings 
balance sheet compared to customer receivables and accrued utility revenues increased million as a result of colder than normal weather experienced in december environmental remediation liabilities increased million due to higher estimates for gas plant site cleanup based on additional studies completed in financial condition wpsc requires large investments in capital assets used to deliver electric and gas services 
as a result  most of the company s capital requirements relate to wpsc s construction expenditures 
wpsc maintains good liquidity levels and a financial condition considered to be strong by analysts 
internally generated funds closely approximate the utility s cash requirements 
no external funding difficulties are anticipated 
pre tax interest coverage was times for the year ended december  wpsc s bond ratings are aa standard poor s  aa moody s  and aa duff phelps 
wpsc is restricted by a pscw order from paying normal common stock dividends of more than of the previous year s common stock dividends without pscw approval 
also  wisconsin law prohibits wpsc from making loans to the company and its subsidiaries and from guaranteeing their obligations 
on january   a special common stock dividend of million was declared by wpsc to be paid to the company 
the special dividend allows wpsc s equity capitalization ratio to remain at approximately  the level approved by the pscw in a recent rate case 
the dividend was paid in january for the three year period to  internally generated funds at wpsc should exceed construction expenditures  estimated at million  by million 
these expenditures are comprised of million for electric construction  million for nuclear fuel  million for gas construction  and million for other construction expenditures 
in early  wps leasing  inc leasing  a subsidiary of wpsc  expects to purchase an additional unit train for approximately million 
this purchase will be funded with long term debt 
leasing expects to refinance the current loan from the company with funds from an external source 
as of december   the current loan was million and carried an interest rate of 
wpsc received a two year rate order from the pscw which became effective january  previously  rate orders page were issued annually 
this new rate order decreased electric retail rates by while retail gas rates remained at current levels 
this order also increased the authorized rate of return on common equity from to 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets to be disposed of  became effective in march this statement imposes a stricter criterion for regulatory assets by requiring that such assets be probable of future recovery at each balance sheet date 
the company will adopt this standard on january  and does not expect that adoption will have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations based on the current regulatory structure 
this conclusion may change in the future as competitive factors influence wholesale and retail pricing in the electric and gas industries and as regulatory policy regarding recovery of stranded investment is developed 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  becomes effective in this statement permits  but does not require  companies to change their accounting for stock based compensation

the company expects to adopt only the disclosure provision of the statement 
plans to construct the rhinelander energy center rec were canceled in the rec would have been a megawatt cogeneration facility and would have provided steam and electricity to the rhinelander paper company  inc rhinelander in rhinelander  wisconsin and electricity to wpsc s customers 
plans for the rec were originally announced in august of following an in depth financial analysis and a lengthy negotiation process  rhinelander terminated negotiations 
wpsc and rhinelander had been negotiating since november of when the pscw selected the rec as the best project from proposals to meet wpsc s future electrical needs 
as a result of this cancellation  wpsc signed a year agreement in november to purchase power from polsky energy corporation polsky  an independent power producer proposing to build a plant adjacent to the nicolet paper company mill in de pere  wisconsin 
this was the second project chosen by the pscw from the proposals referred to above 
the first phase of the project calls for the completion of a megawatt combustion turbine facility in the second phase  scheduled to be in service in  converts the facility into a combined cycle unit and increases the total capacity to megawatts 
the polsky project is in the second stage of a two stage certificate of public convenience and necessity cpcn permitting process prescribed by the pscw 
construction of the polsky project is contingent upon a pscw determination in stage of the cpcn process that wpsc will need the electric capacity provided by the proposed plant 
a recent wpsc load forecast suggests that this capacity may not be needed 
a final decision on stage of the cpcn for the polsky project is expected in if the pscw approves the polsky project  it will be accounted for as a capitalized lease  based on the criteria set forth in sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
this would result in the company recording a plant asset of approximately million  with an offsetting amount of long term debt 
trends wpsc follows sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  and its financial statements reflect the effects of the different ratemaking principles followed by the various jurisdictions regulating the utility 
these include the pscw  of revenues  the michigan public service commission mpsc  of revenues  and the federal energy regulatory commission ferc  of revenues 
in addition  kewaunee is regulated by the nuclear regulatory commission nrc 
environmental matters are primarily governed by the environmental protection agency and the wisconsin department of natural resources 
the single most important development in the electric utility industry is the trend toward increased competition brought about by a combination of new legislation  changing regulation  and market forces 
transmission access  mandated by the energy policy act of  and increased competition in the wholesale power segment of the business have put pressure on profit margins 
certain segments of the industry could become deregulated 
low cost energy producers  such as wpsc  are in a position to benefit from competitive markets 
in march  the ferc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking which would require utilities under the ferc s jurisdiction  including wpsc  to file non discriminatory open access transmission tariffs which would be available to all wholesale buyers and sellers of electric energy  require utilities to take service under the tariffs for their own wholesale sales and purchases of electric energy  and provide utilities with an opportunity to recover stranded costs ie  unrecovered investment in facilities that are no longer economical to operate 
when implemented  this regulatory initiative might force investor owned utilities to separate generation  transmission  and distribution functions in order to create a level playing field where they can compete with municipal utilities  cooperatives  independent power producers  energy marketers  and brokers 
as a result  wpsc is developing and implementing strategies to deal with transmission access and potential stranded investment 
wpsc will develop a separate internal transmission group to fulfill the functional unbundling requirement 
wpsc has also filed comparable transmission access tariffs which have been accepted for use  subject to refund 
comparable transmission access tariffs  as defined by the ferc  provide transmission access to other parties on the same terms and conditions that wpsc provides transmission service to itself 
approval of these tariffs is contingent upon a number of considerations including the ferc s final rulemaking expected later in in december  the pscw outlined its plan for restructuring the electric industry in wisconsin 
utilities are required to develop detailed plans illustrating how they plan to separate generation  transmission  distribution  and energy service functions into separate business units and establish transfer prices for use between the business units 
under the pscw plan  the competitive market for new generation would be enhanced by modifying the present bidding process and replacing the advance plan process with a strategic evaluation process 
the pscw also concluded that the economic benefits and responsibilities of existing generation belong to present customers 
the pscw would continue transmission regulation by retaining control over planning and siting of transmission facilities 
to limit the market power of current transmission owners  the pscw proposes moving either to appointment of an independent transmission system operator or to organization of a single state wide transmission system 
as part of its continuing assessment of retail access  the pscw would establish broad pricing reforms for customer segments and quality of service standards 
the pscw would retain jurisdiction over low income programs  the winter moratorium on disconnection  demand side management  renewables  and research and development funding 
a public benefits advisory board would be formed to advise the pscw on conservation and renewable resource issues 
the wisconsin legislature is not expected to consider electric restructuring until in the meantime  the pscw  utility companies  various advocacy groups  and utility customers will continue to dialogue in an effort to reach a consensus on when and how to introduce competition into the electric marketplace 
the pscw timetable would provide all retail electric customers with energy supply choices by ferc order prompted the pscw to examine the regulation of the natural gas distribution business in wisconsin 
in september  the pscw tentatively concluded that once a class of customers has access to the competitive marketplace  they will be expected to purchase gas from unregulated suppliers  and that utilities could be required to offer unbundled pricing and service choices to their natural gas customers 
these pscw issues will be the subject of additional hearings in these issues are of particular interest to larger customers 
the mpsc initiated a similar process to address gas industry restructuring by forming a committee of interested parties to consider changes in the gas cost recovery mechanism  service unbundling  curtailment issues  and storage issues 
in june  the committee is expected to furnish the mpsc with a report identifying issues and recommending restructuring alternatives 
as a result of the changes occurring in the electric industry  several mergers have been announced in the region  and are in the process of seeking regulatory approval 
wpsc is currently investigating the need for environmental cleanup of eight manufactured gas plant sites which it previously operated 
wpsc engaged an environmental consultant to develop cleanup cost estimates for the seven sites at which either a phase i or phase ii site investigation had been completed 
the estimated cleanup cost ranges in current dollars for each of the seven sites are green bay from to million  two rivers from to million  oshkosh from to million  marinette from to million  sheboygan i from to million  sheboygan ii from to million  and stevens point from to million 
the estimates assume excavation of contaminated soils  thermal treatment of soils  disposal of treatment residuals  on site groundwater extraction  and treatment and post cleanup monitoring for years 
the cost estimates for six of the sites green bay  two rivers  oshkosh  marinette  sheboygan i  and sheboygan ii assume  in addition to those items previously noted  removal and disposal of contaminated river sediments 
the consultant has yet to perform a detailed investigation of the menominee site  therefore  comparable information on this site is not available 
wpsc used the estimate for the stevens point site as a basis for making a projection of to million on cleanup costs at the menominee site 
both sites are relatively small and are not located adjacent to rivers 
the range of future investigation and cleanup costs for all eight sites is estimated to be from million to million 
remediation expenditures would be made over the next years 
wpsc has recorded a liability with an offsetting regulatory asset  which represents wpsc s current estimate of cleanup costs for all eight sites 
the liability represents a million increase from the december  estimate of million as a result of information obtained in the new studies 
based on discussions with regulators and a recent rate order in wisconsin  management believes that these costs but not the carrying costs associated with the amounts expended will be recoverable in future customer rates after the amounts are expended 
as additional investigations and initial remedial actions are completed  these estimates may be adjusted and these adjustments could be significant 
other factors that can affect these estimates are changes in remedial technology and regulatory requirements 
the estimates presented above do not take into consideration any recovery from insurance carriers or other third parties which wpsc is pursuing 
due to the anticipated regulatory treatment  adjustments to the estimated liability do not have an immediate impact on net income 
in addition  wpsc has been notified that it is a minor participant in a number of waste disposal site cleanup efforts 
however  no significant costs are anticipated to clean up these sites 
federal clean air act amendments the act were enacted in the act establishes stringent sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission limitations 
wisconsin previously had enacted laws to limit sulfur emissions 
today  wpsc meets the sulfur dioxide emission standards scheduled to take effect in the year as a result of switching to lower sulfur fuels 
however  some additional capital expenditures will be required to upgrade existing equipment and to monitor emission levels 
these expenditures are estimated to be in the range of to million between and in  wpsc initiated a new demand side management dsm program which involves loans and shared savings 
prior to  dsm expenditures were recovered from all customers 
the new program provides that those who benefit from energy saving programs will finance them 
as of december   wpsc had million of deferred dsm expenditures which will be recovered in future customer rates 
the kewaunee nuclear power plant kewaunee is operated by wpsc 
wpsc has a ownership interest in kewaunee which it owns jointly with two other utilities 
kewaunee is operating with a license which expires in operating and maintenance costs at kewaunee have been reduced more than over the last three years 
continued reduction of costs  while not sacrificing safety and reliability  is planned to keep kewaunee cost competitive 
the nrc recently rated kewaunee superior category in all areas maintenance  operations  engineering  and plant support 
the steam generator tubes at kewaunee are susceptible to corrosion characteristics seen throughout the nuclear industry 
during the first quarter of  kewaunee was shutdown for scheduled maintenance and refueling 
inspection of the steam generators revealed increased levels of tube degradation 
prior to the shutdown  the equivalent of approximately of the tubes in the steam generators were plugged with no loss of capacity 
when the plant was returned to service in may  approximately of the tubes were plugged  resulting in an initial capacity reduction of approximately 
approximately half of this lost capacity has been recovered through operating modifications 
the ultimate small reduction in capacity did not affect earnings in because of operating and maintenance cost savings and capacity recovery efforts at kewaunee 
as a result of the need to keep kewaunee cost competitive and to address the repair or replacement of the steam generators  the owners of kewaunee have been and are continuing to evaluate various alternatives to deal with the potential future loss of capacity resulting from the continuing degradation of the steam generator tubes 
as part of this evaluation  the following actions are being taken a a request has been submitted to the nrc to redefine the pressure boundary point of the repaired steam generator tubes sleeved tubes  which have been removed from service by plugging  in order to allow the return of many of the sleeved tubes to service 
if the request is granted  and even if additional degraded tubes would be discovered during the next planned shutdown in the fall of  kewaunee should be able to return to near full capacity at that time 
b a request will be submitted to the nrc to allow the owners to pursue welded repair technologies to repair existing sleeved tubes in an effort to return plugged tubes to service 
although welded tube repair technologies exist  such technologies have not yet been approved by the nrc 
c continuing evaluations are being performed with respect to the economics of replacing the steam generators 
replacement of steam generators is estimated to cost approximately million  exclusive of additional purchase power costs associated with an extended shutdown 
d wpsc is evaluating the need to accelerate the collection of funds for decommissioning and the recovery of existing investment 
wpsc believes kewaunee can remain cost competitive and generate economically until the expiration of the operating license in  but that it is probable that this cannot be achieved without replacement of the steam generators 
there are many uncertainties which may impact the future operations of kewaunee such as steam generator tube damage and degradation rates  development of repair technologies  regulatory approvals  and changes in power generation economics which can lead to continued repair strategies  a steam generator replacement decision  or a decision to retire kewaunee earlier than the year as operator of kewaunee and based on our current view of future energy prices  wpsc believes it is prudent to seek prompt regulatory approval to replace the steam generators 
a consensus in this regard has not been reached with the other owners of kewaunee and will be the subject of further discussion 
steam generator replacement  in the opinion of wpsc management  would reduce the financial risks that would be associated with an unplanned shutdown due to continued steam generator degradation 
impact of inflation current financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and report operating results in terms of historic cost 
they provide a reasonable  objective  and quantifiable statement of financial results  but they do not evaluate the impact of inflation 
under rate treatment prescribed by the utility s regulatory commissions  projected operating costs are recoverable in revenues 
because forecasts are prepared assuming inflation  the majority of inflationary effects on normal operating costs are recoverable in rates 
however  in these forecasts  wpsc is only allowed to recover the historic cost of plant via depreciation 
although new rates will not be implemented in due to the new two year rate order policy in the wisconsin jurisdiction  management believes inflation will be offset by the impact of customer growth and increased productivity
