interest income and resultant yield information in the table are on a taxable equivalent basis using an assumed tax rate of 
yields and amounts earned include loan fees 
non accrual loans have been included in interest earning assets for purposes of these computations 
net interest income is the largest single component of the company s earnings and represents the difference between interest income received on loans and other earning assets and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings 
net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  was million in  a decrease of million or from as summarized on table  the million decrease in net interest income for consisted of a million increase in interest income that was offset by a million increase in interest expense 
the million increase in interest income on interest earning assets was primarily due to a million  or  increase in the average balance of interest earning assets 
the average balance of loans increased by million  or  to  million 
the increase in the average balance of loans was due primarily to a growth in mortgage loans  which increased by million during to million 
the average yield on interest earning assets increased to compared to in  and in table summarizes the dollar effect of the volume increase in interest earning assets  which had a million positive effect on net interest income  supplemented by the million positive effect of the increase in the average yield on interest earning assets 
the million increase in interest paid on interest bearing liabilities was primarily due to a million  or  increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities 
the increase in interest bearing liabilities was primarily due to an increase in time deposits 
also contributing to the increase in interest expense was an increase in the average cost of funds that increased to in compared to in the basis point increase in the average cost of funds in was due a higher use of time deposits which had an average cost of 
the volume and rate growth in interest bearing liabilities increased interest expense by million and million  respectively 
in and  the increase in net interest income of million and million  respectively  was attributed to the growth in average interest earning assets  which fully offset an increase in average interest bearing liabilities 
the increase in interest income and expense in was due to the april acquisition of the association and the reflection of its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in the company s operating results 
provision and allowance for loan losses the amount of the allowance for possible loan losses is based on periodic evaluations by management 
in these evaluations  management considers numerous factors including  but not limited to  current economic conditions  loan portfolio composition  prior loan loss experience and management s estimation of potential losses 
these various analyses lead to a determination of the amount needed in the allowance for possible loan losses 
to the extent the existing allowance is below the amount so determined  a provision is made that will bring the allowance to such an amount 
thus  the provision for loan allowance may fluctuate and may not be comparable from year to year 
the company s allowance for possible loan losses increased to million at december   from million in and million in allowances for possible loan losses as a percentage of period end total loans was at december   compared to and at and the increase in the allowance for loan losses from to was primarily due to the association allowances of million included in the year end balances 
effective january   the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan sfas 
the adoption of this accounting policy had no material effect on the consolidated financial statements of the company 
at december   the recorded investment in loans that are considered to be impaired under sfas was million 
included in this amount is million of impaired loans of which the related allowance for credit losses is million and million of impaired loans that do not have an allowance for credit losses see note e of notes to consolidated financial statements

the million increase in other operating expenses in was due primarily to an increase of million in other operating expenses from the association 
other operating expenses of the association were included for all of  whereas  in  the association s expenses were incurred only from the april  acquisition date of the association 
total compensation expense  which comprises the largest category of other operating expenses  increased by million in to million

on january   the company announced a major initiative to further improve operating efficiency and decrease expenses by offering a voluntary separation program to all employees 
the program offers all eligible employees the opportunity of electing to terminate their employment 
the company has the right to deny or delay an employee s election 
the voluntary separation program is the first phase of a cost reduction plan 
if the response to this first phase is not sufficient to achieve the company s goals  phase ii will be implemented which will incorporate executive pay reductions of up to and involuntary staff reductions

liquidity management the primary objective of liquidity management is to maintain a balance between sources and uses of funds in order that the cash flow needs of the company are met in the most economical and expedient manner 
the liquidity needs of a financial institution require the availability of cash to meet the withdrawal demands of depositors and the credit commitments of borrowers 
in order to optimize liquidity  management monitors and forecasts the various sources and uses of funds in an effort to continually meet the financial requirements of the company and the financial needs of its customer base 
to ensure liquidity on a short term basis  the company s primary sources are cash or cash equivalents  loan repayments  proceeds from the sale of assets available for sale  increases in deposits  proceeds from maturing securities and  when necessary  federal funds purchased and credit arrangements with correspondent banks and the fhlb 
maturities of investment securities are also structured to cover large commitments and seasonal fluctuations in credit arrangements 
the consolidated statement of cash flows summarizes the sources and uses of cash from operating  investing and financing activities for the three years ended december  the following discussion is based on the aforementioned statement of cash flows included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
cash provided by operating activities during was million compared to and million for and  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities consists primarily of the company s net income from operations 
investing activities reduced cash flow by million during  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the primary use of cash flow for investing activities in was for the million net increase in loans 
cash flow provided from financing activities was million during  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
during  there was an million net increase in deposits  offset by a million net decrease in short term borrowings 
as of december   the bank and association had available unused credit lines of million from the fhlb and committed available lines of credit of million from other sources 
at any time the company has outstanding commitments to extend credit 
see note o of notes to consolidated financial statements 
asset liability management asset liability management involves the maintenance of an appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities to reduce interest rate exposure while also providing liquidity 
the company s management has placed an increased emphasis on interest rate sensitivity management 
interest earnings assets and interest bearing liabilities are those which have yields or rates which are subject to change within a future time period due to either the maturity of the instrument or changes in the rate environment 
gap refers to the difference between the rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities 
when the amount of rate sensitive assets is in excess of rate sensitive liabilities  a positive gap exists  and when the opposite occurs  a negative gap exists 
generally  when rate sensitive assets exceed rate sensitive liabilities  the net interest margin is expected to be positively impacted during periods of increasing interest rates and negatively impacted during periods of decreasing interest rates 
interest rate shifts  resulting from movements in the economic environment  can cause interest sensitive assets and liabilities to reprice within relatively short time frames 
as a result  major fluctuations in net interest income and net earnings could occur due to imbalances between rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
asset liability management seeks to protect earnings by maintaining an appropriate balance between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in order to minimize fluctuations in the net interest margin and net earnings in periods of volatile interest rates 
the company s policy is to closely match its level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities within a limited range  thereby reducing its exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
in connection with these asset and liability management objectives  various actions have been taken  including changes in the composition of assets and liabilities  and the use of financial instruments 
the financial instruments used and their notional amounts outstanding at year end were as follows december  dollars in thousands interest rate swaps pay receive fixed swaps notional amount    average receive rate average pay rate under interest rate swaps  the company agrees with other parties to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the agreed notional amount 
interest rate contracts are primarily used to convert certain deposits and long term debt to floating interest rates or to convert certain groups of customer loans and other interest earning assets to fixed rates 
certain interest rate swaps specifically match the amounts and terms of particular liabilities 
see note n of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion and disclosure of financial instruments 
the table on the following page sets forth information concerning interest rate sensitivity of the company s consolidated assets and liabilities as of december  assets and liabilities are classified by the earliest possible repricing date or maturity  whichever comes first 
in the case of amortizing assets such as mortgage loans  for example maturities are reflected in terms of the expected principal repayment streams  based upon scheduled amortization and anticipated prepayments 
prepayments are estimated using current market expectations for assets with interest rates at similar levels to the company s 
it should be noted that while the company s investment portfolio is classified according to repricing or maturity  most of the portfolio is available for sale 
this will provide the company with the flexibility to restructure the portfolio if it wishes to in the face of a changing interest rate environment 
further note should be taken of the short term classification of most of the company s savings deposits 
in fact  although technically immediately repriceable  most of these deposits are considered to be relatively insensitive to changes in market interest rates

bank holding companies are also required to comply with risk based capital guidelines as established by the federal reserve board 
risk based capital ratios are calculated with reference to risk weighted assets which include both on and off balance sheet exposures 
a company s risk based capital ratio is calculated by dividing its qualifying capital the numerator of the ratio by its risk weighted assets the denominator 
the minimum required qualifying total capital ratio is 
as of december   the company s total capital to risk adjusted assets ratio was 
effects of inflation the financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
virtually all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rate changes have a more significant impact on the company s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
recent regulatory developments effective january  deposit insurance premiums for most banks insured by the bank insurance fund bif dropped to zero  but those for savings associations insured by the savings association insurance fund saif remained unchanged at to cents per of domestic deposits 
this disparity is the direct result of the over capitalization of bif and the serious under capitalization of saif 
this disparity in deposit insurance premiums raises obvious issues relating to the competitiveness of institutions subject to the saif premiums  as well as the possibility that saif insured institutions could convert or otherwise move their deposits to bif insured institutions 
legislation currently pending calls for the recapitalization of saif through a one time assessment of approximately cents per in deposits at saif insured institutions 
while the legislation is currently stalled in budget negotiations  such an assessment would amount to approximately million for the association 
other changes proposed in this area include adding approximately cents per of domestic deposits to the deposit insurance costs of bif insured banks in order to make the financing corp 
bond payments which stem from bonds issued in to recapitalize the thrift insurance fund 
this legislation could have significant effects on the company  the bank and association 
effects of changes issued by the financial accounting standards board in november  the financial accounting standards board issued a special report which permitted institutions to reclassify investment securities under sfas accounting and reporting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  which the company had adopted effective january   without tainting the investment portfolio 
investment securities with an amortized cost of million were transferred from held to maturity to available for sale with the related net unrealized gain of million recorded as a separate component of equity 
the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas  no 
 accounting for mortgage servicing rights sfas and no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
these standards are effective for the company s year end and are described further in note u of notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of sfas  and is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s operating results or financial position
