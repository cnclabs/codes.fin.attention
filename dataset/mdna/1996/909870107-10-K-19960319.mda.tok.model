life insurance general regulation 
uclic is subject to regulation by the state of louisiana  its state of domicile  and the other states in which it transacts business 
the laws of such states are designed for the protection of policyholders rather than securityholders 
uclic is a member of a holding company system in louisiana 
all transactions within a holding company system affecting insurers must be both reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate for its needs 
state laws also require prior notice or regulatory agency approval of changes in control of an insurer or its holding company and of material intercorporate transfers of assets within the holding company structure 
generally  under insurance holding company statutes  a state insurance authority must approve in advance the direct or indirect acquisition of or more of the voting securities of an insurance company chartered in its state 
the laws of the various states establish regulatory agencies with broad administrative powers to approve policy forms  grant and revoke licenses to transact business  regulate trade practices  license agents  and prescribe the type and amount of investments permitted 
insurance companies are required to file detailed annual statements with the state insurance regulators in each of the states in which they do business  and their business and accounts are subject to examination by such agencies at any time 
in addition  insurance regulators periodically examine the insurer s financial condition  adherence to statutory accounting practices  and compliance with insurance department rules and regulations 
as part of their routine regulatory oversight process  state insurance departments conduct detailed examinations periodically generally once every three years of the books  records and accounts of insurance companies domiciled in their states 
such examinations are generally conducted in cooperation with the departments of two or three other states under guidelines promulgated by the national association of insurance commissioners naic 
uclic s last examination occurred during for the three year period ended december  final reports issued by the louisiana commissioner of insurance did not raise any significant issues or adjustments 
regulation at federal level 
although the federal government generally does not directly regulate the insurance business  federal initiatives often have an impact on the business in a variety of ways 
current and proposed federal measures that may significantly affect the insurance business include limitations on antitrust immunity  minimum solvency requirements and the removal of barriers restricting banks from engaging in the insurance and mutual fund business 
congress has from time to time in the past considered possible legislation that would adversely affect the federal income tax treatment of certain annuity products offered by uclic 
there can be no assurance that future tax legislation will not contain provisions that may result in adverse effects on uclic s products 
competition as a marketer of credit and annuity products  the company faces intense competition 
traditional competitors in the financial services business include other mortgage banking companies  commercial banks  credit unions  thrift institutions  credit card issuers and finance companies 
competitors in the annuity business include an increasing number of insurance companies which have begun to offer annuity products 
many of these competitors in the financial services and annuity business are substantially larger and have more capital and other resources than the company 
competition can take many forms including convenience in obtaining a loan or annuity  customer service  marketing and distribution channels and interest or crediting rates 
in addition  the current level of gains realized by the company and its existing competitors on the sale of its and their non conventional loans could attract additional competitors into this market with the possible effect of lowering gains on future loan sales as the result of increased loan origination competition

the table below sets forth income from continuing operations before income taxes for each of the company s business segments and certain home equity loan data for the indicated periods year ended december  dollars in thousands mortgage    life insurance    corporate  other operations and eliminations    total    home equity loan production    home equity loans sold    weighted average interest spread retained on home equity loans sold the following summary identifies the major factors which influenced the results of operations of the company s primary operating divisions during the indicated periods 
mortgage 
the company s mortgage operations primarily consist of the production by origination or purchase  sale and servicing of first mortgage  non conventional  home equity loans 
in the fourth quarter of  the company expanded its lending operations to include additional manufactured housing loan products 
fundamental to the profitability and funding of the company s mortgage operations is the sale of loans with servicing rights retained 
the majority of the revenue of the mortgage segment is derived from gain recognized on the sale of loans and the recognition of net loan fees at the time of sale of the loans 
net loan fees on loans owned by the company are recognized over the lives of the loans 
prior to  the company had either held the home equity loans it originated in its own portfolio or sold them to financial institutions 
since the fourth quarter of  the company has pooled and sold large numbers of loans in mortgage backed securitization transactions 
in late and  this was accomplished primarily through private placement transactions 
in  the company began selling its loans in public securitization transactions through its own shelf registration statement and sold publicly billion  million and million of home equity loans during  and  respectively 
the company s mortgage operations are interest rate sensitive and  therefore  fluctuations in and the level of interest rates can have a variety of effects on the company s profitability 
in particular  significant changes in interest rates may impact the volume of loans produced  and will influence the funding costs of such production and the amount of gain recognized on loans sold in the secondary market 
during periods of declining interest rates the mortgage operations will generally experience an increase in profitability as the interest spread should widen both on loans held by the company as an investment and on loans sold in the secondary market 
during  the positive effect on income of the mortgage operations resulted primarily from a wider interest margin retained on loans sold than experienced in and the weighted average interest spread on loans sold to third parties the difference between the stated rate on the loan and the rate paid to purchasers  less recurring fees was in  declined to in and increased to in due to changes in the interest rate environment 
the weighted average interest spread on loans sold is determined without regard to credit losses  which are provided for separately by the company 
the lower interest spread on loans sold during and was somewhat offset by an increased volume of loans produced and sold 
although historically a lower interest rate environment has not resulted in a significant increase in the level of prepayment of loans originated and serviced by the company  a significant and sustained reduction in interest rates could cause prepayments to increase  and thereby result in a contraction of the amount of loans owned and serviced and an accelerated amortization of capitalized excess servicing income 
increased prepayments reduce the time period during which the company receives excess servicing income and other servicing income with respect to prepaid loans 
increased amortization of capitalized excess servicing income is a current charge to earnings 
likewise  if delinquencies or liquidations were to occur sooner in the portfolio of loans sold by the company and or with greater frequency than was initially assumed  capitalized excess servicing income amortization would occur more quickly than originally anticipated  which would have an adverse effect on servicing income in the period of such adjustment 
in contrast  an increase in the level of interest rates for an extended period of time could adversely affect the ability of the company to originate loans  as well as the profitability of the loan origination program  by increasing the cost of funding and reducing the interest spread on loans retained and loans sold 
if actual prepayments with respect to loans sold occur more slowly than estimated at the time of sale  total income would exceed previously estimated amounts  however  no adjustments would be made to capitalized excess servicing income on the company s consolidated balance sheet as such income would be recognized prospectively 
for further discussion of loan sale gains and capitalized excess servicing income see note to notes to the consolidated financial statements 
life insurance 
united companies life insurance company uclic  the company s wholly owned life insurance subsidiary  has focused its efforts on expanding its annuity product line and its distribution network of financial institutions and independent general agents 
on february   the company entered into an agreement to sell all of the outstanding capital stock of uclic 
the proposed sale is subject to approval of the company s shareholders and regulatory authorities and the satisfaction of certain other conditions 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
in  annuity sales were million compared to million in the company believes that the decrease in annuity sales in is due in part to the interest rate environment  particularly the relative relationships between short term and intermediate term interest rates  and to the focus of uclic s resources on development of its variable annuity product 
in addition  a financial institution which produced approximately of uclic s annuity sales in discontinued the sale of annuities for uclic in subsequent to the merger of such financial institution 
uclic focused in and on expanding the independent general agents share of its distribution network  which agents sold approximately of the total dollar amount of annuities written in compared to in and in as with the company s mortgage operation  fluctuations in and the level of interest rates also impacts the operations of uclic 
the average spread on the annuity business was  and during  and  respectively 
surrenders of annuity policies increased in and compared to due in part to the continued reduction in interest crediting rates on new and existing annuity contracts and to a rising interest rate environment and an increase in the number of annuity contracts which were beyond the surrender penalty period 
at december   the weighted average rating of the publicly traded bond portfolio was aa  the amortized cost of assets allocated to investments in investment grade fixed maturity securities was million or of the portfolio and in investment grade mortgage backed securities was million or of the portfolio 
at december  the amortized cost of uclic s holdings of non investment grade bonds was million or of the portfolio 
uclic s invested assets also include residential and commercial real estate mortgages originated and serviced by united companies lending corporation uclc  however  the percentage of assets invested in mortgage loans in recent years has been reduced primarily as the result of their disfavor with insurance regulatory authorities and rating agencies 
the annuities sold by uclic are monetary in nature and therefore sensitive to changes in the interest rate environment 
profitability of uclic is directly affected by its ability to invest annuity premiums at yields above the interest crediting rates on the related policy liabilities 
one of the primary financial objectives of uclic is to effectively manage this interest spread over time in changing interest rate environments 
this is accomplished in part by adjusting the interest crediting rate paid on its existing and new annuity policies 
during periods of declining interest rates  the fair value of uclic s investments  primarily fixed maturity investments  increases  however  yields earned on investments made during such periods decline 
in contrast  during periods of rising interest rates the fair value of the investment portfolio declines and the risk of policy surrenders increases 
an unanticipated increase in surrenders would impact the company s liquidity  potentially requiring the sale of certain investments prior to their maturities  which may be at a loss 
reserves for annuity policies constitute the company s primary liabilities 
the duration of these liabilities is affected by a number of factors  including interest rates  surrender penalties  ratings  public confidence in the insurance industry generally and in uclic specifically  governmental regulations and tax laws 
since insurance commissions incurred at the origination of annuity policies are generally deferred and recognized over the estimated life of the policies  any unexpected increase in surrenders of annuity contracts would require more rapid recognition of these expenses  thereby adversely impacting profitability 
discontinued operations 
ugtic united general title insurance company 
on april   the company made a decision to dispose of its investment in united general title insurance company ugtic  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  and  on may   approved a formal plan of disposal 
the decision to dispose of ugtic was independent of the consummation of the sale thereof pursuant to the definitive stock sale agreement signed on august  as a result  the operations of ugtic have been classified as discontinued operations  and  accordingly  the consolidated financial statements and the related notes of the company segregate continuing and discontinued operations 
the sale was concluded on february  the definitive stock sale agreement provided for the sale of of the stock of ugtic and contains a provision making the company liable to ugtic for claims from defalcations and fraud losses incurred by ugtic which are unknown and occur prior to closing and are discovered within months thereafter 
the company is also liable  up to million  for policy claims paid over a ten year period after closing that exceed certain specified levels 
the company recorded a loss from discontinued operations net of income tax benefit of million in in connection with the sale of ugtic 
ugtic was formed in in part to compliment the company s mortgage operations  however  underwriting of affiliated transactions represented only approximately of ugtic s business in and at december  ugtic was licensed in states  was represented by approximately independent general agents and had no direct operations 
key markets for ugtic are colorado  louisiana  florida and california 
during  and  title insurance premiums were million  million and million  respectively 
during and  ugtic experienced a net loss of million and million  respectively  compared to net income of 
million in operations in suffered severely as the result of claims related to agency defalcations 
in addition to the incurred losses  the profitability of ugtic in was negatively impacted by a million increase in its reserve for policy losses 
foster mortgage corporation on may   the company decided to divest its subsidiary foster mortgage corporation fmc 
as of november   the servicing rights owned by fmc  which constituted substantially all of its assets  were sold 
on december   the institutional lenders under fmc s primary credit facility the fmc institutional lenders filed a petition in the us bankruptcy court to cause the remaining affairs of fmc to be concluded under the supervision of the bankruptcy court 
the fmc institutional lenders filed and the bankruptcy court approved a plan of liquidation for fmc providing for the appointment of a trustee selected by the fmc institutional lenders

the company is generally obligated to advance interest on delinquent loans to the investor or holder of the mortgage backed security  as the case may be  at the pass through rate until satisfaction of the note  liquidation of the collateral or charge off of the delinquent loan 
at december  the company owned approximately million of commercial loans which were on an accrual status  but which the company considers as potential problem loans  compared to million and million at december  and  respectively 
the company evaluates each of these commercial loans to estimate its risk of loss in the investment and provides for such loss through a charge to earnings 
loan sale gains were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
loan sale gains approximate the present value for the estimated lives of the loans of the excess of the contractual rates on the loans sold over the sum of the pass through rate paid to the buyer  a normal servicing fee  a trustee fee  a surety bond fee  if any  in mortgage backed securitization transactions  and an estimate of future credit losses 
the increase in the amount of loan sale gains was due primarily to a million and a million increase in the amount of loans sold during and  respectively 
excess servicing income retained by the company ie  the stated interest rate on the loan less the pass through rate and the normal servicing fee and other applicable recurring fees decreased in compared to but increased in compared to interest spread retained by the company on loans sold includes the normal servicing fee 
during  guidelines were established which defined an industry accepted normal servicing fee as basis points for servicing b and c quality home equity loans  such as those originated by the company 
as the result of this industry data  the company  effective july   implemented a servicing fee rate in its loan securitization transactions of basis points 
this resulted in an increase in the amount of loan sale gain recognized on the home equity loans sold compared to previous securitization transactions which included a servicing fee rate of basis points 
in addition  as further discussed in note  during the third quarter of  the company implemented a new accounting pronouncement related to mortgage servicing rights on loans originated by the company 
the implementation of the pronouncement increased loan sale gains by approximately million during loan sale gains during were reduced by the use of higher prepayment assumptions  primarily related to adjustable rate mortgage loans  in calculating the gain on sale of loans compared to prior years 
the impact of the change in assumptions reduced loan sale gains by approximately million 
in addition  loan sale gains during were reduced by approximately million as the result of the utilization of interest hedge mechanisms to protect the company against an increase in market interest rates on the pass through certificates sold in the second quarter of securitization transaction 
the reduction in income resulted from a decline in interest rates prior to the pricing of this securitization transaction 
the following table presents information regarding home equity loan sale transactions for the periods indicated 
year ended december  dollars in thousands home equity loans sold    average coupon on home equity loans sold weighted interest spread retained on home equity loans sold home equity loan sale gains    fluctuations in and the level of market interest rates will impact the interest spread retained by the company on loans sold  and  potentially  the amount of its loan sale gains 
an increase in the level of market interest rates will generally adversely affect the interest spread on loans sold  whereas such interest spread generally widens during a declining interest rate environment 
the effect of actions which may be taken by the company during a rising interest rate environment to mitigate the impact on earnings of fluctuations in market rates  such as increasing the coupon rate charged on its loan products  will generally lag the impact of market rate fluctuations 
in connection with loan securitization transactions  the company has used a prefunding feature which locks in the pass through rate that the company will pay to the investor on a predetermined amount of loans for future delivery 
the company is obligated for the difference between the earnings on the prefunded amount and the pass through interest paid to the investor during the period from the date of the closing of the securitization transaction until the date of delivery of the loans

this adjustment offset the impact of an increase of approximately million in the average amount of home equity loans serviced by the company for third parties during compared to the same period of as discussed above  the industry accepted normal servicing fee was defined during the second quarter of as basis points 
effective july   the company reduced its estimate of normal servicing fee and began using basis points in computing loan sale gains 
the reduction in the normal servicing fee for home equity loans from to basis points has the impact of increasing current revenues loan sale gains while reducing future revenues loan servicing income 
the following table reflects the components of loan servicing income for the periods indicated

net insurance premiums reflect revenues associated primarily with credit insurance underwritten by uclic 
the decrease in premium income is primarily the result of the impact of uclic s decision to discontinue sales of credit insurance products

the following table presents the components of the company s expenses for the periods indicated 
year ended december  in thousands interest on annuity policies    personnel    interest    loan loss provision    insurance commissions    insurance benefits    other operating    total    interest on annuity policies increased million during compared to  primarily as the result of a million increase in average annuity reserves 
the decline in interest on annuity policies of million in compared to resulted primarily from a reduction in the average interest crediting rate on the company s annuity policies 
average annuity reserves were billion during and and billion during personnel expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in personnel costs are primarily associated with the expansion of the company s mortgage operations  including start up costs for the manufactured housing lending program  loan production related incentives and an increase in the cost of the company s employee benefit and incentive plans 
insurance commissions for  and were million  million and million  respectively

the declining trend of insurance benefits resulted from a reduction in benefits associated with ordinary life and credit insurance products 
the company s loan loss provision was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the fluctuation in the level of the company s provision for loan losses is attributed in part to increases and decreases in the amount of loans owned by the company during the respective periods 
during  the amount of loans owned by the company declined by approximately million compared to the amount of loans owned during increased million compared to interest expense for increased approximately million compared to primarily as the result of an increase in the weighted average interest rate charged on debt and an increase in the average amount of debt outstanding

the values of and markets for these assets are dependent on a number of factors  including general economic conditions  interest rates and governmental regulations 
adverse changes in such factors  which become more pronounced in periods of economic decline  may affect the quality of these assets and the company s resulting ability to sell these assets for acceptable prices 
general economic deterioration can result in increased delinquencies on existing loans  reductions in collateral values and declines in the value of investments resulting from a reduced capacity of issuers to repay the bonds 
loans 
substantially all of the loans owned by the company were produced through the company s branch ie  retail network or wholesale loan programs 
in connection with its origination of home equity loans  the company relies on specified underwriting and credit review procedures  a mortgage on the borrower s residence and  in some cases  other security  and  in its retail origination program  contact with borrowers through its branch office system to manage credit risk on its loans 
in addition to servicing the loans owned by the company  the mortgage division serviced approximately billion in loans for third parties at december   billion of which are home equity loans 
substantially all of the home equity loans serviced for third parties were publicly sold as mortgage backed securities pass through certificates 
the purchasers of the pass through certificates receive a credit enhanced security which is achieved in part through a guaranty provided by a third party insurer and by subordinating the excess interest spread retained by the company to the payment of scheduled principal and interest on the certificates 
the company has  from time to time  used the financial guaranty insurance company fgic and mbia insurance corporation mbia as third party insurers 
the subordination of the excess interest spread retained by the company relates to credit losses which may occur after the sale of the loans and continues until the earlier of the payment in full of the loans or termination of the agreement pursuant to which the loans were sold 
if cumulative payment defaults exceed the amount subordinated  the third party insurer is obligated to pay any further losses experienced by the owners of the pass through certificates 
the company is also obligated to cure  repurchase or replace loans which may be determined after the sale to violate representations and warranties relating to them and which are made by the company at the time of the sale 
the company regularly evaluates the quality of the loan portfolio and estimates its risk of loss based upon historical loss experience  prevailing economic conditions  estimated collateral value and such other factors which  in management s judgment  are relevant in estimating the credit risk in owned and or serviced loans 
estimated losses on the owned portfolio are provided for by an increase in the allowance for loan losses through a charge to current operating income 
at december   the company s allowance for loan losses was million 
for loans sold  the company reduces the amount of gain recognized on the sale by the estimated amount of credit losses  and records such amount on its balance sheet in the allowance for loss on loans serviced 
at december   the allowance for loss on loans serviced was million 
the maximum recourse associated with sales of home equity loans according to terms of the loan sale agreements totaled approximately million  of which amount approximately million relates to the subordinated cash and excess interest spread 
should credit losses on loans sold materially exceed the company s estimates for such losses  such consequence will have a material adverse impact on the company s financial statements 
at december   the contractual balance of loans serviced was approximately billion comprised of approximately million serviced for the company and approximately billion serviced for investors 
the portfolio is geographically diversified 
although the company services loans in states  at december  a substantial portion of the loans serviced were originated in florida  ohio and louisiana  respectively  and no other state accounted for more than of the serviced portfolio 
included in the serviced portfolio are commercial loans originated by the company  a substantial portion of which were originated in florida  georgia and colorado and no other state accounted for more than of the commercial loans serviced 
the risk inherent in such concentrations is dependent not only upon regional and general economic stability which affects property values  but also the financial well being and creditworthiness of the borrower 
the following table provides a summary of loans owned and or serviced which are past due days or more  foreclosed properties and loans charged off as of the dates indicated

the balance of foreclosed home equity loans owned and or serviced as a percentage of the home equity loans owned and or serviced was  and at december   and  respectively 
the above delinquency and loan loss experience represents the company s recent experience 
however  the delinquency  foreclosure and net loss percentages may be affected by the increase in the size and relative lack of seasoning of a substantial portion of the portfolio 
in addition  the company can neither quantify the impact of property value declines  if any  on the home equity loans nor predict whether to what extent or how long such declines may exist 
in a period of such declines  the rates of delinquencies  foreclosures and losses on the home equity loans could be higher than those theretofore experienced in the mortgage lending industry in general 
adverse economic conditions which may or may not affect real property values may affect the timely payment by borrowers of scheduled payments of principal and interest on the home equity loans and  accordingly  the actual rates of delinquencies  foreclosures and losses 
as a result  the information in the above tables should not be considered as a basis for assessing the likelihood  amount or severity of delinquencies or losses in the future on home equity loans and no assurance can be given that the delinquency and loss experience presented in the tables will be indicative of such experience on home equity loans 
a summary analysis of the changes in the company s allowance for loan losses and the allowance for loss on loans serviced is shown in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

as of december   million was available and no amounts were outstanding under the investment bank warehouse 
the company expects to have facilities similar to the investment bank warehouse available in conjunction with its future securitizations 
the following discussion reflects the primary sources of liquidity and capital for each of the company s primary operating divisions 
mortgage 
the principal cash requirements of the company s mortgage operations arise from loan production  deposits to reserve accounts  repayments of intercompany debt borrowed under the company s senior notes  payments of operating and interest expenses  and income taxes related to loan sale transactions 
loan production is funded principally through proceeds from the issuance of the company s senior notes  short term bank facilities and warehouse facilities pending loan sales 
substantially all of the loans originated or acquired by the company are sold 
net cash used by operating activities of the company in and  respectively  reflects approximately billion and million  respectively  in cash used for loan originations and acquisitions 
the primary source of funding for loan originations is derived from the reinvestment of proceeds from the ultimate sale of loans in the secondary market which totaled approximately billion and million in and  respectively 
in connection with the loan sale transactions in the secondary market  third party surety bonds and cash deposits by the company as credit enhancements were provided 
the loan sale transactions required the subordination of certain cash flows payable to uclc and its subsidiaries to the payment of principal and interest due to certificate holders 
in connection with these transactions  uclc has been required  in some instances  to fund an initial deposit  and thereafter  in each transaction  a portion of the amounts receivable by uclc and its subsidiaries from the excess interest spread has been required to be placed and maintained in a reserve account to the extent of the subordination requirements 
the subordination requirements generally provide that the excess interest spread is payable to a reserve account until a specified level of cash  which is less than the maximum subordination amount  is accumulated therein 
the capitalized excess servicing income of the company is subject to being utilized first to replenish cash paid from the reserve account to fund shortfalls in collections from borrowers who default on the payment of principal or interest on the loans underlying the pass through certificates issued until the total of the company s deposits into the reserve account equal the maximum subordination amount 
in connection with the issuance and sale of approximately billion of pass through certificates through december   the subordination amounts aggregate approximately million 
after the company s deposits into the reserve account equal the maximum subordination amount for a transaction  the subordination of the related excess interest spread including the guarantee fee payable therefrom for these purposes is terminated 
the excess interest spread required to be deposited and maintained in the respective reserve accounts will not be available to support the cash flow requirements of the company until such amount exceeds the maximum subordinated amount other than amounts  if any  in excess of the specified levels required to be maintained in the reserve accounts  which may be distributed periodically to the company 
at december   the amounts on deposit in such reserve accounts totaled million 
life insurance 
the principal cash requirement of uclic consists of contractual obligations to policyholders  principally through policy claims and surrenders 
the primary sources of funding these obligations  in addition to cash flow from investments  are the sale of annuities 
net cash flow from annuity operations is used to build an investment portfolio  which in turn produces future cash flows from investment income and provides a secondary source of liquidity for this division 
net cash provided by operating activities of the insurance division which excludes annuity sales and surrenders in and was approximately million and million  respectively  resulting primarily from cash earnings on investments 
the company monitors available cash and cash equivalents to maintain adequate balances for current payments while maximizing cash available for longer term investment activities 
the company s financing activities during and reflect approximately million and million  respectively  in cash received primarily from sales by uclic of its annuity products 
the company believes that the decrease in annuity sales is due in part to the interest rate environment  particularly the relative relationship between short term and intermediate term interest rates  and to the focus by uclic on development of its variable annuity product 
in addition  a financial institution which produced approximately of uclic s annuity sales in discontinued the sale of annuities for uclic in subsequent to the merger of such financial institution 
as reflected in the net cash used by investing activities during the same periods  investment purchases were approximately million and million  respectively  reflecting the investment of these funds and the reinvestment of proceeds from maturities of investments 
cash used by financing activities during these twelve month periods also reflects payments of million and million primarily on annuity products resulting from policyholder surrenders and claims 
the increase in annuity surrenders during was expected  due in part to an increase in the amount of annuity policies which were beyond the surrender penalty period 
should annuity surrenders continue to exceed annuity sales  such consequence will decrease the liquidity of uclic and potentially result in the sale of certain assets  such as bonds and loans  prior to their maturity  which may be at a loss 
uclic s investments at december   included approximately million in residential and commercial mortgage loans  and the amortized cost of its bond portfolio included million in corporate and government bonds and private debt placements and million in mortgage backed securities 
as a louisiana domiciled insurance company  uclic is subject to certain regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends 
uclic had the capacity at december  to pay dividends of million 
uclic did not pay any dividends to the company during  or in order to retain capital in uclic 
pending sale of uclic 
on february   the company signed a stock purchase agreement the agreement dated as of january   for the sale of all of the outstanding capital stock of uclic to uc life holding corp  a new delaware corporation formed by knightsbridge capital fund i  lp for an aggregate amount of million plus earnings of uclic from january   to closing of the transaction 
knightsbridge  which is a private investment partnership with institutional partners  was formed in to make equity investments in companies engaged primarily in the life insurance industry 
under the terms of the agreement  the sales price is comprised of cash currently estimated to be million and uclic real estate and other assets to be distributed to the company prior to the closing 
the real estate to be distributed includes portions of the united plaza office park  including the company s home office 
in addition  the company will purchase a convertible promissory note from an affiliate of the purchaser for million in cash 
the note matures in years and bears interest at a rate of per annum payable at maturity 
the company does not expect the sale of uclic to have a material effect on net income 
the purchaser also agreed that uclic would continue to be an investor in first lien home equity loans originated by the company s lending operations and that uclic s home office operations would be maintained in its present location in baton rouge  louisiana following the closing for at least two years 
the agreement is subject to approval by ucfc s shareholders and regulatory authorities and the satisfaction of other conditions  and provides that the closing will occur on or before july  ratings the company
