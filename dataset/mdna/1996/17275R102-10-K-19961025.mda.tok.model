comparison of and net sales grew to  million in from  million in the increase in net sales during the year was primarily a result of increasing unit sales of the cisco series  continued strong sales of access business unit products  including the cisco and cisco series  and continued market acceptance of the company s workgroup business unit products  particularly the catalyst in connection with the acquisition of stratacom  inc  the company formed the wan business unit  which consists of the ipxo  bpx  igx and axis product lines 
sales of these products increased from levels primarily because of an increase in demand for asynchronous transfer mode atm cell switching products by public carrier customers 
these increases were partially offset by decreasing unit sales of the company s older product lines  comprising mainly the cisco series 
sales to international customers were of net sales in compared with in this increase is attributable to continued expansion into new geographic markets  as well as growth in existing european and japanese markets 
sales growth between and increased more substantially in japan than in any other geographical markets 
gross margins decreased to of net sales in from in gross margins were affected by several factors  including higher material costs as a result of certain component shortages and the continued shift in revenue mix to the company s lower margin products consisting primarily of products in the access and workgroup business units 
the prices of component parts have fluctuated in the recent past  and the company expects that this trend may continue 
an increase in the price of component parts may have a material adverse impact on gross margins 
the company expects that gross margins will continue to decrease in the future  because it believes that the market for lower margin remote access and high speed switching products will continue to increase at a faster rate than the market for the company s higher margin router products 
the company is attempting to offset this trend through various means  such as emphasizing software content  increasing the functionality of its products  controlling warranty and royalty costs  and improving manufacturing efficiencies 
there can be no assurance that any efforts made by the company in these and other areas will successfully offset decreasing margins 
research and development expenses increased in by million over expenditures 
this represents an increase to of net sales from in the increase reflects the company s ongoing research and development efforts  including the further development of ciscofusiono architecture  as well as the acquisition of technologies to bring a broad range of products to the market in a timely fashion 
a significant portion of the increase was due to the addition of new personnel  both from hiring and through acquisitions  as well as higher expenditures on prototypes and depreciation on new equipment 
all of the company s research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
the company is primarily developing new technologies internally  and because of this  research and development as a percentage of sales is expected to increase 
if the company believes it is unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner  it may acquire other businesses or license technology from other businesses as an alternative to internal research and development 
sales and marketing expenses increased by million in over  but decreased to of net sales in from of net sales in the dollar increase in these expenses resulted mainly from an increase of approximately  employees in the size of the company s direct sales force  and its commissions 
other factors affecting the dollar increase in expenses were additional marketing programs  such as ciscoproo  to support the launch of new products  the entry into new markets as noted by the significant percentage increase in business outside the us  and expansion of distribution channels  particularly the two tier channel associated with the company s initial efforts to reach the mass market 
general and administrative expenses rose by million in over  a slight increase to from of net sales in versus the dollar increase reflects increased personnel costs necessary to support the company s business infrastructure  the amortization of goodwill related to the acquisition of lightstream  and a one time write down of million of lightstream goodwill 
there were also non recurring costs related to the acquisition of stratacom which totaled million for fiscal excluding the effect of these non recurring costs  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales declined to  which reflects management s continued controls over discretionary spending 
the company is continuously evaluating potential acquisition candidates as part of its growth strategy and incurs legal  accounting  and other related costs associated with this activity 
it is management s intent to keep general and administrative costs relatively constant as a percentage of net sales  however  this goal is dependent upon the level of acquisition activity  among other factors 
the amount expensed to purchased research and development in fiscal year reflects the acquisition of lightstream see note 
interest and other income  net  was million in and million in interest income rose as a result of additional investment income on the company s increasing investment balances 
the company currently holds approximately million shares of common stock in a publicly traded company with a cost basis significantly below its current market value 
beginning in fiscal year  the company expects to begin selling its equity stake in this company 
as a result  interest and other income may increase materially in the next fiscal year versus fiscal financial risk management as a global concern  the company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial results 
presently  the company s primary exposures relate to the us dollar value of non dollar denominated sales in japan  canada  and australia and non dollar denominated operating expenses in europe  latin america  and asia where the company sells primarily in us dollars 
at the present time  the company hedges only those currency exposures associated with certain non functional currency assets and liabilities and does not generally hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
the company maintains investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types  and maturities 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale  and consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of shareholders equity 
the company also has certain real estate lease commitments with payments tied to short term interest rates 
given the current profile of interest rate exposures  a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the market value of the company s investment portfolio while increasing the costs associated with its lease commitments 
the company does not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 
recent accounting pronouncements during march  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  which requires the company to review for impairment of long lived assets  certain identifiable intangibles  and goodwill related to those assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in certain situations  an impairment loss would be recognized 
sfas no 
will be effective for the company s fiscal year the company has studied the implications of the statement  and based on its initial evaluation  does not expect it to have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations upon adoption 
during october  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement  which establishes a fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation plans  also permits an election to continue following the requirements of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  with disclosures of pro forma net income and earnings per share under the new method 
the company is required to adopt sfas no 
by fiscal  and  upon adoption  will elect to continue to measure compensation cost for its employee stock compensation plans using the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by apb opinion no 
pro forma disclosure of net income and earnings per share will reflect the difference between compensation cost included in net income and the related cost measured by the fair value based method defined in sfas no 
 including tax effects that would have been recognized in the consolidated statement of operations if the fair value based method had been used 
future growth subject to risks the internetworking business is highly competitive  and as such  the company s growth is dependent upon market growth and its ability to enhance its existing products and introduce new products on a timely basis 
one of the ways the company has addressed and will continue to address the need to develop new products is through acquisitions of other companies 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in assimilation of the operations  technologies  and products of the acquired companies  risks of entering markets in which the company has no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
the company must also maintain its ability to manage any such growth effectively 
in particular  this would include potential growth associated with the stratacom acquisition 
the company has not completed an acquisition and integration of a company of stratacoms size to date 
this process could divert management s attention from normal daily operations of the business 
failure to manage growth effectively and successfully integrate stratacom or other acquisitions made by the company could adversely affect the company s business and operating results 
the company s growth and ability to meet customer demand also depend in part on its ability to obtain timely supplies of parts from its vendors 
while lead times for commodity components have improved recently  some components  particularly proprietary application specific integrated circuits asics and other networking specific components  continue to be in short supply 
an inability to obtain these items at reasonable prices could have a materially adverse effect on the company s growth and operating results 
the markets for the company s products are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions  and evolving methods of building and operating networks 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner  or that products and technologies developed by others will not render cisco s products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
the failure of cisco s new product development efforts could have a material adverse effect of cisco s business operating results and financial condition 
the company expects that  in the future  its net sales may grow at a slower rate than was experienced in previous periods and that on a quarter to quarter basis  the company s growth in net sales may be significantly lower than its historical quarterly growth rate 
in and  the company s lead times for certain products and backlog increased 
if manufacturing lead times are not reduced  the company s customers may cancel orders or not place further orders if shorter lead times are available from other manufacturers 
each year  with the exception of fiscal years and  the company has generally had one quarter of a fiscal year when backlog has been reduced 
traditionally  this has occurred in the third quarter of each year 
while such a reduction did not occur in the past two fiscal years  such reductions are extremely difficult to predict and may occur in the future 
in addition  in response to customer demand  the company has  from time to time  reduced its product manufacturing lead times  which resulted in corresponding reductions in order backlog 
to the extent that backlog levels decline during any particular period  it could result in more volatility and less predictability in the company s quarter to quarter net sales and operating results 
the company also expects that gross margins may be adversely affected by increases in material or labor costs  heightened price competition  and changes in channels of distribution or in the mix of products sold 
in particular  the company broadened its product line by introducing network access products 
sales of these products  which are generally lower priced and carry lower gross margins than the company s core products  have increased more rapidly than sales of the core products 
the introduction of the ciscopro line during  as well as the increasing growth rates experienced in the switching markets  may accelerate this trend 
the company also expects that its operating margins may decrease as it continues to hire additional personnel and increases other operating expenses to support its business 
the results of operations for fiscal are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods  and the company s operating results may be subject to quarterly fluctuations as a result of a number of factors 
these factors include the integration of people  operations  and products from acquired businesses and technologies  especially stratacom  increased competition in the internetworking industry  the overall trend toward industry consolidation  the introduction and market acceptance of new products  including high speed switching and atm technologies  variations in sales channels  product costs  or mix of products sold  the timing of orders and manufacturing lead times  and changes in general economic conditions  any of which could have a material adverse impact on operations and financial results 
in april  the company announced an agreement with the state of california and the city of san jose that provides for the acquisition of approximately acres of land located in northeast san jose subject to certain conditions 
the transaction is valued at approximately million  with the counterparties providing approximately million in infrastructure and improvements 
the company anticipates that this site will accommodate its growth for the next five years 
certain legal challenges were raised subsequent to the announcement of the agreement that may impact the company s ability to complete this acquisition 
although there are alternative sites  they may not be as cost effective or suitable for the company s needs 
the company s inability to successfully purchase this land may impede it from having facilities adequate to meet future demand 
the company s corporate headquarters  including most of its research and development operations and its manufacturing facilities  are located in the silicon valley area of northern california  a region known for seismic activity 
operating results could be materially affected by a significant earthquake 
comparison of and net sales grew to  million in from  million in the increase in net sales during the year was primarily a result of increasing unit sales of the cisco  the cisco  and the cisco series  greater market acceptance of atm wan switching products  sales of new products including the cisco  and the initial market acceptance of the company s high speed switching products 
these increases were partially offset by decreasing unit sales of the company s older product lines  comprising the ags as well as the cisco and cisco series 
sales to international customers were of net sales in compared with in this moderate increase reflects the company s continued expansion into new geographic markets 
gross margins increased to of net sales in from in gross margins improved as a result of several factors  including lower material costs achieved through volume and prompt payment discounts  certain manufacturing overhead efficiencies  and a decrease in warranty expenses 
this improvement was partially offset by the continued shift in revenue mix to the company s lower margin remote access products 
research and development expenses increased million in over  an increase to of net sales in from in the increase reflected the company s ongoing research and development efforts  including the further development of its ciscofusion architecture  as well as the acquisition of technologies to bring a broad range of products to market in a timely fashion 
a significant portion of the increase was due to the addition of new personnel  primarily from hiring and to a lesser extent through acquisitions  as well as higher material costs for prototypes and depreciation on new equipment 
sales and marketing expenses increased million in over  an increase to of net sales from 
the increase in these expenses resulted from an increase in the size of the company s direct sales force and its commissions  additional marketing programs to support the launch of new products  the entry into new markets both domestic and international  and expansion of distribution channels 
general and administrative expenses rose million in  a slight decrease to from of net sales 
the increase in the dollar amount of these expenses reflects increased personnel costs  implementation of the company s new information system  and the amortization of goodwill since the date of the acquisition of the assets and assumption of the liabilities of lightstream see note 
the amount expensed to purchased research and development related to the acquisition of the assets and assumption of the liabilities of lightstream see note interest and other income  net  was million in and million in interest income rose as a result of higher average investment balances in versus liquidity and capital resources cash  short term investments  and investments were  million at july   an increase of million from the increase reflects cash generated by operations and  to a lesser extent  the exercise of employee stock options 
this increase was partially offset by capital expenditures of approximately million and by the repurchase of million of common stock during the year 
the company entered into an agreement to purchase telebit corporation for million in cash  it anticipates that it will make the disbursement in the first quarter of fiscal accounts receivable rose during  while sales grew by 
days sales outstanding in receivables were days at the end of the year versus days at july  inventories increased by in compared with because of production planning associated with higher sales levels and desired manufacturing lead times  particularly on new products 
the growth in inventory in recent quarters may result in future write downs due to obsolescence if the company does not correctly anticipate market demand for certain products 
at the same time  the company recognizes that it must maintain strategic levels of components to ensure its manufacturing lead times will remain competitive 
as such  the company may carry more inventory than it has historically 
accounts payable increased by in compared to because of increases in operating expenses and material purchases to support the growth in net sales 
the increase in accrued payroll and related expenses can be attributed to a increase in personnel during the year 
other accrued liabilities increased by over  primarily because of increases in deferred service contract revenues  as well as accruals made for merger related costs associated with the stratacom acquisition 
at july   the company had a line of credit totaling million  which expires april there have been no borrowings under this agreement 
the company has entered into certain lease arrangements in san jose  california  and research triangle park  north carolina  where it has established its headquarters operations  certain research and development  and customer support activities 
in connection with these transactions  the company pledged million of its investments as collateral for certain obligations of the leases 
the restricted investments balance will continue to increase as the company continues to expand its operations at these and other possible lease sites 
under the company s stock repurchase program  shares have been purchased periodically to meet employee stock plan requirements 
on october   the company terminated its share repurchase program 
approximately million shares of common stock have been repurchased by the company since the original authorization of the program in august the company s management believes that its current cash and equivalents  short term investments  line of credit  and cash generated from operations will satisfy its expected working capital and capital expenditure requirements through fiscal
