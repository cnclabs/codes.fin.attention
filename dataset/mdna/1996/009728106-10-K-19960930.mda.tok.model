item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements 
results of operations net sales the company s consolidated net sales declined to million in compared to the prior year 
this follows a increase in the prior year as compared with the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  net sales by segment  excluding intersegment sales years ended june in millions ophthalmic distribution injectable distribution contract manufacturing total net sales ophthalmic distribution sales include a broad range of therapeutic  diagnostic  surgical and office based products 
ophthalmic distribution sales declined in as compared to and increased in as compared to the decline in sales for is attributable primarily to two factors 
these include the loss of sales for ak con a  the company s previously best selling allergy product  and the discontinuance of certain discounting practices with wholesalers in the fourth quarter of as previously announced  ak con a was converted to over the counter status by the fda  which required the filing of a nda 
sales of ak con a were discontinued in october  pending fda approval of the nda 
the company received approval of the otc version of the product in january the otc version is being marketed through a joint venture with pfizer inc pfizer 
royalties earned under this joint venture totalled  in fiscal sales of ak con a were approximately million and million  respectively  in and in the fourth quarter of  the company discontinued the practice employed by the ophthalmic division of giving discounts to wholesalers at the end of every quarter 
the company was willing to forego the additional sales in the quarter to try to maintain margins at an acceptable rate in the future 
because of the discontinuance of this practice  the company estimates that sales for the quarter and fiscal year ended june  were negatively impacted by approximately million 
excluding the effects of the loss of ak con a and the discontinuance of the wholesaler discounting practice  sales for the ophthalmic segment were relatively flat 
continued erosion of generic pricing along with some product shortages have offset sales increases in other products during the company continues to experience increases in its sales of surgical products which includes surgical instruments and surgical packs 
the surgical products area will continue to be a major focus for the ophthalmic segment since margins are generally higher than for generic pharmaceuticals and sales are controlled more directly by physicians  a customer base which has been traditionally a strength for akorn 
in  ophthalmic distribution sales were enhanced by sales of ak con a  the introduction of several new surgical products  including new surgical instruments and surgical packs  and sales of the company s generic therapeutic products 
injectable distribution sales attributable to prl  which was acquired by the company on may  in a pooling of interests transaction declined in as compared to and increased in as compared to the current year decline is primarily attributable to delays in new product introductions and additional competition on a few of the company s injectable products 
the sales increase in is primarily attributable to an expanded offering of certain grandfathered products  including this segment s lead product for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis 
in addition  in  the company established several marketing alliances which gave it an entree into the group purchasing organization gpo market for injectables 
contract manufacturing sales were relatively flat in versus and increased in as compared to contract sales for were enhanced by a new contract from janssen pharmaceutica  inc janssen  which increased sales significantly beginning in the second half of fiscal sales to janssen accounted for and of consolidated net sales in and  respectively 
janssen had recently notified the company that it would be transferring the production of certain products during fiscal and to its own facilities in puerto rico 
such products accounted for million and million in contract manufacturing sales for and  respectively 
effective july   janssen agreed to transfer to the company ownership of three injectable products in the analgesia anesthesia area  two of which previously had been produced for janssen by taylor  but which janssen had determined to discontinue 
these products accounted for approximately million and million in sales for taylor in and  respectively 
the acquisition of these products should help maintain plant volume and provide the injectable distribution segment with two highly recognized products 
income and expenses the following table sets forth the relationship to sales of various income statement items years ended june net sales cost of goods sold gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses research and development acquisition and severance costs operating income interest and other income expense  net 


income before income taxes income taxes 

net income gross margins the consolidated gross margin percentage declined by percentage points from in to in the decline in gross margins is primarily due to continued price pressure in the ophthalmic generic pharmaceuticals area due to competition  as well as the loss of the the company s high margin sales of ak con a 
in addition  lower plant throughput  primarily in the second half of fiscal  resulted in margin declines for the contract manufacturing segment 
also  in the second half of fiscal  the company increased its estimate for unsaleable inventory by approximately  in the quarter ended june   the company increased its estimate for wholesaler chargebacks by approximately  these changes in estimate are reported as a decrease in gross margin 
excluding these changes  the gross margin for was  a percentage point decline from the gross margin percentage declined percentage points from in to in the decline in gross margin percentage in is primarily due to the effects of price increases from manufacturers primarily in the second half of the fiscal year  which were not fully offset by price increases to customers 
in addition  a shift in the mix of lower margin catalog products added to the decline in gross margin 
the decline in gross margin was more prevalent in the second half of the fiscal year as a result of the loss of sales from ak con a discussed earlier 
the company anticipates that gross margins will continue to be impacted by price erosion on generic pharmaceuticals 
however  with anticipated growth in certain higher margin niche products  the company s overall gross margins should remain relatively stable during as the injectable segment begins the marketing of more commodity generic products  overall company margins are expected to decline beyond selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales declined percentage points from in to in in the quarter ended march   the company decided to no longer pursue andas for several ophthalmic products which had been produced in previously owned facilities 
this decision was based on the cost of the andas versus the future incremental profit to be derived from the sales of these products  given changed market conditions 
this change in estimate was also based on the company s recent decision to enter into the injectable distribution marketplace and the need to redeploy r d resources for the pursuit of injectable andas 
the total amount of the accrual reversed was approximately  and is included as a reduction in s  g a expenses 
during the quarter ended march   the company  based on evaluations made by management  changed the estimated liability related to aged customer credits 
this resulted in a reduction in s  g a expenses of approximately  the decline in s  g a expenses as a percentage of net sales  in spite of the decrease in sales from to  is primarily due to the decision to eliminate approximately million to million of s  g a expenses and other manufacturing operating expenses in response to a slowing in sales growth during the third quarter of fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales declined percentage points from in to in primarily due to the company s operating leverage and the increase in net sales from to research and development research and development expense increased in as compared to this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in r d associated with the recently acquired operations of prl 
prior to fiscal  prl had very little r d expense 
research and development expense was relatively flat in as compared to in  the company maintained a stable mix of new ophthalmic andas and site transfers from its previous manufacturing facility in los angeles 
throughout and the first half of  the company incurred r d costs associated with its nda for the over the counter version of ak con a in connection with the licensing arrangement with pfizer 
this nda was approved in january costs associated with this nda have been capitalized in connection with the long term contract for manufacturing and royalty rights 
the company also continued its work on an nda for the ophthalmic non steroidal anti inflammatory drug piroxicam licensed from pfizer 
the first million of costs associated with this nda are offset by funds obtained from pfizer 
total cash expenditures for all research and development activities were approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
with the acquisition of prl  the company expects to increase its mix of injectable grandfathered and anda products 
prl had several anda filings in process through joint venture arrangements 
it is anticipated that these arrangements would continue and that the company would also continue to develop other injectable products for manufacture by taylor 
several of the products currently marketed and distributed by the injectable distribution segment do not require fda approval and production of such products will be transferred to the taylor facilities as soon as practicable 
in addition to injectable and ophthalmic andas  the company will continue its work on the ophthalmic nda for piroxicam 
the remaining number of products in the r d pipeline which are being transferred from the company s previous manufacturing site in los angeles is minimal at june  the costs associated with these products had been previously accrued 
accordingly  as the mix of transfer products declines  r d expense will increase  given a level amount of r d expenditures 
due to the factors noted above  it is anticipated that the company s r d expenditures will increase in however  the level of r d will continue to be monitored in light of operating performance 
acquisition and severance costs in connection with the merger of prl and taylor  the company recorded certain charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal for transaction costs  and transitional costs  associated with the realignment of the company into two separate reporting divisions 
the transaction costs include legal  accounting and other directly related acquisition costs 
transitional costs consist primarily of provisions for severance related costs 
operating income operating income in of million or of sales was lower than operating income of million 
the decline in operating income for is attributable to several factors noted above 
these include acquisition and severance costs  the loss of high margin sales of ak con a  the company s decision to discontinue wholesaler discounting practices in the fourth quarter  and the changes in estimate noted above 
in addition  the overall reduction in gross margins for the company  primarily associated with increased price sensitivity for ophthalmic generic pharmaceuticals  reduced operating margins 
operating income in was million or of sales compared to the amount of million or of sales 
the increase in operating income was primarily the result of increased sales and operating leverage  coupled with stable research and development expenses 
the sales increase was somewhat offset by the decline in gross margin resulting from cost increases of products distributed but not manufactured and continued price sensitivity in the generic ophthalmic pharmaceutical market 
interest and other income expense net interest and other expense declined  from to during these periods  interest income remained relatively constant 
interest expense increased significantly in to  as compared to  in most interest expense in was capitalized in connection with construction at taylor s facilities in decatur  illinois 
the increase in interest expense in was offset by a gain on the sale of marketable equity securities of  in  a  decline in market value of an equity investment was determined to be other than temporary 
this determination was based on the significant deterioration in the value of the investment and the evaluation that a price recovery was not imminent 
from to  net interest and other expense increased  during these periods  interest income remained relatively constant 
interest expense declined in from  to  as noted above  the majority of interest expense in was capitalized 
the loss of  related to the decline in market value of an equity investment more than offset the decline in interest expense 
the company anticipates that interest expense will increase significantly in as a result of the new long term debt associated with the janssen product acquisition and anticipated capital improvements 
a portion of this interest is expected to be capitalized during during validation and construction periods 
income taxes the company s consolidated effective income tax rate was  and for  and  respectively 
the effective rate for varies from the statutory rates primarily due to the inclusion of net income for prl prior to the acquisition date as a result of the pooling of interests 
prl was a subchapter s corporation and therefore was not subject to corporate income taxes 
the effects of pre acquisition earnings or loss of prl did not have a material effect on the or effective rate since such income or loss was immaterial to consolidated pretax income 
the effective rate for varies from the statutory rates primarily due to the effects of adoption of statement of financial accounting standards board sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  effective july  under sfas  the company was able to recognize estimated future tax benefits attributable to expenses recorded for book purposes but not currently deductible for tax purposes 
in july  the company recorded a net deferred tax asset in the amount of  along with a valuation reserve to reflect the uncertainties surrounding the ultimate realization of the benefits 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company decided to reverse the entire remaining balance of the valuation reserve since uncertainties regarding the ultimate realization of the benefits were reduced to a relatively low level 
this resulted in the recording of a  
cents per share benefit in the fourth quarter 
the company has been in discussions with the internal revenue service irs regarding the examination of tax returns for the periods of through the irs has proposed adjustments to such returns  some of which the company has agreed to and some which the company has appealed 
these adjustments primarily relate to the timing of deductions taken for tax purposes in connection with the reorganization of its manufacturing operations in and the agreed upon adjustments  which resulted in additional interest and taxes of approximately  was paid in fiscal through a bank line of credit 
the company had previously accrued the financial statement effects of these agreed upon adjustments  accordingly  no material financial statement impact of these adjustments was recorded in or with respect to the appealed items  the company does not anticipate any adverse financial statement effect as accruals for these assessments have been previously recorded 
net income net income declined million or 
cents per share from million or 
cents per share in the decline in sales along with certain unusual  infrequently occurring adjustments noted previously  including acquisition and severance costs  and certain other changes in accounting estimates  are the primary reasons for the decline in net income 
net income increased  or 
cent per share from million or 
cents per share in to million or 
cents per share in this marginal increase  in spite of the significant increase in operating income in  is due to the lower effective tax rate incurred in as a result of the adoption of sfas and full realization of the benefit of deferred tax assets 
financial condition and liquidity management assesses the company s liquidity by its ability to generate cash to fund its operations 
the significant components in managing liquidity are funds generated by operations  levels of working capital items including accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable  capital expenditure and debt repayment requirements  adequacy of available lines of credit  and availability of long term capital at competitive prices 
the company traditionally has generated cash from operations in excess of working capital requirements 
the net cash provided by operating activities was  in compared to  in and million in the decline in cash provided from operating activities in and is primarily related to the increase in inventory associated with new product additions and a continual increase in the amount of products produced in house which require akorn to inventory related raw materials and components 
also in  the majority of new contract manufacturing business requires that the company inventory raw materials and components 
in  cash provided from operations was also negatively impacted by a decrease in the average days outstanding for payables 
this decline was due to more timely payments to vendors by the company resulting from the availability of working capital credit lines 
in  the company will continue to fund the payment of certain previously accrued research and development activities including the site transfer of andas from the company s los angeles facility and the development of the nda for piroxicam discussed previously 
management believes that cash flows from operations  funds received from pfizer and the available working capital line of credit are sufficient to handle these short term needs 
in addition to these short term needs  the company may be required to make payments of additional interest and taxes in connection with the ongoing appeal resulting from the examination by the irs of tax returns for the periods of through if unsuccessful in its appeal  the company could be liable for additional interest and taxes currently due of approximately  the tax portion of the appeal items would be offset by deferred tax assets  the interest portion of the appeal items is sufficiently reserved for in the financial statements 
the company continues to challenge the findings of the irs through the appeals process 
payment of the remaining unsettled issues will be based on the timing of the appeals process and the success of the company in arguing its position

these additions were partially funded by net sales of investments of  in addition  net cash utilized for investing activities includes approximately  related to product licensing costs 
the company has plans for capital improvements of million to million in these improvements are for both requirements to meet current fda and dea regulations as well as upgrades to the company s managment information systems 
these improvements are expected to be financed through bank financing  of which approximately million is currently available under previously approved construction lines of credit 
on july   the company acquired certain high speed inspection equipment and the rights to two injectable products in the anesthesia analgesia area from janssen 
the total acquisition cost includes million  which was funded primarily through a million bank credit facility 
in addition  the company is required to provide other products to janssen  at no cost  estimated not to exceed  should certain contingent events occur 
net cash provided by financing activities of approximately million in primarily consists of the net increase in short term borrowings 
increases in long term debt were offset by debt service requirements 
also  in  proceeds from the exercise of options provided  in cash  while dividends representing pre merger subchapter s earnings totalling  were paid to the former shareholders of prl 
on september   the company entered into a million credit facility with first national bank of commerce in new orleans fnbc 
this facility was amended in may which increased the total facility to include the following million term loan for the payout of existing debt and reimbursement for the early payout of a capital lease on the taylor manufacturing facility
