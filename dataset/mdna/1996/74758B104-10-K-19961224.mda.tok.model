item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the five year summary at selected financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
annual results the following table sets forth certain financial data from the consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated 
years ending september  total revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses operating income loss other income interest  net income loss before provision benefit for taxes provision benefit for taxes net income loss the company has derived revenues principally from product revenues and technology development and license revenues  as illustrated in the table below years ending september  in thousands net product revenues    technology development and license revenues from related parties total revenues    acquisition of business on february  the company acquired certain assets of awa microelectronics pty 
ltd 
awam  a subsidiary of awa limited  based in sydney  australia 
the awam assets that were acquired by a new subsidiary of the company  quality semiconductor australia  pty 
ltd 
qsa  included a fully operational wafer foundry business and product design center 
in a separate agreement  the company has also signed a strategic alliance agreement with awa limited  to jointly develop new products and technologies 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method 
the net purchase price of the awam facility was million  consisting of million cash  million present value of redeemable preference shares  of qsa fair value of warrants of  and acquisition costs of approximately  the allocation of the purchase price  based upon an independent valuation  consisted of million of net tangible assets and million of intangible assets which were related to assembled workiforce  customer base  and goodwill  which are being amortized over five years 
as of september   the company had incurred approximately  of amortization expense 
awa limited was issued  redeemable preferred shares at an issue price of  per share 
the shares may be put by awa limited back to qsa beginning july  pursuant to the terms of a put option deed dated january  these redeemable preference shares of qsa have been categorized as debt on the balance sheet and discounted to the present value 
between july and july  the company will make the final payment of a minimum of approximately million up to a maximum of approximately million 
qsa s results of operations have been included in the consolidated results of operations since the date of acquisition 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
total revenues total revenues in fiscal were million  decreasing by over total revenues in fiscal this compares with an increase of total revenues of in fiscal over fiscal net product revenues were up by in fiscal over fiscal the decrease in year over year total revenues was mainly due to a substantial decline in the overall average selling prices partially offset by sales for qsa 
the company expects that the average selling prices of its products generally will continue to decline over the lives of such products 
sales of interface logic devices are expected to continue to account for a significant majority of net product revenues in the foreseeable future 
to increase revenues  the company seeks to increase unit sales of existing products  principally by reducing prices  and to introduce and sell new products 
no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful 
as is common in the semiconductor industry  the company sells a significant portion of its products through distributors 
domestic distributors accounted for approximately   and of the company s total product revenues during fiscal  and  respectively 
sales by arrow electronics inc accounted for approximately   and of total product revenues during fiscal  and  respectively  and the remainder of domestic distributor sales were made primarily through bell microproducts inc bell and nu horizons electronics corp 
the relationship with bell was terminated in fiscal and the company replaced bell with bell industries  inc late in the year 
recognition of sales to distributors and the related cost of sales is deferred until such distributors resell the products to their customers 
there can be no assurance that future sales by distributors will continue at the present levels 
the loss of one or more distributors could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company has received technology development and license revenues from it s wafer fabrication suppliers in connection with certain new product development projects and licenses for qcmos process technology and certain product designs 
technology development and license revenues  which included cash payments and the market value of free wafers provided to the company  constituted of the net revenues in fiscal there was no technology development and license revenue in fiscal and although the company may accept business involving technology development and license revenues  the company does not expect these revenues to constitute a significant portion of net revenues in future periods 
export sales  primarily consisting of sales to countries in europe and the far east  constituted  and of net product revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
gross margin on product revenue the following table sets forth the company s net product revenues and product gross margin years ended september  in thousands  except percentage data net product revenues    cost of product revenues    product gross margin    product gross margin a percentage of net product revenues the company s cost of product revenues includes the cost of wafer fabrication  assembly performed by third party vendors  testing by third party vendors and direct and indirect costs associated with the testing  procurement  scheduling and quality assurance functions performed by the company 
gross margin in fiscal was of net product revenues  compared with of net product revenues in fiscal  and of net product revenues in the decline from fiscal to in gross margin resulted principally from the recording of  in inventory write downs resulting from changes in the product mix and reduced oem demand 
additionally  gross margin was impacted by lower average selling prices  changes in product mix  lower oem demand and absorption of fixed costs at qsa 
this margin erosion was offset in part by the company s cost reduction programs 
the decline in gross margin from fiscal to primarily reflects increased costs resulting from the unfavorable exchange rate on yen based wafer purchases  changes in product mix and lower average selling prices which were partially offset by cost reductions 
the company purchases some of its wafers in yen denominated transactions and is subject to exchange rate risk 
the company attempts to manage its exposure to this risk by entering into forward exchange contracts to hedge its yen denominated firm purchase commitments 
the company s quarterly revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary substantially from quarter to quarter in the future 
the company s operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors  many of which are outside of the company s control  including but not limited to  economic conditions and overall market demand in the united states and worldwide  the company s ability to introduce new products and technologies on a timely basis  changes in product mix  fluctuations in manufacturing costs which affect the company s gross margins  declines in market demand for the company s and its customers products  sales timing  the level of orders which are received and can be shipped in a quarter  the cyclical nature of both the semiconductor industry and the markets addressed by the company s products  product obsolescence  price erosion  and competitive factors 
the company s operating results in fiscal are likely to be affected by these factors as well as others 
the company must order wafers and build inventory well in advance of product shipments 
because the company s markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes  there is a risk that the company will forecast incorrectly and produce excess or insufficient inventories of particular products 
this inventory risk is heightened because many of the company s customers place orders with short lead times 
in the third quarter of fiscal these factors caused the company to have a million inventory writedown 
these factors increase not only the inventory risk but also the difficulty of forecasting quarterly operating results 
moreover  as is common in the semiconductor industry  the company frequently ships more product in the third month of each quarter than in either of the first two months of the quarter  and shipments in the third month are higher at the end of that month 
the concentration of sales in the last month of the quarter contributes to the difficulty in predicting the company s quarterly revenues and results of operations 
the company s products are in various stages of their product life cycles 
the company s success is highly dependent upon its ability to develop complex new products  to introduce them to the marketplace ahead of the competition  and to have them selected for design into products of leading system manufacturers 
these factors have become increasingly important to the company s results of operations because the rate of change in the markets served by the company continues to accelerate 
since product life cycles are continually becoming shorter  revenues may be affected quickly if new product introductions are delayed or if the company s products are not designed into successive generations of products of the company s customers 
the company s gross margins also will depend on the company s success at introducing and ramping production of new products quickly and effectively because the gross margins of semiconductor products decline as competitive products are introduced 
also  the company must deliver product to customers according to customer schedules 
delays in new product introductions could affect revenues and gross margins for current and follow on products if customers shift to competitors to meet their requirements 
as a result of the above factors  gross margin fluctuations are difficult to predict  and there can be no assurance that the company will maintain gross margins at current levels in future periods 
to offset this margin pressure  the company seeks to reduce costs by improving wafer yields  negotiating price restrictions with suppliers  and achieving economies of scale by means of higher production levels 
the company also seeks to offset margin erosion by selling a higher percentage of new products  which tend to have higher margins than more mature products 
no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful 
research and development the company s research and development activities include process development and new product development 
research and development expenditures in fiscal were million  or of total revenues  compared with million  or of total revenues in fiscal  and million  or of total revenues in fiscal this increase in fiscal was mainly the result of costs associated with the development of new products and processes and the added costs of the development group located at qsa 
the company believes that the continued development of its process technology and new products is essential to its success and is committed to continue its investment in research and development to maintain a strong technological position in the industry 
no research and development expense has been capitalized 
the company currently expects to incur higher research and development expenses in fiscal the company believes that future product revenue growth will depend in substantial part on the success of new products and the continued success and sales of existing products 
new products are generally incorporated into a customer s product or system at the design stage 
however  design wins  which can often require significant expenditures by the company  may precede the generation of volume sales  if any  by a year or more 
no assurance can be given that the company will achieve design wins or that any design win will result in significant future revenues 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenditures in fiscal were million  or of total revenues  compared with million  or of total revenues in fiscal  and million  or of total revenues in fiscal sales and marketing expenditures in fiscal increased slightly from fiscal due to increases in advertising and promotional expenses  payroll related expenses and travel  partially offset by lower sales commissions 
the sales and marketing expense increase in fiscal was due primarily to increased commission expense resulting from higher revenues in fiscal the company expects to incur higher sales and marketing expenses in fiscal  although these expenses are expected to decrease as a percentage of revenues 
however  there can be no assurance that the revenues will grow at the same rate as expenditures for sales and marketing are incurred 
general and administrative general and administrative expenditures in fiscal were million  or of total revenues  compared with million  or of total revenues in fiscal  and million  or of total revenues in fiscal general and administrative expenditures in fiscal increased mainly due to the added costs of the australian subsidiary  and legal costs related to patent prosecution and defense 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal were due mainly to costs associated with being a public company and compensation expenses 
the company expects to incur higher general and administrative expenses in fiscal  although these expenses are expected to decrease as a percentage of revenues 
however  there can be no assurance that revenues will continue to grow at the same rate as expenditures for general and administrative expenses are incurred 
other income other income of million in fiscal was earned as a result of engineering and marketing services provided by the company pursuant to an agreement with awa limited 
the company has completed the services under the agreement with awa limited and does expect this other income to continue in future periods 
interest  net net interest income in fiscal was  compared to  in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was mainly due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments used for the purchase of awam assets in february and increased interest expense associated with notes payable for the purchase of capital equipment and interest expense incurred with the redeemable preference shares issued to awam 
the net interest income of  in fiscal was mainly due to interest earned on the proceeds from the company s initial public offering in november as compared to net interest expense of  in fiscal due primarily to interest on leases and other long term obligations 
provision benefit for taxes the company recorded a tax benefit for its fiscal losses based on available carryback potential 
the company s effective tax rate was  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal was due primarily to the recognition of deferred tax assets previously subject to valuation allowances 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources since its inception  the company has financed its operations and investment in property  plant and equipment primarily through the sale of equity securities  debt issuance and technology development and license fees 
total assets increased million to a total of million at year end 
cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments decreased million  accounts receivable increased  property and equipment  net increased million  and goodwill and other assets increased million  current liabilities increased million  long term obligations to a related party increased to million  deferred tax liabilities increased million  and shareholders equity decreased  the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments was primarily due to cash paid for the acquisition of certain assets of awam of million  cash used in operating activities of  and million utilized for the purchase of wafer fabrication equipment at qsa and other capital equipment purchased during fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the proceeds utilized for the purchase of the wafer fabrication equipment was partially offset by the receipt of million from notes payable issued to a related party million recorded as long term debt at september  
see note and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable increased at september  mainly due to a greater portion of net revenues generated in the last month of the fourth quarter as compared to fiscal the increase in other assets was primarily due to the allocation of the purchase price of certain assets of awam which included approximately million allocated as the value of the assembled workforce  customer base and goodwill 
this amount is being amortized over a five year period and approximately  was included as amortization expense in fiscal current liabilities increased million in fiscal due primarily to the issuance of million in redeemable preference shares of qsa which were issued as partial consideration for the acquisition of awam assets 
in december the company negotiated revised payment terms which would defer payment of approximately million due for the redemption of the redeemable preference shares until january the increase in deferred tax liabilities resulted from the acquisition of certain assets of awam due to the difference in tax and financial accounting treatment of certain assets of awam 
in november  the company negotiated a private placement of unsecured  convertible promissory notes in the principal amount of million  of qsa 
the company received million of the total financing  by december  and anticipates receiving the remaining balance no later than february  the company intends to use the proceeds for payment on the debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of certain assets of awam  general corporate purposes and working capital 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that current available cash  short term investments  cash generated from operations  and credit arrangements will be sufficient to finance the company s anticipated operations and capital equipment requirements through at least the next twelve months 
however  there can be no assurance that events in the future will not require the company to seek additional capital sooner or  if so required  that adequate capital will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
employees the number of company employees grew during fiscal mainly due to the acquisition of qsa 
the company had employees at the end of fiscal as compared to at the end of the prior fiscal year 
impact on currency and inflation the company makes yen denominated purchases of wafers from japanese suppliers 
in fiscal year this resulted in material unfavorable foreign exchange transactions included in cost of product revenues 
the company entered into forward exchange contracts beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal primarily to hedge against the short term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on purchases denominated in yen 
the maturities of forward exchange contracts are short term in nature 
notwithstanding these precautions however  the company remains subject to the transaction exposures that arise from foreign exchange movements between the dates of when foreign currency purchase transactions are recorded and the dates cash payments are made in foreign currencies 
inflation has not had a significant impact on the company 
additional factors that may affect results the company s quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially and adversely affect revenues and profitability  including  among others  factors pertaining to i competition  such as competitive pressures on average selling prices of the company s products and the introduction of new products by competitors  ii the current and anticipated future dependence on the company s existing product lines  iii new product development  such as increased research  development and marketing expenses associated with new product introductions  the company s ability to introduce new products and technologies on a timely basis and the amount and timing of recognition on non recurring development revenue  iv manufacturing and operations  such as fluctuations in manufacturing yields  inventory management  raw materials  and production and assembly capacity  v the company operates a wafer fabrication facility which involves significant risks typically inherent in any manufacturing endeavor  as well as additional risks associated with production yields  technical difficulties with process control  expenses associated with responding to increases in environmental polution regulation or disposal of environmentally hazardous waste and events limiting production  such as fires or other damage  vi expenses that may be incurred in obtaining  enforcing and defending claims with respect to intellectual property rights  vii sales and marketing  such as loss of significant distributor  concentration of customers  and volume discounts that may be granted to significant customers  viii customer demand  such as market acceptance of products  the timing  cancellation or delay of customer orders and general economic conditions in the semiconductor and electronic systems industries  as well as other factors  such as risks associated with doing business abroad  retention of key personnel and management of growth and volatility in the company s revenues and stock price 
the company s earnings and stock price have been  and may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
any shortfall in revenue  gross margins or earnings from expected levels could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s stock in any given period 
the company may not learn of  or be able to confirm revenue  gross margin or earnings shortfalls until late in the quarter  or following the end of the quarter  because a significant portion of the company s revenue in a quarter typically is shipped in the last few weeks of that quarter 
in addition  future announcements concerning the company or its competitors  including technological innovations  new product introductions  governmental regulations  litigation  or changes in earnings estimates by analysts  may cause the market price of the company s stock to fluctuate substantially 
stock prices for many technology companies fluctuate widely for reasons that may be unrelated to operating results  such as general economic  political and market conditions 
cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements this report contains certain forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
for such statements the company claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the rule b under the securities exchange act of  securities act release no 
june  and the private securities litigation reform act of the following important factors  in addition to those discussed elsewhere in the report  could cause the results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward looking statements 
the company s products are in various stages of their product life cycles 
the company s success is highly dependent upon its ability to develop new products  to introduce them to the marketplace ahead of the competition  and to have them selected for design into products of leading systems manufacturers 
these factors have become increasingly important to the company s results of operations because the rate of change in the dynamic markets served by the company continues to accelerate 
since product life cycles are continually becoming shorter  revenue may be affected quickly if new product introductions are delayed 
since the gross margins of semiconductor products typically decline as competitive products are introduced  both revenue and profitability are impacted by the company s success in introducing new products quickly 
also  the company must deliver product to customers according to customer schedules 
if delays occur  then revenue and gross margins for current and follow on products may be affected as customers may shift to competitors to meet their requirements 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to compete successfully because of these factors
