pursuant to the amendment  the company s obligations were extended from november to november and defaults at december  and through the date of the amendment  were waived by foothill 
as a result  the company s indebtedness to foothill  which was reflected as a current liability of  at september   is treated as a long term liability of  at december  in addition  as a result of a default under the interest payment provisions of the company s subordinated debentures due the debentures  the company s obligations under the debentures  which were reflected as a  current liability at september   would have also been reflected as a current liability at december  however  as a result of an exchange offer the exchange offer which  as of march   had been accepted by the holders of approximately of the outstanding debentures  the company issued its new zero coupon notes due january  note and shares of common stock in exchange for debentures 
the company is classifying as current liabilities at december    of debentures which have not been exchanged  and the  of debentures exchanged as a long term liability  consistent with the payment terms of the notes 
as a result of the exchange offer  as of march   the company issued its new zero coupon notes in the aggregate principal amount of  and issued  shares of common stock in exchange for debentures in the principal amount of  as of such date  the principal amount of debentures outstanding was  the company is in default on payment of interest on the debentures which were not exchanged 
the company has no past or ongoing interest obligation with respect to either the new zero coupon notes or the debentures which were exchanged 
the aggregate annual interest obligation on the debentures which had not been converted at march  is approximately  as compared with the  aggregate annual interest obligation with respect to the debentures which were outstanding prior to the exchange offer 
on march   the company consummated an agreement pursuant to which it sold certain assets and the buyer assumed certain liabilities and severance obligations related to the operations of the company s fiber optics management and component business 
accordingly  at december   the net assets of the fiber optics business are reflected as assets held for sale  net at net realizable value  based on the terms of the sale 
the net assets of the fiber optics business were sold for a total purchase price of approximately  of which  is held in escrow  subject to certain conditions  plus the assumption of approximately  in liabilities 
the proceeds were applied to reduce the company s obligations to foothill in accordance with the march amendment to the foothill agreement 
the sale of the fiber optics business benefited the company in two ways 
first the sale of this business enabled the company to close two facilities  with a resultant decrease in personnel and overhead costs  the benefits of which are expected to be realized commencing with the second quarter of second  the sale enabled the company to amend and extend its agreement with foothill  as described above  and make a significant payment to foothill  which reduces its ongoing interest costs 
the company s obligations to foothill are secured by substantially all of the assets of the company and its subsidiaries 
the agreement with foothill was extended for two years  and the company is no longer in default under its agreement with foothill 
the agreement with foothill requires the company to continue to meet certain financial covenants 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
inventory was reduced from  at december  to  at december  this decrease resulted from an inventory reduction program during and a  increase in the reserve for slow moving or obsolete inventory at december  in addition  as a result of its illiquid condition  certain vendors ceased shipping to the company while others required cash before delivery or cash on delivery 
in addition  the inventory relating to the company s fiber optics business  amounting to  is included in assets held for sale at december  capital expenditures in were  the company does not have any significant commitments at december  to acquire fixed assets 
the company s liquidity problems have resulted in increased cost of sales  resulting in lower gross profits 
the gross margin for is  and the gross profit of  is significantly less than either selling  general and administrative expenses of  and research and development expenses of  accordingly  without a significant reduction of cost of goods sold  the company will not be able to operate profitably 
to address this situation  the company has consummated the above transactions in to reduce costs and is reviewing options to reduce other costs and operating expenses 
the company continues to require cash for its operations 
foothill has provided the company with funds to meet its immediate cash needs 
however  unless the company can reverse the negative trends in its operations  it may be unable to obtain cash from any sources  including foothill 
although the company has no plans to sell any of its remaining operations  no assurance can be given that it will not be necessary for the company to do so 
the failure of the company to obtain cash when needed is likely to continue to have an adverse effect on its business 
results of operations years ended december  and the company s continued shortage of working capital has had a material adverse effect upon its operations during the effects of the working capital shortage were compounded by the company s defaults during under its agreement with foothill  which resulted in curtailment of certain advances and letter of credit facilities 
although the defaults were waived as a result of a march amendment to the agreement with foothill  during most of  the company was in default under its agreement with foothill 
although foothill provided the company with cash to meet its immediate needs  its failure to provide additional advances and letter of credit facilities adversely affected the company s operations 
in march  the company sold its fiber optics business 
substantially all of the proceeds from the sale were used to reduce the company s obligations to foothill 
the company s sales for decreased by from sales  as the company experienced continuing liquidity problems which adversely affected the company s operations 
sales of oss products were  a increase from oss sales of  in  principally as a result of increased sales to bt and sales in the asian market 
sales of copper connection products decreased by  or  from  in to  in the reduction in such sales reflects a reduction in sales to telefonos de mexico  which accounted for sales of  in and virtually no sales in  a  reduction in sales of copper connection products to bt  as well as the effects of reduced production resulting from the company s working capital problems 
the company believes that the significantly reduced sales to telefonos de mexico is due in part to the continuing mexican financial crisis 
however  no assurance can be given that any improvement in the mexican economy will result in increased sales of the company s products 
sales of fiber optics products declined by  or  from  in to  in the decline reflects the company s inability to produce fiber optics products as a result of its financial problems  as the company allocated its resources principally to the oss and copper connection businesses 
this allocation of resources also reflected the company s decision late in to sell the fiber optics business 
sales of fiber optics products in the fourth quarter of were less than  sales from signal processing products  representing approximately of sales  were also hampered by the company s ongoing financial difficulties 
cost of sales in  as a percentage of sales  increased slightly from  from of sales in to of sales in as a result of the high cost of sales  the gross profit for was  which was significantly less than selling  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses 
the high cost of sales reflected i a lower volume of sales  ii the inability of the company to purchase efficiently and to obtain materials from certain suppliers  iii the under absorption of overhead costs  iv modification of inventory in order to fulfill customer orders  and v significant writedown of fiber optics inventory reflecting the value of such inventory in connection with the sale of the fiber optics business in march in addition  as part of the company s ongoing evaluation of its inventory and based on its level of sales  the company increased its inventory reserve by approximately  for slow moving or obsolete inventory 
steps taken to reduce manufacturing labor costs by reductions in direct and indirect manufacturing personnel were not implemented until late in the second quarter of and are reflected in cost of sales in the third and fourth quarters 
the reduction of facility  personnel and overhead costs from the sale of the fiber optics business will first be reflected in the second quarter of selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by  or  from  in to  in the expense decrease reflects the company s efforts to reduce personnel costs  as well as a reduced level of sales and marketing activities 
to some extent  the effects of the personnel reduction were offset by severance costs incurred during research and development expenses increased by  from  in to  in  or 
the increase reflected a reduction in the amount of software development costs which qualified for capitalization 
in  the company incurred expenses of  reflecting the value of the company s common stock to be issued as a result of the settlement of class actions 
see item legal proceedings 
in addition  in  the company wrote down the net assets of its fiber optics business to net realizable value to reflect the price at which the assets were sold in march as a result of the foregoing  the company sustained an operating loss of  an increase of from the operating loss of  in interest expense increased  or  from  in to  in the increase in interest expense reflects substantially higher average interest rates and increased borrowings under the company s agreement with foothill as compared with the interest rate and borrowings under the company s prior agreement with chemical bank 
although most of the increased borrowings reflect additional borrowings for operations   of the additional borrowings result from the purchase by the company of debentures which were purchased from foothill in connection with the march amendment to the foothill agreement 
other expenses of approximately  include costs associated with the modification of the company s agreement with foothill in march other expenses in related to the restructuring of the company s secured debt when foothill took over chemical bank s note from the company and the terms of the financing were modified 
income tax expense for was nominal  reflecting primarily offshore and delaware corporate taxes 
the  tax expense in results from providing a valuation allowance for deferred income taxes 
the  loss from the sale of discontinued operations reflects a reduction in the amount of the expected recovery from the sale by the company in of its israeli subsidiaries which were engaged in the manufacture of data communications connecting equipment 
as a result of a receivership and liquidation proceedings involving the purchaser of the subsidiaries  the estimated recovery from the sale of such operations was reduced from  which was the estimated recovery at december   to  which is the estimated recovery at december  in connection with the february amendment to the company s agreement with foothill  the company repurchased from foothill and retired  principal amount of debentures for approximately  through an increase of  in the term loan to foothill and the repricing of certain warrants granted to foothill 
the company recorded an extraordinary item  a gain of  million on early extinguishment of this debt  representing the difference between the book value of the debt and the approximate market value of the debt on the date of the transaction 
as a result of the foregoing  the company sustained a loss from continuing operations in of  or per share  as compared with a loss from continuing operations in of  or per share 
after giving effect to the loss on sale of discontinued operations and the gain on early extinguishment of debt  the company sustained a net loss of  or per share  for  as compared with a net loss of  or per share  in in march  the company sold the net assets of its fiber optics business  amended its agreement with foothill and reduced its indebtedness to foothill 
in addition  through march   the company issued its zero coupon notes in the principal amount of  and issued  shares of common stock in exchange for  principal amount of debentures and accrued interest of  at december   pursuant to the exchange offer 
these transactions enabled the company to reduce its facilities and personnel expenses  reduce the indebtedness to foothill and reduce ongoing interest costs 
the effects of these transactions will not be realized until the second quarter of however  the benefits to the company from the reduction in operating costs  including reductions resulting from the sale of the fiber optics business  and the reduced interest expense will not enable the company to operate profitably unless it is able to significantly reduce its cost of goods sold or increase its sales margins and reduce its general overhead  as to which no assurance can be given 
years ending december  and sales from continuing operations for the full year ended december  compared to were up primarily due to increased sales in each of the first three quarters of compared to the similar periods of the company s sales from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of were substantially below expectations  notwithstanding adequate backlog  due to the continuation of the shipment delays caused by persistent and worsening parts shortages associated with the reductions in borrowing availability under the company s borrowing agreement with its senior lender  and a product mix which resulted in shipment of lower priced and margined products 
in addition  the company s fourth quarter oss sales were generally and adversely impacted by the intercreditor disagreement which resulted in the company allocating working capital toward product manufacture in connection with the contract in order to fulfill its agreement with its customer and slowing performance on other contracts in the field due to resulting scarce working capital resources 
sales of oss equipment during the year ended december  were  compared to  in  an increase of  due primarily to increased sales during by the company s korean joint venture subsidiary 
while sales of fiber optic connection protection products for the year ended december  increased to  compared to  in  sales of fiber optic connection protection products during the fourth quarter of were adversely affected by the reductions in working capital availability discussed above 
sales of copper connection protection products decreased during the year ended december  compared to due in part to shipment delays caused by persistent parts shortages during the three months ended september  which accelerated in the three months ended december  resulting from the reductions in working capital availability under the restated credit agreement  as well as the inability of a supplier to ship parts meeting quality standards required by the company 
while shipments to british telecommunications plc had fallen during the three months ended september   the company was able to increase its shipments to this customer during the fourth quarter of the company s backlog for copper products significantly increased during this period due to increased orders for these products 
also  the company s sales to telefonos de mexico  which were denominated in mexican pesos and which were expected to be approximately the same in as in but more evenly distributed over all four quarters of the year  were adversely affected in early december by the mexican economic crisis which caused the company to temporarily halt shipments to telefonos de mexico pending negotiations with telefonos de mexico to determine the increased pricing consequences of such economic crisis 
sales of other products  primarily signal processing products  in the year ended december  were slightly higher than sales during although sales of other products in the third and fourth quarters of were also somewhat affected by the operational inefficiencies resulting from the reductions in working capital availability 
the dollar amount of cost of sales for the year ended december  increased approximately  or compared to cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the year ended december  compared to increased to from 
the dollar amount of cost of sales for the third and fourth quarters of compared to the similar periods of and to the company s historical cost of sales experience were particularly high and negatively impacted the entire year s results due to the unfavorable impact on the company s operational costs of the reductions in working capital availability under the restated credit agreement  the effect of the company s concentrated effort to reduce inventories and the sale of lower margin products in order to generate cash internally to address such reductions in externally available working capital 
in addition  the substantial contribution of the company s joint venture in korea  which sells lower margin oss products  to oss equipment sales tended to increase cost of sales as a percentage of sales 
the company s operational costs were additionally affected by manufacturing inefficiencies resulting from materials shortages  smaller productions runs  higher per unit purchasing and freight costs as well as increased numbers of employees and idle labor manufacturing time and maintenance of a fixed level of expenses associated with the support of a higher level of oss equipment sales than actually resulted in while the company s effort to reduce inventories resulted in increased cash flow in the third and fourth quarters of  the consequences of this effort was higher labor costs related to rework of inventory and reduced margins associated with the sale of certain slow moving inventory at unfavorable prices 
also  the company s aggressive inventory reduction program caused it to conclude  after sales of such inventory  that no easily accessible and significant market remained for certain of its copper products in the markets traditionally accessed by the company or which the company would reasonably be able to access in the near term given the restructuring and cost cutting moves described elsewhere 
accordingly  the company determined to make a  provision for such products 
in addition  the company has made a provision for approximately  of high density frames which it has in stock due to its discovery that such high density frames contain defective parts sold to it by a vendor 
the company is presently considering taking action against such vendor to recoup its losses resulting from such defective parts 
the dollar amount of selling  general and administrative expenses in the year ended december   increased by compared to  while selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased by during the year ended december  compared to selling  general and administrative expenses were significantly higher during the last quarter of compared to due to the costs of servicing its asia pacific marketplace and selling associated with the european market and commission costs 
in addition  the impact of certain one time costs associated with the pursuit of substitute financing  the costs of defense of certain lawsuits which the company was defending during these periods and the costs of settlement of one of these lawsuits increased selling  general and administrative expenses during the year ended december  research and development expenses for the year ended december  compared to decreased significantly  both as a dollar amount and as a percentage of sales  in part because of a reduction in staff and related costs due primarily to the consolidation of research and development activities previously conducted separately by companies acquired in prior periods and in part because of lower research and development requirements for the company s more mature products 
the company s operating loss for the year ended december  is primarily attributable to a number of factors  including a shortfall in the volume of sales  a cost structuring for a much larger level of sales  an inability to adjust the organization to deal with the sales shortfall  the reductions in availability of working capital  inventory reduction program  and transaction costs related to both the restated credit agreement and the new credit agreement 
the company s operating loss for the year ended december  was  and reflected an improving operational trend during the last six months of the year 
a substantial portion of this operating loss was due to low volumes of production in comparison to manufacturing capacity  as well as  costs associated with strategic investments in oss and fiber optic areas being made by the company 
in addition  and consistent with the company s cost of sales  the mix of product sales contributed to the extent of the loss 
interest expense for the year ended december  compared to increased due to higher average interest rates although such higher average rates were offset by a slightly lower borrowing level during most of compared to interest expenses increased substantially during compared to due to substantially increased debt used to finance the company s operating losses and a full year s interest on the convertible subordinated debentures 
as reported  other expenses for the year ended december  compared to decreased 
however  such expenses included various advisory fees required as a result of the company s relationship with its lending banks and fees related to the costs of the company s financing with both its lending banks and its new senior lender  which were partially offset by a  gain from the satisfaction of the bank obligations 
other expenses for the year ended december  are predominantly comprised of various advisory fees relating to the negotiation and finalization of the restated credit agreement as well as fees related to the company s unsuccessful efforts to acquire a telecommunications manufacturing business of another company 
the company adopted financial accounting standard no 
effective january  and  as of december   had recognized a deferred tax asset of  principally relating to the company s net operating loss carryforwards 
in the third quarter of  the company  after reviewing the deferred tax asset in the context of its results of operations for such third quarter  recorded a valuation allowance in the entire amount of such deferred tax asset  which is included in income tax expense 
as a result  the company recorded income tax expense of  for the year ended december  compared to income tax benefit of  in  principally relating to operating losses for united states income tax purposes 
the decision to record such valuation allowance in was based on the criteria contained in financial accounting standard no 
 generally requiring a valuation allowance when cumulative losses have been experienced and there is a lack of sufficient objective offsetting evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be utilized 
new accounting standards in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which must be adopted by the company in the company has elected not to implement the fair value based accounting method for employee stock options  but has elected to disclose  commencing in  the pro forma net income and earnings per share as if such method had been used to account for stock based compensation cost as described in the statement 
in march  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  which must also be adopted by the company in the effect of adopting this standard will be insignificant
