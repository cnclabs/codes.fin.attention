consumer spending the success of the company is influenced by a number of economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income  such as employment levels  business conditions  interest rates and taxation rates 
adverse changes in these economic conditions may restrict consumer spending  thereby negatively affecting the company s results of operations 
in addition  the company s results of operations could be adversely affected if consumer spending is lower than anticipated during the holiday season 
competition the markets in which the company is engaged are highly competitive 
nordictrack competes with several companies which design  manufacture and distribute physical fitness and exercise equipment 
during the past several years  nordictrack s competitors have introduced several new and competitive products at competitive prices which have adversely affected nordictrack s recent revenues and profits 
the future success of nordictrack depends in part upon its ability to introduce new and competitive products successfully  on a timely basis and at competitive prices 
the failure of nordictrack to successfully compete with its competitors could materially adversely affect the financial condition of the company 
many of the competitors of smith hawken are larger companies with greater financial resources  a greater selection of merchandise and nationwide distribution  including a large number and wide variety of specialty retail stores  discount stores and department stores 
smith hawken also competes with mail order catalogs that sell gardening related merchandise and independent garden stores and plant nurseries in towns and cities throughout the united states 
the failure of smith hawken to successfully compete with these companies could adversely affect the company s operating results 
new products the company s future financial performance will depend on the continued market acceptance of the company s existing products and the successful development  introduction and customer acceptance of new and enhanced products 
several new products were introduced in the fall of if these products do not receive favorable market acceptance  the company s future operating results would be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing new products and marketing its existing or new products 
new management team the company has recently replaced a number of key executives at nordictrack 
there can be no assurance  however  that the new personnel will be able to successfully increase revenues or reduce costs at nordictrack in the future 
seasonality the company s businesses are seasonal  with significant amounts of retail sales in the second and third fiscal quarters 
the company expects this seasonality to continue in the future 
because of this seasonality  the company s revenues and earnings have fluctuated and will continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
advertising and marketing programs the company s success in the markets in which it competes depends in part upon the effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs of the company and the company s ability to successfully manage its advertising in house 
in  nordictrack implemented a new advertising program which in large part was ineffective 
the inability of the company to periodically design and successfully execute new and effective advertising and marketing programs could adversely affect the company s operating results 
costs of postage and shipping postage expenses associated with mailing catalogs and shipping charges associated with distributing merchandise to customers are significant factors in the operation of the company s businesses 
increases in postage or shipping costs could adversely affect the company s operating results 
intellectual property rights the company is subject to the risk of adverse claims and litigation alleging infringement of intellectual property rights 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims in the future with respect to the company s current or future products or that any such claims will not require the company to enter into royalty arrangements or result in costly litigation 
while the company believes that it currently has all licenses necessary to conduct its business  no assurance can be given that additional licenses will not be required in the future 
furthermore  no assurance can be given that  if any additional licenses are required  such licenses could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms 
other inflation has not had a significant effect on the company s operations 
the company is involved in various legal proceedings and claims and two former subsidiaries of the company are involved in two separate environmental matters 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on commitments and contingencies 
the company plans to adopt statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for impairment of long lived assets  and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  in the company is evaluating the impact that implementation of sfas nos 
and will have on its consolidated financial statements
