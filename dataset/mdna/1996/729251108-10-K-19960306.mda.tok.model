events and trends affecting operating results market forces 
the demand for logs and manufactured wood products depends upon international and domestic market conditions  the value of the us dollar in foreign exchange markets  competition  the availability of substitute products and other factors 
in particular  the demand for logs  lumber  plywood and mdf is affected by residential and industrial construction  and repair and remodel activity 
these activities are subject to fluctuations due to changes in economic conditions  tariffs  interest rates  population growth and other economic  demographic and environmental factors 
current market conditions 
prices for domestic logs in the cascade region for increased from levels experienced in  primarily as a result of strong pulp and paper markets competing for logs in the domestic market during the first three quarters of the year and the diverting of export quality logs to the domestic market during the second half of the year as a result of a weakening japanese market 
at year end  douglas fir prices were holding steady due to a lack of supply  and whitewood prices were declining as a result of falling chip prices 
domestic log prices in the rockies region were lower than prices experienced in  as a result of weaker lumber markets  aggressive competition from canadian lumber producers and a fourth quarter decline in both commodity plywood prices and chip prices 
export log prices for increased slightly over prices as a result of the diversion of lower quality export logs to the domestic market and near record high price levels in the first quarter of due to low inventory levels in japan and the us west coast 
at year end  there was upward price pressure on export logs due to the short supply of logs in both japan and the us west coast 
industry composite indices for lumber commodity prices were lower in than in the decrease in prices was primarily due to relative weakness in the housing market  aggressive pricing and competition from canadian lumber producers  and increased competition from substitutes 
industry composite indices for plywood commodity prices and prices for mdf in approximately equaled levels experienced in commodity plywood prices began declining during the fourth quarter due to a slowing housing market and the significant oriented strand board capacity expansion projected in mdf prices have fallen significantly as compared to price levels at year end due to a decline in demand for ready to assemble furniture as a result of lower repair modeling activity  high end user inventories  and capacity expansion by pacific rim manufacturers 
prices for pulp logs and chips improved significantly during the first and second quarter of due to strong pulp and paper markets 
prices peaked during the summer and have since retreated due to the oversupply of logs and chips that was brought on by these higher prices 
financial condition and liquidity net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
in  operating cash flow was reduced by million  net of expense  for the funding of certain employee benefit plans 
there was no such funding in future funding of these benefit plans is contingent on meeting targets as defined in the plans 
for further discussion of these benefit plans  see note of notes to combined financial statements 
on december   the company had million of cash and cash equivalents 
the partnership has two unsecured revolving lines of credit lines of credit with a group of banks that permit the partnership to borrow up to million for general corporate purposes  including up to million of standby letters of credit issued on behalf of the partnership or manufacturing 
the lines of credit bear a floating rate of interest 
one line of credit allows the partnership to borrow million through october   of which million was outstanding at december  the other line of credit allows the partnership to borrow million through october  any borrowings outstanding at that time are payable in quarterly installments  at the option of the partnership  due january through october  of which million was outstanding at december  as of december   there were letters of credit outstanding in the amount of million 
borrowings on the lines of credit fluctuate daily based on cash needs 
as of january   all borrowings on the lines of credit were repaid 
the company s long term debt agreements and lines of credit contain certain restrictive covenants  including limitations on harvest levels  sale of assets  cash distributions and the amount of future indebtedness 
the company was in compliance with such covenants as of december  and the first mortgage notes limit distributions from the manufacturing segment to the partnership 
the partnership will distribute per unit for the fourth quarter of the distribution will equal million including million to the general partner  and will be paid on march  to unitholders of record on february  the computation of cash available for distribution includes a required reserve for the payment of principal and interest  as well as other reserves established at the discretion of the general partner  for working capital  capital expenditures or future cash distributions 
cash required to meet the partnership s quarterly cash distributions  capital expenditures and to satisfy interest and principal payments on the company s debt will be significant 
the general partner expects that all debt service will be funded from cash generated by operations 
the partnership expects to make cash distributions from current funds and cash generated from operations 
it is anticipated that future capital expenditures will be funded from current funds and cash generated from operations 
the company is involved in certain environmental and regulatory proceedings and other related matters 
although it is possible that new information or future developments could require the company to reassess its potential exposure related to these matters  the company believes  based upon available information  that the resolution of these issues will not have a materially adverse effect on its results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
capital expenditures capital expenditures for the resources segment were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
resources segment capital expenditures included the construction of logging roads and reforestation 
resources segment capital expenditures for included million of timberlands purchased as part of the montana timberland acquisition  as well as construction of logging roads and reforestation 
capital expenditures for the manufacturing segment were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
manufacturing segment capital expenditures in included a project in the mdf plant to produce super refined mdf  a higher quality mdf product that can be machined and finished more efficiently  adding significant value to the mdf product line  air quality pollution control equipment at the mdf plant  various lumber and plywood value added projects  and equipment upgrades to meet environmental requirements 
planned capital expenditures for the resources segment in are million  primarily for logging roads and reforestation 
the manufacturing segment s planned capital expenditures are million which includes the purchase and installation of various lumber and plywood optimization projects  as well as replacements and upgrades of other equipment in several of the conversion facilities 
results of operations the following table compares operating income by segment for the years ended december   and operating income by segment in thousands resources    manufacturing    other eliminations    total    compared to resources segment revenues were million and million for the years ended and  respectively 
revenues were million higher in  primarily due to a million increase in revenues from pulpwood and chip sales offset in part by lower export log sales volume and lower domestic log prices 
the increase in pulpwood and chip revenues was due to the addition of in woods chipping operations  which utilize small tops of trees and small trees from thinning operations  and a significant increase in pulp log prices and sales volume as compared to due to strong pulp and paper markets 
export log sales volume decreased by  as compared to  due to the shifting of lower quality export logs to the domestic market as a result of a weaker japanese economy and a planned reduction in harvest levels 
domestic log prices  as compared to  decreased by 
the decrease was attributable entirely to the rockies region and was due to weak lumber markets and aggressive competition from canadian lumber producers 
resources segment costs and expenses were million and million for the years ended and  respectively 
costs and expenses were million higher in primarily due to the costs relating to higher volumes of pulpwood and chip sales 
manufacturing segment revenues were million and million for the years ended and  respectively 
revenues were million higher in due to an increase in lumber sales volume and a increase in revenues from residual chip sales  offset in part by lower lumber prices and lower mdf sales volume 
lumber sales volume increased by in  as compared to  due to increased production as a result of the new lumber remanufacturing facility  higher productivity due to improved log merchandising specifications and capital improvements  and additional production shifts 
lumber prices decreased by as compared to due to a weaker housing market as a result of generally slower economic conditions  and increased competition from both canadian imports and substitute products 
while our lumber prices are influenced by commodity prices  we are able to maintain sales volume due to our high concentration of sales in the repair remodel and industrial markets  which are less impacted by the slow housing market 
mdf sales volume decreased by as a result of production downtime associated with weak market conditions and issues encountered during the start up of new high energy refiners for our new mdf product 
residual chip revenues increased due to a substantial increase in prices over due to strong pulp and paper markets 
manufacturing segment costs and expenses were million for the years ended and increased costs due to increased lumber sales volumes were offset by lower log costs and lower for lumber and plywood  respectively and lower mdf production costs as a result of downtime 
other costs and eliminations which consists of corporate overhead  intercompany log profit elimination  and intercompany lifo elimination decreased operating income by million less in as compared to the variance was primarily due to lower intercompany profit elimination  offset in part by an increase in the intercompany lifo elimination 
on a combined basis  the resources segment s profit on intercompany log sales is deferred until manufacturing converts existing log inventories into finished products and sells them to third parties 
the intercompany profit elimination was lower than the prior year s due to a decrease in log inventory levels  and a lower log transfer price as a result of a weaker domestic log market 
on a combined basis  the lifo impact related to price fluctuations on the sale of intercompany logs is eliminated 
the intercompany lifo elimination was greater than the prior year s due to a lower log transfer price  which resulted in a greater decrement in manufacturing s separate company lifo reserve as compared to the combined lifo reserve 
net other expense decreased by million in as compared to primarily due to a decrease in fixed asset retirements  a charge in for the write off of capitalized debt issue costs as a result of refinancing the lines of credit  and a decrease in the expense for state taxes payable on behalf of non resident unitholders 
the income allocated to the general partner increased by million during compared to as a result of higher quarterly distributions to the unitholders which increased the incentive distribution paid to the general partner 
net income is allocated to the general partner based on two percent of the company s net income adjusted for the incentive distribution paid  plus the incentive distribution 
the incentive distribution is based on a percentage of the quarterly distribution paid which totaled per unit for the year ended  compared to per unit in compared to resources segment revenues were million and million for the years ended and  respectively 
revenues were million higher in  primarily due to increased sales volumes and higher prices for domestic logs  offset in part by lower export log sales volumes and lower land sales 
domestic log sales volume increased by as compared to primarily due to increased harvest levels 
the company s fee timber harvest was mmbf which was mmbf higher than  primarily as a result of the montana timberland acquisition 
domestic log prices increased in by as compared to the higher prices were primarily the result of increased demand for wood products as well as from log shortages in the northwest caused in part by legal challenges to federal timber sales and changes in federal timber policy 
in addition  land sales were million lower than land sales declined in  primarily due to the partnership s strategy of deferring land sales until the completion of state and county growth management processes 
resources segment costs and expenses were million and million for the years ended and  respectively 
costs and expenses were million higher in primarily due to the increase in the production volumes of domestic logs  higher log and haul costs resulting from longer hauling distances and higher road amortization and timber depletion rates resulting from the additional roads and timber obtained in the montana timberland acquisition 
manufacturing segment revenues were million and million for the years ended and  respectively 
revenues were million higher in due to sales volume increases and higher prices in all product lines 
lumber  plywood  and mdf prices increased in by  and  respectively  over the higher prices were the result of improved domestic wood product demand and the impact of the log supply shortage 
lumber sales volumes were higher in as compared to  primarily due to increased production 
mdf sales volumes increased by in due to increased production as a result of production improvements 
manufacturing segment costs and expenses were million and million for the years ended and  respectively 
the million of higher costs and expenses were primarily due to increased lumber and mdf production volumes and higher log costs and higher for lumber and plywood  respectively which were the result of improving demand for finished wood products and the log supply shortage 
other costs and eliminations which consists of corporate overhead  intercompany log profit elimination  and intercompany lifo elimination decreased by million for the year ended as compared to  primarily due to a decrease in the cost of employee benefit plans and a decrease in executive incentive compensation paid by the partnership 
profit resulting from intercompany log sales is deferred until the manufacturing segment converts existing log inventories into finished products and sells them to third parties 
interest expense increased by million in as compared to due to an increase in average debt outstanding in  as a result of borrowings in november to finance the montana timberlands acquisition 
net other expense increased by million in as compared to primarily due to an increase in the minority interest elimination as a result of an increase in net income in the manufacturing segment  an increase in fixed asset retirements and an increase in the expense for state taxes payable on behalf of non resident unitholders 
the income allocated to the general partner increased by million during compared to as a result of higher net income and higher quarterly distributions to the unitholders which increased the incentive distribution paid to the general partner 
net income is allocated to the general partner based on two percent of the company s net income adjusted for the incentive distribution paid  plus the incentive distribution 
the incentive distribution is based on a percentage of the quarterly distribution paid which totaled per unit for the year ended  compared to per unit in per unit amounts were restated for the december  three for one unit split 
export sales the company sells logs and finished wood products for export 
these sales are denominated in us dollars and are generally sold to pacific rim countries  principally japan  and to canada 
combined export revenues as a percentage of total revenues were  and for   and  respectively 
effect of inflation during recent years the company has generally experienced increased costs due to the effect of inflation  particularly in the manufacturing segment  on the cost of raw materials  labor  supplies and energy 
however  the company utilizes the lifo inventory valuation method for its raw materials  work in process and finished goods inventory which generally matches current costs to current revenues and thus  tends to reflect the impact of inflation on cost of goods sold
