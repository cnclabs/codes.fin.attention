item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section presents management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of first united corporation and subsidiaries collectively  the corporation including first united national bank trust the bank  and oakfirst life insurance corporation 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements which appear elsewhere in this report 
on january   the board of directors declared a stock dividend to shareholders on record at march  the dividend will result in the issuance of  shares 
earnings and dividends per share have been restated to reflect the stock split 
on november   the corporation acquired all the outstanding stock of hometown bancorp  inc in exchange for  shares of the corporation s common stock  along with cash in lieu of fractional shares  consummating the acquisition announced in march hometown s sole subsidiary was myersville bank 
the acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
accordingly  financial data presented has been restated to reflect this acquisition as if it had occurred at the beginning of the periods presented 
earnings analysis overview the corporation s net earnings for decreased to million or less than the million reported in earnings for the year were less than the previous year s earnings because of a one time restructuring charge of million 
the restructuring charge included the costs associated with the consolidation of first united bank of west virginia and myersville bank into first united national bank trust and the expenses associated with a voluntary retirement plan offered and accepted by eleven employees who met the plan s requirements 
the expense associated with the voluntary retirement plan was million of the million discussed above 
return on average assets was  and in   and  respectively 
the return on average shareholders equity for decreased to from the previous year  as compared to in earnings per share decreased to in from in  and compared with in the restructuring charge discussed above had a significant impact on first united s key ratios 
excluding these restructuring costs  return on average assets would have been while return on average equity would have been 
earnings per share  excluding the one time restructuring charge  would have been 
net interest income the primary source of earnings continued to be net interest income the difference between interest income and related fees on earning assets  and the interest expense incurred on deposits and other borrowed funds 
this segment of earnings is affected by changes in interest rates  account balances and the mix of earning assets and interest bearing funding sources 
total interest income for increased over  from million to million  primarily due to growth in earning assets 
total interest expense at million represented an increase of from in this increase was the result of growth in our depository accounts as well as the effect of higher rates being paid 
the net effect of these changes was a improvement in net interest income to million in from million in this compares to million in the improvement in represents an increase of over s net interest income 
table analyzes the changes in net interest income attributable to volume and rate components 
for analytical purposes  net interest income is adjusted to a taxable equivalent basis 
this adjustment facilitates performance comparisons between taxable and tax exempt assets by increasing tax exempt income by an amount equal to the federal income taxes which would have been paid if this income were taxable at the statutorily applicable rate 
the taxable equivalent net interest margin decreased to in from in  compared with in table compares the components of the net interest margin and the changes occurring between  and allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is based on management s continuing evaluation of the loan portfolio  assessment of current economic conditions  diversification and size of the portfolio  adequacy of collateral  past and anticipated loss experience and the amount of non performing loans 
as a result of continued efforts by management to improve procedures for credit analysis  problem loan detection  and delinquency follow ups  no provision for credit losses was required in this is a continuation of a favorable declining trend for the provision for possible credit losses which decreased from 
million in to 
million in table presents the activity in the allowance for loan losses by major loan category for the past five years 
table presents management s allocation of the allowance for loan losses by major loan catagory 
specific allocations in any particular category may be reallocated in the future to reflect current conditions 
accordingly  the entire allowance is considered available to absorb losses in any category 
other operating income non interest income for  at million  increased over the million earned in although insurance premium income declined 
million  this decrease was more than offset by improvements in income from trust and fiduciary activities  service charges on depository accounts and real estate appraisal processing 
with the exception of service charges on deposit accounts  which declined 
million in  similar improvements accounted for the increase of in non interest income over the million earned in other operating expense non interest expense increased to million in from million in  or 
as was previously discussed  the restructuring costs for  which totalled million  represented a significant portion of the increase in non interest expense for the year 
higher salary and benefit costs associated with merit compensation increases and additional staffing required for the opening of the martin s dual highway office in hagerstown  maryland also contributed to the increase in non interest expense in expenditures to further increase the role of technology in improving the efficiency of customer service delivery and internal processing activities  such as the installation of a wide area computer network  accounted for much of the increase in equipment expenses 
in order to better meet the needs of our customers and to insure more efficient service  the corporation opened a customer service center 
a majority of the costs related to the customer service center were equipment related  and therefore  contributed to the increase in equipment expenses in it is anticipated that the long run efficiencies gained by projects such as these will be a net benefit to the earnings performance of the corporation 
salary  benefit  occupancy and equipment expenses related to the opening of the riverside office as well as expenditures for technology advancements accounted for much of the million increase in non interest expense over the amount 
applicable income taxes applicable income taxes are detailed in note of the corporation s audited consolidated financial statements 
income tax expense amounted to million in as compared with million in and million in these amounts represented effective tax rates of  and for  and  respectively 
investment securities investment securities classified as available for sale are held for an indefinite period of time and may be sold in response to changing market and interest rate conditions as part of the asset liability management strategy 
available for sale securities are carried at market value  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity net of income taxes 
investment securities classified as held to maturity are those that management has both the positive intent and the ability to hold to maturity  and are reported at amortized cost 
the corporation does not currently follow a strategy of making security purchases with a view to near term resales and therefore  does not own trading securities 
the corporation s adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  as of january   resulted in a change in classification of million of investment securities from held to maturity to available for sale 
for additional information  see notes and to the corporation s audited consolidated financial statements 
total investment securties remained relatively unchanged at million and million at december  and  respectively 
at december   total investment securities were million 
the increase in investment securities which occurred in was mainly attributed to excess funds resulting from the growth of deposits over loans 
the corporation manages its investment portfolios within policies which seek to achieve desired levels of liquidity  manage interest rate sensitivity risk  meet earnings objectives and provide required collateral support for deposit activities 
excluding the us government and us government sponsored agencies  the corporation had no concentrations of investment securities from any single issues that exceeded of shareholders equity 
table exhibits the distribution by type  of the investment portfolio for the three years ended december   and  respectively 
loan portfolio the corporation  through its bank  is actively engaged in originating loans to customers primarily in garrett  allegany  washington and frederick counties in maryland  mineral  hardy and hampshire counties in west virginia and the surrounding regions of west virginia and pennsylvania 
the corporation has policies and procedures designed to mitigate credit risk and to maintain the quality of the corporation s loan portfolio 
these policies include underwriting standards for new credits and the continuous monitoring and reporting of asset quality and the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses 
these policies  coupled with on going training efforts  have provided an effective check and balance for the risk associated with the lending process 
lending authority is based on the level of risk  size of the loan and the experience of the lending officer 
table presents the composition of the corporation s loan portfolio by significant concentration 
the corporation s policy is to make the majority of its loan commitments in the market area it serves 
this tends to reduce risk because management is familiar with the credit histories of loan applicants and has an in depth knowledge of the risk to which a given credit is subject 
the corporation had no foreign loans in its portfolio as of december  during  net loans increased million or to a total of million 
in comparison  net loans at year end increased million or to a total of million 
mortgage lending continued to be the primary source of loan growth in part of the mortgage growth included increase in our home equity product 
home equity loans increased from million at year end to million at year end we anticipate our home equity product to continue to experience growth as more of our customers look for tax advantages associated with this product 
table details the dollar amount and percentage distribution of the various key categories of credit in the loan portfolio 
funding for loan growth during and was provided by increased levels of deposits 
it is the policy of the corporation to place a loan in non accrual status whenever there is substantial doubt about the ability of a borrower to pay principal or interest on any outstanding credit 
management considers such factors as payment history  the nature of the collateral securing the loan and the overall economic situation of the borrower when making a non accrual decision 
non accrual loans are closely monitored by management 
a non accruing loan is restored to accrual status when principal and interest payments have been brought current  it becomes well secured or is in the process of collection and the prospects of future contractual payments are no longer in doubt 
at december   million of non accrual loans were secured by collateral with an estimated value of million 
the amount listed in table under restructured loans in is also included in the non accrual loans total for that year 
as of december   the corporation had million in loans for which payments were current  but the borrowers were experiencing financial difficulties 
the corresponding total for year end was million 
these loans are subject to on going management attention and their classifications are reviewed monthly 
deposit and other funding deposit liabilities increased to million in from million at the end of  or an increase of 
the million in deposit growth compares favorably to the million growth in deposits experienced in time deposits continue to be the main source of deposit growth  although interest bearing demand deposits exhibited some growth during both and the corporation continues to experience strong competition for deposits from other commercial banks  credit unions  and stock market and mutual funds 
table displays the average balances and average rates paid on all major deposit classifications for   and capital resources the bank and the corporation itself are subject to risk based capital regulations which were adopted by federal banking regulators and became fully phased in on december  these guidelines are used to evaluate capital adequacy  and are based on an institution s asset risk profile and off balance sheet exposures  such as unused loan commitments and stand by letters of credit 
the regulatory guidelines require that a portion of total capital be tier capital  consisting of common shareholders equity and perpetual preferred stock  less goodwill and certain other deductions 
the remaining capital  or tier capital  consists of elements such as subordinated debt  mandatory convertible debt  and grandfathered senior debt  plus the allowance for credit losses  subject to certain limitations 
under the risk based capital regulations  banking organizations are required to maintain a minimum total risk based capital ratio total qualifying capital divided by risk weighted assets  including a tier ratio of 
the risk based capital rules have been further supplemented by a leverage ratio  defined as tier capital divided by average assets  after certain adjustments 
the minimum leverage ratio is for banking organizations that do not anticipate significant growth and have well diversified risk including no undue interest rate risk exposure  excellent asset quality  high liquidity and good earnings 
other banking organizations not in this category are expected to have ratios of at least  depending on their particular condition and growth plans 
higher capital ratios could be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profile of a given banking organization 
in the current regulatory environment  banking companies must stay well capitalized in order to receive favorable regulatory treatment on acquisition and other expansion activities and favorable risk based deposit insurance assessments 
the corporation s capital policy establishes guidelines meeting these regulatory requirements  and which take into account current or anticipated risks and future growth opportunities 
on december   the corporation s risk based capital ratio was  well above the regulatory minimum of 
the risk based capital ratios for year end and were and  respectively 
retained earnings and shareholder participation in the corporation s dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan provided an additional million in total stockholders equity  which grew to million at the end of  from million at the year end and million at year end the equity to assets ratio at december   was  compared with and at year end and as a result of the corporation s adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for investments in certain debt and equity securities  an adjustment to shareholders equity as of january   of million  net of taxes  was recorded

asset and liability management introduction the investment and funds management committee of the corporation seeks to assess and manage the risks associated with fluctuating interest rates while maintaining adequate liquidity 
this is accomplished by formulating and implementing policies that take into account the sources and uses of funds  maturity and repricing distributions of assets and liabilities  pricing strategies  and marketability of assets 
liquidity the objective of liquidity management is to assure that the withdrawal demands of depositors and the legitimate credit needs of the corporation s delineated market areas are accommodated 
total liquid assets  represented by cash  investment securities available for sale and held to maturity maturing within one year and loans maturing within one year  amounted to million  or of total assets at december  this compares with million  or of year end assets  and million  or of year end assets 
the decrease from to and to is primarily the result of assets being invested for longer periods of time to enhance the yield of the corporation s portfolio 
additional liquidty of million is available from unused lines of credit at various upstream correspondent banks and the federal home loan bank of atlanta 
interest rate sensitivity interest rate sensitivity refers to the degree that earnings will be impacted by changes in the prevailing level of interest rates 
interest rate risk arises from mismatches in the repricing or maturity characteristics between assets and liabilities 
management seeks to avoid fluctuating net interest margin  and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates 
the corporation uses interest sensitivity gap analysis and simulation models to measure and manage these risks 
the gap report assigns each interest earning asset and interest bearing liability to a time frame reflecting its next repricing or maturity date 
the differences between total interest sensitive assets and liabilities at each time interval represent the interest sensitivity gap for that interval 
a positive gap generally indicates that rising interest rates during a given interval will increase net interest income  as more assets than liabilities will reprice 
a negative gap position would benefit the corporation during a period of declining interest rates 
in order to manage interest sensitivity risk  management of the corporation formulates guidelines regarding asset generation and pricing  funding sources and pricing and off balance sheet commitments 
these guidelines are based on management s outlook regarding future interest rate movements  the state of the regional and national economy  and other financial and business risk factors 
management uses computer simulations to measure the effect on net interest income of various interest rate scenarios 
this modeling reflects interest rate changes and the related impact on net income over specified periods 
management does not use derivative financial instruments to effect its interest rate sensitivity 
rates on different assets and liabilities within a single maturity category adjust to changes in interest rates to varying degrees and over varying periods of time 
the relationships between prime rates and rates paid on purchased funds are not constant over time 
the rate or growth in interest free sources of funds will influence the level of interest sensitive funding sources 
in addition  the absolute level of interest rates will affect the volume of earning assets and funding sources 
as a result of these limitations  the interest sensitive gap is only one factor to be considered in estimating the net interest margin 
table presents the corporation s interest rate gap position at december  this is a one day position which is continually changing and is not necessarily indicative of the corporation s position at any other time
