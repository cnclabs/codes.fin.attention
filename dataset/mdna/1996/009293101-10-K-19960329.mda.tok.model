average daily room rate for the industry increased by to and room occupancy increased to 
the hospitality industry in the us experienced a rise in the rate of increase in supply and a drop in the rate of increase in change in demand  and it was only the continued rise in the average room rate that kept the increase in room revenue near the level of room revenue per available room revpar was up  considerably below the increase for a year ago

ii revenue total revenue decreased  or in  compared to an increase of  or in of the total revenue in  and  rooms comprised  and  respectively  food and beverage comprised  and  respectively  and other property operations comprised  and  respectively 
rooms revenue is primarily a function of the properties occupancy levels and room rates 
rooms revenue decreased  in due to a decrease in occupancy from to offset by an increase in average room rates of 
rooms revenue increased  in due to an increase in occupancy from to offset in part by a decrease in average room rates of 
rooms revenue decreases in were primarily attributable to decreases at the sheraton lakeside and sheraton inn buffalo airport 
the leisure market at sheraton lakeside continued to be impacted by significant competitive pressures  resulting from an increase in room supply in the orlando area 
the reduction in rooms revenue at sheraton buffalo was due to a decrease in canadian leisure activity resulting from declines in the value of the canadian dollar and loss of a substantial airline room contract 
the decreases in lakeside and buffalo were mitigated by the impact of increases in rooms revenue  due to increases in average rate  at regal mccormick ranch  sheraton university center and aurora inn 
rooms revenue increases in were primarily attributable to increased sales to group and contract customers at the regal mccormick ranch  sheraton university center and sheraton inn buffalo airport 
the rooms revenue increases were offset in part by a decrease in rooms revenue at the sheraton lakeside  which was impacted by the significant competitive pressures in the leisure market 
these competitive pressures combined with discounts offered to attract more group and contract business resulted in the decreases in average room rates 
food and beverage revenue decreased  or in and increased  or in food and beverage revenue is impacted by room occupancy and the mix of room sales between leisure  group  contract and business customers 
the primary reason for the decrease in was related to increased competition from stand alone restaurants in the area surrounding the regal mccormick  the smaller percentage contribution from the canadian leisure market maintained at the sheraton buffalo and a decrease in banquet activity at both locations 
the primary increases in occupancy in were from group and contract customers  which have a favorable impact on food and beverage revenue 
other property operations consist of marina sales and rentals at fourwinds  gift shops  food marts  lease income  phone charges and other miscellaneous guest services 
other property operations decreased  or in and increased  or in the decrease in other property operations was primarily due to storm damage at the clarion fourwinds resort  which impacted the marina related revenues 
the increase in other property operations was primarily due to the overall increase in occupancy 
while the hotel industry continues to be very competitive  the properties  as a group  have outperformed the industry when measuring revenue per available room occupancy percent times average room rate

ii costs and operating expenses total operating expenses increased  or in this increase is primarily attributable to the impairment of the lakeside property of  and an increase in other operating expenses of  excluding the impairment of the lakeside property  total operating costs increased primarily as a result of increased food and beverage costs 
food and beverage costs as a percent of food and beverage revenue increased to in from in the primary reason for the increase in this percentage is a result of costs incurred for promotional campaigns and marketing plans to reposition the restaurant at the clarion fourwinds resort  aurora inn and regal mccormick ranch 
included in costs and operating expenses in is a loss for the impairment of the lakeside property in the amount of  recorded in the fourth quarter of the circumstances leading up to this impairment loss were primarily a result of the existing and expected local market conditions  a decreasing trend in the property s appraised value and historical operating results in recent years 
this loss was recognized in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of sfas no 
 which was issued by the financial accounting standards board in march and adopted by the partnership in the fourth quarter of the partnership believes that expected future cash flows from the operations of its other hotel properties will be sufficient to recover their carrying values 
the partnership has no current plans to sell any of its properties for less than their carrying values 
total operating expenses increased  or in this increase is attributable to an increase in hotel operating expenses of  and an increase in other operating expenses of  hotel operating expenses increased in primarily as a result of overall increases in occupancy and revenue 
the increase in other operating expenses in is due to an increase of in marketing expenses primarily as a result of increases in franchise fee rates at two of the three sheraton properties 
the increase in other operating expenses in is due to a increase in depreciation and amortization from renovations completed in june on the sheraton inn buffalo airport and other capital additions 
other expense increased  or in this change is primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense of  due to higher levels of debt  net of a  decrease in amortization of debt issue costs 
other income and expense remained relatively consistent in as compared to interest expense increased in primarily as a result of increases in the interest rate offset by decreases in the total indebtedness level 
the increase in interest expense in was offset in part by a gain of  recognized in on an insurance settlement 
ii liquidity and capital resources cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was  in  a decrease of  from this decrease is the result of a decrease in cash received from customers  due to lower hotel revenues  of  an increase of  in interest paid  and an increase in cash paid to employees of  offset in part by decreases in cash paid to suppliers and vendors of  and increases in other cash receipts of  net cash provided by operating activities was  in  a decrease of  from this decrease is the result of an increase in cash paid to suppliers and vendors for increased costs and expenses of  offset in part by increases in cash received from customers for increased hotel revenue of  and other cash receipts of  and decreases in cash paid to employees of  and interest paid of  net cash used in investing activities increased  in due to increases in capital expenditures and cash paid for other assets 
net cash used in investing activities decreased  in due to decreases in capital expenditures and cash paid for other assets 
net cash generated by financing activities increased  in primarily due to the closing of the new first mortgage loan 
net cash used in financing activities increased  in  primarily due to increases in principal payments on the partnership s indebtedness 
the partnership anticipates funding its debt service obligations  and capital expenditures through a combination of operating cash flows and draws on its line of credit  to handle seasonal demands  as necessary 
the partnership has capital improvements of approximately  planned in indebtedness at december  the partnership had a working capital deficit of  the partnership s working capital requirements are expected to be satisfied through the management of payables  collection of receivables  and use of the partnership s revolving credit line 
on june   the partnership signed a credit agreement with a new lender to provide a new  first mortgage loan and a  revolving credit line 
the proceeds of the  first mortgage loan were used to pay off the existing mortgage loan and the note payable to bank with the balance available for certain property renovations and the payment of a facility fee and closing costs 
regal hotels international holdings limited rhl  an affiliate of the general partner  has provided a limited guarantee for the new first mortgage loan 
the partnership paid a loan guarantee fee of  to rhl 
this is an annual fee and is calculated as of the outstanding loan balance at june of each year 
ii the new credit agreement includes a variety of interest rate options  the most favorable of which at present is the eurodollar rate plus  which was at december  repayment of the new first mortgage loan is based on a twenty year amortization with a maturity date at june  while the revolving credit line is renewable annually at the option of the lender 
a condition of the credit agreement signed by the partnership for the first mortgage loan and revolving credit line required the subordination of the  notes payable to ahs the notes 
ahs has agreed to this subordination  and as a result  on september   the board of directors of ahs  in its capacity as general partner  and the advisory committee of the ahp authorized the extension of the term and deferral of certain past due interest on the notes 
pursuant to this extension  the notes  which originally matured in january now become due on june   which is coterminous with the new mortgage loan 
interest accrued on the notes after december   was paid at closing 
interest incurred subsequent to closing continues to be accrued at per annum and is paid monthly 
the unpaid interest on the notes accrued prior to january   in the amount of  was converted into debt pursuant to a new promissory note new note which will also mature on june  the new note accrues interest at the rate of per annum  payable at maturity 
the notes and new notes are convertible into class a units of the partnership at per unit 
in addition  these notes stipulate that of any excess cashflow  as defined  will be applied against the principal portion of the notes outstanding 
the new first mortgage loan contains numerous covenants requiring  among other matters  the maintenance of a minimum debt service coverage ratio including the deferral of management fees payable to an affiliate if this minimum debt service ratio is not achieved  restrictions on additional indebtedness  limitations on annual cash distributions to class a unitholders  limitations on the payment of principal on the affiliate notes payable  prepayment premiums during the first two years  and maintenance of minimum aggregate capital expenditures of revenues in and of revenues thereafter 
partnership distributions and unit conversions the partnership agreement provides for periodic distribution of distributable cash flow  as defined  to the partners subject to any applicable restrictions and the discretion of the general partner 
distributable cash flow is generally defined as cash flow from operations of the hotel properties 
such cash is allocated and distributed net of ahs s general partnership interest in the operating partnerships to the class a unitholders and to the general partner until the class a unitholders have received defined minimum annual distributions 
the minimum annual distribution is per class a unit 
any portion of the minimum annual distribution that is not paid by the partnership in any year is added to the cumulative unpaid minimum annual distribution 
the partnership has not made any distributions since prior to making future distributions  the partnership will comply with its capital expenditure requirements as specified in its mortgage loan agreement and maintain sufficient working capital balances 
at december   the cumulative unpaid minimum annual distribution per class a unit significantly exceeds the partnership s net asset value per unit based on the appraised values of the hotel properties 
at this time it is uncertain whether there will be any excess cash flow to be available for distribution to the class a unitholders in ii the class b units entitle each unitholder to a limited partnership interest which is subordinated to the class a units 
the class b units are redeemable or convertible in certain circumstances 
the class b units do not receive distributions until the class a unitholders receive minimum annual distributions which have not been made by the partnership since through  the class b units are convertible into class a units only to the extent that distributable cash flow of the partnership in the previous year would have been sufficient to pay minimum annual distributions for the class a units  including the class b units to be converted 
the partnership does not expect any class b units to be converted in beginning in  during the day period following the release of the partnership s annual audited financial statements  and each year thereafter through  a minimum of  class b units are required to be converted at a redemption value of per class b unit  by issuing class a units valued at the then current market price of a class a unit 
therefore  the number of class a units to be issued upon the conversion of a class b unit will be determined at the time of conversion by dividing by the then current market price of a class a unit 
current market price for this calculation is the average market price for a class a unit during the last five days prior to conversion 
based on current market prices of the class a units  such required conversion is expected to result in substantial dilution to the preconversion class a unitholders 
for example  based on the average closing month end market price of class a units during of approximately  the conversion of  class b units in the first year of the required conversion period would result in an approximate dilution to the class a unitholders upon conversion 
the conversion of all  class b units would result in an approximate dilution to the preconversion class a unitholders at the per unit market price 
in addition  using the same per unit market price for a class a unit of  affiliate ownership of class a units would increase to approximately and upon conversion of the first  class b units and conversion of all  class b units  respectively 
changes in the market price of class a units do not result in proportional changes in dilution 
the market price of the partnership s class a units is subject to fluctuations and there is no assurance that such prices upon conversion will approximate the average per unit market price in pursuant to the partnership agreement  the class a units to be issued upon conversion of the class b units must be identical to the class a units existing prior to the conversion date 
if the general partner determines  based on advice of counsel  that no reasonable allowable convention or other method is available to preserve the uniformity of the intrinsic tax characteristics of any specifically identifiable group of units  such units will be separately identified  to the extent practicable  as distinct classes to reflect intrinsic tax differences  regardless of any such non uniformity 
property values the appraised value of the properties is  at december   which exceeds their carrying values of  in accordance with statement on financial accounting standards on accounting for the impairment of long lived assets  which was issued in  the partnership has recognized an impairment on the lakeside property 
the partnership has no current plans to sell any of its properties for less than their carrying values 
ii income taxes in accordance with the revenue act of  the partnership will become a taxable entity in as a result  the income of the partnership will be taxable as a corporation and distributions from the partnership will continue to be taxable to the individual partners 
the partnership anticipates that it will have an excess of tax basis over book basis of the hotel properties at january  of approximately  which will result in tax deductions in and later years 
therefore  the partnership does not expect that the impact on net income in from becoming a taxable entity will be significant 
the partnership is continuing to evaluate various alternatives to minimize the impact on the partnership as a result of these changes in tax laws 
inflation the rate of inflation as measured by changes in the average consumer price index has not had a material impact on the revenue or net income of the partnership in the three most recent years 
other matters management of the partnership  the board of directors of the general partner and the advisory committee are seeking to increase the value of the partnership for all of its unitholders 
management has been evaluating and will continue to evaluate different strategies for maximizing unitholder value including  i continued ownership and operation of the properties  ii liquidation  sale or other similar transactions  iii sales of one or more of the partnership s properties in response to exceptional offers  and iv combining the partnership or its assets with other hotel owning entities 
during  the general partner has received suggestions from certain class a unitholders regarding  i the reconfiguration of the partnership as a real estate investment trust reit  ii a reorganization of the partnership involving the redemption of the interests of the general partner and its affiliates the majority unitholders and iii sales of one or more of the partnership s properties 
the suggestions made concerning the reconfiguration of the partnership as a reit and the reorganization transaction were each rejected by the partnership because they each called for the majority unitholders to surrender substantial economic entitlements in the partnership without adequate compensation 
the partnership also rejected an offer to sell the durham property for approximately three quarters of its present appraised value 
unless and until such time as management identifies one or more preferable strategic alternatives the partnership intends to pursue its current strategy of owning and operating its existing portfolio of properties
