related entities surgical aids partnership 
in  genzyme sponsored the surgical aids partnership the partnership  a research and development limited partnership that raised million through the private placement of limited partnership interests and warrants to purchase shares of the company s common stock 
a wholly owned subsidiary of genzyme is the general partner of the partnership and holds a partnership interest therein 
the general division entered into a contract with the partnership to perform research and development of products based on ha  a naturally occurring biopolymer  for use as surgical aids to reduce the incidence and severity of postoperative adhesions and  in arthroscopic procedures  as a synovial fluid replacement for which the general division was reimbursed its costs plus a fee 
under the terms of the various agreements between the partnership and genzyme  the partnership has the exclusive right to sell seprafilm tm formerly called hal f tm  sepracoat tm formerly called hal c tm  sepragel tm formerly called hal g tm  hal s tm and other ha based surgical products in the united states and canada through a joint venture with the general division the joint venture 
the general division was granted back an exclusive license to sell these products outside the united states and canada subject to a royalty on european sales of these products under certain circumstances 
the joint venture was formed in for the purpose of manufacturing and marketing the partnership s products  but is not expected to engage in active business until receipt of marketing approval for a product from the fda 
the general division will be reimbursed for its costs of manufacturing the products and will be compensated for its general and administrative services in an amount to be determined by the venturers 
the parties will share in the profits and losses of the joint venture 
the joint venture will be dissolved a upon purchase by the general division of all of the limited partnership interests  b if the general division does not exercise its option to purchase the limited partnership interests i upon the sale  license or other disposition of all or a substantial part of its technology by the partnership or ii upon days notice by either venturer at any time after the expiration of a one year period commencing after the option to purchase the limited partnership interests expires  whichever shall first occur  c by operation of law  d upon the bankruptcy  retirement  withdrawal or dissolution of genzyme  e upon mutual consent of the general division and the partnership or f upon the election by the partnership if the general division shall fail to establish to the satisfaction of the partnership that it is capable of and has undertaken to manufacture the joint venture s requirements for the products for a specified period 
all of the funds of the partnership available to fund development of the ha products were spent by the end of the first quarter of genzyme believes that additional funds will be required to complete the development  clinical testing and commercialization of the ha products 
while genzyme is not obligated to provide such funding  the option to purchase all of the limited partnership interests terminates unless genzyme commits  on an annual basis  to provide funding for continuation of the research and development programs for the next twelve month period or until receipt of fda marketing approval for one of the ha products is obtained  whichever is shortest 
the general division funded these activities in and and has committed to fund them for the twelve month period commencing on march  in addition  the general division has the option to buy all of the limited partnership interests in the partnership for an initial payment of either cash or general division stock or a combination thereof  at its option  equal to of the amount initially invested by the limited partners which amount will be recovered by the general division as a credit against subsequent royalty payments and quarterly royalty payments for a period of ten years after the buy out date equal to of product sales in the united states and canada and of such sales in europe  but only to the extent necessary to meet certain projections made in connection with the funding of the partnership and of any revenues derived by the general division from sales in the united states and canada and in europe  but only in the instances cited above of non ha based products that are competitive with the partnership s products 
the option to purchase all of the limited partnership interests is exercisable during a day period commencing on the last day of the forty eighth month after the first commercial sale of a product by the joint venture  but such commencement date will be accelerated under certain circumstances 
on january   genzyme made a proposal to a special committee of the board of directors of the general partner of the partnership the special committee  offering to purchase substantially all of the assets of the partnership for approximately million payable in shares of general division stock 
genzyme s offer is subject to several conditions  including that the offer receive the affirmative vote of two thirds in interest of the limited partners of the partnership and that genzyme receive satisfactory assurance from its independent accountants that the purchase may be accounted for as a purchase of in process research and development 
the special committee has consulted with its financial and legal advisors in respect of genzyme s offer and negotiations between the parties are ongoing 
there can be no assurance that any agreement between the parties will be reached and  if an agreement is reached  there can be no assurance as to its terms 
failure to reach an agreement regarding the acquisition of the partnership s assets by genzyme will not affect the respective rights and obligations of the parties under any of the existing agreements between the parties 
genzyme transgenics corporation 
in february  genzyme formed genzyme transgenics corporation gtc and transferred to it all assets and liabilities of its business in the field of transgenic technology as applied to the development and production of recombinant proteins for therapeutic and diagnostic uses in exchange for shares of gtc s stock 
in addition  it exclusively licensed to gtc all patents  licenses and other intellectual property in the field excluding that related to cftr 
in july  gtc completed an initial public offering of its common stock  which resulted in net proceeds to gtc of approximately million  after which genzyme s ownership interest was reduced to approximately 
in  gtc acquired tsi corporation tsi issuing common stock for the tsi common stock 
as a result of that transaction  genzyme s percentage ownership of gtc common stock declined to approximately 
in february  gtc exercised its put option with genzyme  originally entered into at the time of gtc s initial public offering  and the general division thereby purchased an additional  shares of gtc common stock 
in june  genzyme purchased an additional  shares of gtc common stock in exchange for a million reduction in the amount due from gtc under the genzyme gtc credit agreement 
in july  genzyme exchanged  shares of general division common stock for  shares of gtc common stock in connection with gtc s acquisition of biodevelopment laboratories  inc subsequent to these transactions  genzyme owns approximately of gtc 
in march  genzyme and gtc entered into a convertible debt and development funding agreement under which i genzyme has made available to gtc a million credit line of debt payable on march  and convertible by either party into shares of gtc common stock  ii genzyme has agreed to fund the development costs associated with transgenic recombinant antithrombin iii atiii  and iii in exchange for funding such development costs and for making available the credit line  genzyme has received the right to co market atiii with gtc throughout the world  other than asia 
under contractual arrangements between genzyme and gtc  the general division has  in the past  engaged gtc to perform transgenic research and development on cftr and may engage gtc to perform transgenic research and development on other proteins of interest to genzyme 
gtc has contracted with the general division for purification and protein chemistry research and development services 
genzyme leases laboratory and office space to gtc and provides it with certain administrative and support services for which gtc pays fees based on genzyme s costs 
neozyme ii corporation 
in  genzyme sponsored an initial public offering by neozyme ii corporation neozyme ii which resulted in gross proceeds to neozyme ii of approximately million from the sale of units the neozyme ii units 
the neozyme ii units consisted of one share of the callable common stock of neozyme ii  one warrant  which expires on december   to purchase one share of general division stock and 
share of tr stock at a combined exercise price of per warrant the series n warrants and one warrant to purchase one share of general division stock and 
share of tr stock  which may not be exercised unless and until genzyme s option to purchase all of the shares of the callable common stock of neozyme ii terminates unexercised the callable warrants  in which case the callable warrants will be exercisable for two years 
genzyme has an option the neozyme ii purchase option to purchase all of the shares of the callable common stock of neozyme ii at any time on or before december  if the neozyme ii purchase option is exercised  the callable warrants will terminate 
the exercise price of the neozyme ii purchase option was per share on december  and increases monthly thereafter to a final exercise price of per share in december the exercise price may be paid in cash  shares of general division stock or any combination thereof  at the discretion of genzyme 
if the neozyme ii purchase option is not exercised  the exercise price of each callable warrant will be equal to the sum of the average of the closing sale prices of one share of general division stock and 
share of tr stock for the trading days immediately preceding the exercisability thereof 
genzyme has licensed to neozyme ii all technology owned or controlled and sublicensable by it for use in developing therapeutic products for the treatment of cystic fibrosis the neozyme ii products which products may be commercialized on a worldwide basis exclusively and royalty free 
the neozyme ii products  which currently include gene therapy and protein replacement products for the treatment of cf and a product primarily intended to treat specific infections common in cf patients  may be expanded to include other products if agreed upon by genzyme and neozyme ii 
neozyme ii has engaged the general division to conduct research  development and clinical testing of the neozyme ii products under a research and development agreement and will utilize substantially all of the net proceeds from the offering  including interest earned thereon  to fund the general division s activities under the agreement 
genzyme believes that additional funding will be necessary in order to complete clinical testing and commercialization of the neozyme ii products 
the business of the general division therapeutics the general division s strategy is to use its technological strengths  particularly its ability to modify and produce dna and proteins and its expertise in fermentation  carbohydrate engineering and gene therapy  to develop safe and effective therapeutic products for selected markets 
the general division is currently selling ceredase r enzyme and cerezyme r enzyme and has several therapeutic products in various stages of the research  development  clinical testing and regulatory review processes 
certain of these products are being developed on behalf of the partnership and neozyme ii 
there can be no assurance that development of any product will be successfully completed or that fda approval of any product will be obtained

preclinical development status includes work done to increase yields and standardize manufacturing processes and studies in animals to support an application to the fda to commence clinical testing in humans 
human clinical trials for products classified by the fda as drugs or biologics are generally conducted in three phases phase i  to determine safety and pharmacokinetics  phase ii  to provide preliminary evidence of efficacy  and phase iii  sometimes referred to as pivotal trials  to provide data for proof of safety and effectiveness 
following completion of the clinical studies  an application for marketing approval of a new drug an nda or licensure of a biological product a pla is submitted to the fda 
clinical trials for products classified by the fda as devices are generally conducted in two phases initial studies to evaluate safety and feasibility  followed by expanded trials to prove safety and effectiveness 
an application for marketing approval a pma is then submitted to the fda 
ceredase r enzyme alglucerase injection and cerezyme r enzyme imiglucerase for injection 
treatment with ceredase r or cerezyme r enzyme replacement therapy currently represents the only safe and effective treatment for gaucher disease  a seriously debilitating  sometimes fatal genetic disorder caused by a deficiency in an important enzyme in the body called glucocerebrosidase gcr 
this deficiency results in the accumulation of the lipid glucocerebroside in the body 
the disease is characterized by an enlarged liver or spleen  anemia  bleeding problems  bone and joint pain  fatigue and orthopedic complications such as repeated fractures and bone erosion 
ceredase r is a modified form of human gcr in which glycoprotein remodeling technology has been used to target gcr to the cells where the lipid accumulation occurs 
cerezyme r is a recombinant form of gcr which has been remodeled in a similar manner 
the general division is marketing these products directly to physicians  hospitals and treatment centers worldwide through a highly trained sales force 
the worldwide marketing effort is directed at identifying and initiating treatment for the  gaucher patients the general division believes exist worldwide 
currently  approximately one third of these patients are receiving treatment 
ceredase r is available in approximately countries worldwide 
the product has received marketing approval in countries with applications pending in countries 
the general division produces ceredase r enzyme from raw material extracted from human placental tissue 
pasteur merieux  located in france  is the only significant commercial source of this material 
the supply of starting material available for the production of ceredase r enzyme effectively limits the amount of product that can be produced 
the current available supply is not sufficient to produce enough ceredase r enzyme to supply all present patients 
any disruption in the manufacturing process for ceredase r enzyme may have a material adverse effect on the division s revenues in any period 
to address supply constraints for ceredase r enzyme  which is limited by the amount of new material available from human placental tissue  the general division has developed cerezyme r enzyme 
cerezyme r is a recombinant form of modified gcr which has been shown in human clinical trials to be equivalent to ceredase r in its safety and effectiveness in the treatment of gaucher disease 
in may  genzyme received us marketing approval for cerezyme r from the fda 
cerezyme r has also received marketing approval in israel and sweden and is available on a named patient basis in canada  germany and brazil 
the general division is presently producing cerezyme r enzyme in its small scale manufacturing plant in framingham  massachusetts 
a large scale mammalian cell manufacturing facility located in boston  massachusetts is undergoing validation and review prior to application for fda approval to use it for full scale manufacturing of cerezyme r enzyme  which application is expected to be submitted in see item properties 
the general division believes that sales of cerezyme r enzyme will gradually supplant sales of ceredase r enzyme 
although protein replacement is currently the only existing therapy for gaucher disease  the general division is collaborating with a university and a gene therapy company to develop a gene therapy for gaucher disease 
these efforts are in the research stage 
ha products 
the general division is developing the ha products to be used during surgical procedures to limit the formation of postoperative adhesions and  in arthroscopic procedures of the joints  as a synovial fluid replacement 
adhesions are fibrous structures that connect tissues or organ surfaces that are not normally joined 
they are an undesirable side effect of the body s normal healing process following damage to tissue 
adhesions can cause significant complications such as bowel obstruction following abdominal surgery  infertility and pain following gynecological surgery and restricted limb motion following musculoskeletal surgery 
moreover  adhesions that form as a result of cardiac surgery can increase the complexity  duration and risk of subsequent cardiac surgery 
the general division believes that approximately million of the million abdominal  gynecologic  musculoskeletal and cardiac surgical procedures performed each year in the us could benefit from the use of the ha products  as could the comparable number of these procedures that are performed each year outside the us the division currently is developing the following ha based products seprafilm tm bioresorbable membrane is a solid formulation of modified ha and is used to separate and protect tissues and organs that have been damaged by surgery 
the membrane is designed to last several days in the body 
sepracoat tm coating solution is a liquid formulation of ha that  when used to coat tissues and organ surfaces at the start of and throughout surgical procedures  forms a temporary physical barrier that may protect tissues during surgery 
sepragel tm bioresorbable gel is a highly viscous gel form of modified ha and is intended to be used to separate and protect tissues and organs that have been damaged by surgery 
sepragel tm is intended to be used in laporoscopic procedures and on tissue surfaces that are inaccessible to seprafilm tm 
similar to seprafilm tm  the gel is designed to last several days in the body 
hal s tm synovial fluid replacement is a liquid formulation of ha intended to be used during arthroscopic surgery to maintain normal joint function and to reduce pain and inflammation following surgery 
the programs to develop the four ha products achieved a number of significant milestones in two pivotal clinical trials for seprafilm tm bioresorbable membrane were completed during  one in abdominal surgery and the other in gynecological surgery 
the results of each of these studies indicated that use of seprafilm tm significantly reduced the incidence  extent and severity of adhesions following surgery 
based on these results  a pma was filed with the fda in october for approval to market seprafilm tm in the us for abdominal and gynecological applications 
on march   an advisory panel of the fda recommended that approval be granted to market seprafilm tm to reduce postoperative adhesion formation in both types of surgery studied in the two pivotal clinical trials conducted for seprafilm tm 
the panel s recommendation for approval was conditioned on a requirement that post marketing surveillance be conducted to monitor possible adverse events 
the panel s recommendation will be considered in the fda s final review of the pma for seprafilm tm  but is not binding upon the fda 
clinical trials for sepracoat tm coating were completed in in october  genzyme announced that the results of this study indicated that use of sepracoat tm significantly reduced the incidence of postoperative adhesions 
in january  genzyme filed a pma to market sepracoat tm for use in abdominal  pelvic and cardio thoracic surgical procedures 
the fda has notified genzyme that the sepracoat tm pma will receive expedited review 
a clinical trial for hal s tm synovial fluid replacement was completed in november the results of this study have been collected and currently are being reviewed and analyzed and are expected to be made available during the first half of if the results of the study show hal s tm to be safe and effective  a pma to market hal s tm for such procedures will be filed with the fda 
genzyme is currently developing a clinical strategy and conducting stability studies in anticipation of filing an investigational device exemption an ide with the fda for sepragel tm bioresorbable gel during clinical trials of sepragel tm will commence soon after receipt of the ide 
genzyme  on behalf of the joint venture  is in the process of preparing for marketing of seprafilm tm in the us and canada 
genzyme has received approval in canada to market seprafilm tm bioresorbable membrane on behalf of the joint venture and has received authorization from the fda to export the product to canada 
test marketing in canada is expected to begin during genzyme has  for its own account  initiated marketing efforts for seprafilm tm in europe 
genzyme has been notified by regulatory agencies in the netherlands  sweden  denmark and ireland that such agencies have no objection to genzyme marketing seprafilm tm in those countries at this time 
authorization from the fda for export of the product to these four countries has been obtained  and genzyme began test marketing seprafilm tm in the netherlands late in in february  genzyme obtained notification that seprafilm tm had been granted the approval of conformity certificate a ce mark in accordance with the european community ec medical devices directive 
the ce mark signifies that a product meets quality standards necessary for marketing in the ec and will allow introduction of seprafilm tm more rapidly into europe 
genzyme believes that successful initial market penetration and subsequent maintenance of market share for seprafilm tm and sepracoat tm may require a specialized hospital based sales force 
a substantial effort to educate surgeons and hospital administrators as to the benefits of these products will be required in order for the products to gain broad market acceptance 
the efforts to develop marketing and sales capabilities are at an early stage 
significant additional resources will be required to penetrate target markets 
funding for the development of all four of these products has been provided by the partnership  which has the exclusive right to commercialize these products in the united states and canada through the joint venture the partnership also has the right to a royalty on the general division s european sales of these products under certain circumstances 
early in  the general division began funding development of these products on behalf of the partnership and has committed to continue such funding for the months commencing march  see related entities surgical aids partnership 
thyrogen r hormone 
the general division is developing thyrogen r hormone  a recombinant form of human thyroid stimulating hormone tsh  which is intended for use as an adjunct to the approximately  to  diagnostic and therapeutic procedures undertaken each year to detect and treat metastases of thyroid cancer 
the general division believes that the administration of thyrogen r hormone may be more effective and result in fewer adverse side effects for patients undergoing current standard medical procedures for thyroid cancer 
thyrogen r hormone was demonstrated to be safe and effective in stimulating the uptake of radioiodine for whole body scanning in a phase i ii clinical study 
a phase iii multi center clinical study completed late in provided evidence that the use of thyrogen r hormone prior to diagnostic scanning greatly improved the quality of life in of thyroid cancer patients tested and was effective in producing scans that were as good as or better than conventional scans in 
to confirm the results of this study  the general division is conducting a second phase iii study 
during it is anticipated that thyrogen r hormone will be made available to patients who meet certain criteria under a treatment ind which will allow genzyme to gather additional information regarding use of the product while recovering appropriate costs of the product and the treatment 
tretinoin lf 
the general division is collaborating with aronex to develop and commercialize a proprietary liposomal formulation of the retinoid known as all trans retinoic acid tretinoin lf for the treatment of cancer 
the initial indications chosen for clinical development of tretinoin lf are acute promyelocytic leukemia and kaposi s sarcoma 
the general division and aronex believe that tretinoin lf will also have application in the treatment of other cancers 
although numerous clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of oral retinoids against certain cancers  the use of these drugs has been limited because patients often develop intolerance to the drug followed by relapse of their cancers 
the general division and aronex believe that tretinoin lf will overcome these limitations 
separate phase ii clinical trials of tretinoin lf for treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia and of kaposi s sarcoma are currently ongoing 
pursuant to the agreements with aronex  the general division made a million equity investment in aronex and is required to make milestone payments totaling million and share in the development funding for the project 
the general division also has an obligation to make an additional equity investment of million in aronex following the occurrence of a clinical milestone 
antithrombin iii atiii 
atiii is a human blood protein which acts as an anticoagulant 
depressed levels of atiii can lead to increased risk of thrombosis clotting in patients with either hereditary atiii deficiency or an acquired atiii deficiency often associated with multiple disease states  such as sepsis  various surgeries  multiple trauma and liver disease 
natural atiii derived from donated human plasma currently is sold worldwide for multiple indications 
the general division is funding efforts at gtc to develop a transgenic source for atiii to address anticipated growth in volume requirements in the market to treat atiii deficiency by protein replacement therapy 
the general division believes that current sources of plasma derived atiii will be inadequate to address this growth 
in combination with tufts and smig  gtc has developed a herd of transgenic goats at its production facility in central massachusetts 
these goats have produced active recombinant atiii 
gtc is preparing to file an ind to initiate a phase i clinical trial of atiii and anticipates conducting this trial during the general division is funding this development work through a recently concluded development funding and co marketing agreement under which the general division has obtained co marketing rights for the product outside of asia 
cystic fibrosis 
on behalf of neozyme ii  the general division is engaged in research  development and clinical testing of biotherapeutic products for the treatment of cystic fibrosis by gene therapy or protein replacement therapy and for the treatment and prevention of pseudomonas bacteria infections in cf patients the cf products 
cf is the most common fatal genetic disease affecting the caucasian population 
approximately one in every  infants in the united states is born with the disease and there currently are approximately  cystic fibrosis patients in north america 
cf is caused by a mutation in the gene responsible for determining the molecular structure of a protein called cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator cftr 
although improvements have been made over the last years in alleviating certain symptoms of the disease and delaying its progress  the underlying disease remains untreated and patients have an average life expectancy of only years 
the general division s work has initially concentrated on two promising approaches to correct the basic defect in cf cells gene therapy  to augment the mutant genes with genes that would enable the patient s cells to produce normal cftr protein and protein replacement therapy to replace the missing or defective cftr protein with properly functioning cftr protein 
for technical and competitive reasons  the gene therapy approach has been emphasized during the last two years  and currently the protein replacement program is largely inactive 
gene therapy 
in october  results of a study approved by the recombinant dna advisory committee the rac of the national institutes of health the nih showed that it is possible to correct the biochemical defect in cystic fibrosis cells in vivo 
the study results were the first published report of a successful gene transfer in cystic fibrosis patients and the first successful application of an adenovirus vector in gene therapy 
in december  one of the general division s collaborators received rac approval for a study involving repeat administration of the general division s second generation adenovirus vector to the nasal epithelium and sinus passages of cf patients 
the nasal part of the study was completed in the second quarter of aggregated data from this study showed limited evidence of gene expression at the intermediate doses but not at the highest dose 
the virus appeared safe  but a complex immune response to the adenovirus was measured in almost all patients 
this and other data obtained in animal studies suggests that immune response may limit the efficacy of repeat dose therapy with adenovirus 
a two part safety study of genzyme s second generation adenovirus vector administered via bronchoscope and aerosol involving cf patients commenced during and is currently on going 
in september  genzyme switched to the use of a third generation adenovirus vector with an improved safety profile as part of this same study 
in parallel with the early phase clinical studies  the general division is conducting extensive research into improving the safety and efficacy of adenovirus 
particular emphasis is being placed on immunology  since it is highly likely that new vectors or methods need to be developed so as to reduce the patient s immune response and to increase the efficacy of adenovirus vectors 
such improvements may be necessary in order for adenovirus vectors to be clinically useful in chronic therapy 
in addition to its work with viral vectors  the general division is developing  both internally and in collaboration with others  alternative technologies for the delivery of cftr to cf patients 
to date  the most significant collaborative arrangement is an exclusive research agreement with vical  inc to evaluate that company s cytofectins as non viral delivery vectors for treating cystic fibrosis 
although substantial progress has been made in this work  currently the optimal formulation of the best of these alternatives is still less efficient that adenovirus 
during  the general division initiated a collaboration with a british academic group in gene therapy utilizing lipids 
another of the general division s collaborators commenced a study in of a cf nasal protocol utilizing a lipid dna complex containing one of vical s proprietary cytofectins which is currently on going 
a nasal study involving a proprietary lipid dna complex developed by genzyme commenced in january because of the innovative nature of gene therapy and public policy issues surrounding the insertion of new genetic information into cells  the general division expects that early clinical evaluation will continue to entail especially careful testing in a limited number of patients 
the general division expects to continue preliminary clinical testing of its gene therapy products in the timing and results of these initial studies will determine whether and when pivotal trials to determine safety and effectiveness will be undertaken 
these pivotal trials may involve large groups of patients for lengthy periods of time in order to address the uncertainties surrounding insertion of new genetic information into humans and to show clinical effectiveness in the treatment of a progressive disease 
protein replacement therapy 
cftr is a membrane protein  a class of molecules which historically has been difficult to produce in conventional cell culture in active form and in quantities 
genzyme  however  has developed recombinant cell lines that synthesize the protein and  in collaboration with researchers at gtc and elsewhere  has used transgenic expression techniques to breed mice and rabbits which secrete human cftr protein in their milk 
based on these results  genzyme engaged gtc to develop transgenic goats that express cftr protein in their milk 
although one transgenic goat was born  it did not synthesize measurable cftr in its milk and no further work is currently underway 
hypergam tm cf 
the general division is developing vaccine and passive immunization antibody based products to treat and prevent pseudomonas infections 
the majority of cystic fibrosis patients suffer from lung infections caused by this bacteria  a major medical problem and a frequent cause of hospitalization 
in many cases  the immediate cause of death in cf patients is pulmonary failure associated with these infections 
the general division is collaborating on this project with nabi 
nabi is employing an exclusively licensed proprietary technology to develop hypergam tm cf for use in passively immunizing cf patients infected with the bacteria 
a phase i clinical trial involving single dose administration of hypergam tm cf was completed in and showed that hypergam tm cf appears to be safe 
a multi center  dose ranging phase ii trial to assess safety and efficacy of the product in chronic administration commenced in the first quarter of and enrollment was completed in the first quarter of the general division believes that hypergam tm cf may be complementary to its gene therapy and protein replacement therapy products in treating or preventing pseudomonas infections in conjunction with correcting the basic defect in airway cells 
however  it is possible that the gene therapy and protein replacement products may result in an effective therapy for cf which  over time  would reduce or obviate the need for a pseudomonas treatment 
pursuant to the agreement with nabi  the general division made a million equity investment in nabi and is required to fund two thirds of the development program costs and make certain milestone payments associated with the progress of clinical trials 
nabi will manufacture the product and the general division will market it on a worldwide basis 
neozyme ii funds the general division s obligations to provide development funding and make milestone payments to nabi in exchange for the exclusive rights that the general division acquired to market hypergam tm cf on a worldwide basis and the right to its share of the profits resulting from commercialization of the product 
transgenics 
gtc  genzyme s owned affiliate  has developed methods of protein production in transgenic animals and has produced significant quantities of several human proteins  including cftr  atiii  alpha one anti trypsin and longer acting tissue plasminogen activator  in the milk of animals  including mice and goats 
transgenic production of a human protein is achieved by inserting a gene that directs the production of a desired protein into the genetic material of an animal such that the target protein is secreted in the milk of female offspring 
gtc believes that transgenic production offers significant economic and technological advantages over traditional protein production systems 
gtc s strategy is focused on utilizing this technology to develop and produce a broad range of proteins  both in collaboration with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and independently 
gtc s work in developing transgenic recombinant atiii is funded by the general division under a funding and co marketing agreement entered into in march see related entities genzyme transgenics corporation 
gtc is working with the general division and with a number of biopharmaceutical companies on feasibility studies regarding the transgenic production of specific proteins 
during  gtc completed and opened a transgenic production facility in central massachusetts that utilizes transgenic goats 
a specially selected goat herd was imported from new zealand from which transgenic animals will be bred to produce pharmaceutical proteins 
in october  gtc acquired tsi  a leading provider of preclinical testing and manufacturing support services primarily to pharmaceutical  biotechnology and chemical companies 
this acquisition was undertaken in order to expand gtc s business operations and provide a more comprehensive offering of support services to its customers 
gtc s testing businesses offer broad scientific capabilities in such fields as preclinical efficacy models  teratology  photobiology  surgery and continuous infusion 
for the year ended december   the testing businesses had revenues of approximately million 
diagnostic services the general division s diagnostic services business unit  which operates under the trade name of integrated genetics  applies advanced biotechnology to develop and provide high quality  sophisticated genetic diagnostic services to physicians  hospitals  universities  medical centers  clinical laboratories  genetic centers and managed care organizations throughout the united states and internationally 
the general division also provides identity testing services to state and local government agencies  attorneys and various courts in the us  as well as donor typing to bone marrow registries 
on october   genzyme acquired all of the publicly owned shares of ig and ig was merged into the general division 
see related parties 
in february  genzyme announced an agreement to merge genetrix  inc  a phoenix based operator of prenatal and cancer genetic testing laboratories  with genzyme in a transaction to be accounted for as a pooling of interests 
subject to the approval of the genetrix shareholders and the satisfaction or waiver of certain other conditions  the merger will be consummated  with holders of genetrix stock receiving shares of general division stock  and the operations of genetrix will be included within the diagnostic services business of the general division

the general division offers three types of genetic diagnostic services biochemical testing  classical and molecular cytogenetic testing  and dna testing 
biochemical testing services consist primarily of a widely used screening test afp used to determine if further prenatal genetic testing is appropriate 
classical and molecular cytogenetic testing involves the analysis of fetal cells obtained through amniocentesis or chorionic villi sampling cvs to evaluate chromosomal abnormalities 
dna analysis is performed to determine the likelihood that the subject has  or is a carrier for  a specific genetic disorder 
the market for these services has experienced significant growth in recent years 
the general division s strategy is to expand its genetic diagnostics business by providing a comprehensive range of high quality testing services in a timely  accurate and convenient manner  by aggressively marketing its services through a direct sales force  and by maintaining an active research and development program that enables it to introduce additional testing services based on new technologies 
the division also has an active program to expand its laboratory operations through acquisition 
the insight r test  a faster cytogenetic test based on in situ hybridization of chromosome specific dna probes  was introduced by integrated genetics in this technology permits identification of the most frequently occurring chromosomal abnormalities within hours  as compared to the one to three weeks required to perform classical cytogenetic testing karyotyping 
the insight r analysis is offered in conjunction with a complete karyotype 
cancer diagnostic services based on cytogenetics and a series of supporting tests currently focus primarily on various forms of leukemias and lymphomas 
the general division also provides testing for numerous genetic diseases including  fragile x syndrome  spinal muscular atrophy  huntington disease  polycystic kidney disease  sickle cell anemia  and hemophilia 
its current cystic fibrosis test  launched in  uses samples of cells collected by using a simple cheek brush and is capable of detecting more possible genetic mutations  more rapidly and at lower cost than methods previously available 
genetic identity testing services 
the general division also provides identity testing services principally to state and local government agencies and courts throughout the united states from its high volume testing laboratory in north carolina 
both classical blood tests and dna tests are used to provide customers with reports as to the likelihood of paternity 
testing services are also performed to provide forensic medical evidence which is used to identify suspects involved in violent crimes and dna testing is offered to bone marrow registries attempting to match potential donors with transplant patients 
development programs 
the general division maintains an active program aimed at identifying and developing new technologies and methods of performing genetic tests and applying these methods to improve and expand its menu of testing services 
in its own research laboratories and in collaboration with others  integrated genetics conducts major research and development programs in such areas as genomics  test platforms for complex mutational analysis  predispositional testing for cancer and other late onset diseases  and rare cell separation and analysis methods 
since introduction of the first generation insight r rapid cytogenetic analysis test in  the company has developed numerous other fish probes and various dna tests  including a sophisticated mutation cystic fibrosis cheek brush test 
in  proprietary new multiple allele specific diagnostic assay masda technology was introduced 
masda is an efficient  accurate and cost effective dna test method for high throughput complex mutational analysis which can simultaneously detect more than one hundred known mutations in hundreds of patient samples 
also in  the genomics group  together with their collaborators  announced the full identification of the pkd gene  which causes polycystic kidney disease  a common genetic disorder that leads to renal failure by middle age in most affected individuals 
this group is also involved in the discovery of the gene for the most common cause of inherited cardiac arrhythmia  long qt syndrome  also known as sudden death syndrome 
the general division is now beginning to use the masda technology in its in house predispositional assay development 
this program is aimed at identifying causative genetic mutations associated with various cancers and certain other diseases where the ability to test a large number of genetic mutations is critical 
work in the genomics program continues to focus on finding and understanding important genes that have a potential diagnostic and therapeutic use for various sectors of genzyme s businesses 
the general division continues its efforts to develop methods and procedures to isolate and genetically analyze fetal cells obtained from maternal blood samples 
the program has demonstrated the feasibility of a separation technology involving the use of combinations of antibodies that bind selectively to specific cell types and has developed appropriate immobilization and analytical methods 
however  at this point  the process does not meet the division s consistency standards well enough to commercialize it as a high quality diagnostic test 
fetal cells obtained from maternal blood serum could potentially be used in lieu of cells derived from amniotic fluid or chorionic villi for genetic testing  thereby avoiding the risk associated with amniocentesis or cvs 
the general division believes that successful development of techniques which permit prenatal genetic testing of samples obtained from mothers on a low risk basis  using rapid low cost detection methods such as insight r  can result in a substantial expansion of the market for prenatal testing 
significant resources continue to be focused on this research program

the general division sells devices and reagents for the quantification of ldl and hdl cholesterol levels 
in particular  the general division has developed and commercialized an in vitro diagnostic test kit the direct ldl tm test kit for the direct measurement of ldl cholesterol in blood samples 
the correlation between elevated blood cholesterol levels and increased risk of coronary heart disease  one of the leading causes of death in the united states  is well established 
a high level of ldl cholesterol in the blood indicates an increased risk of coronary heart disease 
prior to the approval of the division s kit  there was no routine direct standardized test for measuring ldl cholesterol and ldl cholesterol levels were derived using several indirect measurements and estimates  each contributing a potential source of error to the calculation 
diagnostic intermediates 
the general division produces and sells critical components such as diagnostic enzymes  substrates  proteins and reagents for use in diagnostic kits used for blood analysis in clinical chemistry laboratories 
one primary diagnostic area of emphasis for the general division is pancreatic function  where it provides enzymes  substrates  bulk reagents and patented methodologies for amylase and lipase determination to diagnostic kit manufacturers

in  melatonin  a synthetic human hormone present in a variety of foods and marketed as a dietary supplement  became the largest selling chemical product manufactured by the general division 
in  the general division began supplying bulk quantities of melatonin in response to demand from manufacturers of final dosage form product 
in addition  genzyme has developed its melapure tm melatonin trademark and marketing program to identify melapure tm as a high quality material 
genzyme has developed and currently is marketing outside the us a tableted finished dosage form product 
clindamycin phosphate 
the general division currently produces and sells clindamycin phosphate  an off patent antibiotic widely used by hospitals for the treatment of infections 
clindamycin phosphate is sold to pharmaceutical companies in the united states  europe  japan and the middle east through the division s worldwide sales organization 
hyaluronic acid 
the general division currently produces and sells bulk hyaluronic acid ha for a number of applications 
under an agreement with alcon  the general division supplies ha powder to alcon for incorporation into provisc r  an ha based ophthalmic surgical aid product  which alcon introduced in the general division also receives a royalty based on alcon s product sales 
hyaluronic acid is also sold to a number of customers for various research and development applications 
active drug substances and pharmaceutical intermediates 
the general division produces drug substances for leading ethical pharmaceutical companies for formulation into a variety of dosage forms 
the general division also supplies various pharmaceutical intermediaries which are converted to active drug substances by the customer 
fine chemicals 
the general division has developed a range of high value fine chemicals and chiral intermediates based on the company s proprietary technology in complex organic chemistry 
these products include various synthetic starting materials and liquid crystal chemicals for the electronics industry 
the general division markets these products through its own sales force directly to chemical and pharmaceutical companies worldwide 
synthetic phospholipids 
phospholipids are the major structural components of cell membranes 
they are useful in drug delivery systems  emulsion formulations and as components of pharmaceutical products such as liposomes 
the general division has developed proprietary technology for the large scale manufacture of synthetic phospholipids with high purity and consistency 
the general division currently produces and sells synthetic phospholipids to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in the formulation and delivery of certain of their products 
synthetic peptides and amino acid derivatives 
synthetic peptides are a class of biologically active compounds comprised of chains of amino acids 
many of these compounds have applications as active drug compounds and are used by the pharmaceutical industry in final dosage form preparations 
the general division is a commercial scale gmp manufacturer of synthetic peptides for many such applications 
amino acid derivatives are the materials used in the production of synthetic peptides 
in addition to producing these materials for use in its own peptide manufacturing processes  the general division sells amino acid derivatives to the pharmaceutical industry for use in the manufacture of peptides 
biomolecules 
the general division produces and sells a variety of biomolecules for use as bioprocessing materials in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry 
these include reagents such as dtt 
competition the general division is engaged in a segment of the human health care products industry that is extremely competitive 
competitors in the united states and elsewhere are numerous and include major pharmaceutical  chemical and biotechnology companies  many of which have substantially greater resources than genzyme 
these companies may succeed in developing products that are more effective than any that have been or may be developed by the general division and may also prove to be more successful than the general division in producing and marketing their products 
each of the general division s four business areas faces different competitive challenges therapeutics 
although the general division is not aware of any current effective alternative to its products for the treatment for gaucher disease ceredase r enzyme and cerezyme r enzyme  competition potentially could come from other protein replacement therapies or gene therapy 
the general division believes that its proprietary production techniques  exclusive raw material source for ceredase r enzyme and  to a certain extent  the orphan drug status of its products give it a number of advantages over potential competitors using protein replacement therapy for the treatment of gaucher disease 
gene therapy techniques are still in experimental stages 
the general division believes that the principal factors that will affect competition for ceredase r enzyme and cerezyme r enzyme will be clinical effectiveness and absence of adverse side effects 
one company is attempting to develop an alternative form of recombinant gcr by producing the enzyme in insect cells and modifying it by applying a coating of polyethylene glycol 
the general division believes that its expertise in developing proprietary fermentation processes and its access to proprietary strains of micro organisms used in its ha production process will give it a competitive advantage in the development of ha products 
the general division s anti adhesion products may face significant competition from other ha based products  from non ha based products and from changes in surgical techniques that would obviate the use of ha 
the general division believes that the principal factor that will affect competition in this area is acceptance of the product by surgeons  which depends  in large part  upon product performance  safety and price 
there are a number of organizations  both academic and commercial  which are engaged in developing therapies to treat either the symptoms of cf or the cause of the disease 
the general division is not aware of other non academic organizations working on a protein replacement therapy for cf 
several groups are developing gene therapy approaches to the disease and also have received rac approval to initiate limited human studies of cf gene therapy 
in addition  other organizations are investigating pharmacological and biological agents that would treat cf 
one such product  pulmozyme tm  which was developed by genentech  inc  currently is on the market 
these groups may succeed in developing gene therapy products before the general division  in obtaining patent protection that may effectively block the general division from commercializing its gene therapy or protein replacement products or in developing other drug therapies that relieve the symptoms of cystic fibrosis and  thus  compete with products under development by the general division 
diagnostic services 
the united states market for prenatal cytogenetic and biochemical testing is divided among approximately laboratories  many of which offer both types of testing 
of this total group  less than laboratories market their services nationally 
the general division believes that the industry as a whole is still quite fragmented  with the top laboratories accounting for approximately of market revenues  and with no individual company  including integrated genetics  accounting for more than of the total 
competitive factors in the genetic diagnostics services business generally include reputation of the laboratory  range of services offered  pricing  convenience of sample collection and pick up  quality of analysis and reporting and timeliness of delivery of completed reports 
the general division believes that its research and development program  which has enabled it to develop and introduce testing services based on new technology  and its active sales and marketing force have played significant roles in the rapid growth of its genetic diagnostics services business 
furthermore  in addition to the general division  several companies and academic groups are attempting to develop fetal cell separation techniques 
the general division believes that its combination of separation and analytical technologies will give it a significant competitive advantage 
diagnostic products 
the general division acts as a primary supplier of enzymes and substrates  and generally does not compete with its customers in the sale of complete diagnostic kits 
this philosophy enables the general division to maintain unique relationships with major diagnostic kit manufacturers and to engage with them in development efforts to produce new or improved kits 
the market in the diagnostic products industry is mature and competition is based on price  reliability of supply and the purity and specific activity of products 
pharmaceuticals 
competition in the pharmaceuticals business is affected primarily by production efficiency  product quality and price 
the general division believes that its success in this market is due to its technical expertise and selection of high value  small volume products which minimizes direct competition with larger production operations in commodity products 
patents and proprietary technology the general division has filed or has licensed rights to many patent applications and patents in the united states and numerous foreign countries relating to its processes and products 
in general  patents issued in the us are effective for a period of seventeen years from date of issue  although the gatt legislation recently passed changes this to twenty years from the filing date for applications filed after june  the duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with applicable local law 
the general division also relies on trade secrets  proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain a competitive position in its product areas 
genzyme s employees  consultants and corporate partners who have access to its proprietary information have signed confidentiality agreements 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will be honored or that others may not independently develop similar technology 
there can be no assurance that the general division s patent claims will offer protection against competition  or will not be designed around or infringed upon by others 
in addition  there can be no assurance that other companies will not be awarded patents that affect the general division s interests 
genzyme may be required to obtain licenses under such patents in order to manufacture and market some of its products 
there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such licenses or that such licenses will be available on commercially reasonable terms 
in addition  patent litigation is widespread in the biotechnology industry and it is not possible to predict how this will affect the division s efforts to form strategic alliances  to conduct clinical trials or to manufacture and market its products under development 
government regulation governmental regulation  in the united states and other countries  is a significant factor in the production and marketing of many of the general division s products and in its ongoing research and development activities 
fda regulation 
in the united states  products that do not achieve their principal intended purpose through chemical action within or on the body and which are not dependent upon being metabolized by the patient s body in order to be effective are classified by the fda as devices while other products are classified as drugs or biologics 
the general division s ceredase r enzyme and cerezyme r enzyme are regulated in the us as drugs  as are thyrogen r hormone and tretinoin lf 
hypergam tm cf and neozyme ii s protein replacement and gene therapy products are regulated as biologics 
the partnership s products are regulated as devices 
the direct test ldl tm cholesterol is classified as an in vitro diagnostic device 
the activities required before drugs or biologics may be marketed in the united states include i preclinical laboratory tests  in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies and formulation and stability studies  ii the submission to the fda and approval of an application for human clinical testing an ind  iii adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to prove the safety and effectiveness of the drug or biologic  iv the submission of a new drug application nda for a drug or a product license application pla for a biologic and v the approval by the fda of the nda or pla 
in addition to product approval  the manufacturer of the product may have to obtain an establishment license for a biologic that is not considered well characterized or a pre approval good manufacturing practices gmp inspection for a drug or well characterized biologic from the fda 
since any license granted by the fda is both site and process specific  any material change by a company in the manufacturing process  equipment or location necessitates additional fda review and approval 
products that are classified as devices also require fda approval prior to marketing 
devices are classified as class i  ii or iii  depending upon the information available to assure their safety and effectiveness 
in general  class i and class ii devices are devices whose safety and effectiveness can reasonably be assured through general or specific controls  respectively 
class iii devices are life sustaining  life supporting or implantable devices or new devices which have been found not to be substantially equivalent to legally marketed devices 
the steps required for approval of a class iii device include i preclinical laboratory tests and in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies  ii the submission to the fda and approval of an investigational device exemption an ide to allow initiation of clinical testing  iii human clinical studies to prove safety and effectiveness of the device  iv the submission of a pma and v the approval by the fda of the pma 
typically  clinical testing of devices involves initial testing to evaluate safety and feasibility and expanded trials to collect sufficient data to prove safety and effectiveness 
in addition  the procedures and the facilities used to manufacture the device are subject to review and approval by the fda 
a device other than a class iii device which is proved to be substantially equivalent to a device marketed prior to may   when government regulations for devices were first introduced  can be marketed after approval of a k application rather than the filing of an ide and a pma 
the k application must contain a description of the device  its methods of manufacture and quality control procedures and the results of testing to demonstrate that the device is substantially equivalent to the device already marketed 
the time and expense required to perform the clinical testing necessary to obtain fda approval can far exceed the time and expense of the research and development initially required to create the product 
even after initial fda approval has been obtained  further studies may be required to provide additional data on safety or to gain approval for the use of a product as a treatment for clinical indications other than those initially targeted 
in addition  use of these products during testing and after marketing approval has been obtained could reveal side effects which  if serious  could delay  impede or prevent marketing approval  limit uses  force a recall of the product or expose the general division to product liability claims 
regulation outside the united states 
for marketing outside the united states  the general division is subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical testing and marketing approval for its products 
these requirements vary by jurisdiction  differ from those in the us and may necessitate additional pre clinical or clinical testing whether or not fda approval has been obtained 
generally  the division s initial focus for obtaining marketing approval outside the us is europe 
european community ec directives regulations generally classify products either as medicinal products or devices 
for medicinal products  marketing approval may be sought using either the centralized procedure of the committee for proprietary medicine or products the cpmp or the decentralized mutual recognition process 
the cpmp centralized procedure results in a recommendation for approval in all member states  while the ec multi state process involves country by country approval 
ec regulations for products classified as devices have been implemented for some devices 
devices such as genzyme s ha products must receive market approval through a centralized procedure  where the device receives a ce mark allowing distribution to all member states of the european union 
for those devices where ec regulations have not been implemented  marketing approval must be obtained on a country by country basis 
the ce mark certification requires the company to receive international standards organization iso certification for each facility involved in the manufacture or distribution of the device 
this certification only comes after the development of an all inclusive quality system which is reviewed for compliance to international quality standards by a licensed notified body working within the ec 
after certification is received a product dossier is reviewed which attests to the products compliance with ec directive eec for medical devices 
only after this point is a ce mark granted ceredase r enzyme has been registered for sale in the ec through a cpmp centralized procedure 
the general division expects cerezyme r enzyme  thyrogen r hormone and the products of neozyme ii also will be regulated through centralized cpmp procedure 
seprafilm tm has been granted the ce mark 
orphan drug act 
the orphan drug act provides incentives to manufacturers to develop and market drugs for rare diseases and conditions affecting fewer than  persons in the united states at the time of application for orphan drug designation 
the first developer to receive fda marketing approval for an orphan drug is entitled to a seven year exclusive marketing period in the united states for that product 
however  a drug that is considered by the fda to be clinically superior to or different from another approved orphan drug  even though for the same indication  is not barred from sale in the united states during the seven year exclusive marketing period 
the general division has been accorded orphan drug status for ceredase r enzyme and cerezyme r enzyme and has received orphan drug designation for a number of other products currently under development  including the products of neozyme ii and thyrogen r hormone 
the tretinoinlf product being developed in conjunction with aronex has received orphan drug designation for the treatment of leukemias 
periodically  legislation is proposed before the united states congress to amend the orphan drug act to reduce the seven year exclusive marketing period under certain circumstances 
any such legislation is not likely to affect products currently being marketed such as ceredase r enzyme and cerezyme r enzyme but could reduce the market exclusivity period for future products 
although the company has filed for or received orphan drug designation for various products  the company believes that the commercial success of these products including ceredase r enzyme and cerezyme r enzyme will depend more significantly on the associated safety and efficacy profile and on the price relative to competitive or alternative treatments and other marketing characteristics of each product than on any exclusivity afforded by the orphan drug act 
additionally  these products may be protected by patents  exclusive raw material supply contracts and other means 
other government regulation 
the general division s operations are or may be subject to various laws  regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions  laboratory practices  the experimental use of animals and the purchase  storage  movement  import and export and use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances  including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents used in connection with its research work 
the extent of government regulation which might result from future legislation or administrative action cannot be predicted 
the business of the tissue repair division overview genzyme s tissue repair division gtr focuses on developing  producing and marketing technologically advanced products for the treatment and prevention of serious tissue damage 
gtr believes that strong capabilities in three groups of core technologies autologous cell processing  therapeutic protein development and biomaterials engineering enhance its ability to successfully develop and market a portfolio of novel products and services to apply to unmet medical needs in the field of tissue repair 
two services  the epicel sm service for permanent skin replacement  and the carticel sm service for repair of cartilage  currently are on the market 
several others are in clinical evaluation 
significant additional development efforts  preclinical testing and manufacturing scale up activities  as appropriate  must be completed before the products and services under development can be commercialized 
in addition  most of these products and services will require regulatory approval 
there can be no assurance that adequate resources will be available to fund these activities or that  if funded  they will be completed successfully  that necessary regulatory approvals will be obtained or that the products under development will be commercialized successfully 
genzyme created gtr in december by acquiring biosurface technology  inc biosurface and combining it with several genzyme programs in the area of tissue repair 
biosurface was in the business of developing and supplying engineered tissues grown from normal human cells using proprietary cell culture technology 
gtr products and services gtr s activities can be divided into three main areas cartilage repair  consisting of the carticel sm service and carticel ii  skin repair  including the epicel sm service and the tgf beta and vianain r debriding product programs  and other tissue repair opportunities in the areas of multiple sclerosis and bone repair 
cartilage repair carticel sm service cartilage tissue can be found in several parts of the body and serves several different purposes 
articular hyaline cartilage is a thin layer of tough opaque tissue that lines the opposing bone surfaces of all moving joints in the body to provide almost frictionless movement of the joint 
another type of cartilage fibrocartilage serves a shock absorbing function in the knee and in the spine between the vertebrae 
cartilage is also the tissue which gives shape to the ear and the nose 
damage to cartilage causes significant medical problems 
when articular cartilage tissue in a joint suffers more than superficial damage  it does not regenerate and may further deteriorate over time 
even damage which creates a small defect in articular cartilage can impair joint movement  restrict patient mobility and cause pain and joint locking 
there were an estimated million procedures performed in the us in to treat soft tissue damage in the knee 
a substantial number of these procedures involved articular cartilage damage 
in the most severe cases of damaged cartilage  the joint is replaced with a metal or plastic prosthesis 
in the united states  approximately  total joint replacements are performed each year at a total cost to the healthcare system of approximately billion 
total joint replacement carries a significant risk of long term failure 
consequently  knee replacement is considered a last resort treatment for patients under years old 
arthroscopic techniques are currently used to relieve patients pain and lessen the chances of further tissue damage  but they do not repair the defect or stop the degenerative process which may lead to osteoarthritis 
patients with osteoarthritis may require a total joint replacement  which carries a significant risk of long term failure 
therefore  joint replacement is generally not recommended for patients under the age of fifty  who would likely outlive the prosthesis 
gtr s carticel sm service provides autologous or derived from a patient s own cells cultured articular cartilage cells for the repair of focal cartilage defects in the knee 
the service starts with a small sample of healthy articular cartilage tissue removed from the patient s knee 
after the cartilage cells from the tissue have been grown to sufficient number in gtr s laboratory  they are transplanted back into the cartilage defect in the patient s knee to form new cartilage tissue 
because these laboratory grown cells can lead to replacement of the cartilage defect with healthy cartilage tissue  gtr believes that the carticel sm service may improve joint function and significantly delay or even eliminate the need for expensive  debilitating joint replacement surgery 
based on market research it has conducted  gtr estimates that carticel sm service is applicable in approximately  patients with cartilage defects each year in the united states and europe  combined 
the carticel sm service is an integrated program of surgeon training  standardized cartilage cell processing  and rigorous collection and analysis of outcomes data  which is aimed at providing broad surgeon access and achieving and maintaining high quality patient outcomes 
although the carticel sm service is not currently regulated by the fda  gtr has developed a quality systems approach to the delivery of this service 
gtr s carticel sm service has been developed based on eight years of pioneering work by a group of swedish physicians the swedish group 
as of march   the swedish group  which was the first group in the world to report the use of cultured autologous cartilage cells to treat cartilage damage  has treated patients with knee cartilage defects 
a retrospective review of safety data on the initial patients treated by the swedish group  which was conducted by an independent data management organization hired by gtr and covered eight years of data for the earliest patients  indicated no serious adverse events directly attributable to autologous chondrocyte implantation or post implantation joint infection 
an ongoing retrospective review by gtr presently covering approximately of these patients has yielded encouraging data on the efficacy of the treatment  as measured by joint functionality and arthroscopic and histological evaluation  symptoms and patient assessment of improvement 
in the october  issue of the new england journal of medicine  the swedish group published data on the first patients to reach a two year follow up evaluation 
as reported in this article  of patients had restored or improved joint function after treatment with cultured autologous chondrocytes 
in order to gain access to gtr s cartilage cell processing services  surgeons must complete comprehensive training in the surgical procedure for autologous cartilage cell implantation 
as of march   gtr has trained approximately surgeons 
in addition to gtr s three day training program in sweden  gtr established a training site in cambridge  massachusetts in the fourth quarter of and modified the training curriculum to concentrate the program into one day in order to meet the increased demand for surgeon training and to accommodate the surgeon s limited time availability 
beginning in march  gtr also began offering the one day training program in the netherlands 
with the completion of the cambridge facility and by intensifying the training program  gtr will have the capacity to train more than  surgeons per year 
gtr s training programs include clinical  technical and practical orientation modules  providing a concentrated exposure to autologous implantation technology 
physician training consists of lectures  practice of the surgical technique and an orientation regarding reimbursement and billing procedures 
in an effort to maintain the high quality standards of the carticel sm service training program  gtr utilizes videotapes of the surgical biopsy and implantation procedures performed by the swedish group 
gtr believes that its exclusive ability to provide surgeons with the opportunity to observe and interact with the swedish group is a significant competitive advantage 
development programs 
gtr currently has a number of ongoing development programs relating to its carticel sm service collectively referred to as carticel ii  including work on arthroscopic implantation procedures and development of the carticel sm service for other applications 
the primary objectives of these programs are to i improve gtr s general knowledge of cartilage repair  ii improve the regenerative ability of the implanted  autologous chondrocytes and iii expand the application of the carticel sm service to the repair of large surface area defects such as those seen in osteoarthritic joints 
the carticel sm service is currently effective only for the repair of small area defects less than two centimeters in diameter 
skin repair each year approximately  people in the united states suffer burn injuries 
according to the national center for health services  approximately  of these patients are admitted to hospitals for serious burn injuries 
gtr estimates that approximately  of the most severely burned patients in the united states are admitted to one of the specialized burn centers 
industry analysts estimate that approximately billion is spent in the united states annually for the treatment of burns 
chronic skin ulcers are open  often painful wounds found predominantly on the lower extremities of elderly patients 
gtr estimates that approximately  cases of chronic or slow healing skin ulcers are treated in the united states each year at a cost of more than billion  with individual treatments costing up to  per year 
gtr is developing a range of products targeted at the treatment of burns and skin ulcers  as indicated in the following chart gtr skin repair product portfolio product indication application status epicel sm service burns permanent skin replacement marketed since tgf beta tissue growth promotion completed initial phase ii trial  additional phase ii trial began fourth quarter  vianain r debriding product burns wound debridement completed two phase ii clinical trials ulcers wound debridement completed pilot trial  phase ii trial to begin in early epicel sm service 
skin grafts produced using the epicel sm service are a life saving product indicated for patients who suffer severe  full thickness burns and need permanent skin replacement 
these epidermal grafts are grown from a patient s own skin cells and  therefore  are not rejected by the patient s immune system 
starting with a patient biopsy about the size of a postage stamp  gtr can grow enough skin grafts in three to four weeks to cover a patient s entire body surface area 
each skin graft consists of a sheet of cultured skin cells  approximately square centimeters in size and ranging from two to eight cell layers thick  attached to a piece of surgical dressing material 
a hour shelf life allows these grafts to be delivered anywhere in the united states  europe or japan from gtr s production laboratories in cambridge  massachusetts 
skin grafts produced using the epicel sm service were first introduced in and remain the only commercially available laboratory grown skin grafts shown to provide permanent skin replacement 
most burn wounds involving less than body surface area are covered with conventional skin grafts within the three to four weeks it currently takes to grow skin grafts produced using the epicel sm service 
therefore  gtr believes that the primary candidates for the epicel sm service are the approximately four hundred patients each year in the united states who survive burn injuries covering more than of their body surface area 
gtr markets the epicel sm service to burn centers throughout the us and in parts of europe through its own direct sales force 
gtr began marketing the epicel sm service in japan in through its distributor 
gtr is currently evaluating alternative approaches for use of the epicel sm service which will represent improvements over certain limitations that have been identified in its clinical utility and production methods 
methods being evaluated by gtr include use of synthetic membranes and composite skin grafts 
gtr believes that advances in the field of autologous keratinocyte grafting coupled with one or both of these technologies may allow the expanded use of autologous keratinocyte grafting for the treatment of smaller burns as well as for treatment of cutaneous ulcers which involve large surface areas of the skin 
in the latter case  gtr believes an improved autologous keratinocyte graft could effectively and economically provide final wound closure following effective debridement and induction of granulation tissue deposition at the wound site 
transforming growth factor beta tgf beta 
tgf beta is one of a family of proteins that plays an important role in the body s ability to promote normal wound healing by stimulating the growth of connective tissue 
gtr has licensed recombinant tgf beta from celtrix pharmaceuticals  inc celtrix and is collaborating with celtrix on the use of tgf beta to promote the healing of chronic skin ulcers by supplementing the body s own production of tgf beta the product will consist of an easy to use collagen sponge which serves as a delivery vehicle permitting the release of a consistent dose of tgf beta to the wound surface over time 
in january  celtrix announced that the results of the phase ii study of the tgf beta wound healing product in the treatment of venous ulcers were consistent with previous findings which indicated a positive trend in wound healing 
these results also allowed celtrix to reach several important conclusions i topically applied tgf beta is safe at the doses tested  ii the delivery vehicle is well tolerated and iii the ease of treatment enables patients to apply tgf beta therapy themselves 
however  due to variability in patient response in placebo groups  combined with a greater than expected placebo effect  statistical significance was not achieved in this study 
in the fourth quarter of  gtr began a center  double blinded  randomized phase ii clinical trial 
the study groups diabetic patients suffering from neurotrophic diabetic foot ulcers into one of three tgf beta coated collagen sponge dose groups  a placebo group or a standard of care control group 
during the first half of  gtr concentrated its efforts on refining the formulation and manufacturing process for the tgf beta collagen sponges at genzyme s allston  massachusetts facility for use in phase ii clinical trials 
genzyme successfully produced  sponges using bulk tgf beta from celtrix and collagen slurry from an outside source 
genzyme plans to manufacture tgf beta for phase iii clinical trials in its own facilities 
upon commercialization  gtr will make royalty payments to celtrix based on cumulative product sales 
gtr is also obligated to make milestone payments to celtrix for product development related achievements 
gtr s rights with respect to tgf beta derive from a license and development agreement which genzyme and celtrix entered into in june the agreement provides for a collaboration between the parties to develop and commercialize tgf beta for any therapeutic uses for any clinical indication excluding soft tissue augmentation  vascular prostheses  and all ophthalmic and mucositis indications 
genzyme s rights and obligations under the agreement with celtrix have been allocated to gtr 
pursuant to the license agreement  gtr has worldwide commercialization rights  excluding asia  for all systemic indications and select other indications of tgf beta celtrix has retained the right to acquire rights to indications not pursued by gtr 
vianain r debriding product 
the vianain r debriding product is a proprietary enzyme preparation designed to remove necrotic tissue from the wound site 
vianain r debriding product is formulated in a hydrophilic cream delivery vehicle so that it is highly viscous and easy to apply to and cleanse from the wound site 
since vianain r debriding product is designed to be applied at the bedside by a nurse or technician  gtr believes it may also be more cost effective to use than currently available debridement methods 
gtr intends to use the same proprietary preparation of vianain r debriding product to remove necrotic tissue from both burn and skin ulcers 
in october   gtr completed a phase ii clinical trial of vianain r debriding product in burn patients 
the results of this multi center study indicate that i vianain r debriding product is a safe and effective debriding agent  ii multiple applications of vianain r debriding product are required to effectively debride the burn wound  iii a significantly higher number of patients treated with vianain r debriding product achieved acceptable debridement of the wound compared to patients treated with the vehicle alone  iv there was insufficient information to determine if the use of vianain r debriding product can speed the determination of early burn depth  and v there was a trend toward decreased time to wound closure in the vianain r debriding product treatment group as compared to the control group  but this difference was not statistically significant 
based on these results  gtr is evaluating the design of a pivotal study for the treatment of burns using vianain r debriding product 
a phase ii single center study evaluating the ability to transplant skin grafts to full thickness burn injuries directly following treatment with vianain r debriding product in ten patients was completed in may clinical results indicate that the use of vianain r debriding product does not yield an immediately graftable bed in full thickness burns 
however  it appears to be an effective debulking agent 
phase i clinical studies for the vianain r debriding product for the treatment of chronic skin ulcers were completed in june a total of chronic ulcer patients venous  diabetic  pressure were treated 
preliminary results indicate that vianain r debriding product is a safe and effective debriding agent 
the product appears to be most effective in venous ulcers  six out of eight patients experienced at least debridement the remaining patients showed debridement and seven patients showed a significant increase in the amount of healthy granulation tissue present 
a phase ii study is planned to begin during acticel sm wound dressings 
acticel sm wound dressings are living bandages composed of three dimensional sheets of living epidermal tissue grown in the laboratory from donor cells and attached to synthetic dressing materials 
acticel sm wound dressings provide a covering to the wound and act as a barrier to infectious agents and prevent desiccation of the tissue 
in august  gtr completed an interim analysis of data obtained from the first patients in its trial of acticel sm wound dressings as a treatment for partial thickness burns 
although the results from treatment of the second half of this patient group  which followed a clinical investigators meeting to discuss patient selection and use of the product  were at a level sufficient to meet the stated trial objectives  it did not appear that data for the entire trial would be sufficient to support a filing of an application for marketing approval 
based on this analysis  together with gtr s concerns as to the commercial potential of the current product concept  and in order to focus gtr s near term efforts on the introduction of the carticel sm service  gtr has elected to discontinue patient enrollment in the trial 
gtr has also determined that it will undertake a review of the product design and commercial potential of acticel sm wound dressings prior to initiation of future clinical studies 
other tissue repair opportunities multiple sclerosis 
multiple sclerosis ms is the most common disease of the brain and spinal cord among young adults in the united states 
the national multiple sclerosis society estimates that approximately  people in the united states suffer from multiple sclerosis 
gtr believes that the annual healthcare cost associated with care and treatment of multiple sclerosis patients exceeds billion in the united states 
patients develop debilitating symptoms including fatigue  numbness  pain  slurred speech  blurred vision and  ultimately  muscle spasm and paralysis 
ms is rarely fatal 
while most patients are ambulatory  at least between episodes  some patients may eventually become paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair 
current therapy for multiple sclerosis remains inadequate 
steroids can be used for temporary  symptomatic relief in mild cases of the disease  but toxicity and lack of effectiveness limit their usefulness 
more recently  a beta interferon based immunomodulator has been approved by the fda 
gtr is aware of two other products for which ndas have been filed  one of which is beta interferon based 
other therapies such as cyclosporines  antimetabolites  gold and radiation appear to benefit some patients but are also associated with treatment limiting side effects 
gtr is developing recombinant tgf beta for formulation as an intravenous injectable product for administration to ms patients for the prevention of autoimmune damage of nerve tissue 
gtr is continuing the work begun by celtrix on tgf beta in people suffering from multiple sclerosis 
in april  celtrix initiated a phase i clinical study with recombinant tgf beta in individuals with multiple sclerosis 
the study is being conducted by the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke 
the initial clinical evaluation of tgf beta in patients with ms is an open label  ascending dose safety study involving patients with the progressive form of the disease 
it is anticipated that this initial study  along with on going preclinical safety and efficacy testing of tgf beta in ms animal models  will provide the basis for expanded clinical studies 
gtr continues to conduct toxicity studies of tgf beta to support future phase ii clinical trials 
gtr anticipates results from the on going phase i trial in gtr has not committed to a development and commercialization strategy for tgf beta for ms and has begun exploratory discussions regarding the future grant of a license to a third party for this indication 
bone repair approximately two million bone fractures occur in the united states every year  and  of these experience problems with repair 
in these cases  repair may be inhibited by disease 
when there is substantial bone loss  current methods such as autologous bone grafts  cadaver bone grafts and electrical stimulation vary in efficacy and side effects 
in the united states  bone augmentation is used in nearly all of the  spinal fusion procedures and in about of the million trauma fractures 
the most recent alternatives for repair have been hydroxyapatite or collagen based porous bone graft substitutes 
however  these grafts are osteoconductive  meaning that they provide a matrix for bone growth but do not contain growth promoting agents 
current research is focusing on the development of osteoinductive or bone growth promoting agents 
tgf beta has been shown to promote wound healing in animal models of hard tissue repair 
gtr has been approached by a number of companies in the orthopedic implant market to evaluate the use of tgf beta in conjunction with accelerating the healing process in segmental defect repair and general use of implants 
gtr may grant a license for use of tgf beta for this indication to a third party 
production gtr has developed and validated a commercial scale  proprietary chondrocyte processing system for the carticel sm service 
a total of validation studies were conducted as part of this process 
in addition  gtr has developed hundreds of standard operating procedures to ensure the safety and quality of its carticel sm service 
these procedures incorporate gtr s quality assurance program  consisting of facility controls  process controls and final product testing 
furthermore  each technician undergoes three months of training prior to handling patient cells 
all production and quality control procedures are intended to ensure traceability of operations 
gtr believes that this quality systems approach will facilitate meeting the new regulatory requirements expected to be imposed by the fda 
see government regulation 
gtr s process development efforts are directed toward expanding autologous chondrocyte culture capacity  streamlining processing  improving quality at lower production costs and strengthening gtr s proprietary position 
this work includes improving yields  reducing labor associated with harvesting chondrocytes from cartilage biopsies  developing methods for extending the viability of both biopsy specimens and final product cell suspensions  and identifying cell culture systems that will enable gtr to automate much of the production process for the carticel sm service 
gtr produces materials for its epicel sm service and carticel sm service in a specialized facility designed for the production of cell based therapies 
during the second half of  gtr upgraded and increased the processing capacity of that plant for the carticel sm service to approximately  patients per year 
in january  gtr acquired two adjacent buildings in framingham  massachusetts which it is developing as a carticel sm service production facility with annual capacity of approximately  patients 
this project will be completed in see properties tissue repair division 
gtr believes that it manufactures its products in compliance with gmp standards where applicable 
gtr expects that vianain r and tgf beta will be manufactured for gtr by the general division of genzyme  with the costs of such manufacturing being allocated to gtr 
sales and marketing gtr believes that successful commercialization of the carticel sm service is dependent on its being accepted by and incorporated into routine use by a large number of orthopedic surgeons 
in order to gain access to gtr s cartilage cell processing services  surgeons must complete comprehensive training in the surgical procedure for autologous cartilage cell implantation 
gtr has trained approximately surgeons through march  and anticipates training  surgeons during gtr s training programs include clinical  technical and practical orientation modules providing a concentrated exposure to autologus implantation technology and the ability to observe the surgical procedure  either live in sweden or by videotape 
surgeons also are given the opportunity to interact with the swedish surgeons who developed these techniques 
gtr markets the carticel sm service directly to orthopedic surgeons in the united states and europe 
since the launch of the carticel sm service  gtr has built its united states and european sales and marketing organization  which now includes a total of sales people 
gtr intends to expand this organization to more than by the end of with sales people experienced in the orthopedic market 
gtr s sales force promotes the carticel sm service by contacting and educating orthopedic surgeons about the carticel sm service and maintaining an ongoing relationship with each surgeon who receives training from gtr  assisting physicians with administrative  clinical and reimbursement issues involved in arranging to perform the biopsy and implantation procedures at hospitals  and assisting physicians in obtaining the necessary approval from the hospital s irb to collect outcomes data in accordance with gtr s protocol 
gtr further supports its sales and marketing efforts by attendance at and participation in orthopedic congresses and symposia 
in europe  gtr also has access to the general division s sales force on a cost sharing basis 
competition carticel sm service 
gtr is aware of three companies  advanced tissue sciences  inc  in conjunction with smith and nephew plc  integra lifesciences corp 
and lifecell corp 
that are engaged in research on cultured cartilage products 
gtr believes that none of these firms has progressed to clinical trials 
epicel sm service 
gtr is the only commercial provider of cultured skin grafts that have been shown to provide permanent skin replacement for burn patients in the united states 
however  gtr may face competition from companies using other approaches to culture skin tissue 
two companies  organogenesis  inc and advanced tissue sciences  have been granted expedited fda review for their skin substitutes 
one of these products will still require a skin graft from the patient or epicel sm service to close a full thickness wound and thus will not be competitive with gtr s epicel sm service 
integra lifesciences corp 
has submitted a pma for its collagen based dermal replacement product to the fda 
lifecell corp 
currently has freeze dried enzymatically processed human cadaver dermis on the market 
tgf beta the use of growth factors is emerging as a treatment for partial thickness or very small full thickness wounds 
a number of companies are currently conducting or planning to conduct clinical trials with growth factors  although to date  no recombinant growth factor product has received fda approval 
potential competitors include chiron corp  in collaboration with the ethicon division of johnson johnson  curative technologies  inc  and scios novo  inc curative technologies  inc  also has one product on the market which does not require fda approval 
such growth factors may prove to be complementary to  as well as competitive with  tgf beta however  gtr does not believe that growth factors can provide permanent skin replacement to compete with the epicel sm service 
additionally  tgf beta will compete with interferon based immunomodulators produced by chiron corp 
and biogen inc for the treatment of multiple sclerosis 
vianain r debriding product 
vianain r will compete primarily with surgical debridement of necrotic tissue or mechanical debridement using hydrotherepy and daily dressing changes to remove necrotic tissue and  to a lesser extent  with currently available enzymatic debridement products 
surgical and mechanical debridement procedures are painful  labor intensive and remove viable tissue along with necrotic tissue while the enzymatic debridement products on the market are slow acting and of limited efficacy 
enzymatic debridement products currently available commercially include products manufactured by knoll pharmaceuticals  parke davis  boots flinte  inc  lederle laboratories and rystan 
patents and proprietary rights gtr pursues a policy of obtaining patent protection both in the united states and in selected foreign countries for subject matter considered patentable and important to its business 
in addition  a portion of gtr s proprietary position is based upon patents licensed by genzyme 
these license agreements generally require gtr to pay royalties upon commercialization of products covered by the licensed technology 
gtr received its first patent in october for its method of freezing cells 
in addition  gtr has filed and is preparing several patent applications covering its work in cartilage repair 
gtr possesses substantial know how in the field of autologous cell development generally  and for carticel sm service in particular 
such know how includes the production of biopsy kits and packaging materials  procedures for quality control  sterility  segregation and manufacturing  and product delivery  and the method by which gtr validates assays for future development 
gtr believes that this significant technological know how places it in a competitively advantageous position 
biotechnology is a rapidly developing field 
many patent applications have been filed and the scope the courts will give to the claims of patents issued from such applications and the nature of these claims is unknown 
it is premature to predict what general trend  if any  will emerge as to the breadth of allowed claims for biotechnology products and related uses 
the allowance of broader claims will increase the incidence and cost of interference proceedings in the united states and the risk of infringement litigation in the united states and abroad 
a policy of allowing narrower claims  conversely  would limit the value of gtr s proprietary rights under patents it holds  licenses or for which it has applied 
it is possible that interference proceedings will occur with respect to gtr s patent applications 
it is also likely that subject matter patented by others will be required by gtr to commercialize at least some of gtr s products 
no assurance can be given that licenses under any such patent rights of others will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
gtr s proprietary position in the culturing of epidermal tissues was originally exclusively licensed from harvard university and has been augmented by recently obtained additional patents covering cool storage technology and packaging of skin grafts produced using the epicel sm service 
gtr has also exclusively licensed  on a worldwide basis except for italy  recent patents covering cryopreservation of such skin grafts 
gtr has extended this basic cryopreservation technology by patenting additional developments and improvements in the united states 
gtr also possesses know how relating to the large scale production of cultured epidermal grafts  the growth of other types of mammalian cells including fibroblasts and epithelial cells  and the formulation of various types of biomaterials  including ha 
in addition to ha know how  gtr has rights to a series of issued united states patents in tissue repair covering modified forms of ha 
gtr has pending and issued patents in the united states and other countries covering the enzymatic formulation of the vianain r debriding product and hydrophilic cream delivery vehicle for the product 
celtrix has obtained patents and filed patent applications in the united states and foreign countries on the composition of tgf beta  its formulation and its therapeutic applications in wound healing  cancer  immune therapy and bone therapy 
genzyme allocated the rights under its license with celtrix to gtr at the time of gtr s creation in december there can be no assurance that patents issued or licensed to gtr will remain free of challenge by third parties  that gtr may not unintentionally infringe patents of third parties  or that gtr may not have to alter its product development methods or procedures to take into account patents issued to others  causing unexpected costs and delays 
there can be no assurance that the pending applications owned or licensed by gtr will issue in any country or that the issued patents will provide a material commercial benefit for gtr 
while gtr seeks a strong patent position  it believes that its competitive position will also depend on its ability to maintain its trade secrets and proprietary know how  to achieve market leadership in key product areas and to obtain successful clinical results 
gtr s employees  advisors and consultants who have access to gtr proprietary information are required to sign confidentiality agreements 
government regulation prior to launching the carticel sm service  gtr made a determination that this service did not fit within any existing fda regulatory classification 
in the absence of specific regulatory guidance  gtr has voluntarily formulated its own standards for the processing of autologous chondrocytes in its specialized facility and has developed policies governing surgeon training  patient data collection and labeling 
gtr believes that its quality systems program is equivalent to the fda s current good manufacturing practices gmp 
in april   the fda contacted gtr and asked for more information regarding the regulatory status of the carticel sm service 
in order to clarify the situation  gtr filed a formal request in may of with the fda commissioner s office to review the situation and determine appropriate regulatory jurisdiction 
the fda was provided with information regarding gtr s quality standards and the policies that gtr established for the carticel sm service  as well as answers to specific technical questions 
the fda responded to gtr s request for designation in july  confirming in its response gtr s belief that a formal regulatory framework appropriate to the carticel sm service had not yet been established 
furthermore  the fda informed gtr that it intended to hold a public hearing to explore the public health impact of and consider appropriate regulatory controls for autologous cell implants 
the fda also informed gtr that it would not regulate the provision of the carticel sm service and epicel sm services prior to the hearing and development of regulations  and would allow gtr sufficient time to comply with any new regulations that may be promulgated 
in november the fda held a public hearing on the subject of autologous cells for structural purposes as a starting point for the development of new regulations 
gtr participated in this hearing  presenting information regarding the development  clinical application and processing related to the carticel sm and epicel sm services 
gtr also advocated the development of appropriate regulations to guide further development of products and services in this area 
the public comment period following the november meeting closed in february the fda has announced that it will review its position and determine if regulations are required in the area of autologous cells for structural and reconstructive purposes 
the fda has indicated that it will provide gtr with sufficient time to comply with any regulation that it may promulgate relating to autologous cells 
gtr has actively participated in committees with other organizations in the field of autologous cell production in the united states and europe to develop industry standards 
gtr s experience in this field has provided it with the opportunity to take an active role in developing such standards 
a federal criminal statute that prohibits the transfer of any human organ for valuable consideration for use in human transplantation  but which permits recovery of reasonable costs associated with such activities  has not been applied to the carticel sm or epicel sm services 
certain states have laws requiring the licensure of tissue and organ banks and laws governing the sale of human organs and the safety and efficacy of drugs  devices and biologics  including skin  all of which could be interpreted to apply to gtr s production and distribution of cultured tissue products 
provisions in certain states statues prohibit the receipt of valuable consideration in connection with the sale of human tissue by a tissue bank but permit licensed tissue banks  including companies  to recover their reasonable costs associated with such sales 
gtr has received notice from one state s department of health requiring compliance with its tissue bank licensure statute with respect to distribution of the epicel sm service 
genzyme has applied for such a license 
federal or state regulation could result in significant expense to gtr  limit gtr s reimbursement for its services  and otherwise materially adversely affect gtr s results of operations 
autologous products are specifically exempt from the european device directive and pharmaceutical directive promulgated by the european union 
therefore  each european country is free to impose its own regulations on the marketing of such products 
to date  gtr has not encountered any local registration requirements for market introduction of the carticel sm service 
gtr is currently assessing the regulatory requirements for commercialization of the carticel sm service in japan 
gtr is also subject to various federal  state and local laws  regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions  laboratory and manufacturing practices and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous safety procedures used in connection with gtr s research work and production operations 
although gtr believes that its safety procedures comply with the standards prescribed by federal  state and local regulations  the risk of contamination  injury or other accidental harm cannot be completely eliminated 
in the event of such an accident  gtr could be held liable for any damages that result and any liabilities could exceed gtr s resources 
employees of the registrant as of december   genzyme including all consolidated subsidiaries and excluding gtc had approximately  employees of whom were engaged in research and development  in manufacturing  in commercial laboratory operations  in marketing  sales and distribution and in administration 
doctorate degrees are held by of the company s employees 
of the company s employees   are located in the united states  in the uk  in europe and in japan and the far east 
none of the company s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
the company considers its employee relations to be excellent
