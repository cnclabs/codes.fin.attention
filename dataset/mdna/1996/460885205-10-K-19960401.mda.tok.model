long term interest rates declined in to their lowest level in approximately years making entry level housing more affordable to homebuyers 
even though the rates have remained fairly stable and an adequate supply is available to the entry level homebuyer  the economic uncertainties associated with the federal budget and government furloughs during and came at a time when supplies and competition were high in the washington  dc market 
as a result  the profit margins in the region have continued to decline

the average sales price of the residential lots sold in st 
charles have slowly decreased over the last two years as the remaining lots in the second village which are smaller and less desirable than the prime lots are sold 
residential land sales remained slow resulting from increased competition and slow home sales 
the increase in community development gross profit margins to in versus in the is due primarily to a heavier mix of the sales attributable to sales of commercial and business property

revenues from home sales decreased to  for from  for and from  or from the primary reason for the two year decrease is an overall decline in the number of units sold 
the increased focus by the company on its semi custom homebuilding operations  the restructuring of the homebuilding management team in and and the reduced availability of townhome lots to the company s homebuilding division in st 
charles and montclair due to lot sales to third party homebuilders  resulted in a decline in the number of units sold during as compared to and a decline in the number of units sold during compared to gross profits as a percentage of homebuilding revenues for a particular period  are a function of various factors including volume  pricing  efficiency of homebuilding operations  and financing costs including costs of subsidizing customer financing  if any

liquidity and capital resources in march  the company received a notice the notice from the us army corps of engineers the corps asserting that unauthorized fill materials had been placed in portions of an approximately five acre parcel in charles county  maryland the site owned by the company and claimed by the corps to constitute wetlands subject to regulation pursuant to the clean water act 
following receipt of the notice  the company ceased development of the site and remediated a portion of the site in accordance with instructions issued by the corps 
the company also commenced discussions with the corps regarding mitigation plans that would preserve some commercial value for the site and filed suit against the corps claiming that a prohibition of development on the entire site would constitute a governmental taking for which the company would be entitled to compensation 
in november  the company believed that it had an agreement in principle with the corps that would settle the company s claim and permit commercial development of a portion of the site 
however  in early  the company became aware that this matter had been referred to the us attorney for the district of maryland 
after conducting a lengthy investigation of the company s wetlands practices in st 
charles  in october a grand jury convened by the us attorney charged that certain of the company s practices with respect to four parcels  including the site  constituted criminal violations of section of the clean water act 
the indictment charged each of igc  its affiliate  st 
charles associates  lp sca  and the company s chairman  james j 
wilson 
during the us attorney s investigation  the corps issued additional violation notices relating to filling portions of other parcels claimed by the corps to be protected wetlands 
in october the government filed a civil action in the us district court for the district of maryland charging the company and mr 
wilson with violations of the clean water act 
of the approximately  acres developed by the company in st 
charles  approximately acres are the subject of the civil and criminal charges 
on february   each of igc  sca and mr 
wilson were convicted on four counts of felony violations of section of the clean water act 
sentencing is expected to occur in june on march   igc and sca received service of process with respect to the civil action 
maximum statutory penalties possible against each of igc and sca under the criminal action are  per day for each of four felony violations or  alternatively  twice the pecuniary gain realized by the company from any illegal action 
the maximum statutory penalty possible under the civil action is  per day for each of nine separate violations 
because the investigation with regard to the sentencing is ongoing  the company cannot determine from what point in time these fines could be assessed 
in the civil action  the us attorney also seeks to enjoin the company from engaging in future illegal wetlands practices 
during and  the company recognized approximately million in legal and consulting expenses relating to these matters 
such expenses include a reserve available to cover future anticipated costs of the criminal and civil actions  including costs of appealing the criminal convictions 
the amount of any fine in the current case cannot be estimated with certainty and as such the total costs incurred may exceed the amount reserved 
management believes the company and mr 
wilson have many strong arguments to present on appeal of the criminal convictions 
accordingly  the company and mr 
wilson will appeal the criminal convictions and will continue to defend vigorously against charges in the civil action 
the company s loan agreements contain certain restrictive covenants  cross default provisions and material adverse change in financial condition clauses 
as a result of the company s conviction on four felony counts of the clean water act  signet bank issued a notice of default by the company of certain loan agreement covenants pertaining to million of debt 
negotiations of the terms and conditions of a forbearance agreement are in process 
in addition  a million payment was due nationsbank on march  negotiations are in process to modify certain terms and conditions of the loans 
management expects to finalize these amendments and make the principal curtailment in april as a result of this notice of default  past due payment  and unless and until the criminal convictions are reversed on appeal  million of the company s bank debt could be called into default 
the uncertainty with respect to the amount of penalties has hindered the company s ability to secure financing and bonds necessary for the development of fairway village  the third of five villages in the planned unit development of st 
charles  maryland 
the company s current inventory of finished lots in st 
charles is anticipated to be sold during  therefore  the development of additional lots is necessary to provide inventory for sales in and beyond 
as a result of the uncertainty regarding the magnitude of fines  events of default  multiple loan defaults and uncertainty regarding the ability to obtain future financing  which may cause the company to have negative cash flow in  there is substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
the company has historically met its liquidity requirements principally from cash flow generated by land and home sales  property management fees  distributions from hda and residential rental partnerships and from bank financing providing funds for development and working capital 
as discussed in note  the company no longer receives distributions from hda  as a result of the company s distribution of equus units representing a limited partnership interest in equus to igc unitholders in february in addition  under the terms of igc s loans  most of the cash generated by us home and lot sales and distributions from partnerships  including distributions from partnership refinancings  will be used to further reduce bank loans and meet debt service requirements 
as mentioned above  project financings have been delayed by the inability to determine the penalties related to the company s felony convictions 
given these factors  the company s ability to generate cash for overhead  development and other uses is limited 
during the first quarter of  four apartment projects in puerto rico were sold under the low income housing preservation and resident homeownership act lihprha 
the company will retain the management contracts on the four apartments 
this sale  after taxes  generated approximately of cash 
approximately million of cash proceeds is pledged to curtail bank debt and the remainder will be used to pay legal fees related to the wetlands convictions and support operations 
as a result of the debt curtailments  the fdic loan will be paid off and nationsbank will have a first lien on commercial properties in st 
charles which will have the effect of improving the company s cash flow as the release prices under the nationsbank agreement are less than that of the fdic 
during  the company negotiated loan extensions with nationsbank and signet bank 
nationsbank has agreed to extend the maturity of its loans until may under the agreement  the extension of the maturity beyond november  was contingent upon a mandatory principal curtailment of million which will be made with the proceeds of the lihprha sale 
signet bank agreed to extend the maturity of its loans until september the balance of the signet loans as of december  is million 
the company anticipates it will pay off these loans prior to their maturity with the proceeds from the sale of commercial and residential land which secure the loans
