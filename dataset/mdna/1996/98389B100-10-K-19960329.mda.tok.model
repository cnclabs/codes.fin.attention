item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations northern states power company  a minnesota corporation the company  has two significant subsidiaries  northern states power company  a wisconsin corporation the wisconsin company  and nrg energy  inc  a delaware corporation nrg 
the company also has several other subsidiaries  including viking gas transmission company viking and cenergy  inc  cenergy 
the company and its subsidiaries collectively are referred to herein as nsp 
financial results and objectives financial results nsp s earnings per share were  an increase of cents  or percent  over the earned in the effects of sales growth in the core electric and gas utility businesses  favorable weather and reduced operating and maintenance costs more than offset higher costs for depreciation  tax and interest expenses 
this provided a regulated utility earnings increase of cents  or percent  from in  non regulated businesses contributed earnings of cents  up cent  or percent  from earnings 
investor returns also were enhanced in by an increase in the common dividend rate  as discussed below 
nsp remained financially strong in  as evidenced by continued high operating cash flows and interest coverage 
nsp maintained its first mortgage bond ratings with all rating agencies during nsp bonds are rated double a by all rating agencies except moody s investors services moody s 
moody s downgraded nsp s first mortgage bond ratings in may to a based on its interpretation of provisions of a minnesota law enacted in regarding the used fuel storage project for the prairie island nuclear generating plant 
see discussion of this legislation in notes and to the financial statements 
in  moody s placed the company s ratings on credit review for possible upgrade based on anticipated cost savings from the proposed merger with wisconsin energy corporation  which is discussed later 
total return total return to investors is measured by dividends plus stock price appreciation 
nsp s common dividend rate increased by more than percent and its stock price increased by percent in for the most recent  and five year periods  the total return on nsp common stock averaged percent  percent and percent per year  respectively 
for the same periods  the total return for the standard poor s s p composite stock index for industrial companies averaged percent  percent and percent per year  respectively 
financial objectives nsp s financial objectives are to provide investor returns in the top one fourth of the utility industry as measured by a three year average return on equity 
nsp s average return on common equity for the three years ending in was percent 
based on a three year average  this return was below the top one fourth of the industry  which was approximately percent  but above the median three year industry average of approximately percent 
to increase dividends on a regular basis and maintain a long term average payout ratio in the range of to percent 
the objective payout ratio is based on long term earnings expectations 
in june  nsp s annualized common dividend rate was increased by cents per share  or percent  from to 
the dividend payout ratio was percent in  within the objective range 
to maintain continued financial strength with a double a bond rating 
the company s first mortgage bonds continued to be rated aa by s p  aa by duff phelps  inc and aa by fitch investors service  inc since may  moody s has rated nsp s first mortgage bonds a based on its interpretations of a minnesota law enacted in regarding the used fuel storage project for the prairie island nuclear generating plant 
first mortgage bonds issued by the wisconsin company carry comparable ratings 
nsp s pretax interest coverage ratio  based on income without allowance for funds used during construction afc  was in a capital structure consisting of percent common equity at year end  including both regulated and non regulated operations  contributes to nsp s financial flexibility and strength 
to provide at least percent of nsp earnings from nrg businesses by the year nrg expects to meet this goal through growing profitability of existing businesses and the addition of new businesses 
businesses owned or managed by nrg provided percent of nsp s earnings in and percent in to maintain long term average annual earnings growth of percent from ongoing operations  as described below 
excluding the non recurring items discussed later under factors affecting results of operations  nsp achieved earnings per share growth of percent in over and an average annual growth of percent since total earnings per share less earnings from non recurring items earnings from ongoing operations total earnings per share increased percent in over business strategies nsp s management is proactive in shaping the new business environment in which it will be operating 
in april  the company and wisconsin energy corporation wec entered into a definitive agreement that provides for a strategic business combination in a merger of equals transaction to operate as primergy corporation primergy  as discussed further under factors affecting results of operations 
both companies management teams view this transaction as creating a combined enterprise well positioned for an increasingly competitive energy industry environment 
the goal of the merger is to achieve continued competitive energy rates over the long term for the companies respective customers and to enhance value for the shareholders of both companies 
in addition to this merger strategy  management s business strategies include focusing on the core energy business 
the electric utility industry is becoming more complex as customers  as well as utilities and federal and state regulators  promote competition 
to remain successful in this more complex environment  nsp will maintain its focus on its core energy related activities 
providing reliable  low cost  environmentally responsible energy 
whether energy is produced or purchased through nsp s regulated utility or its non regulated businesses  three general concepts provide a focus for its energy businesses reliable energy  low cost energy and environmentally responsible energy 
responding to customer needs 
customers will have an increasing number of options for meeting their energy needs  and there will be competition among energy companies for the privilege of serving those customers 
nsp will work with its customers to develop innovative products and services that benefit both customers and nsp 
increasing non regulated investments and earnings 
non regulated businesses will be an important part of nsp s future 
deregulation in the utility industry is expected to provide new investment opportunities in non regulated businesses 
participation in these opportunities is expected to improve nsp s total profitability 
results of operations and liquidity and capital resources the following discussion and analysis by management focuses on those factors that had a material effect on nsp s financial condition and results of operations during and it should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements and notes thereto 
trends and contingencies of a material nature are discussed to the extent known and considered relevant 
material changes in balance sheet items are discussed below and in the accompanying notes to financial statements 
the discussion and analysis and the related financial statements do not reflect the impact of the company s proposed merger with wec except for pro forma information included in note to the financial statements 
results of operations compared with and nsp s earnings per share were  up cents from the earned in and up cents from the earned in regulated utility businesses generated earnings per share of in  in and in non regulated businesses generated earnings per share of cents in  cents in and cents in the results of the regulated utility businesses and the non regulated businesses are discussed in more detail later 
in addition to the revenue and expense changes  earnings per share have been affected by an increasing average number of common and equivalent shares outstanding 
common and equivalent shares increased in and due mainly to stock issuances for the company s dividend reinvestment and stock ownership plans 
utility operating results electric revenues sales to retail customers  which account for more than percent of nsp s electric revenue  increased percent in and percent in retail revenues were favorably affected by sales growth  weather and increased cost recovery for conservation expenditures 
during  nsp added  retail electric customers  a percent increase 
total sales of electricity increased percent in and decreased percent in warmer than normal summer weather in contributed to sales growth compared with  which had a cooler than normal summer 
on a weather adjusted basis  sales to retail customers increased an estimated percent in and percent in retail sales growth for is estimated to be percent over  or percent on a weather adjusted basis 
sales to other utilities increased percent in after decreasing percent in the decrease from largely was due to unusually high demand in from utilities in flood stricken midwestern states 
the table below summarizes the principal reasons for the electric revenue changes during the past two years millions of dollars vs 
vs 
retail sales growth excluding weather impacts estimated impact of weather on retail sales volume sales to other utilities wholesale sales conservation cost recovery fuel adjustment clause recovery other rate changes energy management discounts and other total revenue increase nsp s electric rates are adjusted for changes in fuel and purchased energy costs from amounts currently included in approved base rates through fuel adjustment clauses in all jurisdictions  except as noted below for wisconsin 
while the lag in implementing these billing adjustments is approximately days  an estimate of the adjustments is recorded in unbilled revenue in the month in which costs are incurred 
in wisconsin  the biennial retail rate review process considers changes in electric fuel and purchased energy costs in lieu of a fuel adjustment clause 
in  a new rate adjustment clause was approved 
it accelerated recovery of deferred electric conservation and energy management program costs in the company s minnesota jurisdiction 
this adjustment clause helps reduce the need for filing a general rate increase request for recovery of increases in conservation expenditures 
the company is required to request a new cost recovery level annually 
in january  a number of changes to the company s regulatory deferral and amortization practices for minnesota conservation program expenditures were approved 
these changes allow the company to expense rather than amortize new conservation expenditures beginning in and to increase its recovery of electric margins lost due to conservation activity 
in addition  the company received approval for and conservation expenditures at levels lower than on april   the company expects to file for annual changes to the minnesota conservation rate adjustment clause with an effective period of july   through june  revenues in are expected to increase by an estimated million  compared with  due to the effects of the rate recovery changes for conservation programs in and these revenue increases will be largely offset by a corresponding increase in conservation expenses 
electric production expenses fuel expense for electric generation increased million  or percent  in compared with an increase of million  or percent  in the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in output from nsp s generating plants  resulting from increased sales and fewer scheduled plant maintenance outages 
although output from nsp s generating plants declined slightly in because of more scheduled fossil plant maintenance outages  fuel expenses were higher in because of the higher cost of nuclear fuel per megawatt hour due to increased payments to the us department of energy doe for decommissioning and decontamination of the doe s uranium enrichment facilities and nuclear fuel disposal costs 
in addition  the costs of fossil fuel were higher in because of fewer coal purchases at the lowest contractual prices due to lower fossil plant output 
purchased power costs decreased million  or percent  in after increasing million  or percent  in the decrease in was primarily due to lower average market prices and less energy purchased 
the level of purchases declined due to fewer scheduled plant maintenance outages in the increase in primarily was due to additional demand expenses of million for the full year impact of capacity charges from the power purchase agreements with the manitoba hydro electric board mh  which went into effect in may  as discussed in note to the financial statements 
in addition to demand expenses  purchased power costs increased from due to higher average market prices and increased purchases because of more plant maintenance outages in gas revenues the majority of nsp s retail gas sales are categorized as firm primarily space heating customers and interruptible commercial industrial customers with an alternate energy supply 
firm sales in increased percent compared with sales  while firm sales in decreased percent compared with sales 
the increase primarily is due to increased sales of natural gas resulting from  additional new firm gas customers  a percent increase  and slightly more favorable weather in the decrease was due largely to warm weather in the last quarter of on a weather adjusted basis  firm sales are estimated to have increased percent in and decreased percent in firm gas sales in are estimated to increase by percent relative to  a percent increase on a weather adjusted basis 
interruptible sales of gas increased percent in and percent in the increase is the result of favorable gas market prices that caused large interruptible customers with alternate fuel sources to use more natural gas 
other gas deliveries increased percent primarily due to additional gas sales to off system customers 
other gas deliveries increased percent in due to gas sales to off system customers 
viking wholesale transmission deliveries increased percent in these wholesale deliveries increased percent in due to a full year of viking activity 
the table below summarizes the principal reasons for the gas revenue changes during the past two years 
millions of dollars vs vs sales growth excluding weather impacts estimated impact of weather on firm sales volume sales to off system customers purchased gas adjustment clause recovery rate changes and other viking gas acquired in june total revenue increase decrease nsp s retail gas rates are adjusted for changes in purchased gas costs from amounts currently included in approved base rates through purchased gas adjustment clauses in all jurisdictions 
effective november  a new rate adjustment clause was approved that accelerated recovery of deferred gas conservation and energy management program costs in the company s minnesota jurisdiction  similar to the retail electric rate clause discussed previously 
the company estimates it will receive an additional million in revenues from this new rate mechanism in compared with this increased recovery will result in a corresponding increase in conservation expenses 
cost of gas purchased and transported the cost of gas purchased and transported decreased million  or percent  in primarily due to a percent decline in the per unit cost of purchased gas  partially offset by higher sendout volumes due to increased sales and off system deliveries 
the lower cost of purchased gas reflects continuing favorable market pricing  while the higher gas sendout reflects sales growth in and higher gas sales to off system customers 
the cost of gas associated with off system sales was million in and million in the cost of gas purchased and transported decreased million  or percent  in the decrease reflects lower gas prices and cost recovery adjustments  partially offset by higher sendout volumes primarily for gas sales to off system customers 
the average cost per unit of nsp owned gas sold in was percent lower than it was in  mainly due to lower market prices for gas 
other operation  maintenance and administrative and general these expenses  in total  decreased by million  or percent  in compared with an increase of million  or percent  in the decrease is largely due to fewer employees  fewer scheduled plant maintenance outages  lower property insurance premiums and a one time charge in for postemployment benefits 
partially offsetting these decreases were higher employee benefit costs  and higher electric line maintenance costs  mostly for tree trimming and heat related repairs 
the increase resulted primarily from higher postretirement health care costs  including amounts deferred from  and higher postemployment costs as discussed in note to the financial statements 
see note to the financial statements for a summary of administrative and general expenses 
conservation and energy management expenses in were higher than in primarily due to higher amortization levels of deferred conservation program costs  consistent with cost recovery under new electric and gas rate adjustment clauses in the company s minnesota jurisdiction effective may   and nov 
  respectively 
the deferred costs being amortized are higher due to increased customer participation in nsp s conservation and energy management programs 
depreciation and amortization the increases in and reflect higher levels of depreciable plant 
property and general taxes property and general taxes increased in and primarily due to property additions and higher property tax rates 
utility income taxes the variations in income taxes primarily are attributable to fluctuations in taxable income 
see note to the financial statements for a detailed reconciliation of the statutory tax rate to nsp s effective tax rate 
non operating items related to utility businesses allowance for funds used during construction afc the differences in afc for the reported periods are attributable to varying levels of construction work in progress and changing afc rates associated with various levels of short term borrowings to fund construction 
in addition  returns allowed on deferred costs for conservation and energy management programs increased afc equity by million and million in and  respectively  and increased afc debt by the amounts of million and million in and  respectively 
other income expense note to the financial statements lists the components of other income deductions net reported on the consolidated statements of income 
other than the operating revenues and expenses of non regulated businesses  as discussed in the next section  non operating income net of expense items and associated income taxes related to utility businesses increased million in and decreased million in the increase primarily is due to higher expense levels in for environmental and regulatory contingencies  and public and governmental affairs costs related to the prairie island fuel storage issue 
these were partly offset by lower interest income associated with the company s settlement of federal income tax disputes in the decrease primarily is due to higher expenses for environmental and regulatory contingencies  and higher public and governmental affairs expenses associated with the prairie island fuel storage issue  partially offset by interest income associated with the company s settlement of federal income tax disputes 
interest charges before afc interest costs recognized for nsp s utility businesses  including amounts capitalized to reflect the financing costs of construction activities  were million in  million in and million in the increase is largely due to long term debt issues in and net of retirements and higher short term interest rates  which affect commercial paper borrowings and variable rate long term debt 
the decrease reflects the impact of refinancing several higher rate long term debt issues in and these interest savings were partially offset by interest on higher short term debt balances and viking debt issued late in 
the average short term debt balance was million in  million in and million in preferred dividends dividends on the company s preferred stock decreased in primarily due to redemption of the series cumulative preferred stock in october non regulated business results nsp s non regulated operations include many diversified businesses  such as independent power production  gas marketing  industrial heating and cooling  and energy related refuse derived fuel rdf production 
nsp also has investments in affordable housing projects and several income producing properties 
the following discusses nsp s diversified business results in the aggregate 
operating revenues and expenses the net results of non regulated businesses that are consolidated are reported in other income deductions net on the consolidated statements of income 
note to the financial statements lists the individual components of this line item 
non regulated operating revenues increased million  or percent  in  and million  or percent  in the increase was largely due to increased gas marketing sales by cenergy 
the increase was mainly due to the impact of cenergy gas marketing and nrg industrial heating and cooling businesses acquired in non regulated operating expenses increased in primarily due to higher gas costs associated with cenergy gas sales and higher project development expenses by nrg on pending projects 
non regulated operating expenses increased in consistent with revenue increases resulting from acquisitions 
in addition  such expenses increased in due to fewer project development costs being capitalized on pending projects in compared with  and project write downs 
non regulated operating expenses include charges of million in and million in for previously capitalized development and investment costs to reflect a decrease in the expected future cash flows of certain energy projects 
equity in operating earnings nsp has a less than majority equity interest in many non regulated projects  as discussed in note to the financial statements 
consequently  a large portion of nsp s non regulated earnings is reported as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates on the consolidated statements of income 
the decrease in equity in project operating earnings is due to lower earnings from an nrg cogeneration project contract that was terminated in and other domestic projects  somewhat offset by higher earnings from nrg international energy projects one of which did not provide earnings prior to the second quarter of 
the increase in equity in project operating earnings primarily is due to new international energy projects in which nrg entered during as discussed in note to the financial statements  and more profitable operations of other energy projects in which nrg had been an investor for several years 
equity in gains from contract terminations in june  after receiving final regulatory approvals  a power sales contract between a california energy project  in which nrg is a percent investor  and an unaffiliated utility company was terminated 
a pretax gain of approximately million was recognized by nrg for its share of the termination settlement 
in  a michigan cogeneration project  in which nrg was a percent investor  received a payment from an unaffiliated utility company as compensation for the termination of an energy purchase agreement 
a pretax gain of million was recognized by nrg for its share of the contract termination settlement  net of project investment costs 
other income expense other than the operating revenues and expenses of non regulated businesses  as discussed above  non operating income net of expense items related to non regulated businesses increased million in and increased million in the increase primarily is due to a gain on the sale of cenergy oil and gas properties  higher income from cash investments  and an adjustment to the contract termination gain recorded by nrg 
interest expense interest charges on the consolidated statements of income include interest and amortization expenses related to non regulated businesses 
the expenses were million in  million in and million in the increase in mainly is due to the issuance of long term debt on new affordable housing projects by eloigne company  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the increase in relates primarily to non utility long term debt issued to finance the acquisitions of nrg s industrial heating and cooling business minneapolis energy center  a gas marketing business now operated by cenergy  and investments in affordable housing projects by eloigne company 
in addition  during and late  united power land and first midwest auto park  wholly owned subsidiaries of the company  issued long term debt secured by non regulated properties and lowered nsp s equity investment in these subsidiaries 
income taxes the consolidated statements of income include income tax expense related to non regulated businesses of million in  million in and million in the increase in mainly is due to a gain from an nrg energy contract termination  as discussed previously  somewhat offset by higher income tax credits from eloigne company s affordable housing projects 
the decrease in mainly is due to higher income tax credits from affordable housing projects and energy tax credits related to an nrg project  somewhat offset by higher taxes due to higher operating earnings  as discussed above 
the effective tax rate in and is substantially less than the us federal tax rate mainly due to the tax treatment of income from unconsolidated international affiliates  and energy and affordable housing tax credits  as shown in note to the financial statements 
factors affecting results of operations nsp s results of operations during  and were primarily dependent upon the operations of the company s and wisconsin company s utility businesses consisting of the generation  transmission  distribution and sale of electricity and the distribution  transportation and sale of natural gas 
nsp s utility revenues depend on customer usage  which varies with weather conditions  general business conditions  the state of the economy and the cost of energy services 
various regulatory agencies approve the prices for electric and gas service within their respective jurisdictions 
in addition  nsp s non regulated businesses are contributing significantly to nsp s earnings 
the historical and future trends of nsp s operating results have been and are expected to be affected by the following factors proposed merger on april   the company and wec entered into an agreement and plan of merger that provides for a business combination of nsp and wec in a merger of equals transaction 
as a result of the mergers contemplated by the merger agreement  primergy will become the holding company for the regulated operations of both the company and the utility subsidiary of wec 
the business combination is intended to be tax free for income tax purposes  and accounted for as a pooling of interests 
on sept 
  more than percent of the respective shareholders of the company and wec voting approved the merger plan at their respective shareholder meetings 
under the proposed business combination  shareholders of the company would receive shares of primergy common stock for each share of the company s common stock owned at the time of the merger 
after the merger is completed  a transition to a new organization would begin 
anticipated cost savings of the new organization compared with the continued independent operation of nsp and wec are estimated to be billion over a year period  net of transaction costs about million and costs to achieve the merger savings about million 
it is anticipated that the proposed merger will allow the companies to implement a modest reduction in electric retail rates and a four year rate freeze for electric retail customers 
in addition  the companies agreed to provide a four year freeze in wholesale rates 
after the merger  the regulated businesses of nsp and wec would continue to operate as utility subsidiaries of primergy  which would be registered under the public utility holding company act of puhca  as amended  and some of the company s subsidiaries would be transferred to direct primergy ownership 
except for certain gas distribution properties transferred to the company  the wisconsin company will become part of the regulated business of wec 
although nsp and wec are working to avoid divestitures  the puhca may require the merged entity to divest certain of its gas utility and or non regulated operations 
also  regulatory authorities may require the restructuring of transmission system operations or administration 
nsp currently cannot determine if such divestitures or restructuring would be required 
in addition  wisconsin state law limits the total assets of non utility affiliates of primergy 
this could affect the growth of non regulated operations 
the agreement to merge is subject to a number of conditions  including approval by applicable regulatory authorities 
during  nsp and wec received a ruling from the internal revenue service indicating that the proposed successive merger transactions would not prevent treatment of the business combination as a tax free reorganization under applicable tax law if each transaction independently qualified 
during  nsp and wec submitted filings to the federal energy regulatory commission ferc  applicable state regulatory commissions and other governmental authorities seeking approval of the proposed merger to form primergy 
the ferc has put the merger application on an accelerated schedule  ordering the administrative law judge s initial decision by aug 
  and briefs on exception by sept 
  which makes possible a ferc ruling on the merger application by the end of although the goal of nsp and wec is to receive approvals from all regulatory authorities by the end of  some regulatory authorities have not established a timetable for their decision 
therefore  the timing of the approvals necessary to complete the merger is not known at this time 
the state filings included a request for deferred accounting treatment and rate recovery of costs incurred associated with the proposed merger 
at dec 
  million of costs associated with the proposed merger had been deferred as a component of intangible and other assets 
in february  the appropriate committees of the minnesota legislature passed legislation that would affect merger approval for electric utilities 
the bill  if passed into law  would provide for certain binding commitments regarding minimum levels of staffing and investment for electric service 
in addition to the regulatory and other governmental approvals of the proposed merger  certain nsp financial and other agreements may be construed to require that  in the case of a change in ownership such as the proposed merger  the other party to the agreement must consent to the change or waive the requirement 
agreements with such provisions at dec 
  include million of long term debt  operating lease agreements with annual payments of million in and a million credit line agreement  under which there were no borrowings at dec 
 although neither consents nor waivers from the other parties have yet been obtained  nsp will seek to obtain them prior to the completion of the merger 
see further discussion of the proposed business combination in note to the financial statements 
regulation nsp s utility rates are approved by the ferc  the minnesota public utilities commission mpuc  the north dakota public service commission  the public service commission of wisconsin pscw  the michigan public service commission and the south dakota public utilities commission 
rates are designed to recover plant investment and operating costs and an allowed return on investment  using an annual period upon which rate case filings are based 
nsp requests changes in rates for utility services as needed through filings with the governing commissions 
the rates charged to retail customers in wisconsin are reviewed and adjusted biennially 
because comprehensive rate changes are not requested annually in minnesota  nsp s primary jurisdiction  changes in operating costs can affect nsp s earnings  shareholders equity and other financial results 
except for wisconsin electric operations  nsp s rate schedules provide for cost of energy and resource adjustments to billings and revenues for changes in the cost of fuel for electric generation  purchased energy  purchased gas  and conservation and energy management program costs 
for wisconsin electric operations  the biennial retail rate review process considers changes in electric fuel and purchased energy costs in lieu of a cost of energy adjustment clause 
in addition to changes in operating costs  other factors affecting rate filings are sales growth  conservation and demand side management efforts and the cost of capital 
competition the energy policy act of the act was a catalyst for comprehensive and significant changes in the operation of electric utilities  including increased competition 
the act s reform of the puhca promotes creation of wholesale non utility power generators and authorizes the ferc to require utilities to provide wholesale transmission services to third parties 
the legislation allows utilities and non regulated companies to build  own and operate power plants nationally and internationally without being subject to restrictions that previously applied to utilities under the puhca 
management believes this legislation will promote the continued trend of increased competition in the electric energy markets 
nsp management plans to continue its efforts to be a competitively priced supplier of electricity and an active participant in the competitive market for electricity 
the proposed merger with wec is a key strategic initiative designed to facilitate nsp s effective competition in the future energy marketplace 
in march  the ferc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking on open access non discriminatory transmission services and a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking on stranded investment together called the mega nopr 
the mega nopr is intended to create a vigorous wholesale electric market by requiring transmission providers to offer open access to their transmission systems 
the ferc is proposing to require utilities to unbundle power sales from transmission 
this unbundled service requirement would apply only to new requirements contracts and new coordination trade contracts 
the mega nopr would apply to all utilities under the ferc s jurisdiction and would require each utility to file individual tariffs 
the ferc also seeks to require non jurisdictional transmission providing entities such as municipals and cooperatives to offer open access by including a reciprocity clause in their individual tariffs so that those who take service from a ferc jurisdictional utility must also offer open access 
concurrently with the mega nopr  the ferc issued a proposal for a real time information network intended to facilitate open access by requiring all public utilities to create an electronic bulletin board of information regarding their transmission system services  availability and rates 
also in the mega nopr  the ferc proposed to consider cases involving stranded costs resulting from open access a when a state regulatory commission does not have authority under state law to address such costs at the time retail wheeling which is the transmission to retail customers of power generated by a third party  in competition with supplies from the host utility takes place  and b after a state commission has addressed such costs 
in response to the ferc s proposals  nsp filed comments with the ferc that supported the mega nopr s open access initiative and asserted nsp s intent that open access transmission tariffs filed in comply with the spirit of the mega nopr 
nsp expects the impact of any rulemaking such as the mega nopr to be consistent with its efforts to be a competitively priced supplier of electricity and an active participant in the competitive market for electricity 
with the development of electric industry competition  the company has experienced an increase in requests for the use of its transmission system 
a large portion of these requests is due to the increase in ferc approved power marketers 
in  the company filed transmission service agreements for ferc approval  including with power marketers 
while the annual transmission revenue in from this activity was immaterial  it is expected that revenues will increase due to the growth of power marketing activity in this region 
in response to the developing electric industry competition  cenergy applied for and was granted permission by the ferc to market electricity except electricity generated by nsp in the united states  effective dec 
 cenergy was one of the first affiliates of an electric utility to obtain this approval from the ferc 
some states are considering proposals to increase competition in the supply of electricity 
in response to a proposal in by its regulator in wisconsin  nsp outlined the transitional steps necessary to create an open and fair competitive electric market 
nsp s position is that all customers should be able to choose their electric supplier by  and that generation also should be deregulated by nsp proposes that utilities retain operational control of their transmission and distribution systems  and that utilities should be permitted to recover the cost of investments made under traditional regulation 
regulators in minnesota and wisconsin are currently considering what actions they should take regarding electric industry competition 
in wisconsin  regulators developed a plan for a phased approach 
they voted to adopt a restructuring plan  which includes a step phase in of retail wheeling by the year a key component of the plan is to provide the protections necessary to ensure that consumers are not harmed in an increasingly competitive environment 
one component of the plan is to have an independent system operator control transmission access 
in minnesota  regulators have developed draft principles to provide a framework for electric industry restructuring 
they have not established definitive timelines for industry restructuring or changes 
one of the principles supports an open transmission system and establishing a robust wholesale competitive market 
nsp believes the transition to a more competitive electric industry is inevitable and beneficial for all consumers 
nsp supports an orderly and efficient transition to an open  fair and competitive energy market for all customers and suppliers 
the timing of regulatory actions and their impact on nsp cannot be predicted and may be significant 
during and  the ferc issued a series of orders together called order addressing interstate natural gas pipeline service restructuring 
this restructuring unbundled each of the services sales  transportation  storage and ancillary services traditionally provided by gas pipeline companies 
interstate pipelines have been allowed to recover from their customers percent of prudently incurred transition costs attributable to order restructuring 
under service agreements that went into effect nov 
  nsp estimates that it will be responsible for less than million of transition costs over a five year period beginning on that date 
to date  nsp s regulatory commissions have approved recovery of these restructuring charges in retail gas rates through the purchased gas adjustment 
nsp does not believe order has materially affected its cost of gas supply 
nsp s acquisitions of viking and cenergy in have enhanced its ability to participate in the more competitive gas transportation business 
in implementing order  viking incurred no transition costs 
customer cogeneration koch refining co 
koch  the company s largest customer which provides approximately million in annual revenues to nsp  proposes to build a cogeneration plant to burn petroleum coke  a refinery byproduct  to produce between and megawatts of electricity 
this would be enough supply for koch s own use plus an additional to megawatts to be sold on the wholesale market 
koch is requesting a legislative exemption from minnesota property tax for its plant 
while nsp supports the reduction of taxes on generating facilities  it believes any reduction should be applied to all generating facilities so that there are no unfair tax advantages available to some generators 
this project has several implications for nsp koch could become a competitor as it seeks markets for its excess capacity  koch s capacity would also represent a potential power source for nsp  and koch s plan represents a potential loss of a large retail customer 
the project s anticipated three year lead time will allow nsp to respond appropriately 
wholesale customers nsp had wholesale revenues from sales of electricity of approximately million in and approximately million in the trend of increased competition  as previously discussed  has resulted in significant changes in the negotiation of contracts with wholesale customers 
in the past several years  these customers have begun to evaluate a variety of energy sources to provide their power supply 
while the full impact of these changes is unknown at this time  the following changes have been identified 
in  nine of the company s municipal wholesale electric customers notified the company of their intent to terminate their power supply agreements with the company  effective july or july the loss of seven of these customers in july resulted in a revenue decrease of approximately million from levels 
the other two customers  who are expected to terminate their power agreements in july  provided revenues of million in these nine customers are expected to become wheeling customers providing estimated annual revenues of nearly million 
nsp s remaining municipal wholesale electric customers are under contracts with terms expiring in the years through during  the company signed an electric power agreement to provide michigan s upper peninsula power company uppco with up to megawatts of baseload service  peaking service options and load regulation service options for years from january through december load regulation service is designed to change the level of power delivery during each hour to match uppco s load requirements 
uppco has nominated megawatts of baseload and five megawatts of winter season peaking power purchases from nsp beginning jan 
 the annual revenue for is projected to be approximately million to million 
the interchange agreement between uppco and nsp for this sale was accepted by the ferc 
the michigan public utilities commission also must approve the transaction 
rate changes as discussed previously under utility operating results  filings for rate changes in had an immaterial impact on financial results 
no significant general rate filings in any of nsp s utility jurisdictions are expected for however  the company has proposed rate changes in connection with requested approvals of its proposed business combination with wec  as discussed previously 
used nuclear fuel storage and disposal in  nsp received legislative authorization from the state of minnesota for dry cask fuel storage facilities at the company s prairie island nuclear generating facility 
as a condition of this authorization  the minnesota legislature established several resource commitments for the company  including wind and biomass generation sources  as well as other requirements 
in addition  the company and other utilities filed a lawsuit against the doe in to compel the doe to fulfill its statutory and contractual obligations to store and dispose of used nuclear fuel as required by the nuclear waste policy act of also  the company is leading a consortium to establish a private facility for interim storage of used nuclear fuel  the outcome of which is uncertain at this time

environmental matters nsp incurs several types of environmental costs  including nuclear plant decommissioning  storage and ultimate disposal of used nuclear fuel  disposal of hazardous materials and wastes  remediation of contaminated sites and monitoring of discharges into the environment 
because of the continuing trend toward greater environmental awareness and increasingly stringent regulation  nsp has been experiencing a trend toward increasing environmental costs 
this trend has caused  and may continue to cause  slightly higher operating expenses and capital expenditures for environmental compliance 
in addition to nuclear decommissioning and used nuclear fuel disposal expenses as discussed in note to the financial statements  costs charged to nsp s operating expenses for environmental monitoring and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes in were approximately million and are expected to increase to an average annual amount of approximately million for the five year period however  the precise timing and amount of environmental costs  including those for site remediation and disposal of hazardous materials  are currently unknown 
in each of the years   and  the company spent about million for capital expenditures on environmental improvements at its utility facilities 
in  the company expects to incur approximately million in capital expenditures for compliance with environmental regulations and approximately million for the five year period these capital expenditure amounts include the costs of constructing used nuclear fuel storage casks 
see notes and to the financial statements for further discussion of these and other environmental contingencies that could affect nsp 
weather nsp s earnings can be significantly affected by unusual weather 
in  unusual weather  mainly a hot summer  increased earnings over a normal year by an estimated cents per share 
mild weather  mainly cool summers  reduced earnings from a normal year by an estimated cents per share in and cents per share in the effect of weather is considered part of nsp s ongoing business operations 
acquisitions in  nrg acquired ownership interests in three significant international energy projects listed in note to the financial statements 
nsp also made three other strategically important business acquisitions in  including an interstate natural gas pipeline viking  an energy services marketing business cenergy and a steam heating and chilled water cooling system business minneapolis energy center  now an nrg subsidiary 
nsp continues to evaluate opportunities to enhance its competitive position and shareholder returns through strategic business acquisitions 
impact of non regulated investments nsp s net income includes after tax earnings of million  or cents per share  from all of its non regulated businesses in and million  or cents per share  in as discussed previously  nrg acquired equity interests in three significant energy projects in nsp expects to continue investing significant amounts in non regulated projects  including domestic and international power production projects through nrg  as described under future financing requirements 
depending on the success and timing of involvement in these projects  nsp s goal is for nrg earnings to increase in the future to contribute at least percent of nsp s earnings by the year the non regulated projects in which nrg has invested carry a higher level of risk than nsp s traditional utility businesses 
current and future investments in non regulated projects are subject to uncertainties prior to final legal closing  and continuing operations are subject to foreign government actions  foreign economic and currency risks  partnership actions  competition  operating risks  dependence on certain suppliers and customers  domestic and foreign environmental and energy regulations  or all of these items 
most of nrg s current project investments consist of minority interests  and a substantial portion of future investments may take the form of minority interests  which limits nrg s ability to control the development or operation of the projects 
in addition  significant expenses may be incurred for potential projects pursued by nrg that may never materialize 
the operating results of nsp s non regulated businesses in and may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results 
accounting changes the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued two new accounting standards that become effective in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets  establishes standards for measuring and recognizing asset impairments 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  provides an optional accounting method for compensation from stock option and other stock award programs that nsp does not intend to use 
nsp does not expect the adoption of these new accounting standards to have a material impact on its results of operations or financial condition 
however  the principles of sfas no 
will be followed to measure the effects of any stranded investments that could arise from the act  the ferc s mega nopr proposal or other competitive business developments 
the fasb also has proposed new accounting standards expected to go into effect in the standards would require the full accrual of nuclear plant decommissioning and certain other site exit obligations 
material adjustments to nsp s balance sheet could occur under the fasb s proposal 
however  the effects of regulation are expected to minimize or eliminate any impact on operating expenses and earnings from this future accounting change 
for further discussion of the expected impact of this change  see note to the financial statements 
use of derivatives through its non regulated subsidiaries  nsp uses derivative financial instruments to hedge the risks of fluctuations in foreign currencies and natural gas prices 
also  to hedge the interest rate risk associated with fixed rate debt in a declining interest rate environment  nsp uses interest rate swap agreements to convert fixed rate debt to variable rate debt 
see notes and to the financial statements for further discussion of nsp s financial instruments and derivatives 
non recurring items nsp s earnings for include two significant unusual or infrequently occurring items 
as discussed in the non regulated business results section  nrg recognized a pretax gain of approximately million cents per share from a power sales contract termination settlement 
partially offsetting this gain was an asset impairment write down of million before taxes cents per share for a non regulated domestic energy project 
nsp s earnings also included several significant unusual or infrequently occurring items 
although their net effect was an earnings increase of only cent per share  individually significant non recurring items included a gain on termination of a non regulated cogeneration contract  interest income from the settlement of a federal income tax dispute  a charge for pre postemployment costs associated with adopting sfas no 
 and asset impairment write downs for certain non regulated energy projects 
inflation historically  certain operating costs  mainly labor and property taxes  have been affected by inflation 
also  inflation has tended to increase the replacement cost of operating facilities  which has increased depreciation expense when replacement facilities are constructed 
however  several significant expense items  including fuel costs  income taxes and interest expense have been less sensitive to inflation 
overall  inflation at the levels currently being experienced is not expected to materially affect nsp s prices to customers or returns to shareholders 
liquidity and capital resources financing requirements nsp s need for capital funds is primarily related to the construction of plant and equipment to meet the needs of electric and gas utility customers and to fund equity commitments or other investments in non regulated businesses 
total nsp utility capital expenditures including afc were million in of that amount  million related to replacements and improvements of nsp s electric system and nuclear fuel  and million involved construction of natural gas distribution facilities 
nsp companies invested million in non regulated projects and property in nrg primarily invested in existing projects 
in  cenergy became a majority investor percent in energy masters corporation  a firm specializing in energy efficiency improvement services for commercial  industrial and institutional customers 
the investment is accounted for on a consolidated basis 
eloigne company invested in affordable housing projects  including wholly owned and limited partnership ventures 
financing activity during  nsp s primary sources of capital included internally generated funds  long term debt  short term debt and common stock issuances  as discussed below 
the allocation of financing requirements between these capital options is based on the relative cost of each option  regulatory restrictions and the constraints of nsp s long range capital structure objectives 
during  nsp continued to meet its long range regulated capital structure objective of percent common equity and percent debt 
funds generated internally from operating cash flows in remained sufficient to meet working capital needs  debt service  dividend payout requirements and non regulated investment commitments  as well as fund a significant portion of construction expenditures 
the pretax interest coverage ratio  excluding afc  was in and in these ratios met nsp s objective range of for interest coverage 
internally generated funds could have provided financing for percent of nsp s total capital expenditures for and percent of the billion in capital expenditures incurred for the five year period nsp had approximately million in short term borrowings outstanding as of dec 
 throughout  short term borrowings were used to finance a portion of utility capital expenditures and provide for other nsp cash needs 
in  the company issued million of first mortgage bonds to refinance higher cost debt issues and reduce short term debt levels 
eloigne company also issued approximately million of long term debt to finance affordable housing project investments 
during  the company issued new shares of common stock under various stock plans  including  new shares under the employee stock ownership plan esop   new shares under the dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan drspp  and  new shares under the executive long term incentive award stock plan 
in addition  the company issued common stock in connection with a non regulated business acquisition 
at dec 
  the total number of common shares outstanding was nsp s equity investments in non regulated projects during were financed through internally generated funds 
project financing requirements  in excess of equity contributions from investors  were satisfied with project debt 
project debt associated with many of nsp s non regulated investments is not reflected in nsp s balance sheet because the equity method of accounting is used for such investments 
see note to the financial statements 
in january  nrg issued million of percent unsecured senior notes maturing in to support equity requirements for projects currently under way and in development 
the senior notes were assigned ratings of bbb by s p s rating group and baa by moody s 
future financing requirements utility financing requirements for may be affected in varying degrees by numerous factors  including load growth  changes in capital expenditure levels  rate changes allowed by regulatory agencies  new legislation  market entry of competing electric power generators  changes in environmental regulations and other regulatory requirements 
nsp currently estimates that its utility capital expenditures will be million in and billion for the five year period of the amount  approximately million is scheduled for utility electric facilities and approximately million for natural gas facilities including viking 
in addition to utility capital expenditures  expected financing requirements for the period include approximately million to retire long term debt and meet first mortgage bond sinking fund requirements 
through its subsidiaries  nsp expects to invest significant amounts in non regulated projects in the future 
financing requirements for non regulated project investments may vary depending on the success  timing and level of involvement in projects currently under consideration 
nsp s potential capital requirements for non regulated projects and property are estimated to be approximately million in and approximately million for the five year period these amounts include commitments for nrg investments  as discussed in note to the financial statements  and eloigne company investments of up to million annually in for affordable housing projects 
eloigne company expects to finance approximately percent of these investments in affordable housing projects with equity and approximately percent with long term debt 
in addition to investments in non regulated projects  nsp continues to evaluate opportunities to enhance shareholder returns and achieve long term financial objectives through acquisitions of existing businesses 
long term financing may be required for such investments 
the company also will have future financing requirements for the portion of nuclear plant decommissioning costs not funded externally 
based on the most recent decommissioning study  these amounts are anticipated to be approximately million  and are expected to be paid during the years to future sources of financing nsp expects to obtain external capital for future financing requirements by periodically issuing long term debt  short term debt  common stock and preferred stock as needed to maintain desired capitalization ratios 
over the long term  nsp s equity investments in non regulated projects are expected to be financed through internally generated funds or the company s issuance of common stock 
financing requirements for the non regulated projects  in excess of equity contributions from investors  are expected to be fulfilled through project or subsidiary debt 
decommissioning expenses not funded by an external trust are expected to be financed through a combination of internally generated funds  long term debt and common stock 
the extent of external financing to be required for nuclear decommissioning costs  as discussed above  is unknown at this time 
nsp s ability to finance its utility construction program at a reasonable cost and to provide for other capital needs depends on its ability to meet investors return expectations 
financing flexibility is enhanced by providing working capital needs and a high percentage of total capital requirements from internal sources  and having the ability to issue long term securities and obtain short term credit 
nsp expects to maintain adequate access to securities markets in access to securities markets at a reasonable cost is determined in large part by credit quality 
the company s first mortgage bonds are rated aa by standard poor s corporation  a by moody s investors service  inc moody s  aa by duff phelps  inc  and aa by fitch investors service  inc ratings for the wisconsin company s first mortgage bonds are generally comparable 
these ratings reflect the views of such organizations  and an explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from each agency 
in may  moody s downgraded the company s first mortgage bond ratings to a based on its interpretation of provisions of a minnesota law enacted in for used nuclear fuel storage at the prairie island generating plant 
the other three rating agencies reaffirmed their ratings of the company s bonds after considering the potential impact of the legislation on nsp 
as discussed in notes and to the financial statements  the legislation requires the company to increase its use of renewable energy sources such as wind and biomass power 
moody s has indicated that it believes these sources of power are considerably more costly than the power currently generated and that nsp s electric production costs will increase materially over current levels 
nsp acknowledges that electric production costs may increase as a result of the prairie island legislation 
in  moody s placed the company s ratings on credit review for possible upgrade based on anticipated cost savings from the proposed merger with wec  which was discussed previously 
the company s and the wisconsin company s first mortgage indentures limit the amount of first mortgage bonds that may be issued 
the mpuc and the pscw have jurisdiction over securities issuance

commercial banks presently provide credit lines of approximately million to the company and an additional million to subsidiaries of the company 
these credit lines make short term financing available in the form of bank loans 
the company s articles of incorporation authorize the maximum amount of preferred stock that may be issued 
under these provisions  the company could have issued all million of its remaining authorized  but unissued  preferred stock at dec 
  and remained in compliance with all interest and dividend coverage requirements 
the level of common stock authorized under the company s articles of incorporation is million shares

the company may issue new shares or purchase shares on the open market for its stock based plans 
see note to the financial statements for discussion of stock awards outstanding 
the company plans to issue new shares for its drspp  esop and executive long term incentive award stock plans in while no general public stock offerings are currently anticipated in  such offerings may be necessary to fund significant equity investments in non regulated projects should they occur 
internally generated funds from utility operations are expected to equal approximately percent of anticipated utility capital expenditures for and approximately percent of the billion in anticipated utility capital expenditures for the five year period internally generated funds from all operations are expected to equal approximately percent and percent  respectively  of the anticipated total capital expenditures for and the five year period because nsp intends to reinvest foreign cash flows in non us operations  the equity income from international investments currently does not provide operating cash available for us cash requirements such as payment of dividends  domestic capital expenditures and domestic debt service 
through nrg  nsp intends to pursue a diverse portfolio of foreign energy projects with varying levels of cash flows  income and foreign taxation to allow maximum flexibility of foreign cash flows 
the merger agreement  as previously discussed  provides for restrictions on certain transactions by both the company and wec  including the issuance of debt and equity securities 
while the company currently does not plan to enter into transactions that would not comply with these restrictions  circumstances may arise to make such transactions necessary 
under such circumstances  the company and wec would need to mutually agree to amend the merger agreement
