contingencies and uncertainties the internal revenue service the irs is currently examining the company s federal tax returns for the years through in december  the company received an examination report from the irs proposing a substantial tax deficiency based on this examination 
the examination report raises a variety of issues  including the company s substantiation for certain deductions taken during this period  the company s utilization of certain net operating loss carryovers nol s and the availability of such nol s to offset future taxable income 
if the irs were to prevail on all the issues raised  the amount of the tax assessment would be approximately plus interest and penalties 
if the company were required to pay a significant portion of the assessment  it could have a material adverse impact on the company and could exceed the company s resources 
the company has filed its administrative appeal to the examination report 
although management believes that the company will be able to provide adequate documentation for a substantial portion of the deductions questioned by the irs and that there is substantial support for the company s past and future utilization of the nol s  the ultimate outcome of this matter is subject to the resolution of significant legal and factual issues 
if the company s positions prevail on the most significant issues  management believes that the amounts due would not exceed amounts previously paid or provided  however  even under such circumstances  it is possible that the company s nol s could be reduced to some extent 
no additional accruals have been made for any amounts which might be due as a result of this matter because the possible loss ranges from zero to plus interest and penalties and the ultimate outcome cannot presently be determined or estimated

lenz retired as chairman of the board of the company

lenz is able to sell a substantial portion of his shares in the company  such sale  in combination with the issuance by terex of certain common stock purchase warrants on december  and subject to the effects of other changes in share ownership of the company  could result in a change in control for tax purposes
