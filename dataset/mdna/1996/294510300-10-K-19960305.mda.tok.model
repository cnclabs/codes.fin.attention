this analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear elsewhere in this report 
the company reports financial results on a consolidated basis 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its subsidiaries  all of which are wholly owned at december  the company s primary subsidiaries are equitable life insurance company of iowa equitable life and usg annuity life company usg 
results of operations sales percentage percentage year ended december change change dollars in thousands first year and single premiums annuities    life insurance    renewal premiums annuities    life insurance    total premiums    total annuity and life insurance sales  as measured by first year and single premiums  decreased to  in compared to an increase of to  in from  in the current year decrease in annuity sales from record sales in reflects the impact of a more challenging sales environment during than in previous years wherein high short term interest rates have allowed bank certificates of deposit and other shorter duration investments to be more competitive than usual  while declining long term rates have caused returns on annuity and life insurance products to be comparatively lower than usual 
however  the company believes that the growth in the number of its agents  its commitment to customer service  the quality of its investment portfolio  competitive pricing and its overall financial strength will continue to attract consumers to its products as consumers seek a secure return on their retirement savings 
insurance agents are attracted to sell the company s products by several factors  including the company s diversified product portfolio  competitive commissions  prompt policy issuance and weekly commission payments 
the increase in life insurance premiums resulted primarily from a simplified career agent contract which emphasizes life production  an increase in experienced career agent recruits and increased production from brokers  especially on our single premium life products 
revenues percentage percentage year ended december change change dollars in thousands annuity and universal life product charges    traditional life insurance premiums    net investment income    realized gains on investments    other income    total revenues increased to  in compared to an increase of to  in from  in annuity and universal life insurance product charges increased in compared to an increase of in these product charges consist primarily of cost of insurance charges  policy administrative charges and surrender charges that increase as the company s policyholder liabilities grow 
in addition  withdrawals and surrenders of the company s annuity products which contain a market value adjustment feature generate greater surrender charge income as interest rates increase and lower surrender charge income as interest rates decrease 
surrender charge income allows the company to recover a portion of the expenses incurred to generate policy sales  and partially offsets the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs related to surrendered policies 
premiums from traditional life insurance products  which are included in revenue  decreased in compared to a decrease of in as a result of the company s continued emphasis on the more popular universal life and fixed premium  current interest life insurance products for which premiums are not included in revenues 
net investment income increased to  in compared to an increase of to  in from  in as invested assets continued to increase and decreases in portfolio yield slowed 
the effective average annual yield on assets invested to support policy accounts for interest sensitive products  including annuities  universal life type policies and participating life policies  was in compared to in and in the company s total investment portfolio  excluding policy loans  had a yield at amortized cost of at december  and  compared to at december  during  the company had realized gains on the disposal of investments  which were generated primarily from calls and repayments of fixed maturities  of  compared to realized gains of  in and  in expenses total insurance benefits and expenses increased to  in compared to an increase of to  in from  in interest credited to annuity and universal life account balances increased to  in compared to an increase of to  in from  in as a result of higher account balances associated with those products 
the company s policy is to change rates credited to policy accounts as the company s investment portfolio yield changes 
most of the company s interest sensitive products  including annuities  universal life type policies and participating policies  allow for interest rate adjustments at least annually 
the following table summarizes the effective annual yield on assets invested to support policy accounts for interest sensitive products  the average interest rate credited to those products and the interest rate spread for the years ended december   and yield on assets and cost of funds are estimated by calculating the weighted average of the twelve month end values for those items 
years ended december  yield on credited interest  and assets rate rate spread average base rate excluding first year bonus average total including first year bonus at december  and  the effective annual yield on assets  credited rate and interest rate spread were as follows yield on credited interest december  and assets rate rate spread base rate excluding first year bonus total including first year bonus the base interest credited rate represents the average interest rate credited to policy accounts for interest sensitive products  including annuities  universal life type policies and participating policies 
total interest credited rate includes first year bonus interest credited to certain annuity policies 
death benefits on traditional life products and benefit claims incurred in excess of account balances increased to  in compared to an increase of to  in from  in after adjustment for charges for mortality risk  reserves released on death claims and taxes  the overall impact of mortality on net income was less favorable in compared to by approximately  and less favorable in compared to by  other benefits increased to  in compared to an increase of to  in from  in the increase in other benefits in is primarily attributable to the coinsurance of a small block of disability income business which was offset by a corresponding reduction in future policy benefits and  therefore  had only a minor impact on net income 
commissions decreased to  in compared to an increase of to  in from  in general expenses decreased to  in compared to an increase of to  in from  in insurance taxes increased to  in compared to an increase of to  in from  in increases and decreases in commissions and insurance taxes are generally related to changes in the level of annuity sales 
the increase in insurance taxes resulted from the special reserve accrual for future guaranty fund assessments totaling  in the fourth quarter of most costs incurred as the result of new sales have been deferred  thus having very little impact on current earnings 
the decrease in general expenses is the result of restructuring the company s career agent contracts and compensation to eliminate certain fixed costs that were included in general expenses in and as a result of this change  agent compensation is predominately in the form of commissions and  as such  will vary directly with sales production levels 
additionally  with the more challenging annuity sales environment  management began an aggressive expense management program in the second quarter which also reduced the level of general expenses 
management intends to closely manage general expenses and plans for general expenses to continue to decline as a percentage of assets and or revenues  but does not expect these expenses to decline at a rate comparable to that achieved during the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs increased to  in compared to an increase of to  in from  in increases in amortization of deferred acquisition costs related to operating earnings are the result of increases in the deferred policy acquisition cost asset before adjustment to reflect the impact of sfas no 
as costs of generating sales of the company s products are deferred and amortized in later periods 
also  higher withdrawals and surrenders of the company s products have accelerated the amortization of deferred acquisition costs related to those products although surrender charges assessed on certain withdrawals offset some of the earnings impact of this accelerated amortization 
amortization related to realized gains continues to decline as a result of the decrease in realized and prepayment gains 
percentage percentage year ended december change change dollars in thousands amortization related to operating income    realized gains    total income    most of the company s annuity products have surrender charges which are designed to discourage early withdrawals and to allow the company to recover a portion of the expenses incurred to generate annuity sales in the event of early withdrawal 
withdrawal rates have been impacted by several factors 
the company is experiencing an increase in its underlying withdrawal rate as its annuity liabilities age 
when interest rates on new sales are higher than inforce rates  as in  withdrawals tend to increase 
a block of annuity policies sold in and primarily by stockbrokers contained a five year surrender charge and a portion also contained a five year interest guarantee 
the company planned for  and experienced  higher surrenders related to this block of business 
at december   all policies issued from through with a five year interest guarantee represent approximately million of the company s annuity liabilities 
the company is currently studying a hedging program which would use certain derivative instruments interest rate caps or swap options to reduce the negative effect of increased withdrawal activity which may result from extreme increases in interest rates 
the following table summarizes the annual annuity withdrawal rates and the life insurance lapse ratios for the years ended december   and year ended december annuity withdrawals annuity withdrawals excluding withdrawals of policies for which the five year interest guarantee and five year surrender charge have expired life insurance lapse ratio the withdrawal ratio for the company s annuity products is calculated by dividing aggregate surrenders and withdrawals by beginning of period account balances 
the company s annual lapse ratio for life insurance is measured in terms of face amount and uses am best s formula 
during  the company made one fixed annuity product available for sale through stockbrokers  but has modified the pricing assumptions to reflect higher lapse expectations 
prior to this  the company had not actively solicited fixed annuity sales through stockbrokers since the company plans to continue to expand its distribution channels to include stockbrokers  banks and other financial institutions in addition to its current brokerage and career agency distribution channels 
product features and pricing assumptions are expected to be modified to reflect the differing characteristics and needs of these different markets 
operating income income  excluding  net of related income tax  prepayment gains on mortgages and mortgage backed securities  realized gains or losses  related amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs  and the special reserve accrual for future guaranty fund assessments increased in compared to an increase of in net income decreased in compared to an increase of in a breakdown of income is as follows year ended december per share per share dollars in thousands  except per share data operating income   realized gains net of tax gains realized on disposal of investments   mortgage and mortgage backed securities prepayment gains   realized gains related amortization of dpac   guaranty fund accrual  net income   year ended december per share dollars in thousands  except per share data operating income  realized gains net of tax gains realized on disposal of investments  mortgage and mortgage backed securities prepayment gains realized gains related amortization of dpac  guaranty fund accrual net income  average shares outstanding totaled  in compared to  in and  in operating earnings increased primarily as a result of the growth in average assets 
realized gains continue to decline due to fewer prepayments and calls 
the decline in net income in is attributable to the  or per share  after tax accrual of a special reserve for future guaranty fund assessments 
earnings per share  operating and net income  grew less than operating earnings and net income in due to the additional shares outstanding as a result of the common stock offering in october financial condition investments the financial statement carrying value of the company s total investments grew in the amortized cost basis of the company s total investment portfolio grew during the same period 
effective december   all of the company s investments  other than mortgage loans and real estate  are carried at market value in the company s financial statements 
as such  growth in the carrying value of the company s investment portfolio included unrealized appreciation and depreciation of fixed maturity and equity securities as well as growth in the cost basis of these securities 
growth in the cost basis of the company s investment portfolio resulted from the investment of premiums from the sale of the company s insurance and annuity products 
the company manages the growth of its insurance operations in order to maintain adequate capital ratios 
to support the company s annuities and life insurance products  cash flow was invested primarily in fixed income investments 
at december   the company s investment portfolio was comprised of the following yield at amortized of estimated of amortized cost total market value total cost dollars in thousands investment cash and short term investments   governments and agency mortgage backed securities   conventional mortgage backed securities   investment grade corporate securities   below investment grade corporate securities   mortgage loans   total cash and fixed   income investments equity securities   real estate   total investments   note estimated market values of publicly traded securities are as reported by an independent pricing service 
market values of conventional mortgage backed securities not actively traded in a liquid market are estimated using a third party pricing system  which uses a matrix calculation assuming a spread over us treasury bonds based upon the expected average lives of the securities 
market values of private placement bonds are estimated using a matrix that assumes a spread based on interest rates and a risk assessment of the bonds over us treasury bonds 
estimated market values of redeemable preferred stocks are as reported by the national association of insurance commissioners naic 
market values of mortgage loans on real estate are estimated by discounting expected cash flows  using interest rates currently being offered for similar loans 
market values of publicly traded equity securities are based upon the most recently available quoted price for those securities 
market values of the company s investment in its registered separate account are based upon the quoted market value of the securities comprising the individual portfolios underlying the separate account 
market value of owned real estate is estimated to be equal to  or in excess of  carrying value based upon appraised values 
at december   the ratings assigned by standard poor s corporation standard poor s and moody s investors service moody s to the individual securities in the company s fixed maturities portfolio are summarized as follows amortized of estimated of cost total market value total dollars in thousands ratings assigned by standard poor s us governments  agencies aaa corporates   aa to aa   a to a   bbb to bbb   bb to bb   b to b   ccc to ccc   issues not rated by s p by naic rating rated aaa to a   rated bbb to bbb   rated bb to bb   rated b to b   rated c  d   redeemable preferred stock total fixed maturities   amortized of estimated of cost total market value total dollars in thousands ratings assigned by moody s us governments  agencies aaa corporates   aa to aa   a to a   baa to baa   ba to ba   b to b   caa to caa   issues not rated by moody s by naic rating rated aaa to a   rated baa to baa   rated ba to ba   rated b to b   rated c to ca   redeemable preferred stock total fixed maturities   on november   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a special report a guide to implementation of statement on accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
this report allowed companies a one time opportunity to reassess the classification of their securities holdings pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
sfas no 
requires companies to classify their securities as held to maturity  available for sale or trading 
sfas no 
significantly restricts a company s ability to sell securities in the held to maturity category without raising questions about the appropriateness of its accounting policy for such securities 
classification of securities as held to maturity  therefore  limits a company s ability to manage its investment portfolio in many circumstances 
for example  a company would be prohibited from accepting a tender offer or responding to an anticipated decline in the credit quality of assets in a particular industry when the security is categorized as held to maturity 
additionally  a company is unable to adjust its portfolio to take advantage of tax planning opportunities or economic changes that would assist in asset liability management 
thus a company s ability to maintain the appropriate flexibility to make optimal investment decisions is significantly restricted if it classifies securities as held to maturity 
in response to this opportunity  the company reclassified of the securities in its held to maturity category to available for sale on december  to maximize investment flexibility 
as a result of this reclassification  the net unrealized investment gain component of shareholders equity increased by  on december  net of deferred taxes of  and an adjustment of  to deferred policy acquisition costs to reflect the net unrealized investment gains on securities classified as available for sale that were previously classified as held to maturity 
the company is not  however  precluded from classifying securities as held to maturity in the future 
while it is not the company s current practice to engage in active management of the fixed maturities securities portfolio such that significant sales would occur  the inability to respond to prudent financial management decisions necessitated this change 
sfas no 
requires the carrying value of fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale to be adjusted for changes in the market value  primarily caused by interest rates 
while other related accounts are adjusted as discussed above  the insurance liabilities supported by these securities are not adjusted under sfas no 
 thereby creating volatility in shareholders equity as interest rates change 
as a result  the company expects that its shareholders equity will be exposed to incremental volatility due to changes in market interest rates and the accompanying changes in the reported value of securities classified as available for sale  with equity increasing as market interest rates decline and  conversely  decreasing as market interest rates rise 
due to this potential for distortion in shareholders equity  fair value disclosure is provided in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments requires disclosure of fair values for selected financial instruments but does not require disclosure of fair value of life insurance liabilities 
although the company s life insurance liabilities are specifically exempted from this disclosure requirement  estimated fair value disclosure of these liabilities is provided in an effort to more properly reflect changes in shareholders equity from fluctuations in interest rates 
on december   fixed income securities with an amortized cost of  and an estimated market value of  were designated as available for sale 
unrealized holding gains on these securities  net of adjustments to deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred income taxes  increased stockholders equity by  or per share at december  net unrealized appreciation of fixed maturity securities of  was comprised of gross appreciation of  and gross depreciation of  the percentage of the company s portfolio invested in below investment grade securities increased slightly during at december   the amortized cost value of the company s total investment in below investment grade securities consisted of investments in issuers totaling  or  of the company s investment portfolio compared to issuers totaling  or  at december  the company intends to purchase additional below investment grade securities but it does not expect the percentage of its portfolio invested in below investment grade securities to exceed 
at december   the yield at amortized cost on the company s below investment grade portfolio was compared to for the company s investment grade corporate bond portfolio 
the company estimates that the market value of its below investment grade portfolio was  or of amortized cost value  at december  below investment grade securities have different characteristics than investment grade corporate debt securities 
risk of loss upon default by the borrower is significantly greater with respect to below investment grade securities than with other corporate debt securities 
below investment grade securities are generally unsecured and are often subordinated to other creditors of the issuer 
also  issuers of below investment grade securities usually have higher levels of debt and are more sensitive to adverse economic conditions  such as recession or increasing interest rates  than are investment grade issuers 
the company attempts to reduce the overall risk in its below investment grade portfolio  as in all of its investments  through careful credit analysis  strict investment policy guidelines  and diversification by company and by industry 
the company analyzes its investment portfolio  including below investment grade securities  at least quarterly in order to determine if its ability to realize its carrying value on any investment has been impaired 
for debt and equity securities  if impairment in value is determined to be other than temporary ie if it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the security  the cost basis of the impaired security is written down to fair value  which becomes the security s new cost basis 
the amount of the writedown is included in earnings as a realized loss 
future events may occur  or additional or updated information may be received  which may necessitate future write downs of securities in the company s portfolio 
significant write downs in the carrying value of investments could materially adversely affect the company s net income in future periods 
during  the company identified two below investment grade securities as having impairments in value that were other than temporary 
as a result of those determinations  the company recognized pre tax losses of  to reduce the amortized cost basis of these two securities to their estimated fair value 
these securities were subsequently sold resulting in realized gains totaling  at december   no fixed maturity securities were deemed to have impairments in value that are other than temporary 
the company s fixed maturity investment portfolio had a combined yield at amortized cost of at december  and mortgage loans make up approximately of the company s investment portfolio  as compared to an industry average of  based on information reported in the acli fact book 
the company has resumed active mortgage lending to broaden its investment alternatives and  as a result of this increase in lending activity  mortgages outstanding increased to  from  during the company expects this asset category to continue to grow over the next several years 
the company s mortgage loan portfolio includes loans with an average size of  and average seasoning of years if weighted by the number of loans  and years if weighted by mortgage loan carrying values 
the company s mortgage loans are typically secured by occupied buildings in major metropolitan locations and not speculative developments  and are diversified by type of property and geographic location 
at december   the yield on the company s mortgage loan portfolio was 
distribution of these loans by type of collateral is as follows of of carrying mortgage loans value portfolio dollars in thousands collateral breakdown farm multi family residential  industrial  office buildings  retail  other  total  distribution of these loans by geographic breakdown is as follows of of carrying mortgage loans value portfolio dollars in thousands geographic breakdown middle atlantic  south atlantic  east north central  west north central  east south central  west south central  mountain  pacific  total  at december   the company had established valuation allowances of  on two mortgage loans one of which was delinquent by days or more to reduce the carrying value of these investments to their estimated fair value less costs to sell 
the company does not expect to incur material losses from its mortgage loan portfolio since mortgage loans represent a small percentage of the company s investment portfolio 
the company has been able to recover of the principal amount of problem mortgages that have been resolved in the last three years 
at december   the company owned real estate totaling  including properties acquired through foreclosure valued at in total  the company has experienced a relatively small number of problems with its total investment portfolio  with only of the company s investments in default at december  the company estimates its total investment portfolio  excluding policy loans  had a market value equal to of amortized cost value for accounting purposes at december  other assets accrued investment income increased  during due to an increase in new fixed income investments and in the overall size of the portfolio 
deferred policy acquisition costs decreased  over year end levels

surrender charge periods on annuity policies currently typically range from years to the term of the policy  with of such policies being issued with a surrender charge period of seven years or more during the initial surrender charge on annuity policies ranges from to of the premium and decreases over the surrender charge period

total consolidated debt increased  during as the company issued  of notes in february of that amount   was contributed to the company s insurance subsidiaries to fund growth in insurance operations and the remainder was used to reduce commercial paper and to provide for short term operating needs 
as a result  commercial paper notes payable decreased  and amounted to  at december  other liabilities increased  from year end levels due to a  net increase in the company s reserve for future guaranty fund assessments and a  increase in draft accounts payable related to the company s asset retention program

at december   there were  common shares outstanding compared to  shares at december  the effects of inflation and changing prices on the company are not material since insurance assets and liabilities are both primarily monetary and remain in balance 
an effect of inflation  which has been low in recent years  is a decline in purchasing power when monetary assets exceed monetary liabilities 
liquidity and capital resources the liquidity requirements of the company s subsidiaries are met by cash flow from annuity and insurance premiums  investment income  and maturities of fixed maturity investments and mortgage loans 
the company primarily uses funds for the payment of insurance and annuity benefits  operating expenses and commissions  and the purchase of new investments

the amount of any liability which may arise as a result of this arbitration  if any  cannot be reasonably estimated and no provision for loss has been made in the accompanying financial statements
