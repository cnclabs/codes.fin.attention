item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
the growth in the company s sales and operating income has been achieved through the successful implementation of management s business strategies 
overall sales growth of was achieved through an increase in both the domestic and international sectors 
domestic sales grew by million  bolstered by sales of new products and by ten domestic acquisitions 
acquisitions accounted for approximately million of the domestic sales growth 
international sales grew by million  aided by recovering international economies and the acquisition of nunc 
acquisitions accounted for approximately million of the international sales growth 
the modest internal domestic growth can be attributed to softness in the company s core domestic laboratory business experienced primarily in the first half of although end user demand remained healthy  demand from the company s largest domestic laboratory distributors was weak in the wake of significant dealer consolidation 
in the company s principal distributors  fisher  cms  vwr and baxter industrial  combined into two distributors through fisher s acquisition of cms and vwr s acquisition of baxter industrial 
this distributor consolidation is believed to have been responsible for the slowness in domestic laboratory sales during the first half of as distributor inventories were reduced 
see item  business laboratory segment 
as discussed in item  business general  management has maintained an active program of developing and marketing both new products and product line extensions 
the company believes that new product introductions have enabled the operating subsidiaries to maintain their competitive positions 
management has also sought out and pursued numerous acquisition opportunities  completing twenty nine such acquisitions since  ten of which were completed by the company in acquisitions completed in were as follows approximate acquisition company annual sales date description analytic technology corporation million manufacturer of equipment used in conjunction with endodontic treatment 
casco standards  inc million manufacturer of liquid standards as well as calibration verification and quality control materials used with clinical diagnostic and testing equipment

micro aseptic products  inc million marketer of infection control products  disinfectant and decontaminant cleaners  deodorizers  antiseptic hand and skin cleaners and related products to the medical and dental markets 
e d dental products  inc million wholesale supplier of dental products 
these acquisitions are consistent with the company s strategy of making acquisitions which provide product lines that can be manufactured in existing facilities  sold through existing sales and distribution networks  or both 
the company intends to continue to seek out acquisition candidates consistent with its business strategy 
however  there can be no assurance of the number or size of future acquisitions 
as described in item  legal proceedings  one of the company s subsidiaries is involved as a prp at the aqua tech site  and another is involved in legal proceedings with respect to environmental claims against it with respect to the rochester site 
because the testing has not been done to determine what remedy  if any  should be required at the aqua tech site  an estimate of the company s potential liability with respect to this site cannot be made at this time 
however  and although cercla does provide for joint and several liability  because the company s share of waste allegedly sent to the site is reportedly not more than of the total waste sent  the company believes that any ultimate liability with respect to the aqua tech site will not have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or financial condition of the company and its subsidiaries as a whole 
with respect to the rochester site  as reported previously  on may   combustion engineering  inc ce commenced legal proceedings in the new york supreme court  county of monroe the ce litigation  against the company with respect to the former taylor instruments taylor facility in rochester  new york the rochester site  a discontinued operation 
according to ce s complaint  its claims are based on an asset purchase and sale agreement dated as of september   pursuant to which taylor was sold to ce the agreement  and an agreement between a subsidiary of the company and ce dated august  the agreement 
the complaint alleges that under the agreement the company retained certain liabilities for  and indemnified ce with respect to  environmental contamination  hazards and other conditions that existed at the time of the sale of taylor to ce  and that under the agreement  the company agreed to bear percent of the costs thereafter incurred to clean up  remediate and remove mercury from the land and buildings at the rochester site 
ce s complaint seeks declaratory relief and claims damages of at least million with respect to expenses ce has incurred and expects to incur to remediate and remove mercury contamination from the land and buildings sold to ce at the rochester site 
the complaint also seeks declaratory relief and claims damages in excess of million with respect to expenses incurred and expected to be incurred for remediating other alleged environmental hazards associated with the rochester site 
some of ce s claims relate to the cost to demolish and dispose of the buildings at the rochester site  which ce maintains it had to do because the buildings were contaminated with mercury 
ce previously informed the company that ce claims that the company s share of such demolition and disposal costs is approximately million 
the company denies it has any liability for such costs 
ce s remaining claims relate to alleged soil and groundwater contamination  including mercury contamination  for which the company also denies liability 
ce implemented a plan in early to assess the extent of potential soil and groundwater contamination at the rochester site  the preliminary results of which have been provided by ce to the company 
the preliminary results indicate there is mercury and inorganic and volatile organic compound contamination in the soil and groundwater at certain rochester site locations 
ce is preparing a voluntary clean up proposal based on these results which it plans to present to the new york department of environmental conservation the nydec for consideration 
the cost to remediate the rochester site will depend upon the remediation standards incorporated into any voluntary agreement between ce and the nydec 
because the clean up standards which may be applied have not been determined  the extent of remediation to be undertaken  and its cost  is unknown 
as a result  the company cannot  at this time  estimate the cost of the soil and groundwater remediation claims 
the company previously reported that prior to beginning the rochester site assessment which generated the current test results  ce had indicated to the company that  based upon information available to it and subject to a number of caveats  including the lack of assessment information and the fact that clean up standards which may be applied to the rochester site have not been determined  the cost to remediate the soil and groundwater would range from million to million 
because the bases for this estimate were not disclosed by ce to the company  the company cannot make a judgement about how the preliminary test results it has been provided would affect this estimate 
the company intends to pursue insurance coverage for ce s claims and has therefore provided notice of ce s claims to its third party liability insurance carriers 
to date the carriers have denied coverage 
for additional information regarding factors that may influence the company s performance  see item  business and item  legal proceedings 
the company s results of operations reflect goodwill amortization  other amortization  and depreciation  which are non cash charges  totaling million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
due to the acquisition activity and associated amortization of stepped up assets and goodwill  the company expects depreciation and amortization to continue to increase through fiscal in fiscal  such depreciation of stepped up assets associated with the acquisition is expected to decrease by approximately million  primarily as a result of the completed write off of depreciation associated with machinery and equipment with a ten year life 
as discussed below in liquidity and capital resources  the company s earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda amounted to million  million and million in  and  respectively 
ebitda represents  for any relevant period  net income except that extraordinary items and the cumulative effect on prior years of adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas are excluded plus i interest expense  ii provision for income taxes  iii depreciation  and iv amortization  all determined on a consolidated basis and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
substantial portions of the company s net sales  net income and cash flows from operations are derived internationally 
the financial position and the results of operations from substantially all of the company s international operations  other than most united states export sales  are measured using the local currency of the countries in which such operations are conducted and are translated into united states dollars 
while the reported income of foreign subsidiaries will be impacted by a weakening or strengthening of the united states dollar in relation to a particular local currency  the effects of foreign currency fluctuations are partially mitigated by the fact that manufacturing costs and other expenses of foreign subsidiaries are generally incurred in the same currencies in which sales are generated 
such effects of foreign currency fluctuations are also mitigated by the fact that such subsidiaries operations are conducted in numerous foreign countries and  therefore  in numerous foreign currencies 
in addition  the company s united states export sales may be impacted by foreign currency fluctuations to the relative value of the united states dollar as foreign customers may adjust their level of purchases upward or downward according to the weakness or strength of the united states dollar 
in order to hedge against future strengthening of the united states dollar  in june and july and in october  the company employed currency hedges through the purchase of a series of options 
in june and july  options were purchased with a united states dollar notional amount of approximately million at a cost of approximately million 
all of these options expired worthless 
in october the purchased options had a united states dollar notional amount of approximately million at a cost of approximately million 
the october options expired worthless but protected the company from potential detrimental effects of currency movements as compared to the prior year 
from time to time  management may employ additional currency hedges to further mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
if currency hedges are not employed  the company is exposed to earnings volatility as a result of foreign currency fluctuations
