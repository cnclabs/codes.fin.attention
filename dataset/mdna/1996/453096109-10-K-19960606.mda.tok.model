item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operations in fiscal was million and includes decreases in raw material and finished products inventory 
operating cash flow along with the net proceeds from marketable securities sales were used primarily to reduce long and short term borrowings and fund capital expenditures 
working capital totaled million at march  and includes marketable securities which are recorded at a market value of million  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s current ratio was at march  working capital financing is provided by a combination of trade credit and borrowings 
management believes that existing internal and external sources of liquidity are adequate to meet financing needs 
short term financing is available to the company s beet sugar operations in the form of nonrecourse  secured borrowings from the ccc under the usda price support program 
future ccc loans may be recourse in certain circumstances under recently enacted legislation 
see business sugar legislation and other market factors 
the company has a million committed bank line of credit expiring june  as well as uncommitted bank lines which aggregate million  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company uses these arrangements to supplement trade credit and ccc borrowings as necessary to meet working capital needs 
capital expenditures for fiscal totaled million  capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to approximate million 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company completed the acquisition of spreckels in april for an initial payment of million  the final purchase price and remaining balance due is subject to the resolution of certain post closing review issues 
the purchase price was funded from advances under the company s revolving credit line 
spreckels owns sugarbeet processing plants in woodland and mendota  california  as well as a sugarbeet seed operation and a limestone quarry 
spreckels sales for its most recent fiscal year which ended june   were equivalent to approximately one quarter of the company s sales volume 
the company has entered into a limited partnership agreement with a sugarbeet growers cooperative in washington state to build  operate and market the production from a new sugarbeet factory 
the company s capital commitment consists of million and certain production equipment which is not presently in use 
in fiscal  the company entered into a venture with the sugarbeet growers associations representing the growers supplying holly s rocky mountain factories to jointly build additional bulk refined sugar storage silos at holly s sidney  montana factory 
the additional silos are owned by the venture and are financed largely by non recourse  term bank debt 
in fiscal  the company purchased and retired million principal amount of its senior notes due the remaining notes  with an aggregate principal amount of million  require semi annual interest only payments prior to maturity 
long term debt at march  was approximately of total long term debt plus shareholders equity 
shareholders equity was million at march   approximately of total assets 
the company will adopt statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
in fiscal the company expects to elect to continue to follow accounting principles board opinion no 
to measure employee stock compensation cost  and to provide the pro forma disclosures required by sfas no 
consequently  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to materially effect reported results of operations or financial position 
results of operations industry environment the company s results of operations are substantially dependent on market factors  including domestic prices for refined sugar and raw cane sugar 
these market factors are influenced by a variety of external forces  including the number of domestic acres contracted to grow sugar cane and sugarbeets  prices of competing crops  weather conditions and united states farm and trade policy  that the company is unable to predict 
certain segments of the beet sugar industry in recent years have expanded sugarbeet acreage at rates exceeding the rate of growth in the demand for refined sugar  which along with large crop yields  put downward pressure on refined sugar prices 
a smaller than expected sugarbeet crop in the fall of  along with projections of some reductions in sugarbeet acreage for the fall of  have increased spot refined sugar prices recently 
see business competition 
the domestic sugar industry operated under marketing allotments imposed by the usda for the year ended september  the company s allotment did not have a significant restrictive effect on the company s marketing abilities 
marketing allotments are not included in the recently enacted legislation which becomes effective july  see business sugar legislation and other market factors 
in addition  weather conditions during the growing  harvesting and processing seasons  the availability of acreage to contract for sugarbeets  as well as the effects of diseases and insects  may materially affect the quality and quantity of sugar beets available for purchase as well as the unit costs of raw materials and processing 
see business raw materials and processing requirements 
year ended march  versus net sales increased million or in fiscal resulting from increases in both sugar sales volumes and average sales prices 
the increase in sales volumes  which occurred in both the company s cane and beet sugar operations  along with a smaller than expected fall sugarbeet crop significantly reduced ending beet sugar inventory levels 
as a result  the company expects beet sugar sales volumes during the first two quarters of fiscal to be lower than fiscal prior to the inclusion of refined sugar sales owing to the spreckels acquisition 
a substantial portion of this decrease is expected to be offset by higher cane sugar sales volumes as a result of lower refined beet sugar inventories industry wide 
average sales prices of refined sugar increased modestly during fiscal spot prices began strengthening in the second half of the fiscal year as a result of the smaller domestic sugarbeet crop 
a significant portion of the company s industrial sales are made under forward sales contracts  most of which commence october and extend for up to one year 
as a result  changes in the company s realized sales prices tend to lag market price changes 
to mitigate its exposure to future price changes  the company enters into forward purchase contracts for raw cane sugar and utilizes a participatory sugarbeet purchase contract described below 
see business raw materials and processing requirements 
by product sales revenues were virtually unchanged as lower volumes offset the impact of higher prices 
prices began rising significantly late in the fiscal year as a result of high feed grain prices 
cost of sales increased million or as a result of both higher sales volumes and increases in unit costs 
raw cane sugar costs increased significantly during the fiscal year  particularly during the first six months  due to a tight raw sugar market 
average beet sugar manufacturing costs increased slightly as the reduced throughput from the smaller fall sugarbeet crop offset cost reductions achieved in the spring processing campaigns 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company liquidated beginning lifo inventory layers at costs below current year cost  and charged such beginning amounts to cost of sales 
competitive crop pressure  particularly in light of high feed grain prices  as well as weather conditions in some areas  have reduced the availability of sugarbeet acreage to contract 
the company has experienced  and expects in fiscal to continue to experience  reductions in acreage contracted to grow sugarbeets for its hereford  texas plant  and to a lesser degree its torrington  wyoming plant  increasing unit manufacturing costs at those facilities 
sugarbeet acreage in recent years has also declined in northern california 
concurrent with the acquisition of spreckels  the company announced that it will cease processing beet sugar at its hamilton city  california plant after the current spring campaign 
prior to its acquisition by holly  spreckels closed its manteca  california factory  which was retained by the seller 
the company expects that the consolidation of the processing of the sugarbeets purchased in northern california  oregon and washington into its three northern california plants will reduce freight  increase individual factory throughput and reduce unit manufacturing costs at those facilities 
selling  general and administrative costs declined million or as increases in volume related selling and distribution costs were more than offset by reductions in general and administrative as well as research and development costs 
during the third fiscal quarter  the company commenced a cost reduction program in the sales  administrative and manufacturing overhead areas and recorded a charge to earnings of  for the cost of a work force reduction 
additionally  the company recorded a  charge in the fourth quarter related to the closure of the hamilton city factory 
interest expense for fiscal was lower than fiscal as lower balances of both short and long term borrowings were partially offset by higher short term interest rates and a lower earnings credit from the interest rate swap described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the interest rate swap  which was entered into to effectively convert a portion of the company s fixed rate debt to a floating rate basis and has provided positive cash flow for each period during its term  expires in october realized gains on marketable securities increased million during fiscal  unrealized gains and losses  which have not been recognized in the company s results of operations  but are shown  net of tax  as a component of shareholders equity  are detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the components of income tax expense and its relationship to statutory rates are detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the extraordinary item is discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
year ended march  versus net sales declined million or in fiscal  primarily due to a reduction in the volume of refined sugar sold 
cane sugar sales volumes were reduced significantly in response to continued reductions in favorable sales opportunities in the face of a continuation of weak prices and rising raw cane sugar costs 
lower beet sugar sales volumes were principally the result of lower fiscal production owing to the closure of the betteravia  california factory in august average sugar sales prices increased less than 
on a year to year basis 
reduced byproduct sales volumes as a result of the betteravia closure also contributed to the lower fiscal net sales 
cost of sales decreased million or in fiscal  as the sales volume decreases were coupled with reductions in unit manufacturing costs 
costs per unit of refined sugar sold declined as operating efficiencies at both the beet factories and the cane refinery as well as elimination of the high cost betteravia production overcame an increase in the cost of raw cane sugar 
additionally  holly experienced a decline in sugarbeet acreage at its hereford  texas factory which reduced throughput and increased unit costs 
the company purchases sugarbeets under participatory contracts which provide for a percentage sharing of the net selling price realized on refined beet sugar sales between the company and the grower 
use of this type of contract reduces the company s exposure to inventory price risks on sugarbeet purchases so long as the contract net selling price does not fall below the regional minimum support prices established by the usda 
depressed refined sugar selling prices resulted in net selling prices falling below such minimum support levels in some contract areas 
consequently  the low selling price of refined beet sugar was only partially offset by reduced cost of sugarbeets purchased 
selling  general and administrative expenses declined million from the year earlier level 
selling and distribution costs declined primarily due to sales volume reductions  general and administrative costs  combined with research and development costs were lower in fiscal largely as a result of a full year effect of the cost reduction program implemented in the third quarter of fiscal interest expense increased  as higher interest rates more than offset lower average balances of both long and short term debt 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the company s borrowings 
realized gains on marketable securities increased  during fiscal other income net increased  due primarily to gains on sales of assets 
the components of income tax expense and its relationship to statutory rates are detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements
