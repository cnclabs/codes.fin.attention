this compares to net income of million  or per common share  on total revenues of million in  and net income of million  or per common share  on total revenues of million in fiscal the significantly higher earnings in as compared to and were largely the result of higher production and prices per mcfe  partially offset by higher oil and gas depreciation  depletion and amortization and higher interest costs 
oil and gas sales 
during fiscal  oil and gas sales increased to million versus million for fiscal and from the fiscal amount of million 
the increase in oil and gas sales resulted primarily from strong growth in production volumes 
for fiscal  the company produced bcfe  at a weighted average price of per mcfe  compared to bcfe produced in fiscal at a weighted average price of per mcfe  and bcfe produced in fiscal at a weighted average price of per mcfe

for fiscal  the company realized an average price per barrel of oil of  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the company markets its oil on monthly average equivalent spot price contracts and typically receives a premium to the price posted for west texas intermediate crude oil 
the company realized million less in oil revenues than it would have received from unhedged market prices in fiscal gas price realizations increased from fiscal to by approximately  despite lower gas revenue realized by the company during the fourth fiscal quarter of as a result of the hedging activity 
as a result of hedging  the company had gas revenues during that period that were approximately million less than unhedged market prices 
although gas prices generally increased during  the weighted average realization per mcf in was still less than the lower prices realized in were the result of lower natural gas prices  and the fact that an increased portion of the company s gas production was from areas that contain leaner gas that is either not processed for liquids or contains less energy value btu s per mcf 
the company anticipates gas production in louisiana will receive premium prices at least equivalent to henry hub indexes due to the high btu content and favorable market location of the production 
gas marketing sales 
in december  the company entered into the gas marketing business by acquiring all of the outstanding stock of an oklahoma city based natural gas marketing company for total consideration of  this subsidiary provides natural gas marketing services including commodity price structuring  contract administration and nomination services for the company  its partners and other natural gas producers in the geographical areas in which the company is active

the gross profit margin of in fiscal was up from the margin in fiscal  and up slightly from the gross margin in fiscal the gross profit margin derived from these operations is a function of drilling activities in the period  costs of materials and supplies and the mix of operations between lower margin trucking operations versus higher margin labor oriented service operations

the company expects that operating costs in fiscal will increase based on the company s expansion of drilling efforts into the louisiana trend and the williston basin  because both are oil prone areas which generally have higher operating costs than gas prone areas and because limited severance tax exemptions will be applicable in these areas as compared to existing exemptions in giddings 
depreciation  depletion and amortization

depreciation and amortization of other assets 
depreciation and amortization d a of other assets increased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  and million in this increase in fiscal was caused by an increase in d a as a result of increased investments in depreciable buildings and equipment  and increased amortization of debt issuance costs as a result of the issuance of the senior notes in may and in april the company anticipates an increase in d a in fiscal as a result of a full year of debt issuance cost amortization on the senior notes issued in april and higher building depreciation expense on the company s corporate offices  offset by a reduction in depreciation expense associated with the sale of the service company assets
