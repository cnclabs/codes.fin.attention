selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by  in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in expense was due to delays in filling open positions and additional expense cutting as a result of slow software sales

selling  general and administrative expenses decreased significantly in fiscal due to the restructuring and staff reductions begun in fiscal depreciation and amortization decreased significantly in fiscal and fiscal due to the non recurring amortization charge of million incurred in fiscal as a result of management s decision to move from dos to windows r as the principal operating system for the company s end user applications

net loss of  in fiscal is favorable to fiscal by  due to expense reductions explained previously 
the expense savings were partially offset by an increase in interest expense of  liquidity and capital resources the company has experienced significant negative cash flows from its operating activities 
the company will require significant increases in revenues to cover fixed operating costs and to achieve a profitable level of operations 
the company expects to continue to incur operating losses for the fiscal year ending july  and there can be no assurance that profitability will be achieved thereafter 
the company also expects to continue to incur significant expenditures for network construction and expansion 
the company s network construction and expansion costs and negative cash flow from operations historically have been funded primarily from the sale of securities and from the lines of credit with shareholders 
at july   the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately  compared to approximately  at july  and  at july  on november  the company filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for the sale of up to two million shares of the company s common stock 
between january  and september  all two million shares were sold with net proceeds to the company of  the proceeds were used to fund operations and repay portions of outstanding revolving credit lines 
on december  the company executed a loan agreement with witech corporation witech and quaestus limited partnership qlp providing the company with a  senior secured revolving line of credit facility the senior line  which expires on december  extended from december  by amendment dated october  
interest on the senior line accrues at the rate of over the prime rate 
the company also has a line of credit with witech  the witech line that has been in place since october  the witech line is in the amount of million 
on april  the witech line was amended to provide a bridge loan of  accruing at the same rate as the other lines through june  in the event the bridge loan was not repaid by june  the unpaid balance was to bear an annual interest rate of prime plus

the only financial covenant in the senior line and the witech line is that the company must maintain a net worth calculated in accordance with general accepted accounting principles of at least million reduced from million effective may  
the company has been  and is currently  in compliance with the finanacial convenant in the agreements and currently expects that it will be able to continue to comply with such covenant or obtain any required waivers or raise additonal equity  if necessary 
the company will require additional financing during fiscal in order to meet its requirements for operations and development investments and to refinance the senior line and witech line of credit 
management is currently negotiating with witech to amend the expiration dates on the witech line and the witech portion of the senior line to july  from december  management believes that sufficient financing for fiscal will be available from the sale of additional securities and from additional borrowings from existing shareholders 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
on a long term basis  management believes that financing for the company s operations  including capital expenditures  will come principally from cash generated from operations  the sale of additional equity or other third party financing  capital leases  additional borrowings from shareholders and other sources of capital if available 
there can be no assurances that these financing arrangements will occur 
forward looking statements certain statements contained in this management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are forward looking statements 
several important factors can cause actual results to materially differ from those stated or implied in the forward looking statements 
such factors include  but are not limited to  the growth rate of the company s selected market segments  the positioning of the company s products in those segments  variations in demand for and cost of customer services and technical support  customer adoption of internet enabled windows r applications and their willingness to upgrade from dos versions of software  the company s ability to establish and maintain strategic alliances  the company s ability to manage its business in a rapidly changing environment and the company s ability to finance capital investments 
projected revenues are difficult to estimate because the company s revenues and operating results may vary substantially from quarter to quarter 
the recurring revenues of maintenance and subscription fees may be estimated based on the number of subscribers to the company s services but will be greatly impacted by the renewal ratio which cannot be determined in advance 
recurring revenues from network traffic fees and transaction fees are difficult to estimate prior to the end of the quarter as it is determined by usage 
the number of transactions processed by the company is a function of the number of subscribers and the quantity of reportable events per subscriber 
reportable events include product ordering  warranty claim processing  inventory and sales reporting  parts number updates and price updates 
the company cannot impact or predict the volume of transactions per customer 
non recurring revenue is also difficult to estimate 
this revenue is generated from software license fees  customized development and related professional services 
license fee revenue is based on contracts signed and product delivered within the quarter 
nonrecurring revenue is impacted by the time required to close large license fee and development agreements  which cannot be predicted with any certainty due to customer requirements and decision making processes 
although the company has recently introduced and plans to expand its internet enabled windows r portfolio of products  this marketplace is highly competitive and there can be no assurances that a customer will select the company s software and services over that of a competitor 
the environment in which the company competes is characterized by rapid technological changes  dynamic customer demands  and frequent product enhancements and product introductions 
the company s current and potential competitors have greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and advertising resources than the company 
the widespread acceptance of the internet may increase the usage of the company s product applications but exert pricing pressures on the network traffic revenue
