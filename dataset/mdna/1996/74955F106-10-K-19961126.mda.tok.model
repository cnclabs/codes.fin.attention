the company s products are based on saw technology  and the company s strategy is to leverage its rf design skills to provide saw based solutions to the current and emerging needs of the electronics industry 
the company s products include more than resonators  filters  high frequency clocks  oscillators  transmitter and receiver modules 
the company s average selling prices within these product lines generally range from to for low power products components and radio systems  to for frequency control modules and to for filter products 
during fiscal and the first two quarters of fiscal  the company constructed and tested its new surface mount technology smt manufacturing facility 
the purpose of the facility is to provide the capability to manufacture products utilizing surface mount packaging in a highly automated environment 
during this period  the facility had not reached production status  so the related equipment was not placed into service  and certain associated costs were capitalized as start up costs 
the related costs were included in property and equipment as construction in progress 
in the third quarter of fiscal  this facility achieved production status 
accordingly  depreciation on the equipment and amortization of capitalized start up costs began 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company completed an initial public offering of its stock 
the company issued  shares of its common stock on the nasdaq market at per share  resulting in net proceeds of million 
during fiscal and  the company s income tax expense was reduced as a result of the adoption of statement of financial standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas and subsequent reductions in the related valuation allowance 
see the discussion on income taxes for further detail 
except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section  as well as in the sections entitled business  legal proceedings and selected financial data in this report 
results of operations the following discussion relates to the financial statements of the company for the fiscal year ended august  current year or fiscal  in comparison to the fiscal year ended august  prior year or fiscal  as well as the fiscal year ended august  fiscal 
in addition  there is discussion of the financial statements for the three months ended august  fourth quarter  in comparison to the three months ended august  comparable quarter of the prior year 
the following table sets forth  for the years ended august i the percentage relationship of certain items from the company s statements of income to total sales and ii the percentage change in these items from year to year percentage of sales year to year change to to sales cost of sales gross profit research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations other income expense  net income before income taxes income tax expense benefit  net income sales the following table sets forth the components of the company s sales and percentage relationship of the components to total sales for the periods indicated year ended august  amount of total amount of total amount of total dollars in thousands product sales low power components and virtual wire r radio systems    frequency control modules    filter    total product sales    technology development sales total sales    product sales increased in fiscal and in fiscal  primarily because of increased units shipped of the company s low power products 
low power sales include sales of both low power component products and low power virtual wire r radio system products 
low power sales increased in fiscal and in fiscal a significant portion of the and increase was due to the introduction of the company s surface mount low power component products particularly to customers in automotive markets 
in fiscal  the company brought its new smt facility to production status  with gradually increasing production levels during fiscal and fiscal the company has invested a considerable amount of its capital  technical  sales and marketing resources into new smt products that were primarily targeted toward the low power market 
frequency control module sales decreased in fiscal after increasing in fiscal these products accounted for only of total sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal frequency control module sales include sales to the company s largest customer  digital equipment corporation digital  for use in systems based on the alpha microprocessor 
sales to digital decreased in both fiscal and fiscal  primarily as a result of lower average selling prices  as this customer converted to lower priced units 
the lower priced units  in the current year  represented a new line of clock oscillator products that were introduced to respond to price competition from products that utilize phase lock loop technology 
digital accounted for approximately  and of total sales during fiscal  and  respectively 
the company has no long term volume purchase commitments from its major customers  including digital 
orders to digital have fluctuated in the past  and there can be no assurance that such fluctuations will not recur or that digital will continue to purchase the company s products at all 
international sales primarily in europe and asia were approximately of the company s total sales during fiscal compared to approximately in fiscal and in fiscal the company considers all product sales with a delivery destination outside north america to be international sales 
these sales are denominated primarily in us currency 
the company intends to continue its focus on international sales in the future and expects that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of its business 
there can be no assurance  however  that this can be achieved 
the company s top five customers accounted for approximately  and of the company s total sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
the reduction in the relative portion of sales to the company s top five customers over this period largely reflects the reduction in sales to the company s largest customer  digital 
in addition  a significant portion of the increased sales for the company s new smt products were due to new customers  which increased the total number of customers receiving rfm products 
while the company has achieved sales increases in prior periods  there can be no assurance that this can be achieved in future periods 
the company s success is highly dependent on achieving technological advances in its product design and manufacturing capabilities  as well as its ability to sell its products in a competitive marketplace that can be influenced by outside factors such as economic and regulatory conditions 
the company experiences increased competition from companies that offer alternative solutions such as phased locked loop technology 
there can be no assurance that competition from alternative technologies or from competitors duplicating the company s technologies will not adversely affect selling prices and market share 
gross profit margin gross profit margin increased to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal  primarily as a result of increased gross profit margin for the company s low power products 
margins for these products increased primarily due to a decrease in per unit manufacturing costs which were the result of improved production processes that increased yields and productivity  and increased demand creating an increase in the number of units produced 
the increased number of units produced allowed relatively high fixed overhead costs to be lower on a per unit basis  particularly for the new smt facility 
there can be no assurance  however  that the trend toward lower per unit manufacturing costs  that occurred in the current year  will continue 
an additional reason for improved gross profit margin was that the average selling prices for low power products increased as a result of changes in product mix within this product line 
the improvement in low power gross profit margins was partially offset by a reduction in gross profit for the higher margin frequency control module products 
historically  the company has achieved substantially higher gross profit margins on its frequency control module products than its low power products due in part to the higher engineering and technical content of the frequency control module products 
these products accounted for only of total sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the decline in sales to digital accounted for most of this impact 
in addition  lower average selling prices for these products caused a decline in gross margins  despite lower per unit manufacturing costs 
gross profit margins decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal this was primarily due to lower gross margins for the company s low power products  resulting from higher per unit manufacturing costs associated with increasing the capacity to produce these products  particularly for the new smt facility  which reached volume production status in fiscal additionally in fiscal  the company experienced a yield loss of approximately  associated with the introduction of a process improvement procedure for its leaded metal component manufacturing 
additionally  gross profit margins were adversely impacted as sales from the higher margin frequency control module products declined to of total sales in fiscal from of total sales in fiscal the company has in the past experienced sudden increases in demand which have put pressure on its manufacturing facilities to increase capacity to meet this demand 
in addition  new products sometimes require different manufacturing processes than the company currently possesses 
the company has devoted the bulk of its capital expenditures to increase capacity and improve its manufacturing processes 
there can be no assurance that the company can continue to increase its manufacturing capacity and improve its manufacturing processes in a timely manner so as to take advantage of increased market demand 
failure to do this would result in a loss of potential sales in the periods impacted 
research and development research and development expenses increased approximately in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in both fiscal and fiscal was due to increased focus on developing standard products and increased emphasis on process engineering and document control process for its operations 
during the past several years  the company has decreased its activities in connection with customer funded technology development contracts nonrecurring engineering expenses 
the company believes that the continued development of its technology and new products is essential to its success and is committed to continuing its investment in research and development  which is expected to increase in absolute dollars in future periods 
since sales increased faster than research and development expenses  such expenses decreased to of total sales in fiscal from in fiscal sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses increased approximately in fiscal and in fiscal these increases were due primarily to increased sales commissions and marketing costs needed to support the company s increased sales 
since sales increased faster than sales and marketing expenses  such expenses decreased as a percent of total sales to in fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal the company expects to incur higher sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars in future periods as it expands its sales and marketing efforts 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased approximately in fiscal and in fiscal such increases were primarily attributable to increased staffing and support for the company s expansion  and in the current year included increased costs for write offs of certain foreign receivables 
there can be no assurance that the company will not continue to incur bad debt write offs as it expands its business to new customers and new geographic areas 
the company currently expects general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods 
other income expense during the first two quarters of the current year  the company increased its indebtedness to finance an increase in working capital and capital expenditures 
this increase in indebtedness caused an increase in interest expense for fiscal  compared to fiscal  resulting in a net reduction of other income 
income tax expense the company s income tax expense was  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal  and  in fiscal fiscal included the one time favorable impact of  
per share  resulting from recognition of research and development tax credits 
the company recognized an income tax benefit of  
per share in fiscal as a result of a decrease in the valuation allowance that was provided upon adoption of sfas  in view of continued increases in earnings during this period 
the company does not expect a similar tax benefit in the future 
in fiscal  the company adopted sfas and elected to apply it retroactively to september  the cumulative effect of adopting sfas was to record in fiscal a deferred tax asset of million  representing the estimated benefits of the company s net operating loss carryforward and expected future deductible temporary timing differences  and to increase fiscal net income by this amount 
the company s effective tax rate  exclusive of the fiscal one time tax credit and the fiscal valuation allowance benefit  was approximately  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
earnings per share net income increased to million in the current year as compared to million in the prior year 
the company s earnings per share was 
per share for fiscal  compared to 
per share for fiscal and 
per share for fiscal as discussed above  fiscal included a tax benefit related to the decrease in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of 
per share 
earnings per share in fiscal reflect lower weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding relative to fiscal and fiscal the weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding in fiscal and fiscal reflected the impact of  shares of common stock issued in connection with the company s initial public offering in july fourth quarter of fiscal unaudited quarterly financial data is presented in note of the accompanying financial statements 
sales for the fourth quarter increased to million  compared to million in the comparable quarter of the prior year 
the overall sales increase was primarily due to an increase in low power sales of approximately  compared to the comparable quarter of the prior year 
this was primarily due to an increase in the number of units shipped  particularly for new smt type products for automotive customers 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in sales for frequency control module products  compared to the comparable quarter of the prior year  primarily due to a decrease in the average selling price and number of units shipped to digital 
gross profit margins were in the fourth quarter  compared to for the comparable quarter of the prior year 
this was primarily due to improvement in margins for the low power product line  resulting from a continued reduction in per unit manufacturing costs for those products  particularly the new smt products 
this reduction in cost was due to increased productivity  improvements in yield and an increased number of units produced  allowing for fixed overhead expenses to be spread over a larger number of units 
also  there was an increase in average selling prices for these products due to changes in product mix toward higher priced units 
margins for frequency control module products declined due to lower average selling prices associated with the introduction of a new line of lower priced units and associated start up costs 
operating income for the fourth quarter was million  or of total sales compared to 
million  or of total sales  for the comparable quarter of the prior year 
the increase in operating income as a percentage of total sales was due to gross margins improving and revenues increasing faster than operating expenses 
operating expenses increased 
million in the fourth quarter  compared to the comparable quarter of the prior year 
this increase was due to the additional costs of supporting the company s increased level of sales  as well as an increase in product and market development programs 
earnings per share were 
in the fourth quarter  compared to 
per share for the comparable quarter of the prior year 
liquidity and capital resources principal sources of liquidity at august   consisted of million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  and million of unused credit under a line of credit agreement 
as of august   the company also had million unused credit available under an equipment collateralized operating lease facility lease facility which was to be advanced in stages prior to october  no additional advances were made under the lease facility and the company is currently under negotiations to extend it under current terms and conditions through the end of fiscal year the credit facilities contain financial covenants and restrictions relating to various matters  including a minimum net worth requirement  a minimum ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest expense and current maturity of the term loan  a minimum quick ratio and a maximum ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth 
as of august   the company was in compliance with such covenants and restrictions 
net cash from operations increased million due to a million increase in net income and noncash items included in net income  such as depreciation and amortization  and million less cash used in working capital  such as trade receivables and inventory 
as of august   inventory had been reduced almost 
million from the prior year 
cash used in investing activities in the current year was million lower than the prior year due to lower capital acquisitions 
fiscal year and capital acquisitions included significant purchases of property and equipment to construct the company s smt manufacturing facility 
the company expects to acquire approximately million to million of capital equipment by the end of fiscal  consisting primarily of equipment needed for its manufacturing facilities 
some of this equipment may be acquired under the lease facility 
net cash generated from financing activities was less than 
million 
funds raised from operations  borrowings on notes payable and exercises of stock options were mostly used to repay other debt and acquire property and equipment 
in the prior year  financing activities resulted in million of funds generated mainly from borrowings on notes payable used to finance increases in working capital and capital expenditures 
in fiscal  the ipo generated more than million that was used to retire debt  pay preferred dividends and finance capital spending 
the company believes that cash generated from operations  if any  banking facilities  and the million balance in cash and short term investments will be sufficient to meet the company s operating cash requirements through fiscal to the extent that these sources of funds are insufficient to also meet the company s capital expenditure requirements  the company will be required to raise additional funds 
no assurance can be given that additional financing for capital expenditures will be available or  if available  that it will be available on acceptable terms
