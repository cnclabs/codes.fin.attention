item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s analysis of operating results and financial condition in recent years as presented in the five year consolidated financial summary shown on the preceding pages 
this analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and their accompanying notes 
first michigan bank corporation fmb is incorporated under the laws of michigan and is registered under the bank holding company act of  as amended 
fmb is engaged in commercial and retail banking through subsidiary community banks and provides other financial services including trust  brokerage  and credit insurance

the pending acquisition of arcadia financial corporation arcadia is the result of a definitive agreement  signed december   to acquire all of the outstanding stock of arcadia  a  one bank holding company located in kalamazoo  michigan 
the acquisition of arcadia is anticipated to be consummated during the second quarter of the principal source of revenues of fmb and its subsidiaries is interest and fees on loans which amounted to of total revenues in  in  and in interest on securities amounted to of total revenues in  in  and in the principal markets for fmb s banking services are the communities within the state of michigan in which the subsidiaries are located

earnings summary in thousands  except per share data year ended december  net income    per share earnings ratios return on average assets return on average equity the financial results presented above reflect the continued strong earnings performance of fmb 
was the fourteenth consecutive year that fmb has reported record earnings 
net income of  was up  or  over the results for which were up over fmb s earnings per share rose to  a increase over the per share recorded for per share earnings were up over results 
fmb s return on average assets has remained consistently above in each of the past three years while its return on average equity has risen in each of the last five years to a level of for fmb s shareholders have benefitted from fmb s performance as dividends per share for the past five years have increased at a compounded annual rate  adjusted for the effect of stock dividends and splits during those years  and the total return on fmb stock has grown at a compound annual rate for the same period  considering reinvestment of dividends and stock price appreciation 
the increases in fmb s earnings over the last two years have been the result of increased net interest income due to strong loan growth and excellent asset quality and cost control efforts 
results also benefitted from increases in fee income and the mid year reduction in fdic insurance premiums

the effect on fmb s interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis and on interest expense due to the changes in volume and rate for the periods indicated are shown below in thousands compared to compared to amount of amount of increase increase decrease total decrease total due to amount of due to amount of change in increase change in increase volume rate decrease volume rate decrease interest income federal funds sold   interest bearing deposits with banks securities taxable     tax exempt    loans       total interest income       interest expense interest bearing deposits savings and now accounts     time      short term borrowings    long term debt total interest expense      net interest income fully taxable equivalent       for the purposes of this table  changes in interest due to volume and average rate were determined as follows volume variance change in average balance multiplied by previous average rate 
rate variance change in average rate multiplied by previous average balance 
rate volume variance change in average balance multiplied by change in average rate 
the rate volume variances have been allocated to the change in volume and rate in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each 
as shown in the table above  fmb s net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis grew by  or  in and by  or  in the rate of growth in net interest income is affected by the relative rates of growth in the underlying earning assets and costing funds and also by fluctuations in the net interest margin 
average earning assets grew by in and in primarily due to very strong growth in average loans  which increased by during and during the effect of the growth in higher yielding loans was significantly offset in  and to a lesser degree in  by a shift in the mix of deposits to higher costing time deposits 
average time deposits grew by in  while increasing in the net interest margin declined by basis points during partially offsetting the positive impact of the growth in earning assets 
the decline can be attributed to increased competition for both loans and deposits 
in addition  customers preference for longer term  higher yielding certificates of deposits changed fmb s deposit mix and increased the overall cost of funds by basis points 
during  the margin increased basis points enhancing the growth in net interest income 
the main factor in the margin improvement was the increase of basis points in the rate earned on assets  resulting from rising interest rates coupled with strong loan demand  while the overall rate paid on costing funds was relatively stable  for versus in maintaining steady growth in net interest income is one of fmb s primary objectives and is continually monitored through its asset liability management process  which is discussed later 
fmb has historically achieved this objective as a result of having the necessary systems  procedures  and products in place to manage and promote balance sheet growth  maintain a strong net interest margin and remain competitively priced 
management believes fmb  as in the past  is well positioned to maintain solid growth in net interest income 
non interest income year ended december  change change non interest income in thousands service charges on deposits    trust and investment management fees    investment products revenue    credit insurance income    fees and gains on sale of loans    mortgage servicing income    other operating income    subtotal    realized securities gains losses total    the table above lists fmb s primary sources of non interest income 
the non interest income of  increased  or  over the results of this compares to a non interest income decrease in of  or  from the results of changes in individual categories are impacted by a number of significant factors that occurred during the increases in service charges on deposits in and are due to increases in deposit volumes as well as fees charged 
trust and investment management fees increased by in and in investment product sales brokerage revenue increased in by after decreasing by the previous year 
both of these areas were positively impacted by the bullish financial markets during management anticipates sales of trust  financial planning and investment services to our customers to be a growing source of fee income in future periods 
credit insurance revenue increased in and in the growth in this area is directly correlated to growth in consumer loans 
the consumer loan portfolio increased by in and in management anticipates continued strong growth in the consumer lending business and related credit insurance revenue 
fees and gains on sale of loans increased during after declining during the increase in was due to a strong real estate market combined with a continuation of refinancing activity as long term interest rates declined during the year 
the decrease from to was anticipated as both long term interest rates rose during and the number of loans eligible for refinancing dramatically declined 
mortgage servicing income increased during to  from to  servicing income increased 
the increases in servicing income are reflective of the year to year increase in fmb s servicing portfolio from the on going sale of mortgage loans in the secondary market 
at december   the total amount of mortgage loans serviced amounted to  compared to  at the end of and  at the end of other operating income includes fees collected from customers for a variety of bank services  other fees charged in loans  gains and losses on sales of fixed assets and other real estate  and miscellaneous income 
due to the variety of income sources in this category  fluctuations in the level of income occur from year to year 
no single component of this category was significant during or non interest expense year ended december  change change non interest expense in thousands salaries and employee benefits    occupancy and equipment    printing and supplies    telecommunications    computer processing    software  postage    advertising and promotion    single business tax    fdic insurance    professional services    other operating    total    the table above lists fmb s most significant operating expenses 
fmb was able to hold overall non interest expense growth for both and to single digit increases 
the increase over was  which was aided by the reduction in fdic insurance expense 
excluding the reduction in fdic insurance expense  the increase in operating expenses was 
the increase in over was 
salaries and employee benefits are the largest component of non interest expense 
during salaries and employee benefits increased compared to a increase in fmb is committed to controlling the growth in non interest expense and anticipates continued single digit increases in the area of employee salaries and benefits for the upcoming year 
printing and supplies increased in and during the increase in is primarily due to significant increase in the cost of copier and computer paper 
during  telecommunication costs increased  computer processing expense increased  and software costs increased 
these increases are a result of fmb s plan to expand and upgrade its products and electronic delivery systems 
management foresees additional investment in these areas as fmb continues to expand its product and service levels to its customers 
advertising expense increased above the level as fmb introduced its new debit and credit cards 
the increase in over of relates primarily to promotions of consumer loan products that helped increase the consumer loan portfolio by approximately that year 
fdic insurance expense decreased  or  in compared to an increase of  or  in during  the bank insurance fund exceeded the mandatory balance levels requiring the fdic to lower insurance premiums 
effective in june  fmb s fdic insurance rate was reduced by over 
the fdic has also announced plans in to charge only the minimum allowable amount of  per bank for those banks that meet the fdic criteria of being well capitalized and well managed 
this fdic action is expected to significantly reduce fmb s fdic insurance expense again in income taxes income tax expense for was  an increase of  or  over the provision of  this is due to fmb s profit improvement  virtually all of which is taxable  as the amount of tax exempt income declined compared to a similar effect can be noted in the income tax increase of 
the increase results from an improvement in income before income taxes while tax exempt income increased by only versus amounts 
loan portfolio while providing full service banking  fmb accepts credit risk as an essential part of its business 
fmb concentrates its lending efforts on its existing market areas with emphasis on both consumer and commercial credits 
these credit decisions are made as close to the customer as possible by keeping the evaluation and approval process local with the management of each affiliate bank 
in addition to maintaining a strong lending staff at the customer level  fmb ensures that a conservative underwriting philosophy and excellent credit quality are maintained by utilizing an independent  centralized loan review function 
the primary objective of the loan review function is to assist bank management in the process of monitoring the credit underwriting function and to ensure lending decisions are made within established guidelines 
december  components of loan portfolio balances in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural      real estate construction      real estate mortgage      consumer      total      percentages commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction real estate mortgage consumer total as noted earlier  average loans increased by during  while the ending balance in the loan portfolio grew by over the mix of the portfolio  however  has remained constant from year to year 
the largest component of fmb s loan portfolio is real estate mortgage loans  of which is comprised of loans secured by commercial real estate 
these loans together with the commercial  financial and agricultural loans amount to of fmb s total loan portfolio  revealing the balance fmb achieves between commercial lending  primarily to small and medium sized businesses  and retail lending to individuals 
fmb s loan portfolio continues to be well diversified  and as of december   fmb had no significant concentration of loans to any group of borrowers engaged in similar activities that would be impacted by changes in economic or other conditions 
december  under to over total year years years maturity of selected loans in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural     real estate construction     total     rate sensitivity of above loans due after one year in thousands fixed interest rates    variable interest rates    total    nonperforming assets nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans and other real estate owned 
nonperforming loans include loans on which interest is not being accrued  accruing loans contractually past due ninety days or more as to interest or principal payments  and other loans whose terms have been renegotiated to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of a deterioration in the financial position of the borrower 
other real estate includes assets acquired through loan foreclosure and repossession 
december  nonperforming assets in thousands non accrual      ninety days past due      renegotiated  total nonperforming loans      other real estate      total nonperforming assets      as a percent of total loans 


fmb s nonperforming asset ratios have historically been very low relative to other michigan bank holding companies 
as indicated in the schedule above  nonperforming assets have decreased to 
of total loans 
the steady improvement since is primarily attributable to the prevailing strength of the local economy in the communities in which the subsidiary banks operate and the banks timely attention to potential problem credits 
loans are placed in non accrual status when  in the opinion of management  the collectibility of principal and interest is considered doubtful or when the payment of interest and principal is days past due  unless the loans are both well secured and in the process of collection 
consumer loans are generally not placed on non accrual status as they are normally charged off when days past due 
interest in the amount of approximately  on loans classified as non accrual and renegotiated was included in net income during additional interest in the amount of approximately  would have been earned in had the loans classified as non accrual and renegotiated remained at original terms 
as of december   loans which are not included in the above nonperforming loan total but which management has serious doubts as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms amount to  although these loan customers are having financial difficulties at the present time and may need adjustments in their repayment terms  no material losses are anticipated 
payouts are anticipated or collateral or guarantees are available to reduce any loss incurred 
allowance for loan losses the following schedule sets forth management s allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan type and the resulting ratio of the allowance allocated to the related outstanding loans 
this allowance allocation is necessarily judgmental and is based primarily upon the risk inherent in each category of loans as well as past loss experience  estimated loss exposure on specific loans  current and projected economic conditions and other factors 
the entire allowance is available to absorb any future loan losses and is not necessarily indicative of the categories in which future charge offs are to be classified 
the amounts indicated for each loan type include amounts allocated for specific loans as well as a general allocation

allowance for loan losses to loans outstanding at end of period the provision for loan losses charged to operations increased by  from to and  from to the increases in both years were primarily for the maintenance of an adequate allowance given the significant growth in loans outstanding from period to period 
the ratio of net charge offs to average loans increased slightly in compared to  yet it remains at a very low level historically  reflecting the prevailing strength of the local economy in the communities in which the subsidiary banks operate and fmb s attention to underwriting and monitoring standards for its loan portfolio 
it is anticipated that the results will  as in the past  compare very favorably to the banking industry as a whole and to other michigan bank holding companies 
management rates the overall quality of the loan portfolio as good and the allowance for loan losses as strong  given the ratio of the allowance to total loans of and the low level of nonperforming assets 
securities portfolio securities are purchased with the ability to hold those assets until maturity 
however  fmb has identified as available for sale certain securities which may be sold in the future to meet fmb s investment objectives of quality  liquidity and yield and to avoid significant market value deterioration 
as allowed by the transition provisions in the guide to implementation of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

a comparison of the average daily balances of deposits and short term borrowings and the percentage of average daily assets that were supported by each category of deposits and short term borrowings is reflected in the following schedule in thousands average for the year of of of balance assets balance assets balance assets deposits non interest bearing demand    savings and now accounts    time    total deposits    short term borrowings securities sold under agreements to repurchase    other short term borrowings    total    the maturity distribution of time deposits of  or more as of december  is as follows in thousands under to months over months months to year year total time deposits of  or more      the banks operate in a competitive environment as to rates paid on most deposits 
money market savings accounts  coupled with a wide range of options in the area of time deposits  have given consumers the opportunity to invest their money at competitive rates for the time period that best fits their needs 
at fmb  these opportunities include regular and money market savings programs for individuals  certificates of deposit cd s of varying maturities and interest rates for public and private depositors  and cash investment checking  a one day retail repurchase agreement for commercial accounts 
market rates are adjusted from time to time in order to attract additional funds 
during  fmb has also purchased brokered cd s and obtained advances from the federal home loan bank fhlb to meet lending demand and liquidity needs 
fmb has established guidelines to limit its exposure to funding from time deposits of  or more  which includes brokered cd s 
brokered cd s amount to only of total deposits at december  asset liability management asset liability management is a vital function in today s banking environment 
at fmb  this process involves developing  implementing and monitoring strategies to maintain a proper level of liquidity  maximize net interest income  and minimize the impact on earnings from major interest rate changes 
this process is carried out through corporate and affiliate bank asset liability committees 
the corporate asset liability strategy group establishes policies  analyzes strategies and monitors the effectiveness of the asset liability management process on a consolidated basis 
committees at the subsidiary banks develop and implement strategies to enhance the profitable management of each bank s sources and uses of funds 
liquidity is monitored through the asset liability management process in order to meet the needs of customers  such as depositors withdrawing funds or borrowers requesting funds to meet their credit needs  while at the same time maximizing investment and lending opportunities 
deposit gathering is a principal source of funds for fmb 
development of consumer deposits is achieved by paying competitive rates and by maintaining an active marketing program 
larger cd s  issued to public authorities and the private sector  are purchased primarily from within fmb s market areas and are considered a reliable source of funds 
fmb also purchases brokered cd s from time to time for varying periods of up to three years 
another principal source of funds derives from the routine payments on loans and the maturities of loans and securities 
fmb s securities portfolio is invested almost exclusively in investment grade issues  and  as discussed previously  fmb continues to have a high quality loan portfolio 
as a result  payments and maturities on these assets are also a reliable source of funds 
externally  fmb has the ability to enter the federal funds market as a purchaser to meet daily liquidity needs  and  for longer term liquidity needs  fmb has the ability to enter into funding arrangements with other financial institutions 
through the asset liability management process  attention is also placed on a bank s interest sensitivity  which is the degree net interest income is affected by a change in market interest rates 
one method of estimating sensitivity is by a gap analysis 
gap is the difference between assets and liabilities maturing or repricing in the same time period 
when the amount of rate sensitive assets is greater than rate sensitive liabilities  an increase in market interest rates has a positive impact on net interest income while a decrease in rates has a negative impact 
when rate sensitive liabilities are greater than assets  the converse is true with falling market rates impacting net income positively and rising rates impacting it negatively 
minimizing exposure to changes in market rates is accomplished by keeping the relationship of the rate sensitive assets and liabilities in a relatively balanced position 
fmb continued in to structure its balance sheet and utilize off balance sheet strategies to respond to interest rate fluctuations 
to a very limited extent  interest rate swap agreements continued to be utilized to manage the short term interest sensitivity position 
fmb continues to sell long term  fixed rate residential mortgage loans in the secondary market to minimize its long term exposure to rate changes 
during  fmb s nominal asset sensitive position in the short term  coupled with consumer preference for higher yielding  long term certificates of deposit had a negative impact on the net interest margin when compared with however  as demonstrated in the table below  fmb has maintained a strong and relatively stable net interest margin over the past five years 
december  net interest margin the next table illustrates fmb s static gap position as of december   with a cumulative day gap position of and one year gap of 
distribution of non maturity deposits are based on historical analyses and management s current assumptions as to the repricing frequency for these funds 
although the static gap sensitivity varies from time frame to time frame  management has the ability to adjust rates on deposit accounts enabling fmb to achieve a neutral interest sensitivity position within the intermediate term 
based upon the gap  simulation  and market value analyses  management believes fmb is well positioned to respond to interest rate movements in either direction

the board of governors of the federal reserve system federal reserve has published guidelines on the adequacy of capital  commonly referred to as risk based capital that were applied to bank holding companies beginning in on december   the federal reserve issued a final rule regarding risk based capital guidelines concerning the net unrealized gains and losses recorded under sfas no 
the following table illustrates fmb s leverage and risk based capital ratios compared to the current regulatory requirements in accordance with the federal reserve s final guidance minimum well regulatory capitalized fmb requirements definition tier capital tier and tier capital leverage ratio during recent years  fmb has supported its growth in assets with its ability to generate and retain earnings 
management feels the overall equity position is very strong as indicated below december  shareholders equity in thousands    ratio of equity to total assets at the end of  fmb announced a plan to repurchase its shares from time to time in negotiated transactions 
pursuant to this plan  fmb repurchased  shares during   shares during and  shares during at costs of   and  respectively 
fmb reaffirmed its stock repurchase plan in and intends to continue repurchasing shares similarly during the strength of fmb s capital position has enabled it to increase the dividend payout to shareholders over the past two years 
fmb s cash dividends amounted to  in and  in for dividend payout ratios of and  respectively 
prior to  the payout ratio had been approximately from year to year 
for the fourth quarter of  fmb increased the dividend by to per share 
fmb s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is limited by its ability to obtain funds from the subsidiaries  as specified by applicable regulatory guidelines 
however  the amounts currently available for dividends are in excess of fmb s current annual dividend payout rate 
new accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for mortgage servicing rights  which is an amendment to sfas no 
 accounting for certain mortgage banking activities 
sfas no 
requires that an asset be recognized for the rights to service mortgage loans which are sold or securitized with the servicing rights retained by the originator  including those rights created by the origination of mortgage loans 
the amount of the asset for these originated mortgage servicing rights omsr is to be determined based upon the relative fair value of the underlying mortgage loans  without the omsr  and the omsr itself 
sfas no 
requires the asset to be amortized against servicing income over the period of estimated net servicing income 
it also requires that omsrs be stratified based on one or more of the predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans and evaluated for impairment 
any impairment is to be recognized as a valuation allowance for each impaired stratum 
sfas no
