as of fiscal to

because the company s operations are subject to seasonality  the company s liquid resources fluctuate annually in a manner which changes very little from year to year 
the company experiences a normal seasonal decrease in production in april 
inventories and related short term borrowing are usually at their peak at this time 
the slowdown in production normally extends through july and corresponds to the availability of raw fruit on an affordable basis 
the company s inventory ordinarily decreases during the period beginning in may and ending in october  which creates a corresponding increase in liquidity 
the company s largest external source of liquidity is a  revolving line of credit provided by a bank at the bank s prime lending rate
