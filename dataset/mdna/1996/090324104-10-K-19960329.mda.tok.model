the company has made several acquisitions which affect the comparison of the results of operations on a year to year basis 
all acquisitions have been accounted for under the purchase method and  accordingly  the results of operations of the acquired entities are included in the company s financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition

this represented a increase of direct store sales over and a increase for over gross margin of million in increased by over  primarily because of the increase in net sales 
the increase in gross margin for over was also 
the primary reason for this increase was also the increase in net sales 
gross margin as a percent of net sales had a slight increase in to from in  which had decreased slightly from the of the decrease in resulted from competitive selling pressures and the timing of purchasing gains associated with pharmaceutical price inflation 
in  the pressure on sell side margins continued and the purchasing gains remained relatively constant 
however  there was an infusion of higher margins from the recent acquisitions of the alternate care alternate site businesses of phc and the commitment to growth of the direct store delivery portion of the business 
this growth included a greater emphasis on providing new value added information systems programs  new marketing programs with manufacturers and increased sales of higher margin products such as generics  home health care and private label 
other income decreased in and as a result of reduced gains on the sale of marketable securities and a decrease in service fee income on certain customer receivable balances 
selling  general and administrative sga expenses increased from million in to million in and to million in the increase from to included incremental sga of million related to acquisitions 
for  the increase attributable to the acquired companies was million 
the remainder of the increases resulted from normal inflationary increases and costs to support the growing direct store delivery business of bindley western drug company and the alternate care alternate site business of phc 
the cost increases related to the direct store delivery and alternate care alternate site business include  among others  delivery expense  warehouse expense  and labor costs  which are variable with the level of sales volume 
in  sga expense also included sales and development costs associated with the new information systems and marketing programs and incremental costs associated with the consolidation of the charlotte division into the expanded facility in shelby  nc 
sga expenses will continue to increase as direct store delivery and alternate care alternate site sales increase 
however  management remains focused on controlling this increase through improved technology  better asset management and opportunities to consolidate distribution centers

in all years  funds received from customers in respect of working capital carrying cost were treated as a reduction of interest expense 
the writedown of accounts receivable of million represented the company s remaining exposure from the reliable bankruptcy claim

as of the date of filing  pic n save was indebted to the company in an amount approximating million 
during  the company s sales to pic n save approximated million 
these sales were made to pic n save on a cash basis and the company is continuing to sell to pic n save on a cash basis 
the company believes that its reserves for doubtful accounts should be sufficient to absorb any uncollectible amounts resulting from the pic n save plan of reorganization 
the restructuring charge of million in was attributable primarily to consolidation programs for the company s east coast operations which should provide increased efficiency  reduced costs and enhanced data processing based programs for all customer categories 
this charge included lease commitments to third parties  writedowns of various assets to realizable values and facilities consolidation costs 
the charge was comprised of noncash asset writedowns of approximately million  product consolidation costs of approximately 
million and anticipated probable cash expenditures of million related to payments on lease commitments  data processing and inventory conversion costs and other employee costs 
the anticipated probable cash expenditures will be funded from operating revenues 
the company believes that  as of december   the consolidation of the east coast operations was on schedule and the company had expended million of the probable cash expenditures on a basis substantially consistent with the original plan and believes that the million charge taken at december  should be sufficient to complete the consolidation 
the provision for income taxes represented  and of earnings before taxes in  and  respectively 
the rate included the effect of the statutory rate increase on the company s deferred tax liabilities at the beginning of in accordance with the provisions of statement of accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes  the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
the asset and liability method requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences that currently exist between the tax bases and financial reporting bases of the company s assets and liabilities 
the company is considering a pro rata distribution to its shareholders of all of the stock of phc 
the proposed spin off would separate the company s wholesale drug business from the wholesale drug and alternate care alternate site business of phc 
the contemplated spin off would be subject to  among other business considerations  obtaining a favorable tax ruling and compliance with applicable securities and other governmental regulations 
liquidity capital resources 
the company s operations provided million in cash for the year ended december  the source of funds was primarily a result of a reduction in merchandise inventory and an increase in accounts payable 
these sources were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
the decrease in merchandise inventories resulted from management s efforts to control inventory levels to minimize carrying costs and maximize purchasing opportunities while the increase in accounts payable was attributed to the timing of payment terms 
the increase in accounts receivable resulted from the increase in the current year sales 
capital expenditures  predominantly for the expansion and automation of existing warehouses and the investment in additional management information systems  were million during proceeds from the sale of marketable securities during were million 
amounts paid to acquire the stock of the iv one companies and to satisfy amounts owed pursuant to a prior year acquisition agreement totaled approximately million 
net decrease in borrowings under the bank credit agreement was million during at december   the company had borrowed million under the bank credit agreement and had a remaining availability of million 
the company believes that its cash on hand  cash equivalents  bank line of credit and working capital management efforts are sufficient to meet future working capital requirements 
as of december   the company s short term bank line of credit was  the company s principal working capital needs are for inventory and accounts receivable 
the company sells inventory to its chain drug warehouse and other customers on various payment terms 
this requires significant working capital to finance inventory purchases and entails accounts receivable exposure in the event any of its chain warehouse or other major customers encounter financial difficulties 
although the company monitors closely the creditworthiness of its major customers and  when feasible  obtains security interests in the inventory sold  there can be no assurance that the company will not incur some collection loss on chain drug or other major customer accounts receivable in the future 
inflation 
the company s financial statements are prepared on the basis of historical costs and are not intended to reflect changes in the relative purchasing power of the dollar 
because of its ability to take advantage of forward purchasing opportunities  the company believes that its gross profits generally increase as a result of manufacturers price increases in the products it distributes 
gross profits may decline if the rate of price increases by manufacturers declines 
generally  price increases are passed through to customers as they are received by the company and therefore reduce the negative effect of inflation 
other non inventory cost increases  such as payroll  supplies and services  have been partially offset during the past three years by increased volume and productivity
