item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
years ended august  and net sales for the fiscal year ended august  decreased approximately million compared to the fiscal year ended august  the decrease was due primarily to a decrease in the number of garments sold offset by a increase in the average selling price per garment 
the decrease in the number of garments sold was primarily attributable to a restructuring in the fourth quarter of fiscal resulting in the sale or discontinuance of certain product lines as part of a concentrated effort to divest the company of unprofitable and lower margin lines 
gross margins increased from for the fiscal year ended august  to for the fiscal year ended august  while the general business and market conditions have not improved in fiscal  the company s current product mix resulted in higher overall gross margins and fewer garments being sold below cost in fiscal than in fiscal the company s product mix constantly changes to reflect customer mix  fashion trends and changing seasons 
consequently  gross margins are likely to vary on a quarter to quarter basis and in comparison to gross margins generated in the same period of prior fiscal years 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased in dollar amount from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  but were approximately the same as a percent of net sales in fiscal and in fiscal 
the decrease in dollar amount was due to the lower sales volume in the current period and  in part  to a reduction in overhead as a result of the company s restructuring in the fourth quarter of fiscal year interest expense increased in the current year due to the company s increased usage of its short term line of credit 
interest income decreased in fiscal due to decreases in the company s average cash balances on hand and a decrease in the prime rate of interest  and consequently the company s investment rate for its unutilized cash 
the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets decreased by  in fiscal due to the utilization on a consolidated basis of deferred tax deductions generated by the company 
consequently  the company reported an income tax provision of  years ended august  and net sales for the fiscal year ended august  decreased approximately million compared to the fiscal year ended august  the decrease was due primarily to a decrease in the number of garments sold offset by a increase in the average selling price per garment 
gross margins increased from for the fiscal year ended august  to for the fiscal year ended august  fiscal was characterized by weak economic and market conditions for the apparel industry in general which resulted in lower than normal gross margins as well as an increase in the number of garments sold below cost 
while the general business and market conditions did not improve in fiscal  the company s product mix in fiscal resulted in higher overall gross margins and fewer garments being sold below cost in fiscal than in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses decreased in dollar amount from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  but were approximately the same as a percent of net sales in fiscal and in fiscal 
the decrease in dollar amount was due to the lower sales volume in fiscal and the reversal of an unutilized  reserve established in fiscal for the closure of one of the company s two warehouse facilities 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company implemented a strategy to eliminate unprofitable product lines  reduce its work force  dispose of excess equipment and consolidate its operations 
as a result of this strategy  restructuring charges were incurred which reduced pretax operating income by approximately million 
the restructuring charges included approximately  for employee terminations and related severance packages   for lease write offs and  for fixed asset write offs 
on august   the company sold various assets associated with its junior  girls and maternity product lines for an initial cash payment of  and a five year note for  the company recorded a  pretax gain from the transaction 
because of the general market conditions within the apparel industry and the financial condition of the buyer  the company accounted for the  note on a cost recovery basis and will record revenue when the buyer makes payments on the note 
accordingly  no amounts associated with this note receivable have been recorded in the accompanying financial statements and no collections on the note were received through august on october   the buyer purchased the company s remaining inventory of the product lines at the company s cost 
on october   the company sold the buyer the company s remaining inventory in such product lines at the company s cost of  the buyer was also granted an exclusive world wide license to use various trade names registered by the company for the product lines 
at that time  the company also ceased purchasing garments which had previously been sold under the trade names licensed to the buyer 
sales of these product lines amounted to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
interest expense decreased in fiscal due to the company s decreased usage of its short term line of credit 
interest income increased in fiscal due to increases in the company s average cash balances on hand and increases in the prime rate of interest  and consequently the company s investment rate for its unutilized cash 
the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets decreased by  in fiscal due to the utilization on a consolidated basis of deferred tax deductions generated by the company s body drama subsidiary 
consequently  the company reported an income tax benefit of  while reporting a pretax loss of only  on november   the company completed a short form merger and acquired all remaining outstanding shares of its body drama subsidiary 
the minority interest of  represents the earnings attributable to the minority shareholders through november  subsequent to november   the company owned of body drama 
liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital of million at august  decreased from the august  level of million and the company s current ratio decreased from at august  to at august  the principal reason for these declines was that on september   the company purchased and retired approximately  shares of its common stock at per share in connection with a tender offer by the company 
the aggregate cost of the shares  including legal and other costs associated with the tender offer  was approximately million  which was funded entirely from the company s existing cash balances 
at august   the company had agreements with a financial institution pursuant to which the company sold a majority of its trade accounts receivable to the financial institution on a pre approved non recourse basis 
the company ships the non financed portion of the merchandise to customers and attempts to make those shipments on a cod basis or ensure that the customers payments are backed by a commercial or standby letter of credit issued by the customer s bank 
the amount of the company s receivables which were not sold to the financial institution and were not made on a cod basis or supported by commercial or standby letters of credit at august  was approximately  of which  has been collected through october  payment for receivables which are sold to the financial institution is made at the time customers make payment to the financial institution or  if a customer is financially unable to make payment  within approximately days of the invoice due date 
the company may request advances in anticipation of customer collections at the lender s prime rate less one half percent and open letters of credit through the lender up to million 
the amount of such borrowings  including a portion of outstanding letters of credit  are limited to certain percentages of outstanding accounts receivable and finished goods inventory owned by the company and are collateralized by all of the assets of the company 
at august   the company had outstanding letters of credit of  for the purchase of finished goods which had been opened through the financial institution 
under these agreements  the company is required to maintain million in net worth and million in working capital 
in fiscal  the company s body drama subsidiary acquired  shares of its stock at per share 
the total cost of these shares was approximately million  which includes expenses specifically associated with the tender offer  including the costs of defense for a related class action suit filed against body drama  the company and several of its officers and directors 
 and approximately  respectively  of legal costs related to the class action lawsuit were paid by the company and its subsidiary  respectively  during the twelve months ended august  on november   the company acquired the remaining  outstanding shares of body drama at per share 
the aggregate cost of these shares incurred in connection with the purchase was  the company is not aware of any trends or other matters which will  or are reasonably likely to  result in its liquidity materially increasing or decreasing 
other information inventory the experience of the company demonstrates that  in its ordinary course of operations  a portion of the company s sales may be made below its normal selling prices or below cost subsequent to august  the amount of such sales depends on several factors  including general economic conditions  market conditions within the apparel industry  the desirability of the styles held in inventory and competitive pressures from other garment suppliers 
the company s inventory increased from million at august  to million at august  the company has established an inventory markdown reserve as of august   which management believes will be sufficient for current inventory that is expected to be sold below cost in the future 
there can be no assurance that the company will realize its expected selling prices  or that the inventory markdown reserve will be adequate  for items in inventory as of august  for which customer sales orders have not yet been received 
backlog at august   the company had unfilled customer orders of million compared to million of such orders at august   with such orders generally scheduled for delivery by january and  respectively 
the decrease in backlog is primarily attributable to the sale of its junior girls and maternity product lines  the termination of other product lines in connection with the company s refocusing on higher profit margin product lines  and a general trend in the retail industry toward shorter order lead times  particularly in dresses 
these amounts include both confirmed orders and unconfirmed orders which the company believes  based on industry practice and past experience  will be confirmed 
the amount of unfilled orders at a particular time is affected by a number of factors  including the scheduling of the production and shipment of garments  which in some instances may be delayed or accelerated by customer request 
accordingly  a comparison of unfilled orders from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative of eventual actual shipments 
while cancellations  rejections and returns have generally not been material in the past  there can be no assurance that cancellations  rejections and returns will not reduce the amount of sales realized from the backlog of orders at august  impact of exchange rates while the company purchased over of its products from foreign manufacturers in fiscal  all of its purchases are denominated in united states dollars 
because the company s products are sold exclusively in the united states  in dollar denominated transactions  the company does not engage in hedging or other arbitrage to reduce currency risk 
an increase in the value of the dollar versus foreign currencies could enhance the company s purchasing power and reduce its cost of goods sold 
conversely  a decrease in the value of the dollar relative to foreign currencies could result in an increase in the company s cost of manufacturing and costs of goods sold 
impact of inflation  deflation  and changing prices management does not believe that inflation and changing prices have had any material impact upon the company s revenues or income from operations 
however  continued deflation in women s clothing prices may put pressure on gross margins 
the strong resistance on the part of the consumer to increases in price and the increasing fabric and labor costs lead to an increased cost of goods on a percentage basis
