percentage of revenues year to year change vs 
vs 
sales and service fees 
gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses restructuring charge operating income loss interest expense net income loss 
fiscal compared with fiscal total sales and service fees of million in fiscal represented an increase of million over fiscal  inclusive of million attributable to the effect of stronger european currencies when converting foreign currency revenues into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
on a worldwide basis  sales of cnc guided machine tools totaled million  an increase of million over fiscal  and sales of cnc systems and software totaled million  an increase of million over fiscal while the increases in both product lines reflected improvements in the world s principal machine tool markets  particularly germany  the significantly greater percentage increase associated with the sales of cnc guided machine tools was attributable to the strong demand for the company s new advantage series of machine tools as well as the enhanced availability of products for shipment as a result of capacity increases on the part of contract manufacturers 
revenues attributable to sales of parts and service fees declined million from fiscal levels  primarily as a result of reduced sales of parts for discontinued machine tool models 
in the united states  sales and service fees in fiscal increased million over fiscal  reflecting increases of million in sales of cnc guided machine tools and million in sales of cnc systems and software  offset by a decrease of million in revenue from service parts and fees 
the improved sales were primarily attributable to increases in unit volume  rather than pricing  due to enhanced demand for and availability of the company s advantage product line and general strengthening of the markets for both fully integrated machine tools and cnc systems 
in europe  sales and service fees in fiscal increased million over fiscal  inclusive of the effects of currency conversion for financial reporting purposes 
net of currency translation effects  the improvement was primarily attributable to a increase in unit volume and a increase in average unit prices realized for the company s cnc guided machine tools  reflecting the introduction of the new advantage series in the second half of fiscal as well as a significant strengthening of the european machine tool markets 
in asia  sales and service fees increased to million in fiscal from  recorded for fiscal  reflecting the company s more competitive pricing of the new advantage series product line in that market 
on a combined basis  european and asian sales and service fees in fiscal  exclusive of currency translation effects  accounted for of total worldwide revenues  compared with in fiscal  due primarily to the more significant year to year change in general market conditions in europe than in the united states  as well as improvements in the company s foreign sales and marketing operations 
demand for the company s products during fiscal was strong 
worldwide new order bookings for fiscal increased million over  primarily due to the introduction of the new advantage series of machine tool products and the increased production capacity of the company s contract manufacturers 
backlog as of october   was million compared to million as of october  the company is continuing to work with its contract manufacturers to further increase their production capacity 
gross profit margin as a percentage of revenues increased from in fiscal to in as reflected in note to the consolidated financial statements  gross profit margins have steadily increased from in the first quarter of fiscal to in the fourth quarter of fiscal  reflecting cost reductions achieved through the company s restructuring program as well as the incremental phase in of higher margin products 
also contributing to the enhancement of gross profit margins was an improved mix of higher margin european sales as a percentage of total worldwide sales  as well as the favorable currency translation effects associated with foreign sales 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in fiscal increased  over fiscal primarily because of favorable currency translation effects  and increased selling expenses associated with increased unit volume 
sg a expenses  as a percentage of sales and service fees  was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the company generated million of operating income in fiscal compared to a million operating loss in fiscal  a million improvement 
this return to operating profitability after three years of losses reflects the benefits of the company s restructuring program  the phase in of new higher margin products and improved market conditions worldwide 
interest expense in fiscal increased  over fiscal included in interest expense for fiscal is a  incremental fee payable to the company s lenders under its credit agreements  which provide for additional fees when certain gross profit levels are achieved 
as of october   the maximum fee became fully due 
the remaining  incremental fee payable to the lenders as of october   will be amortized to expense during fiscal the remainder of the increase in interest expense reflects the impact of higher interest rates on the company s floating rate bank borrowings  despite a million reduction in total debt during the year 
no income tax expense has been provided for fiscal the income tax liability incurred in certain tax jurisdictions was offset by the reversal of valuation allowance reserves against the company s net operating loss carryforwards 
net operating loss carryforwards available to offset pre tax income in future periods are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company manages its foreign currency exposure through the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company does not speculate in the financial markets and  therefore  does not enter into these contracts for trading purposes 
the company also moderates its currency risk related to significant purchase commitments with certain foreign vendors through price adjustment agreements that provide for a sharing of  or otherwise limit  the potential adverse effect of currency fluctuations on the costs of purchased products 
the results of these programs achieved management s objectives for fiscal compared with fiscal the results of operations for fiscal are not directly comparable with those for fiscal due to the impact on fiscal results of non recurring charges that aggregated million 
in addition  sales in fiscal included approximately million attributable to certain product lines that were discontinued in fiscal although total sales and service fees in fiscal were relatively unchanged from those for fiscal  sales of continuing product lines increased million substantially offsetting the negative impact on sales of the discontinuance of certain product lines that had accounted for approximately million of sales in fiscal sales of continuing product lines in europe increased million over fiscal  reflecting a increase in unit volume and a increase in average unit prices 
the increase in unit volume resulted primarily from general improvement in economic conditions in the united kingdom and germany 
the improvement in average unit prices reflected a reduction in price discounting within the machine tool market generally as well as an upgrading in the company s total product mix 
changes in currency exchange rates were not a material factor in the year to year increase 
in the united states  sales and service fees in fiscal decreased million from fiscal sales of cnc systems and software increased million  reflecting improved conditions in those machine tool market segments in which these products are sold 
this increase was offset  however  by a decrease in sales of cnc guided machine tools  as well as associated parts and service fees  reflecting the adverse effect of shortages in the availability of certain of the company s product lines for immediate shipment during the first six months of fiscal  the restructuring of the company s domestic sales and marketing organization throughout the year  the early phase out of certain older machine tool models and a decline in customer orders for certain continuing product offerings in anticipation of the expected introduction of the advantage series of machine tools in the fourth fiscal quarter 
new orders in fiscal decreased million from fiscal backlog as of october  was million compared to million at october  in september  the company introduced its new advantage series of machine tools and several new open architecture based cnc systems and software products  resulting in near record orders for that month 
although the new machine tool products were not available for shipment until the first quarter of fiscal in the united states  and later in europe  new domestic machine tool orders in september and october reflected an increase of compared to the same months in gross profit margin as a percentage of revenues increased from in fiscal exclusive of non recurring charges to in fiscal  the effect of which is approximately million 
gross profit margins increased from in the first quarter of fiscal to in the fourth quarter 
the improvements in gross profit margins reflected the benefits of cost reductions achieved through the implementation of the company s restructuring program and the incremental phase in of higher margin products 
selling  general  and administrative expenses in fiscal decreased million  or  from fiscal primarily as a result of facilities and personnel reductions under the restructuring program 
as a result of the improvements in gross profit margins and the reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses  the fiscal operating loss was million less than that reported for fiscal exclusive of the non recurring charges 
interest expense in fiscal increased  over the fiscal amount notwithstanding a million reduction in outstanding debt  as a result of higher interest rates and fees payable to the company s lenders 
in fiscal  the company entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge against foreign currency fluctuations on receivables denominated in foreign currencies and net investments in foreign subsidiaries  principally working capital 
these contracts were typical forward contracts and were not entered into for trading purposes 
hedge gains and losses were effectively matched with corresponding transaction gains and losses on foreign currency receivables and corresponding translation gains and losses on net investments 
the net effect of this activity was not significant during liquidity and capital resources at october   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at october  cash provided by operations totaled million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal accounts receivable increased by million because of substantially higher sales volume in the fourth quarter of fiscal than in the comparable quarter of fiscal inventories decreased by million primarily due to focused efforts to sell discontinued cnc machine tool products and related parts inventories 
this reduction offset increased inventory requirements related to higher production capacity at the company s contract manufacturers 
accounts payable and accrued expenses increased by million primarily because of the increased inventory requirements and the higher sales volume 
working capital was million at october   compared to million at october  the decrease in working capital is primarily attributable to the classification of term debt payable on or before september  as current liabilities 
during fiscal  total debt was reduced by million through the application of cash provided by operations 
this compares to decreased borrowings of million in fiscal capital expenditures for property and equipment were  in fiscal and represented normal improvements and replacements 
capitalized software development costs were million in fiscal and represented continued activity in developing new software features and options for both new and existing cnc system products 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has approximately million in inventories of discontinued products  inactive parts and excess slow moving parts which it expects to liquidate in the normal course of operations 
management expects the results of such liquidation in to be sufficient to offset any increases in inventory requirements related to continuing products and to provide an additional source of cash from operations 
as of october   the company had unutilized credit facilities of million available for either direct borrowings or commercial letters of credit 
as noted under item business intellectual properties  the company s subsidiary  ims technology  inc  entered into a patent license agreement under which it will receive payments  net of legal fees and expenses  aggregating approximately  throughout january  of which approximately  will be included in income during fiscal under the terms of the company s agreements with its lenders  which were amended and restated effective january   as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  million of term loan payments are due and payable in fiscal  including approximately million in installment payments which were deferred from february  to july  management believes that anticipated cash flow from operations  together with available borrowings under the company s bank credit facilities  will be sufficient to enable the company to meet its anticipated cash requirements for fiscal  including scheduled debt amortization payments 
however  should cash flow from operations be less than currently anticipated  the company may be required to limit planned investments in new products  equipment and business development opportunities 
in order to provide additional liquidity and working capital  as well as a basis for ultimately refinancing its outstanding indebtedness  the company is considering opportunities for raising approximately million of additional capital through the issuance and sale of equity or subordinated debt securities 
the company has no present agreements or arrangements for obtaining such additional capital and there can be no assurance that it will be obtainable on acceptable terms 
although the company has no obligation to seek or obtain such additional capital  if it is not obtained  the company may be subject to increased fees to its lenders  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements
