overview the company provides a broad range of integrated telecommunications products and services  primarily to customers located in the western continental united states and hawaii 
since inception as a facilities based cap  the company has constructed and operated digital interconnected telecommunications networks that provide an alternative to lecs 
the company has expanded beyond the scope of traditional cap operations into clec services and currently provides  through its established sales channels  a range of enhanced telecommunications services that include long distance  internet access and data services 
in addition  the company provides switched access and recently began to offer local dial tone services to complement its existing telecommunications service offerings 
the company also provides advanced telecommunications switching platforms with integrated applications software and network telemanagement capabilities through its subsidiary  nact 
the company s fiber optic networks currently serve cities in arizona  california  new mexico and washington and its digital microwave networks serve four of the hawaiian islands 
in addition  the company has networks under construction and other networks in various stages of development 
the telecommunications act and state regulatory initiatives have substantially changed the telecommunications regulatory environment in the united states 
as a result of these regulatory changes  the company is permitted in certain states to provide local dial tone in addition to its existing telecommunications service offerings 
in order to capitalize on these opportunities  the company has accelerated the development and construction of additional networks within its region 
in addition  to facilitate the provision of local services  the company has deployed four high capacity digital switches and intends to deploy additional switches in the first half of results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
total revenues for fiscal increased million  or to million from million for fiscal telecommunications services revenues for fiscal increased million  or  to million from million for fiscal the increase in telecommunications services revenues resulted from an acceleration of revenue growth in clec operations and continuing growth of long distance  internet and data services  including revenues associated with fiscal and strategic acquisitions 
telecommunications products revenues for fiscal increased million  or over fiscal results 
the increase in telecommunications product revenues resulted from the introduction by nact of its new stx product line in the third quarter of fiscal operating expenses 
total operating expenses for fiscal increased million  or  to million from million for fiscal network expenses  which include direct local and long distance circuit costs  increased million to million from million for fiscal  due to an expanded customer base and increased usage 
as a percentage of telecommunications services revenues  network expenses decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal facilities administration and maintenance expenses for fiscal increased million to million from million for fiscal as a percent of telecommunications services revenues  facilities administration and maintenance expenses increased from for fiscal to for fiscal the increase relates to additional personnel and facility costs required by continuing network expansion  a substantial portion of which are incurred before the realization of revenues 
cost of product revenues at nact for fiscal increased million to million from million for fiscal as a percentage of telecommunications products revenues for fiscal  cost of product revenues remained relatively constant as compared to fiscal results 
however  gross profit on telecommunications product revenues as a percent of telecommunications product revenues decreased nominally due to initial lower margins resulting from the discontinuance of the lcx as nact transitioned to the new stx to existing customers 
research and development costs increased nominally for fiscal relative to fiscal as the company moved to more rapidly develop an improved billing system and to maintain ongoing research and development of the company s existing hardware and software product lines 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million from million for fiscal the increase is due to the expansion of the company s clec and enhanced services operations  including  to a lesser extent  the acquisitions during fiscal of call america  certain assets of texas ohio  hawaii on line and tri star 
the implementation of the company s integrated services strategy has resulted in additional marketing  management information and sales staff dedicated to network expansion and increased service offerings 
depreciation and amortization for fiscal increased million to million from million for fiscal due to increased depreciation resulting from newly constructed networks becoming operational 
to a lesser extent  the increase in depreciation and amortization was also due to increased amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions 
other expenses 
other expenses for fiscal increased to million from million for fiscal the increase was principally the result of additional interest expense associated with the company s sale in december of units consisting in the aggregate of million principal amount at maturity of the senior notes  million principal amount at maturity of the convertible notes  receiving gross proceeds of approximately million the notes offering 
the increase was partially offset by interest income resulting from the investment of the proceeds of the notes offering

telecommunications service revenues increased million as a result of wholesale carrier services revenues generated by nact and wins  which began to offer such services during fiscal  and long distance and other service revenues of itg  which was acquired effective may  in addition  an increase of million was the result of revenues generated by the hawaiian digital microwave and the san gabriel valley networks 
the san gabriel valley networks became operational in fiscal the increase in manufacturing revenues was due to increased unit sales of telecommunications switching and network management and billing systems 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses for fiscal increased million  or  to million from million for fiscal network expenses for fiscal increased million to million from million for fiscal due to expansion of network operations  the acquisition of itg and the commencement of wholesale carrier services at wins and nact 
facilities administration and maintenance expenses totaled million for fiscal  compared to only  for fiscal the increase was due to significant network expansion in fiscal  whereas fiscal results included only three months of engineering expenses at the company s hawaiian network 
cost of product revenues at nact for fiscal increased to million  or of product revenues  for fiscal from million  or of product revenues  for fiscal research and development expenditures of nact increased by million  or to million for fiscal from million for fiscal due to the continuing development of a new switch that was introduced in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase was principally the result of higher salary and benefit costs incurred in fiscal as the company added a significant number of sales  marketing and management employees in connection with network expansion 
also contributing to the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses were higher professional fees and travel costs related to expansion of clec operations 
in addition  bad debt expense increased million in fiscal principally due to a reserve for doubtful accounts for an itg customer 
depreciation and amortization increased million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a result of amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions and depreciation of newly operational networks 
other expenses 
other expenses increased 
million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal contributing to the increase was an 
million increase in interest expense resulting from tomen borrowings and a 
million write off of investments 
offsetting these increases was a 
million decrease in the loss on joint ventures due to improved operating results at the phoenix fiber network 
additionally  in fiscal the company wrote off 
million in pre operating costs at gst telecom 
no such losses were realized in fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company has incurred significant operating and net losses as a result of the development and operation of its networks 
the company expects that such losses will continue to increase as the company emphasizes the development  construction and expansion of its networks and builds its customer base and that cash provided by operations will not be sufficient to fund the expansion of its networks and services 
net cash provided by financing activities from borrowings and equity issuances to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions and operating losses was million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal the company s net cash used in operating and investment activities was million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal the company made capital expenditures of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the company estimates capital expenditures of approximately million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
these expenditures will be utilized for the expansion  development and construction of its networks  the acquisition and deployment of switches and related equipment to facilitate the offering of advanced telecommunication services and internal management systems 
continued significant capital expenditures are expected to be made thereafter 
in addition  the company expects to continue to incur increasing operating losses while it expands its business and builds its customer base 
actual capital expenditures and operating losses will depend on numerous factors beyond the company s control  including the nature of future expansion and acquisition opportunities  economic conditions  competition  regulatory developments and the availability of capital 
the company completed the notes offering in december  consisting of million in senior notes and million in convertible notes 
the net proceeds from the issuance of the notes  million  are being used to fund network development  capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
the indentures governing the senior notes include restrictive covenants which  among other items  limit or restrict additional indebtedness incurred by the company  investment in certain subsidiaries and the payment of dividends 
the company has historically funded its capital expenditures  acquisitions  working capital requirements and operating losses from public and private offerings of common shares  notes and warrants to purchase common shares and notes and from funds made available under the tomen facility 
under the tomen facility  tomen agreed to make up to a total of million of financing available  on a project by project basis  for the construction and development of network projects 
at september   tomen had provided or agreed to provide  the company with million of financing under the tomen facility and had purchased  common shares and warrants to purchase  additional common shares 
in november  tomen agreed in principle to provide the company with million of additional financing under the tomen facility for the hawaiian inter island network and terrestrial fiber optic facilities and in connection with such financing will purchase additional common shares in an amount to be determined and warrants to purchase  additional common shares 
on october   the company completed a private placement to non us investors of the special warrants 
the special warrants become exercisable by holders for no additional consideration upon the later to occur of i the date upon which approval for the canadian prospectus is received from the securities commission of each of the canadian provinces where the special warrants were sold and ii the date that the us registration statement is declared effective  but in any event  no later that september  in the event that the requisite regulatory approvals for the canadian prospectus are not received by the company and the us registration statement is not declared effective  in each case by february   then each special warrant will become exercisable for common shares and one half of one underlying warrant 
the company received  constituting of the aggregate purchase price of the special warrants net of placement agency fees and expenses  on october  the balance of the net purchase price of special warrants  is being held in escrow and is payable to the company upon the earlier to occur of x the date of receipt of final regulatory approval of a preliminary canadian prospectus from the securities commissions of the applicable canadian provinces and y the initial filing of the us registration statement with the commission  in each case covering the resale of the common shares issuable upon exercise of the special warrants and the underlying warrants 
the company recently entered into an agreement for million of additional equipment financing the ntfc financing with the ntfc capital corporation ntfc 
the company expects to use the proceeds from the ntfc financing to finance the purchase of equipment and products from northern telecom inc nortel 
the company currently is negotiating the terms of additional financing to be provided by nortel 
in september  the company entered into a loan and security agreement with siemens stromberg carlson siemens the siemens loan agreement that provides for loans by siemens of up to an aggregate of million to finance the purchase of siemens equipment and certain equipment from other suppliers 
the company proposes to incur significant additional indebtedness to purchase telecommunications equipment such as switches and fiber optic cable and to finance related design  development  construction  installation and integration costs 
in such connection  the company may make public or private offerings of its debt and equity securities and may negotiate additional credit facilities  which may be similar to the tomen facility or to the ntfc financing 
at september   the company had cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and marketable securities of million  compared to million at september  the company believes that the net proceeds of the special warrant offering  the nact offering and any other offerings  if any  in the future  together with cash on hand and borrowings expected to be available under both the tomen facility and the equipment financing arranged with siemens and ntfc  will provide sufficient funds for the company to expand its business as presently planned and to fund its operating expenses through the first half of fiscal thereafter  the company expects to require additional financing 
however  in the event that the company s plans or assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate  or the foregoing sources of funds prove to be insufficient to fund the company s growth and operations  or if the company consummates additional acquisitions  the company may be required to seek additional capital sooner than currently anticipated 
sources of financing may include public or private debt or equity financing by the company or its subsidiaries  sales of assets or other financing arrangements 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing would be available to the company or  if available  that it could be obtained on acceptable terms or within the limitations contained in the company s financing arrangements 
failure to obtain such financing could result in the delay or abandonment of some or all of the company s development and expansion plans and expenditures and could have a material adverse effect on the company 
such failure could also limit the ability of the company to make principal and interest payments on its outstanding indebtedness 
the company has no working capital or other credit facility under which it may borrow for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
there can be no assurance that such a facility will be available to the company in the future or that if such a facility were available  that it would be available on terms and conditions acceptable to the company 
although the company s liquidity substantially improved as a result of the notes offering  because the notes do not require the payment of cash interest prior to june and the notes and the notes do not require payment of principal until maturity in and  respectively  a portion of the indebtedness under the tomen facility will  and a portion of the equipment financing may  mature prior to accordingly  the company may need to refinance a substantial amount of indebtedness 
in addition  the company anticipates that cash flow from operations may be insufficient to repay the notes in full at maturity and that the notes may need to be refinanced 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to improve its earnings before fixed charges or that the company will be able to meet its debt service obligations  including its obligations under the tomen facility  the notes or equipment financing 
because the company does not currently have a revolving credit facility  if a shortfall occurs  alternative financing would be necessary in order for the company to meet its liquidity requirements and there can be no assurance that such financing would be available 
in such event  the company could face substantial liquidity problems 
the ability of the company to meet its obligations and effect such refinancings will be dependent upon the future performance of the company  which will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  including factors beyond the control of the company
