item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary historically  abiomed has emphasized long term product research and development  and company revenues and expenses have primarily been attributable to this research and development 
this emphasis continued in fiscal and  with a variety of products being developed internally and under government contracts 
however  since fiscal  the first full year marketing the bvs in the us  increasing sales of the bvs have made product revenues the largest contributor to the company s operating results 
at the end of fiscal  the bvs console and blood pumps had been sold to over medical centers in the us  with us sales of the number of disposable blood pumps increasing by more than as compared to sales of disposable blood pump units for fiscal the bvs was approved by the food and drug administration fda for sale in november during calendar the company began building its domestic direct sales and marketing organization and began its transition into a more complete commercial entity 
since that time  the company has built a domestic sales  support and marketing team for the bvs consisting of people  including a post sales clinical support team consisting of seven members compared to only two during most of fiscal the company believes that this sales team and the effectiveness of the bvs in saving lives are the primary reasons for increases in product revenues in each of its first three full years domestically selling the bvs

table total product revenues thousands fy fy fy product revenues    during fiscal and  unit sales of bvs products  particularly blood pumps and related accessories  increased over the prior year 
average selling prices for the bvs console and blood pump also increased during fiscal in fiscal and  sales were balanced between sales to new customers and reorders from existing customers  with reorders of the disposable products to the installed customer base growing faster than sales of systems to new customers 
in fiscal  the majority of product revenues were derived from sales of systems to new customers 
the majority of the company s product revenues in the three fiscal years since fda approval of the bvs have been to us customers 
international sales represented  and of total product revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increases in product revenues also reflect increases in sales by the company s dental subsidiary in each of the last three fiscal years with increases resulting primarily from increased halimeter and periotemp unit sales in both fiscal and combined with increases in average selling prices for both products in fiscal revenue from dental products continue to represent less than ten percent of total revenues 
contract revenues the company s research and development subsidiary completed fiscal with approximately  in contract revenues  compared with contract revenues of  in fiscal and  in fiscal  representing increases of and for fiscal and  respectively table 
these revenues are based upon cost reimbursement and  therefore  reflect the level of the company s research and development activity in each year 
the majority of the company s contract revenues  approximately in fiscal  was earned in connection with research for the company s total artificial heart tah under the first phase of a contract awarded in september and expiring in september  by the national heart  lung and blood institute nhlbi 
as of march   approximately  in funding remained available to the company under this first phase of the tah contract 
the nhlbi has indicated that it has approximately million to be awarded in october for continued phase two development of a total artificial heart 
the nhlbi has indicated that only two of the three scientific teams presently receiving tah research funding from the nhlbi will qualify for funding for the second phase 
the second phase is anticipated to be a four year contract 
abiomed has asked for million to be awarded for its continued tah research and development 
there can be no assurance that abiomed will receive its requested amount or any amount from the nhlbi for this continued tah research and development 
during october  the company was awarded a contract for million over five years from the nhlbi for the initial research and development of its implantable heart booster 
at march   the company was working on a number of contracts and grants representing a total backlog  excluding the second phase of the tah contract  of approximately million 
the company has submitted proposals for funding on several additional projects including the request for second phase funding of the tah 
all such government contracts contain provisions making them terminable at the convenience of the government 
the company retains for itself the rights  royalty free and clear  to manufacture and market the products developed under these government contracts and grants 
although the nih of which the nhlbi is a part budget has been increasing in recent years  there can be no guarantee that this budget will not be reduced

the increase in sales margins in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily attributable to increased sales volumes of disposable blood pump units to an expanded installed customer base  increased average selling prices across all product lines and increased manufacturing efficiencies 
decreased units costs for both the bvs console and the bvs blood pumps resulted from decreases in direct manufacturing costs and more effective absorption of overhead expenses with higher manufacturing volume 
the company believes that increased manufacturing volumes and productivity gains will continue to reduce bvs product costs 
costs of research and development increased to approximately  in fiscal compared to  and  fiscal and  respectively 
these increases reflect increased activity under research contracts and grants which are billed on a cost plus fixed fee basis 
costs of internal research and development primarily relate to continued engineering support and improvement of existing products  to continued development of internally developed products such as supracor and for regulatory support for all products

although the company does not currently have significant capital commitments other than as described above  the company believes that it will continue to make significant investments over the next several years to support the development and commercialization of its products 
in particular  the company intends to accelerate development and testing of its total artificial heart 
the company will need additional funding for this development  a portion of which may be provided if its proposal to obtain phase ii funding for tah development from the nhlbi is successful 
a response from nhlbi is due in october the company believes that its revenues and its existing resources are sufficient to meet its needs for the current fiscal year 
health care reform private and government proposals for significant health care reform are expected to continue to affect health care expenditures in the united states as well as internationally where the company sells or plans to sell its products 
the company cannot assess at this time the potential impact that healthcare trends may have on future operating results because of the uncertainties surrounding any foreseeable changes
