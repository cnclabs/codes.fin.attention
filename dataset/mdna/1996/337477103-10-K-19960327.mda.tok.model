item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations net income for the fiscal year declined to million compared to the million earned in net income for includes the earnings from farmers national bancorp  acquired at the end of and accounted for as a purchase 
accordingly  the results included only three days earnings from farmers  while the earnings contained the full year 
earnings per share equaled per share  a decline from the earned in earnings per share declined at a greater pace than net income because of the greater number of shares outstanding issued in connection with the acquisition of farmers national bancorp 
the primary reason for the decline in earnings during was a decline in the net interest margin as the cost of funds increased at a faster pace than the yield on earning assets 
in addition  goodwill and other intangibles created in connection with the farmers acquisition caused an increase in amortization expense 
first virginia has historically been one of the highest performing banks in both its market area and the nation and  despite the decline in earnings  it once again achieved the highest return on average assets of all of the major virginia based bank holding companies 
first virginia s return on average assets declined from in to in however  this still exceeded by a significant margin the return on average assets of the banks in its regional peer group of southern banking companies and the of its national peer group of to billion asset sized banks 
over the past years  first virginia has averaged a return on average assets compared to a return posted by its national peer group of similar sized banks 
average shareholders equity increased and  at year end  equaled million  an increase over the million at the end of first virginia remains one of the most highly capitalized of the largest financial institutions in the country 
its average equity to average assets ratio of during is significantly higher than the of its national peer group of similar sized banks 
this high rate of capitalization provides the corporation with ample capital to weather periods of economic adversity and  at the same time  gives it the flexibility to take advantage of any opportunities that may arise 
it also permitted the board of directors to increase the dividend twice during the th consecutive year the dividend has been increased and the th consecutive year in which the dividend has been increased at least twice during the year 
during  the corporation  continuing its program to repurchase some of its shares  purchased  shares 
since the repurchase program was begun in  the corporation has purchased and retired million shares  or of the shares outstanding at the beginning of the program 
however  the increase in average shareholders equity  coupled with the slight decline in earnings  meant that the return on average shareholders equity declined from in to in this was less than the peer group average of and marked the first time in over a decade that first virginia s return on equity was below its peer group s average 
over the past years  however  first virginia s average return on equity of has exceeded the peer group average of despite first virginia s much higher capitalization rate 
total assets at year end increased to billion compared to billion at the end of in september  the corporation purchased four offices with approximately million in deposits in the richmond  virginia  area from citizens federal savings bank 
these offices enhanced the corporation s exposure in the richmond market and were a complementary fit with the existing offices of first virginia bank colonial  making it the second largest bank in the first virginia system 
average assets increased at a greater pace of due to the two acquisitions the million farmers national bancorp operating in the annapolis and eastern shore areas of maryland  and the million fnb financial corporation with offices in the knoxville  tennessee  area 
loan demand slowed during  and outstanding loans at year end were up only to billion compared to the billion at the end of average loans increased at a faster rate of as a result of strong loan volume throughout and the acquisition of loans from farmers national bancorp at the end of declining automobile sales caused indirect automobile loan production to decline 
the corporation opened new indirect automobile loan production offices in north carolina  tennessee and south carolina and plans to open additional offices in direct installment loan production  primarily home equity loans made in the corporation s branches  which grew in  slowed considerably 
we attribute this to a growing unease by consumers in the corporation s market area over the prospect of continued employment 
gross production in this area dropped  although by year end it had begun growing modestly as interest rates began to decline 
deposits increased from the end of and reached billion by the end of almost all of this growth  however  came from the purchase of four citizens federal savings bank branches containing million in deposits 
increased competition from other banks restricted deposit growth and did not permit interest rates on deposits to decline as rapidly as rates in general 
in addition  an escalating stock market brought increased competition from mutual funds  resulting in some disintermediation of funds out of traditional bank deposits and into alternative investments

statement of income net interest income the tables on pages through detail the increase in earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and demand deposits for the last three years  along with the related levels of fully taxable equivalent interest income and expense 
the variance in interest income and expense caused by differences in average balances and rates is shown on pages and as the federal reserve reacted to a slightly weaker economy and the lack of an inflation threat  interest rates declined steadily throughout they gave up almost all of the approximately basis point increase they had achieved in in the beginning of the year  some banks experienced strong commercial loan demand and needed to attract deposits to fund these loans 
later in the year  the continued surge in the stock market attracted bank deposits as consumers pursued the higher returns available in the market 
consequently  as banks sought to maintain their deposit funding sources  deposit interest rates did not decline as rapidly as did the interest rates on loans and investments 
at first virginia  the net interest margin declined steadily during the year as interest rates on deposits did not drop as fast as the yield on consumer loans and investment securities 
the margin for the full year declined basis points to from the rate maintained in during the fourth quarter  the margin dropped below for the first time since it is anticipated that the margin will stay below for a portion of until interest rates on deposits catch up with the decline in rates on loans and investments 
further improvement in the margin is anticipated in if a modestly growing economy and the expansion of the corporation s indirect automobile loan production offices into additional market areas cause an increase in loan demand 
net interest margin chart the higher  the better national first southern peer virginia regionals group southern regionals banking companies with assets over billion in national peer group banking companies with assets of between and billion in source keefe  bruyette woods despite the decline in the net interest margin  net interest income increased 
this was caused by an increase in average earning assets of as a consequence of the acquisition in late of farmers national bancorp 
interest income from loans increased due to an increase in yield of basis points and a increase in average outstanding balances 
the corporation experienced very strong loan growth in early that helped to increase average loans for it also benefitted from the loans acquired from farmers national bancorp 
interest income from securities remained relatively unchanged despite a decline in average outstanding balances 
the combination of strong loan demand in and modest deposit growth caused the corporation to fund part of its loan growth from securities maturing in its investment portfolio 
by the third quarter of  however  a new combination of deposits purchased from citizens federal and a weaker loan demand meant additional funds were placed in the investment portfolio  causing it to grow again 
interest expense increased  due in part to the acquisition of deposits from farmers national and citizens federal  and increased the cost of funds basis points to 
in mid a significant shift in the composition of deposits began to occur as consumers moved deposits out of lower yielding savings accounts and into higher cost certificates of deposit 
this continued into as consumer savings accounts declined and certificates of deposit increased  including the million purchased from citizens federal 
it is anticipated that this trend will continue into as consumers react to declining interest rates by seeking alternative  higher cost certificates of deposit to maximize their interest 
lower cost transaction accounts grew during the year as demand accounts advanced and interest checking accounts advanced 
the corporation s extensive branch structure and convenient locations create a strong sales base for these types of accounts 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses increased million to million or during  after remaining unchanged in the corporation enjoyed exceptionally low net charge offs of under basis points in and because of a higher quality loan portfolio and the strong economic cycle 
as a result  the allowance for loan losses was gradually reduced from to early to of outstanding loans  which contributed to the reduction in the provision in and the allowance for loan losses covered net charge offs times at the end of  compared to times at the end of  and covered nonperforming loans by 
nonperforming assets represented 
of outstanding loans at the end of  compared to 
at the end of  and delinquencies remained essentially unchanged during both periods 
during  four factors combined to create a million increase in net charge offs to million recoveries declined slightly from their and highs as loans charged off in the last economic cycle were collected 
farmers national and fnb financial corporation were included for the full year in outstanding loans that were booked over the past several years increased 
the current economic cycle  now fairly mature  increased the pace of charge offs in all loan categories 
despite these factors  net charge offs are still below their peak in and amounted to just 
of outstanding loans well below peer group averages and below first virginia s average of 
over the past ten years 
because the corporation makes approximately of its loans to consumers for small amounts with regular monthly repayment schedules  it has less risk exposure to loan charge offs than many banks 
credit card loans are made primarily to bank customers located in the corporation s trade area and contain a lesser degree of risk and delinquency than many banks nationally solicited accounts 
the balance of the corporation s loans are made primarily to small and medium sized businesses in the corporation s trade area and are well secured 
less than of the corporation s loans are for land development and construction and are primarily for residential or owner occupied facilities 
the corporation does not have any international  national or highly leveraged credits  nor does it have any concentration of credit in any one industry that exposes the loan portfolio to adverse risk 
noninterest income noninterest income increased in after rising by a more modest in however  when the income from the newly acquired farmers national is excluded  noninterest income rose by only in first virginia receives a greater proportion of its income from net interest income than other banking companies and has been aggressively seeking to develop more sources of noninterest fee income 
for example  in  the corporation successfully began two new programs it believes will produce fee income in the future and  in addition  is adding new products to further enhance fee income 
building on its expertise in the indirect automobile loan business  the corporation is making an automobile lease product available to its dealers 
since leasing is becoming a more popular form of financing automobile acquisitions over of new cars sold nationally are leased this area has a great potential for future fee income 
during  the corporation earned  in leasing fees by originating leases for third parties  and it expects to more than double that in when the program is introduced to additional markets and automobile dealers 
another new product introduced in was real property title insurance  offered through the corporation s insurance agency 
despite a poor year for home equity loans  the corporation earned  in commissions with the introduction of this product 
as it is offered through each of the member companies and as real estate lending increases  the volume of income from this source is expected to double in despite the success of the newly introduced title insurance product  income from all types of insurance products was virtually unchanged in because of a decline in premium income on credit life insurance 
a lower level of consumer installment loan production and lower rates mandated by the state of virginia combined to reduce income in this area 
service charges on deposits increased in  after a increase in  because of increased activity  higher fees and the addition of accounts from farmers national 
most fee increases were at least equal with inflation since the corporation maintains a practice of continually reviewing fees to ensure that each line of business remains profitable 
returned check and overdraft fees  which make up slightly more than of service charges on deposits  increased in as a result of a modest fee increase  higher transaction volume and a weakening of the current economic cycle that caused some consumers to overdraw their accounts more frequently 
credit card fee income rose despite an increase in average outstanding balances of 
in response to a more competitive market for new accounts and the retention of existing accounts  the corporation has been offering more customers a no annual fee credit card  which reduced fee income from this category by 
this has resulted in a greater retention of customers  however  and is more than offset through greater interest income and interchange income on the customers charge activity 
trust services income rose in the corporation has reorganized the trust and asset management area over the past several years  adding more sophisticated computer support and product enhancements and eliminating some lower margin business 
as a result  all categories of personal trust services enjoyed double digit growth 
implementation of additional changes in marketing and managing these products should further enhance profitability in the future 
interchange income from automated teller machines atms slowed slightly in to a growth after increasing in excess of per year in the two previous years 
point of sale activity is growing rapidly as it becomes more widely accepted by consumers and offered by more merchants 
this growth is expected to continue over the next several years 
the corporation had a network of over atms at the end of the year  including a number in high traffic nonbranch locations  such as airports  shopping centers  and even temporary units used for local fairs and community events 
since it is the corporation s general policy to hold all of its fixed income securities to maturity  there were no security gains and losses in in and  the corporation had gains of  and  respectively  from the sale of some equity securities acquired a number of years previously 
other noninterest income includes gains of million in both and from the sale of mortgage servicing rights 
the corporation normally sells a package of servicing rights each year rather than selling individual loans with servicing released 
a higher total profit is made by packaging a group of servicing rights for sale 
excluding the sale of mortgage servicing rights  other income increased in  primarily because of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for mortgage servicing rights  which required recognition of the value of originated mortgage servicing rights when the loan is made rather than when it is ultimately collected 
in  other income had declined due to a decline in mortgage origination income caused by reduced refinance activity 
however  as mortgage loan interest rates declined at the end of  refinance activity had begun to increase strongly again 
efficiency ratio chart the lower  the better national first southern peer virginia regionals group southern regionals banking companies with assets over billion in national peer group banking companies with assets of between and billion in source keefe  bruyette woods noninterest expense first virginia continued to manage its noninterest expenses in a highly disciplined manner 
because first virginia has always tightly controlled its expenses and searched for the most efficient means to operate in good and bad times  it has not had to resort to large layoffs or incur massive restructuring charges that seem so common today 
first virginia s efficiency ratio improved slightly in to from in and remains below industry averages  despite a very large branch structure 
while first virginia has a much larger branch network than other financial institutions of comparable size  it manages the network efficiently and gathers a larger proportion of its deposits from low cost transaction oriented accounts generated by its many convenient branch locations 
in  noninterest expenses increased  caused entirely by the acquisition of farmers national bancorp at the end of and thus not included in expenses 
excluding farmers from expenses would have resulted in a decline in noninterest expense 
despite five additional branches in and a growth in assets of  the corporation actually had fewer employees at the end of compared to salaries and employee benefits increased primarily due to the inclusion of farmers in results 
a decline in net income meant incentive payments to employees declined by 
the increase in the price of the stock  however  resulted in an  increase in expense for stock related compensation 
health care costs continued to increase and were up 
although higher health care premiums caused part of the increase  most of it was the result of the farmers acquisition 
at the end of  the corporation replaced its traditional health care plan for most employees with a point of service plan 
this is expected to both control future expense increases and provide a greater choice of benefits to employees 
retirement benefits increased because of higher pension costs and greater participation by employees in the corporation s k plan 
new branches in growing areas and the inclusion of farmers in expense created a increase in occupancy expense in  which was greater than the increase in expense in equipment expense increased in and in as the corporation was able to absorb most of the extra processing from the farmers acquisition with existing equipment 
in updating its branch automation system  the corporation is currently installing the next generation of computer equipment 
this update will permit the corporation to continue offering customers sophisticated financial services at a low cost 
fdic insurance expense declined million or as the bank insurance fund bif became fully funded at mid year and premiums for the second half of the year were curtailed drastically 
this expense should decline an additional million in since the premium has been virtually eliminated 
congress is currently debating proposed legislation to recapitalize the savings association insurance fund saif for savings and loan deposits 
since first virginia purchased several branches from savings and loan institutions over the past years  it may be subject to a special one time assessment to recapitalize the saif fund in if the legislation passes 
as currently proposed  this would be approximately million  but it would potentially reduce first virginia s annual assessment by an additional  other operating expenses increased million in after declining in the primary cause was a million increase in the amortization of goodwill and core deposit premiums paid in connection with the acquisition of farmers  fnb financial and citizens federal savings bank branches 
foreclosed property expense increased slightly in after declining in  but it was under  in each year 
most other categories of expense increases reflected the general rate of inflation and the acquisition of farmers national 
provision for income taxes income tax expense increased million in  slightly greater than the increase in pretax income due to increases in state income taxes and nondeductible goodwill expense 
farmers national bancorp operates in maryland and is subject to a maryland state income tax of 
the majority of the corporation s other banking activities are in virginia  which does not have an income tax on banks 
the corporation s effective tax rate increased to in  primarily the result of the increases in state income taxes and nondeductible goodwill expense 
the effective tax rate in increased 
to because of a decline in the proportion of nontaxable interest income received from municipal securities 
since  various changes in tax laws have reduced the availability and attractiveness of tax exempt securities for banks  and the corporation has not been able to replace maturing tax exempt securities 
balance sheet the corporation s primary use of funds is to support the lending activities that generate the greatest amount of its income 
the corporation s objective is to invest of its total deposits in loans 
loan volume weakened in after strong activity in outstanding loans at the end of were up only compared to the end of  however  average loans increased in because s strong growth carried forward into the acquisition of farmers national also contributed to the increase in average loans 
average loans had been up in compared to because of very strong loan demand in the weaker loan growth  coupled with the growth and acquisition of deposits from a thrift in the third quarter  resulted in a small expansion in the loan to deposit ratio from in to in the loan growth was funded primarily through growth in deposits  and in a lesser amount  from maturing investments  while most of s loan growth was funded through maturing investments 
total assets increased to billion  a growth of over s assets of billion  due in large measure to the purchase of million in deposits from citizens federal savings bank 
in  total assets grew with the acquisition of farmers national bancorp and fnb financial corporation  which added approximately million in assets

overnight investments loans loans increased at a modest rate in after strong growth in the national decline in automobile sales affected first virginia s production of indirect automobile loans  causing it to decline in after advancing or more for each of the three previous years 
the corporation opened its first loan production office in with very successful results 
it expanded its loan production into new areas in  including additional offices in north carolina  tennessee and south carolina  and it intends to continue expanding this activity in the future 
first virginia has approximately of its loan portfolio in automobile related loans and is a full service provider of financial services to automobile dealerships 
in fact  most of this portfolio consists of loans originated by automobile dealerships to consumers purchasing new and used vehicles 
first virginia concentrates on the highest quality of automobile loans  primarily a and b credits  for new cars with a maximum life of five years 
there is an approximately equal distribution between domestic and foreign automobiles in the portfolio and there is no concentration in any particular make of car 
the corporation also makes loans directly to dealers to finance their sales inventory called floor plan loans  which are fully secured by specific automobiles 
average floor plan loans in increased and totaled million at the end of the year 
in addition  loans are made to dealers to finance their show rooms and real estate facilities 
during  a leasing product was introduced that is sold through the dealers 
it provides a financing alternative for consumers and gives the dealers another opportunity to make a sale 
first virginia is committed to the automobile market  regardless of the economic cycle  and it devotes its primary lending resources to this area 
home equity lending is the second most important source of loans for first virginia and comprises approximately of the loan portfolio 
these loans are originated through the banks branches and through a home equity mortgage loan company in areas outside the corporation s banking markets 
after advancing in  outstanding home equity loans declined in as new loan production dropped over from s record production 
the weakening in the economy and the concern over employment prospects  particularly in the corporation s primary markets in the washington  dc  metropolitan area  reduced consumers willingness to use their home equity in making significant financial commitments 
first virginia also pursues the highest quality home equity loans with high underwriting standards 
this has enabled the corporation to show minimal bad debt losses 
for example  the corporation typically requires a maximum loan to equity ratio of no more than and does not take a second mortgage behind a jumbo first mortgage in order to reduce its risk in foreclosure 
residential real estate loans declined in  after advancing in  as interest rates dropped to levels the corporation did not feel warranted the long term interest rate risk 
the corporation generally limits the term of loans it will accept for its own portfolio to year  fixed rate mortgage loans or longer term loans with rates that adjust every three to five years 
the corporation generally does not invest in adjustable rate mortgages because of the substantial prepayment risk and low initial rates generally associated with such loans 
revolving credit loans  including credit cards  continued to grow rapidly 
ln  they increased following a rise in first virginia has generally not aggressively promoted its cards through initial low teaser rates but has  instead  offered one of the best low fixed rate  no annual fee card products in its market 
this has resulted in a more stable cardholder base and an increased penetration rate in acquiring new accounts 
the corporation limits its solicitation efforts primarily to the geographic area of its member banks 
commercial loans grew on average by in the acquisition of farmers  a more commercially oriented lender  was a primary cause for the increase 
total loans were up only from the end of to the end of in average commercial loans grew 
floor plan loans to automobile dealers comprise of commercial loans at year end 
these loans are made to the highest quality automobile dealers and are subject to periodic inventory audits and at least an annual financial review 
the corporation s other major commercial lending areas include loans to government contractors  secured by receivables from the us government  and church and country club loans 
other commercial loan activity was modest in both and because of increased competition for attractive commercial loans 
real estate development and construction loans declined in after a increase in because several projects were successfully completed 
these loans comprise less than of the total loan portfolio and are primarily made to established developers on residential properties with strong sales 
commercial mortgage loans increased and are composed almost entirely of owner use properties carrying floating or adjustable interest rates 
in  commercial real estate loans rose with the acquisition of farmers national bancorp  an active lender in commercial properties

investment securities the investment portfolio declined on average by in  despite the acquisition of farmers national  because of the growth in the loan portfolio 
by mid year  however  deposit growth was sufficient and loan volume had moderated to allow a renewed expansion in the portfolio 
in  the investment portfolio declined as it was permitted to mature without reinvestment to fund loan growth 
the corporation places primary importance on safety and liquidity in the investment portfolio 
accordingly  most of the portfolio is invested in us government and agency securities with a maximum life of five years 
at the end of and  the average life of the portfolio was just under two years 
at december   us government and agency securities comprised of the securities portfolio 
this percentage has been gradually increasing since when changes in federal income tax laws reduced the tax benefits derived by banks in investments in municipal securities 
the limited availability of bank qualified municipal securities and the reduction in yield caused by the loss of tax benefits has generally made municipal securities less attractive to the corporation 
first virginia has generally limited its investments in municipal securities to publicly issued municipal securities with a rating of a or better or to unrated  general obligation municipal securities of municipalities in its market areas with which it is familiar 
the corporation generally does not invest in mortgage backed securities or collateralized mortgage obligations because of their unpredictable cash flows and maturities and the corporation s own emphasis on liquidity 
it does not invest in structured notes or other types of derivative securities and has constructed its portfolio in a laddered approach so an approximately equal amount matures each month 
during  the corporation adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
the corporation has classified virtually of its investment portfolio as held to maturity 
it intends to hold its securities until their stated maturity and has the ability to do so 
at the end of  approximately million in securities were reclassified out of the held to maturity portfolio and into the available for sale portfolio as permitted by a transition provision of sfas no 
this was done to utilize some capital loss carry forwards and some changes in maryland state income tax laws 
the reclassification is not a change in the corporation s policy to hold all of its securities to maturity  however  it is the intention of the corporation to sell these securities during to take full advantage of available tax incentives 
with the reclassification of securities to the available for sale category  shareholders equity has been increased by million in recognition of the change in market value of this component of the portfolio 
overnight investments overnight investments  consisting primarily of federal funds sold and securities repurchase agreements are generally governed by the size of normally anticipated deposit swings and loan demand 
in addition  the amount of customer repurchase agreements is generally covered by investments in overnight securities 
in  overnight investments declined as the corporation utilized some of the liquidity in this asset to temporarily fund loan growth 
ln  average overnight investments increased to a more normal level of million 
deposits deposit growth continued to be sluggish in as the competition for funds from other banks remained high 
higher commercial loan activity by other banks increased demand for funds and kept interest rates on most deposit products relatively high  particularly compared to the decline in rates on loans and investment securities 
the stock market also experienced a big increase in  creating strong consumer demand for mutual funds and placing further pressure on deposit growth 
overall  average deposits increased in compared to a growth in  however  almost all of the growth was a result of the purchase of farmers national and the deposits from citizens federal savings bank 
the corporation s extensive branch system has enabled it to acquire low cost consumer core deposits through its convenient neighborhood locations 
in and  there was a large shift by consumers out of higher cost certificates of deposit and into lower cost money market and savings accounts 
from to its peak in  savings accounts increased million to billion 
they began falling in and as interest rates declined and certificates of deposit became relatively more attractive 
in average savings accounts declined to billion 
similarly  insured money market accounts  which peaked in early  declined from to this shifting will probably continue into as some of this money migrates back to higher yielding certificates of deposit 
average demand deposits grew  after growing in most of this growth came from the acquisition of farmers national as actual balances at the end of were virtually unchanged from the end of interest checking accounts grew at a slower pace of in the corporation obtains a higher proportion of its deposits from these sources than most other banks  with demand accounts equaling of deposits and interest checking  an additional 
average deposits pie chart millions of dollars noninterest bearing   interest checking    savings    money market consumer cds    large denomination cds consumer certificates of deposit increased in after declining slightly in the two previous years as customers switched out of savings and money market accounts 
the shorter maturity certificates still remain the most popular  with those maturing between to months receiving the most growth 
the yield curve was fairly flat throughout  so shorter term certificates were attractively priced compared to longer term certificates 
large denomination certificates of deposit increased to million  following a increase in these deposits are mostly from high net worth consumers and not from purchased sources as the corporation does not aggressively pursue deposits from jumbo sources 
these deposits generally bear the same or lower rate than the corporation s smaller denomination consumer certificates 
the corporation does not purchase brokered deposits nor does it solicit deposits outside of its primary market areas

nevertheless  this level of capital exceeds the regulatory minimum of by over three times and gives the corporation considerable capital for growth and safety 
each of the corporation s individual banks maintains capital ratios well in excess of regulatory minimums  and all qualify as well capitalized banks  allowing them the lowest fdic premium rate and freedom to operate without restrictions from regulatory bodies

first virginia and its subsidiary banks are required to comply with capital adequacy standards established by the federal reserve and the fdic 
the corporation exceeded the additional regulatory risk based capital requirements by wide margins  due in part to the high level of capital and in part to the conservative nature of the corporation s assets 
the tier risk based capital ratio increased basis points to during  and the tier or total risk based capital ratio advanced basis points to 
regulatory minimums of and  respectively  are exceeded by substantial margins 
asset quality the corporation has a number of policies to ensure that lending and investment activities expose the bank to a minimum of risk while producing a profit consistent with the exposure to risk 
these policies are reviewed constantly by the corporation s senior management  and each member bank s internal loan monitoring system provides a detailed monthly report of production  delinquencies  and nonperforming and potential problem loans 
this careful monitoring has resulted in a consistent record of low delinquencies and charge offs as well as few non performing loans in relation to the entire loan portfolio 
the corporation has no foreign or highly leveraged transaction loans  and loans are only made within the trade areas of the member banks or in adjacent states where the corporation maintains loan production offices generating high quality consumer installment loans 
loans are generally not participated with or purchased from banks outside of the first virginia system 
in addition  participations between banks within the first virginia system must first be participated with the corporation s lead bank where a second comprehensive loan review process is performed 
approximately of the corporation s loans are made to consumers and are normally secured by personal or real property 
first virginia has no significant concentrations of credit to a single industry or borrower and its loans are spread throughout its market area 
the corporation s legal lending limit to any one borrower is approximately million  however  it generally limits its loans to any one borrower and related interests to million 
in special cases  the corporation may exceed its internal guideline from time to time 
one of the corporation s specialty loan areas is the automobile finance area  and loans are made to consumers both directly in the branches of the member banks and indirectly through automobile dealerships 
roughly of the total loan portfolio is comprised of consumer automobile loans  but because the loan amounts are relatively small and spread across many individual borrowers  the risk of any major charge offs is minimized 
the automobile loans produced by the corporation consist primarily of the highest quality loans  commonly referred to in the industry as a and b quality loans 
these loans contain substantially less risk characteristics than lower quality c and d subprime loans and have lower delinquency  charge off and collection costs 
during periods of economic weakness  the subprime loan categories generate very high delinquencies and charge offs 
however  the high quality loans the corporation specializes in experience only modestly higher delinquencies and charge offs in recessions compared to periods of strong economic growth 
the corporation also makes loans directly to high quality automobile dealers to finance their inventories  and it has never experienced any losses in this area 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets increased million to million after declining steadily in each of the preceding four years 
nonperforming assets were 
as a percentage of total loans plus nonperforming assets  up slightly from the

foreclosed properties declined in as a number of properties were sold 
in  foreclosed properties had increased due entirely to the acquisition of farmers national bancorp and would have declined excluding properties acquired from the merger with farmers 
the corporation had no foreclosed commercial real estate in the washington  dc  area market 
the table below shows the total of nonperforming loans at the end of the past five years 
experience has shown that actual losses on nonperforming assets are only a small percentage of such assets

loans past due days or more totaled million at the end of  an increase of compared to  however  this represented only 
of outstanding loans  which was up slightly compared to the prior year s  but was significantly below historic and national averages 
no particular loan or category of loans accounted for the increase 
loans past due over days increased basis points over to 
of outstanding loans and have been slowly increasing throughout all categories of loans have participated in this increase  and it reflects the gradual weakening of the economy 
these levels are still significantly below industry averages and reflect the high overall quality of the corporation s loan portfolio 
a loan generally is classified as nonaccrual when full collectibility of principal or interest is in doubt  when repossession  foreclosure or bankruptcy proceedings are initiated  or when other legal actions are taken 
in the case of installment loans  a loan is placed in nonaccrual if payments are delinquent days  and for other loans after payments are delinquent for days 
credit card loans are charged off if they are days past due 
if collateral on a loan is sufficient to insure full collection of principal and interest  an exception to the general policy might be made 
loans may also be placed in a nonaccruing status at any time prior to that indicated above if the corporation anticipates that interest or principal will not be collected

management s methodology in determining the adequacy of the allowance considers specific credit reviews  past loan loss experience  current economic conditions and trends  and the growth and composition of the loan portfolio 
every commercial loan is reviewed and rated at least annually  and trends in the total portfolio are examined for potential deterioration in overall quality 
the corporation has reduced the allowance steadily over the past several years from a high of in to at the end of a basis point decline from the end of this reduction reflects the improvement in the corporation s net charge off rate from 
in to 
in and declines in nonperforming assets and delinquencies 
the quality of the corporation s loan portfolio has improved over the past ten years as it has stressed higher quality automobile and home equity loans 
the allowance covered net charge offs times at the end of and amounted to of nonperforming loans 
most of the corporations loans are small  homogeneous loans to consumers with regular monthly repayment schedules  and accordingly  none of the allowance has been allocated to specific credits 
the corporation constantly monitors the level of the allowance considering its long term experience and short term individual requirements 
the allowance is charged when management determines that the prospect of recovery of the principal of a loan has significantly diminished 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
if asset quality and loan charge offs remain at the current low levels  the corporation intends to maintain an allowance for loan losses in the to range 
management believes the allowance is adequate to absorb any potential unidentified losses 
after improving in and to historic low amounts  net charge offs increased in however  the net charge off rate was only 
of loans  below the corporation s ten year average of  and lower than industry averages 
all categories of gross charge offs increased by double digits  with the largest component of charge offs comprised of credit card loans 
net charge offs of credit card loans increased basis points to  caused by a large increase in the number of bankruptcies  as the economy softens and bankruptcy becomes an easier option for many consumers 
nevertheless  the corporation s charge off ratio for credit cards is significantly below those for most banks  as it generally pursues only customers within its banks trade areas and does not solicit accounts on a nationwide basis 
net charge offs in the corporation s two largest lending areas indirect automobile and home equity loans increased in to 
and  respectively  but are still extremely low by any standard 
delinquencies have increased slightly  but the overall credit quality of the portfolios is so high and the volume of problem credit so low that virtually any increase in net charge offs or delinquencies would result in a large percentage increase in these ratios

liquidity and sensitivity to interest rates the primary functions of asset liability management are to ensure adequate liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities 
liquidity management involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of the corporation s loan and deposit customers 
interest rate sensitivity management seeks to avoid fluctuating net interest margins and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates 
the corporation does not hedge its position with swaps  options or futures but instead maintains a highly liquid and short term position in all of its earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in order to meet its liquidity needs  the corporation schedules the maturity of its investment securities so that approximately an equal amount will mature each month 
the weighted average life of the securities portfolio at the end of and was just under months 
because the corporation views its securities portfolio primarily as a source of liquidity and safety  it does not necessarily react to changes in the yield curve in an attempt to enhance its yield 
accordingly  the average life of the portfolio does not change much as the corporation maintains a constant approach to its portfolio and invests primarily in us government and agency securities with a life no greater than five years 
municipal securities are also generally limited to lives of no more than five years but due to availability and other factors are occasionally purchased in serial issues with longer lives 
the maturity ranges of the securities and the average taxable equivalent yields as of december   are shown in the following table

 after ten years   total    weighted average maturity months months a cash reserve consisting primarily of overnight investments is also maintained by the parent company to meet any contingencies and to provide additional capital  if needed  to the member banks 
most of the corporation s loans are fixed rate installment loans to consumers and mortgage loans with maturities longer than the deposits by which they are funded 
a degree of interest rate risk is incurred if the interest rate on deposits should rise before the loans mature 
however  the substantial liquidity provided by the monthly repayments on these loans can be reinvested at higher rates that largely reduce the interest rate risk 
home equity lines of credit have adjustable rates that are tied to the prime rate 
many of the loans not in the installment or mortgage categories have maturities of less than one year or have floating rates that may be adjusted periodically to reflect current market rates 
these loans are summarized in the following table

   total    first virginia s asset liability committee is responsible for reviewing the corporation s liquidity requirements and maximizing the corporation s net interest income consistent with capital requirements  liquidity  interest rate and economic outlooks  competitive factors and customer needs 
liquidity requirements are reviewed in detail for each of the corporation s individual banks  however  overall asset liability management is performed on a consolidated basis in order to achieve a consistent and coordinated approach 
one of the tools the corporation uses to determine its interest rate risk is gap analysis 
gap analysis attempts to examine the volume of interest rate sensitive assets minus interest rate sensitive liabilities 
the difference between the two is the interest sensitivity gap  and it indicates how future changes in interest rates may affect net interest income 
regardless of whether interest rates are expected to increase or fall  the objective is to maintain a gap position that will minimize any changes in net interest income 
a negative gap exists when the corporation has more interest sensitive liabilities maturing within a certain time period than interest sensitive assets 
under this scenario  if interest rates were to increase it would tend to reduce net interest income 
at december  the corporation had a negative interest rate gap in the short term under six months of approximately of earning assets  which reduced to in months 
technically  the corporation may reprice interest checking  savings and insured money markets at any time and  accordingly  they have been classified in the day sensitivity category in the accompanying table 
while these accounts have in the last two years been somewhat more subject to repricing than in prior years  the degree and frequency of movement is limited  and they are much less sensitive than contractually possible

first virginia does not simply manage its interest rate risk with static maturity and repricing reports 
it also uses a dynamic modeling process that projects the impact of different interest rate  loan and deposit growth scenarios over a month period 
a large part of first virginia s loans and deposits comes from its retail base  and they do not automatically reprice on a contractual basis in reaction to changes in interest rate levels 
accordingly first virginia has not experienced the earnings volatility its interest sensitive gap position indicates it might 
due to the relatively larger proportion of lower cost core deposits  such as demand  interest checking  savings  and insured money market accounts  the corporation will tend to do better in a higher interest rate environment than a low one since these deposits can be invested in higher yielding loans and investments 
however  the corporation historically has been able to maintain a net interest margin in excess of every year since  regardless of whether rates were high or low  and has been able to maintain adequate liquidity to provide for changes in interest rates and in loan and deposit demands 
quarterly results the results of operations for the first three quarters of have been analyzed in quarterly reports to shareholders 
the results of operations for each of the quarters during the two years ended december   are summarized in the table on pages and the results of operations for the fourth quarter are highlighted below 
net income during the fourth quarter of was million  a decline compared to the million earned in the fourth quarter of and down compared to the million earned in the third quarter of earnings per share of 
per share declined at a greater rate of  compared to the 
earned in the fourth quarter of  because of the higher number of shares outstanding in  a result of the farmers national bancorp acquisition at the end of in connection with the acquisition of this million asset bank holding company  million shares of stock were issued and cash of million was paid 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and  accordingly  did not have a material effect on income 
the rate of growth in loans increased at the end of the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter with loans growing at an annualized rate of to billion 
average loans increased compared to the prior year s fourth quarter with the inclusion of farmers national loans in the net interest margin declined basis points to compared to the fourth quarter of  which included the recovery of interest on a loan that had been in a nonaccruing status 
the margin was down basis points compared to the third quarter as the yield on earning assets increased at a slower pace than the cost of funds 
competition for deposits was strong throughout in the corporation s market area 
while deposit rates began to drop more rapidly in the fourth quarter  they were still declining at a slower pace than the yields on new loans and investments 
noninterest income increased compared to the prior year s fourth quarter due  in part  to an increase in service charge income from the increased level of deposits from the acquisition of farmers national and from normal deposit growth 
fee income from mortgage origination activities increased compared to the third quarter as lower interest rates prompted consumers to refinance real estate loans 
trust income increased compared to the fourth quarter of because of increased personal trust business 
other income also benefitted in from the introduction of an automobile leasing program and a real property title insurance agency business 
noninterest expense increased compared to the third quarter  which had been low due to a rebate of fdic premiums of million 
noninterest expense in the fourth quarter increased compared to the prior year s fourth quarter  primarily due to the acquisition of farmers national 
excluding farmers national related expenses  which were not included in fourth quarter expenses  a reduction in fdic insurance and nominal growth in other noninterest expenses caused an actual decline in noninterest expense 
nonperforming assets increased million to million compared to the prior year s fourth quarter 
this represented 
of outstanding loans compared to 
at the end of and was relatively unchanged from the 
at the end of the third quarter 
net charge offs increased slightly compared to the third quarter and represented 
of outstanding loans 
the provision for loan losses during the fourth quarter was million compared to million in the third quarter and million in the fourth quarter of it was up primarily because of the increase in outstanding loans
