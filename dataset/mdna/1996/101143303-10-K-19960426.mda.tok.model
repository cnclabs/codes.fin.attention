future operating results and risk factors the reader should consider the following important factors  among others  which in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  the company s actual results in future quarters and fiscal years to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company 
historically  the company has operated with minimal backlog  however  at march   backlog is  up from  at march  although this backlog increase has provided greater visibility for near term revenues  revenues earned in any quarter will continue to be largely dependent on orders booked  built  and shipped in that quarter 
the company has also experienced a pattern of recording the majority of its quarterly revenues in the third month of the quarter 
historically  a substantial portion of the company s revenues have been attributed to a limited number of customers in north america  bell atlantic in particular 
the company also has a high average system revenue per transaction therefore  the loss of any one customer  or a significant decline in their volume  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and its results of operations 
although north american revenue was significantly lower during fiscal versus fiscal  increased international business mitigated any adverse effect 
the company s ability to increase future revenues may depend on its ability to generate sufficient revenues to substitute for reduced purchases by one or more major customers 
in addition  the company s operating expenses are incurred ratably throughout each quarter and are relatively fixed in the short term 
as a result  if projected revenues are not realized in the expected period  the company s operating results for that period could be adversely affected 
the company s revenue stream depends on its ability to enhance its existing software products and to introduce new products on a timely and cost effective basis 
this includes any customer required custom software enhancements required in the normal course of product delivery 
if the company were to delay the introduction of new products  or to delay the delivery of specific custom software enhancements  the company s operating results could be adversely affected 
the international portion of the company s business  which represented of fiscal revenues  is subject to a number of inherent risks  including difficulties in building and managing international operations and international reseller networks  international service and support of the company s products  difficulties or delays in translating products into foreign languages  fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies  import export duties and quotas  and unexpected regulatory  economic or political changes in international markets 
due to the competitive environment in the international marketplace  certain international customers may require longer payment terms  as a result  days sales outstanding may periodically extend beyond ninety days on amounts due from these customers 
as a result of the increase in international business  the company s revenues may increasingly be denominated in foreign currencies 
to date  foreign currency fluctuations have not had a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
while the company has periodically engaged in hedging transactions to cover its currency translation exposure  the increase in international business may require the company to engage in these types of transactions more frequently to mitigate the effect of foreign currency fluctuations 
the company sells substantially all of its product to companies in the telecommunication industry 
this industry is undergoing significant change as a result of the recent passage of the telecommunications bill  reducing restrictions on competition within the industry 
the enhanced services systems industry is already highly competitive and the company expects competition to intensify 
competition for the sale of enhanced services systems to network operators is based principally on capacity  high reliability and ability to provide multiple applications platforms integrated with telecommunications networks 
the company believes that it will continue to encounter substantial competition from its existing competitors  and that other companies  many with considerably greater financial  technical  marketing and sales resources than boston technology  may enter the enhanced services systems markets 
also  sudden or unforseen changes in the regulatory environment may have an impact on the company s revenues and or costs in any given part of the world 
certain components of the company s products are currently purchased from a single source and  although the company believes that alternate sources are available  any interruption in the supply of such components could adversely affect the company s operating results 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased by  or  from january  levels to  at january  the decrease is due primarily to the repurchase of  shares of the company s common stock for  also during fiscal  the company invested  in a joint venture in brazil see note

accounts receivable increased  over fiscal to  as of january  this increase had three major components 
the first component was approximately  due from contracts for custom modification and enhancement activities 
the second component was approximately  due from certain international accounts as a result of extended payment terms 
the third component was approximately  due to incremental sales made to customers in north america 
due to the competitive environment in the international marketplace  certain international customers may require longer payment terms  as a result  days sales outstanding may periodically extend beyond ninety days on amounts due from these customers 
inventories at january    and were   and  respectively 
the increase in inventories at january  was due primarily to the transition from the co access platform to the access np network services platform  as additional inventories were necessary to support the introduction of access np platforms while also maintaining adequate support for the co access customer base 
the increase in inventories at january  was required to support ongoing customer trials  higher planned revenues  and the new access np platform introduction 
the company s investment in sales type leases was  as of january   a decrease of  versus january  due primarily to scheduled customer payments 
the company s investment in sales type leases was  as of january   an increase of  over fiscal in fiscal  approximately  of sales type lease receivables were originated with international customers while approximately  of sales type lease receivables were sold with recourse or collected

management believes that capital expenditures for fiscal will approximate fiscal levels and will continue to be concentrated in the areas of research and development and computer equipment 
cash flow used by financing activities was  as compared to cash flow from financing activities of  and  in fiscal years and  respectively 
the decrease in cash flow was due primarily to the repurchase during fiscal of  shares of common stock at an average price of per share 
in fiscal and  cash flows consisted primarily of proceeds from the purchase of common stock through the exercise of stock options and through the company s employee stock purchase plan 
the company maintains a  revolving credit facility with two banks 
borrowings are collateralized by the company s accounts receivable and inventories and bear interest at the prime rate 
the credit facility is scheduled to expire on july  this revolving credit facility also has a of annual commitment fee on the unused portion 
the facility contains quarterly covenants which  among other things  require the company to maintain certain financial ratios  specified levels of equity  and other restrictions 
the company also has available an aggregate  uncollateralized line of credit for forward foreign exchange contracts with two banks 
these lines of credit are scheduled to expire on july  the company believes that its cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  along with cash generated from operations and unused credit facilities will be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements and to fund operations at least through january  the financial accounting standards board recently issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas 
under fas the company is required to elect either expense recognition or the disclosure only alternative for stock based employee compensation

the company has determined that it will elect the disclosure only alternative 
the company will be required to disclose the pro forma income or loss and the per share amounts in the notes to the financial statements using the fair value based method 
the company has not determined the impact of these pro forma adjustments
