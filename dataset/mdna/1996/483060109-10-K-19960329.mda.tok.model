the improvement in engineering and construction operations was partially due to a major transit project in the philippines  operating revenue of which had been previously deferred 
other improvements in engineering and construction operations were due to substantial growth in the group s industrial sector and a reduction in the group s overhead

chm hill 
an additional million increase in operating income resulted from the company s operations at doe s hanford  washington site hanford 
the results reflect higher award fees earned 
a million decline in the company s operating income from other environmental work excluding the rocky flats and hanford contracts partially offset the improvements in operating income discussed above between the ten month periods ended december  and this decrease in other environmental operations was primarily due to a decline in operating income from private sector environmental work  increases in bidding and proposal efforts required by large scale us department of defense dod and doe contracts  and temporary delays in federal environmental projects due to federal government budgetary uncertainties 
the company s consulting operations also experienced a decline in operating revenues between the ten month periods ended december  and  resulting in a million decrease in operating income for this group 
the decrease was caused by a delay in task order assignments under new contract awards and a significant increase in levels of business development activity 
the federal government s fiscal budget was not finalized during the ten months ended december   which led to the federal government operating under a continuing resolution including two no work furlough periods since october  while under this resolution  the assignment of work under task order contracts has been delayed 
a significant company wide increase in marketing efforts further negatively impacted operating results for the ten months ended december  as compared to the ten months ended december  these efforts were in addition to the marketing activities discussed above within the environmental and consulting operations 
management believes that icf kaiser s increased efforts in its business development activities should result in additional contract awards in both the public and private sectors of its business 
icf kaiser international  inc report on form k for the ten months ended december  page outlook the company s contract backlog increased significantly to billion at december  compared to billion at february  the increase in backlog primarily resulted from the april award of the rocky flats contract  which added billion to contract backlog

the response to doe s request for proposals is due in march doe has indicated that it would like the new contract to be in place in october the company s existing contract to perform services at hanford terminates in march it is expected that two other teams also will bid on the new contract  one of those teams already has been announced and includes westinghouse hanford company the incumbent management and operations contractor at the site 
if the company is unsuccessful in its bidding efforts on the new hanford contract  the impact on icf kaiser s operating income after could be significant 
with the award of the rocky flats contract and the company s continued work at hanford  icf kaiser is now actively participating in two of doe s major environmental cleanup efforts and at seven of doe s other former weapons facilities 
icf kaiser recently expanded its environmental cleanup contract base with dod with the award of the usace baltimore terc and usace savannah contracts discussed above 
the company expects that the experience and reputation it earns under these contracts will continue to enhance its position as a major participant in the field of environmental cleanup and large program management 
the company plans to continue its increased level of business development activity in the consulting group and expects that such activity will result in expanded public and private sector consulting services

icf kaiser international  inc report on form k for the ten months ended december  page results of operations the following table summarizes key elements in the consolidated statements of operations for the ten months ended december  and december  unaudited  and the years ended february  and dollars in millions 
ten months ended year ended december  february  gross revenue service revenue service revenue as a percentage of gross revenue operating expenses as a percentage of service revenue direct cost of services and overhead administrative and general depreciation and amortization unusual items  net operating income loss as a percentage of service revenue gross revenue represents services provided to customers with whom the company has a primary contractual relationship 
included in gross revenue are costs of services subcontracted to third parties and other reimbursable direct project costs  such as materials procured by the company on behalf of its customers 
service revenue is derived by deducting the costs of subcontracted services and direct project costs from gross revenue and adding the company s share of the income of unconsolidated joint ventures and affiliated companies 
icf kaiser believes that it is appropriate to analyze operating margins and other ratios in relation to service revenue because such revenue and ratios reflect the work performed directly by the company 
operating profits fees generated by the hanford and rocky flats contracts are based on performance and not revenue 
a change in revenue between periods is likely to be disproportionate to the change in the fees 
consequently  changes in revenue may have an exaggerated impact on the company s margins as measured on a percentage basis 
in addition  because kaiser hill is a consolidated subsidiary of icf kaiser  the operating income includes the portion of income generated under the rocky flats contract attributable to chm hill 
chm hill s interest in kaiser hill is reflected as a minority interest in icf kaiser s financial statements see note b to the consolidated financial statements 
ten months ended december  versus ten months ended december  revenue gross revenue for the ten months ended december  increased million  or  to million 
the increase in gross revenue was attributable to the commencement of work under the kaiser hill contract which generated million in gross revenue during the current year 
the increase was partially offset by a million reduction in gross revenue under the hanford contract due to federal budget reductions at the hanford site 
this reduced level of hanford activity is expected to continue and may be reduced further during the contract period  however  a reduction in the hanford budget is not currently expected to have a significant impact on operating income due to the nature of the fee structure under this particular doe contract 
service revenue increased by million for the ten month period ended december  as compared to the ten months ended december  the increase was due primarily to million of service revenue icf kaiser international  inc report on form k for the ten months ended december  page generated under the rocky flats contract  offset by a million decrease in service revenue under the hanford contract 
service revenue as a percentage of gross revenue decreased to for the ten months ended december  from for the ten months ended december  as a result of the nature of the rocky flats contract 
a significant portion of the gross revenue derived from the rocky flats contract includes the costs of services subcontracted to third parties 
operating expenses direct cost of services and overhead increased million between the ten month periods ended december  and costs on the new rocky flats contract million were offset by a million reduction in the hanford contract costs attributable to the federal budget reductions discussed above 
the remainder of the company s direct cost of services and overhead as a percentage of service revenue for the ten months ended december  was comparable to the same period in the prior year 
administrative and general expenses increased million  or  between the ten month periods ended december  and and increased from to as a percentage of service revenue 
the increase in these costs is primarily attributable to the company s increased marketing activities  including filling several key marketing positions and incurring relatively high levels of marketing expense associated with proposing and bidding large scale dod and doe contracts 
interest expense icf kaiser s average debt outstanding and average effective interest rate for the ten months ended december  and were as follows 
ten months ended december  december  average debt outstanding   average effective interest rate the average effective interest rate was comparable between the ten month periods ended december  and due to consistent interest rates and indebtedness outstanding between the ten month periods 
the company s principal debt outstanding consists of senior subordinated notes due notes see liquidity and capital resources for further discussion 
income tax expense icf kaiser s income tax provision was million and million for the ten months ended december  and  respectively 
although pretax income for the ten months ended december  was million greater than pretax income for the comparable period ended december   the company s effective tax rate decreased due to a reduction in permanent differences such as the nondeductibility of goodwill as a percentage of pretax income  increased foreign tax benefits  and minority interest earnings of a consolidated subsidiary see note h to the consolidated financial statements 
the ten months ended december  also included a repatriation of overseas funds to the united states which could not then be currently offset by foreign tax credits  resulting in additional income taxes for that period see income tax expense under year ended february  versus year ended february  because of the reported losses for the year ended february   a million valuation allowance was established in that year for deferred tax assets 
although the level of pretax income has increased substantially since that period with a corresponding increase in taxable income  the company has maintained the valuation allowance as of december  at december   the company had deferred tax assets of million related to net operating loss carryforwards  of which million expire in the next five years and million expire in additionally  the company had deferred tax assets of million related to tax credit carryforwards  the majority of icf kaiser international  inc report on form k for the ten months ended december  page which expire in to management believes that the company s expected levels of pretax earnings  when adjusted for nondeductible expenses such as goodwill amortization  will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the million deferred tax asset net within the next five years 
unusual items during the ten months ended december   the company recorded million in additional income net  consisting of the following unusual items income in settlement of litigation against the internal revenue service irs  associated with an affiliate of an acquired company  net of an accrual for related expenses million see liquidity and capital resources  a charge to accrue the net settlement cost and legal expenses of other litigation million  a charge to accrue for severance for the termination of employees in the engineering and international groups million  and a charge to accrue for consolidation of office space million 
management expects that all actions associated with the termination of employees and office space consolidation will be completed by december  year ended february  versus year ended february  revenue gross revenue for the year ended february  increased to million  while service revenue increased to million  versus the year ended february  these increases were attributable to the work performed at hanford million of the gross revenue increase and million of the service revenue increase 
the hanford revenue increases were offset partially by a decrease in the company s engineering and construction revenue million gross revenue and million service revenue 
service revenue as a percentage of gross revenue decreased to for the year ended february   from for the previous year  primarily because under an october amendment to the hanford contract  icf kaiser absorbed tasks utilizing a much higher proportion of subcontractors than company personnel 
operating expenses the company s direct cost of services and overhead was relatively flat as a percentage of service revenue for the year ended february  versus the previous year 
excluding hanford  direct cost of services and overhead decreased to of service revenue for the year ended february  from for the year ended february  administrative and general expense decreased million 
the decrease in these costs is attributable primarily to management cost cutting initiatives 
a restructuring plan initiated during the year ended february  to respond to operating losses included downsizing the work force  consolidating office space  renegotiating significant leases  and restructuring certain international operations 
all actions have been completed  and there is no further liability outstanding as of december  associated with this plan 
interest expense icf kaiser s interest expense net of interest income net interest for the year ended february   increased million from the prior year due to a recapitalization that took place in the fourth quarter of the year ended february  also see liquidity and capital resources 
the increase in net interest was impacted favorably by million in refunds of interest from the irs recorded in the third quarter of the year ended february  associated with the company s tax liabilities and those of an acquired company 
the increase in net interest was offset partially by a reduction in preferred stock dividends 
income tax expense icf kaiser s income tax provision for the year ended february  was million  even though pretax income was million 
this is due to several factors including the deemed dividend from the repatriation of overseas icf kaiser international  inc report on form k for the ten months ended december  page funds to the united states during the year ended february  that currently could not be offset by foreign tax credits and permanent differences  such as the nondeductibility of goodwill amortization 
nondeductible permanent differences comprised a very high percentage of pretax income 
as such  the traditional percentage relationship between income tax expense and pretax income was not meaningful 
liquidity and capital resources during the ten months ended december   cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million 
cash was primarily used in investing and financing activities for acquisitions and investments in joint ventures and affiliates million  purchases of fixed assets million  payments of dividends million  repurchases by the company s insurance subsidiary of a portion of the company s outstanding notes and related warrants million  and payments of other outstanding debt million 
in addition  million was used in operating activities 
an interest payment of million on the company s notes was made in june an additional million interest payment on the notes was due and paid on january  an increase in contract receivables  net between february  and december  was primarily due to million in receivables from the commencement of work by kaiser hill under the rocky flats contract 
an increase in accounts payable  accrued expenses  and accrued salaries and employee benefits was also primarily due to the rocky flats contract which had million of accounts payable  accrued expenses  and accrued salaries and employee benefits as of december  during the year ended february   the us environmental protection agency approved the company s revised provisional billing rates for fiscal years through  thus authorizing the company to submit invoices on cost plus contracts with us government agencies for work performed during these approved years 
the company has collected in excess of million as of december  on these contracts 
the company has a million revolving credit facility the credit facility provided by a consortium of banks the banks 
icf kaiser international  inc and certain of its subsidiaries  which are guarantors of the credit facility  have granted the banks a security interest in their accounts receivable and certain other assets 
the credit facility limits the payment of cash dividends  requires the maintenance of specified financial ratios  and has a million limitation on cash borrowings 
total available credit is determined from a borrowing base calculation based on accounts receivable 
the credit facility was amended in to modify ratios and certain terms 
as of december   the company had million in borrowings outstanding under the credit facility  in addition to million in letters of credit  and the company had million of available credit under the credit facility 
as of february   the company had million of borrowings  excluding letters of credit  outstanding under its credit facility 
the credit facility contains eurodollar and alternate base interest rate alternatives with margins dependent upon the company s financial operating results  and expires on october  kaiser hill has a million receivables purchase facility to support its working capital requirements under the rocky flats contract 
the receivables purchase facility requires kaiser hill to maintain a specified tangible net worth and contains certain default provisions for delinquent receivables 
program fees consist of per annum of the unused portion of the facility and per annum of the used portion of the facility 
the receivables purchase facility is non recourse to kaiser hill s owners  icf kaiser and chm hill  and expires on june  in january  the company issued  of notes and  warrants  each to purchase one share of the company s common stock at per share 
the net proceeds were used  in part  to retire senior subordinated notes and associated warrants  to repurchase preferred stock  and to repay the outstanding balance on the company s then existing revolving credit facility 
the recapitalization resulted in a million extraordinary charge net of tax benefit for the early extinguishment of debt and a million charge to net income available for common shareholders to repurchase redeemable preferred stock 
as noted above  in november  the company s insurance subsidiary repurchased  of the notes and related warrants for million 
in march  the interest rate on the notes was increased by one percent until the company achieves and maintains a specified level of earnings see notes f and i to the consolidated financial statements 
the notes mature on december  with semi annual interest payments 
icf kaiser international  inc report on form k for the ten months ended december  page for the past several years  the company has had ongoing negotiations  filings  and litigation with the irs related to settlement of its tax liabilities and the liabilities associated with affiliates of acquired companies 
as noted in the results of operations  the cash and income impact have generally been favorable to the company 
further  the company s previous tax losses and its resultant net operating loss carryforward position  combined with the effect of tax credit carryovers  should limit federal income tax payments required in the near future 
in one recent tax case  the company prevailed at the trial court level in a tax refund litigation matter against the irs 
as discussed under unusual items under results of operations  the department of justice recently agreed to pay million  net of related expenses  to the company in settlement of this matter 
management believes that current projected levels of cash flows and the availability of financing  including borrowings under the company s credit facility  will be adequate to fund operations throughout the next twelve months 
the company s series d senior preferred stock is subject to mandatory redemption on january  in the amount of million plus accrued dividends 
because of technical limitations on the payment of dividends contained in the indenture governing the company s notes  the company did not pay the november  and february  accrued dividends in the aggregate amount of  until march  following the signing of an amendment to the indenture which permitted the payment of all accrued and future dividends 
as consideration for this amendment  the interest rate on the notes was increased as discussed above 
the company currently intends to use cash generated from operations including cash received from the tax refund litigation discussed in the immediately preceding paragraph to redeem a portion of this preferred stock on or before the redemption date 
to redeem the balance of the preferred stock  the company expects to use funds generated from alternative financing sources 
the company is currently negotiating for replacement or extension of the current credit facility and the possible issuance of new equity 
management received a commitment for a replacement of the company s existing credit facility in march with terms and covenants similar to the existing credit facility 
impact of new accounting standards the financial accounting standards board fasb recently issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  it is the company s current policy to evaluate all long lived assets on a periodic basis for asset impairment 
therefore  upon formal adoption of this statement in  management does not expect that there will be a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or operations 
the fasb also recently issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
 which encourages companies to adopt a fair value method of accounting for employee stock options and similar equity instruments 
the fair value method requires compensation cost to be measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized over the service period 
alternatively  sfas no 
requires the provision of pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if the fair value method had been adopted when the fair value method is not reflected in the financial statements 
the company has not yet determined whether it will adopt a fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation or provide pro forma disclosures 
the impact of the adoption of this statement on the financial statements cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
the requirements of sfas no 
are effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  icf kaiser international  inc report on form k for the ten months ended december  page
