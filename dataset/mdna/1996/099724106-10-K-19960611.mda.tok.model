competition the company competes worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors which produce and sell similar products 
price  quality and technological innovation are the primary elements of competition 
the company s competitors include vertically integrated units of the company s major oem customers  as well as a large number of independent domestic and international suppliers 
many of these companies are larger and have greater resources than the company 
a number of the company s major oem customers manufacture for their own use  products which compete with the company s products 
although these oem customers have indicated that they will continue to rely on outside suppliers  the oems could elect to manufacture powertrain components to meet their own requirements or to compete with the company 
there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates 
the competitive environment has changed dramatically over the past few years as the company s traditional united states oem customers  faced with intense international competition  have expanded their worldwide sourcing of components with the stated objective of better competing with lower cost imports 
as a result  the company has experienced competition from suppliers in other parts of the world enjoying economic advantages such as lower labor costs  lower healthcare costs and  in some cases  export subsidies and or raw materials subsidies 
backlog total backlog at december   was approximately million compared to million at december   all of which is expected to be filled during employees as of december   the company and its consolidated subsidiaries had approximately  salaried and hourly employees as compared with  employees at december   of which approximately  were us employees

the collective bargaining agreement covering the muncie plant expires in march and the collective bargaining agreement covering the ithaca plant expires in october the hourly workers at the company s european facilities are also unionized 
the company believes its present relations with employees to be satisfactory 
raw materials the company believes that its supplies of raw materials for manufacturing requirements in are adequate and are available from multiple sources 
it is common  however  for customers to require their prior approval before certain raw materials or components can be used  thereby reducing sources of supply that would otherwise be available 
manufacturing operations are dependent upon natural gas  fuel oil  propane and electricity 
environmental regulation and proceedings the company s operations are subject to federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations governing  among other things  emissions to air  discharge to waters and the generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of waste and other materials 
the company believes that its business  operations and facilities have been and are being operated in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations  many of which provide for substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations 
however  the operation of automotive parts manufacturing plants entails risks in these areas  and there can be no assurance that the company will not incur material costs or liabilities 
in addition  potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental and health and safety laws  regulations or requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future 
the company believes that the overall impact of compliance with regulations and legislation protecting the environment will not have a material effect on its financial position or future operating results  although no assurance can be given in this regard 
capital expenditures and expenses in attributable to compliance with such legislation were not material 
the company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors  subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the us environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties prps at hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act superfund and equivalent state laws and  as such  may be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial activities at these sites 
responsibility for cleanup and other remedial activities at a superfund site is typically shared among prps based on an allocation formula 
the means of determining allocation among prps is generally set forth in a written agreement entered into by the prps at a particular site 
an allocated share assigned to a prp is often based on the prp s volumetric contribution of waste to a site and the characteristics of the waste material 
based on information available to the company which  in most cases  includes an estimate of allocation of liability among prps  the probability that other prps  many of whom are large  solvent public companies  will fully pay the costs apportioned to them  currently available information from prps and or federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of contamination and estimated remediation costs  estimated legal fees  and other factors  the company has established a reserve for indicated environmental liabilities in the aggregate amount of approximately million at december  the company expects this amount to be expended over the next three to five years 
the company believes that none of these matters  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on its financial position or future operating results  generally either because estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not large or because liability will be shared with other prps  although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter
