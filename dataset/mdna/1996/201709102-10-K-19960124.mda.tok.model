item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations consolidated results continued strength in the us economy and improved business conditions for most of the overseas operations enabled the corporation to achieve record sales and earnings in income from continuing operations of million was percent higher than last year s income of million and was more than double the million reported in included in the results for and are after tax charges of million and million  respectively  to close and consolidate certain operations in europe and the us net income in of million includes a million noncash gain from the reversal of tax accruals no longer required in connection with a discontinued operation 
record sales of million were higher than those in and by percent and percent  respectively  after adjusting for the effects of exchange rate differences on foreign sales reported in us dollars 
most of this improvement resulted from increased volume as price increases have been relatively modest over the three year period 
revenues for the corporation s us operations advanced for the fourth consecutive year to an all time high of million  surpassing those in and by percent and percent  respectively 
domestic sales have increased substantially over this period for the hydraulic and metal product groups while revenues in the fluid purification segment have grown at more moderate rates 
export sales were up percent over last year  reflecting increased shipments to nonaffiliated customers in canada  europe  pacific rim countries and the middle east 
domestic operations accounted for percent of the company s total sales in versus percent in and percent in revenues for the company s overseas operations increased by percent over those in on a parity adjusted basis 
most of the year over year gain occurred in europe  brazil  australia and southeast asia  reflecting increased demand for all of the corporation s product lines serving those regions 
sales growth was less robust in japan and the united kingdom where business conditions were somewhat weaker than in other countries 
item continued consolidated results continued operating income of million was higher than and by percent and percent  respectively  with record earnings being achieved by a number of operating units from all three of the company s major product groups 
operating income for the hydraulic systems group advanced for the fourth consecutive year  while earnings were flat in the metal products segment where significant gains in the domestic metal stamping divisions were negated by a downturn in income for the astron division in europe 
year over year improvements in most of the domestic and foreign operating units enabled the fluid purification group to reach its second highest annual operating income since the acquisition in included in operating income for and are the financial results of the orsta hydraulik operations which were acquired last year 
orsta  a manufacturer of hydraulic cylinders  piston pumps  and gear pumps  consists of sachsenhydraulik chemnitz gmbh shc and its wholly owned subsidiary  hydraulik rochlitz gmbh 
shares of the business were acquired on may  from the truehandanstalt tha  the regulatory agency of the federal republic of germany responsible for the privatization of former east german state owned enterprises 
under terms of the purchase agreement  commercial intertech tendered no financial consideration to acquire the shares of shc but received  in addition to the net assets of the two companies  cash contributions from the tha to fund pre existing capital investment programs and cover estimated operating losses over a period of two years 
the loss indemnification was recorded as a deferred credit negative goodwill and is being amortized to income through cost of sales in accordance with a predetermined schedule which coincides with projected losses in each fiscal quarter over the two year period 
the combined german operations represented by this acquisition incurred an operating loss of million in  after amortization of the deferred credit  on sales of million 
the impact on operating income in was negligible see note k for further details 
item continued industry segments following the acquisition of orsta hydraulik during the latter half of  the corporation announced strategic plans to close certain hydraulic facilities in europe and the united kingdom  phase out some nonperforming products manufactured at those facilities  and consolidate the remaining core businesses with the newly acquired operations in germany and other existing operations located in the united kingdom 
included in cost of sales for are nonrecurring charges of million for the separation of employees  closure of facilities  writedown of unrecoverable fixed assets  and other incremental costs necessary to complete this consolidation effort 
the program is being executed in phases with two out of three segments having been completed during and the final phase now scheduled for completion in early cash consumed thus far totals million  while the remaining accrued liability at the end of amounts to million  principally representing separation costs 
accomplishment of this program is expected to improve the corporation s operating results over time through reduced employment costs  more effective utilization of plant and equipment  and lower depreciation expense 
hydraulic systems the hydraulic systems segment accounted for percent of the company s total sales and percent of total operating income in revenues in this segment increased by million or nearly percent over last year  while operating income as reported was higher by percent 
excluding the nonrecurring charges incurred in  income was flat versus the prior year as profitability was eroded in some of the domestic units by higher material costs  expenses to re engineer manufacturing processes and administrative systems  general manufacturing inefficiencies from operating at capacity levels  and costs incurred to develop and launch a new range of fluid power components for the marine and automotive industries 
financial performance was favorable in the foreign segment during with the exception of operations in germany which incurred a combined loss of million for the year 
assimilation of these recently acquired businesses has been slower than expected  and operating results were further reduced by one time costs incurred for plant rearrangement  relocation of the cylinder operations to a new facility  and installation of equipment for the manufacture and assembly of a new line of piston pumps 
additional programs were initiated during the year to reorganize marketing and administrative functions  rationalize product offerings  and operate the business more efficiently 
the combined results of these efforts are expected to enable the german operations to reach the breakeven point during the latter half of elsewhere  earnings improved dramatically in the united kingdom where the valve manufacturing unit located in grantham achieved record sales and income in results were item continued hydraulic systems continued also significantly better for the corporation s industrial and specialty hydraulic product lines in the united kingdom due  in part  to the benefits derived from consolidating these businesses at the warwick facility 
increased local demand and continued growth in export shipments to the pacific rim enabled our subsidiary in australia to post record sales and income this year 
earnings improved moderately for the brazilian operating unit  but business conditions were adversely affected during the latter part of by government measures to restrict economic growth and slow the rate of inflation 
capital expenditures amounted to million for this segment in versus expenditures of million in and million in included in the total for the current year are expenditures of million for production equipment  facility upgrades  and new building construction at the chemnitz and rochlitz facilities in germany 
funding for most of these projects was provided by the tha in accordance with the terms of the purchase 
the majority of the remaining expenditures in pertains to ongoing equipment purchases in the us to upgrade manufacturing performance  increase production capacity for future growth  and outfit specialized machining cells for the manufacture of new products being introduced by the oildyne division 
also included are expenditures for the construction of a new cylinder manufacturing facility in youngstown  ohio 
incoming orders for the hydraulic systems group held steady in the fourth quarter of but were down percent from the peak levels experienced during the same period last year 
the backlog of unfilled orders to start the new fiscal year was percent higher than last year  after adjusting for foreign currency differences  as surging activity among the overseas units has counteracted a broad slowdown in business for the us operations 
item continued building systems and metal products this segment accounted for percent of the company s total sales and percent of total operating income in revenues for this group were up substantially over and  but operating income was flat over the three year period as progressive improvements in the domestic sector were negated by a decline in overseas income 
sales for the astron division were higher than last year by percent on a parity adjusted basis  but earnings diminished for the third consecutive year due to the combined effects of weak industry prices  rising production costs  and price discounting in selected markets to preserve share and stimulate demand 
operating results were also impacted by costs incurred to establish satellite manufacturing operations in the czech republic and to expand astron s business activities in china  asia  and other parts of eastern europe 
operating income for this division was lower than and by percent and percent  respectively 
astron incurred losses during the first half of but steadily improved upon profitability in the third and fourth quarters as a result of increased selling prices and stabilized material costs 
business conditions were much stronger for the metal stampings operations in the us where sales were higher than those in and by percent and percent  respectively  reflecting strong demand from customers in the transportation equipment and home building industries 
sales were further enhanced by the first quarter acquisition of a small manufacturer of large diameter steel heads located in saginaw  texas 
additionally  record sales were achieved again in by the division s expanding distribution center program where revenue growth has averaged more than percent per annum in each of the three most recent fiscal periods 
operating income for the combined metal stamping operations in the us was higher than and by percent and percent  respectively 
capital expenditures for this segment amounted to million in versus spending of million in and million in nearly two thirds of the current year expenditures pertain to upgraded production equipment  installation of a satellite manufacturing line in the czech republic  and office automation for engineering and administrative functions in the astron division 
the balance of the spending in related to refurbishment of facilities and replacement of production equipment in the us general upgrading of astron s facilities and production capabilities accounts for the majority of the capital expenditures in and item continued building systems and metal products continued incoming orders for domestic operations in the fourth quarter were percent lower than the same period last year  reflecting the general slowing of the us economy 
bookings in the astron division  however  were up percent over those in the final quarter of on a parity adjusted basis 
the backlog of unfilled orders to start the new year is off percent from a year ago in the us  while the astron backlog is higher by percent after adjusting for foreign currency differences 
fluid purification the fluid purification segment accounted for percent of the company s total sales and percent of total operating income in parity adjusted sales for the group were higher than those in and by percent and percent  respectively 
a mild recovery in the chemical and industrial processing industry segment during enabled the process division to achieve moderate sales growth in the us  but business conditions remained sluggish for the consumer product line 
sales for the combined overseas operations were up percent from the previous year on a parity adjusted basis with year over year growth occurring in all of the business units 
strong performances by the overseas units and the consumer division in the us pushed operating income for the group to million in  representing an increase of nearly percent over the previous year 
operating results improved dramatically in the consumer product line due  principally  to higher prices and improved manufacturing efficiency 
disposal of an unprofitable product line late in further enhanced earnings in the current year for this group s us operations 
elsewhere  operating income for cuno europe was the highest in five years as a result of increased demand  concurrent gains in manufacturing efficiencies  and stronger profit margins from changes implemented in marketing and distribution strategies 
in japan  the adverse effects of price discounting to meet competitive challenges in the marketplace were offset by low costs for imported material resulting from continued weakness of the us dollar throughout most of the year 
the brazilian operations were profitable in  but business conditions deteriorated during the latter half of the year as the government instituted fiscal policies designed to restrict the economy and keep local inflation in check 
item continued fluid purification continued capital expenditures amounted to million in versus spending of million in and million in two thirds of the total spending over the three year period pertains to investment in the us for new production equipment  environmental controls million in and million in  advanced testing equipment  and refurbishment of facilities 
capital expenditures in the overseas units during this period primarily consisted of upgraded computer capabilities  replacement of production equipment  facility improvements  and office equipment 
incoming orders in the fourth quarter of were percent higher than the same period last year on a parity adjusted basis 
bookings were stronger in both the domestic and overseas segments 
the backlog of unfilled orders to start the new year was percent higher than last year for the overseas units but was down percent in the us item continued nonoperating income and expense interest received from investments increased from million in to million in due  primarily  to additional interest earned on cash contributions from the tha in connection with last year s acquisition of orsta hydraulik 
investment yields were marginally higher than those in previous periods 
approximately percent of total interest expense incurred on borrowed funds in resulted from long term obligations 
most of the long term interest expense derives from the issuance of million in percent senior notes as part of a capital restructuring program 
remaining interest expense primarily pertains to long term debt to fund major construction projects completed in recent years  some equipment leases  and short term borrowings to support current operations 
recorded as a credit to interest expense in is a million reversal of an unrealized interest obligation accrued in prior years 
effective interest rates paid by the company on long term debt were relatively unchanged over the three year period  while short term rates have fluctuated on an interim basis 
the weighted average rate was about the same over the most recent two year period  but short term rates were generally lower at the end of versus rates which were available earlier in the year 
foreign currency exchange and translation losses principally in brazil are included in other nonoperating expense for the three year period reported herein 
these amounts totaled million in  million in and million in the company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the principal and interest due on loans which are periodically made with foreign subsidiaries 
deferred gains or losses from such hedging activities were negligible at the end of the current fiscal period see note j 
other nonoperating expense for includes a million loss incurred on the fourth quarter sale of the fluid purification group s ultrafiltration product line located in the us included in nonoperating income for  and are million  million and million  respectively  in technology license fees derived from a license agreement entered into with geoyang development co 
ltd 
in under terms of the agreement  geoyang obtained the rights and technology necessary to design  engineer  manufacture  market and assemble astron s integrated metal building systems in korea 
commercial intertech will also receive royalties and fees on buildings manufactured and sold by geoyang in future periods 
item continued taxes the company s effective tax rate was reduced to percent in and percent in primarily as the result of utilizing tax loss carryforwards acquired with the orsta business in to shelter earnings of the company s other german operations  including those of an astron subsidiary 
remaining orsta net operating losses of approximately million  which may be carried forward indefinitely  are expected to provide tax relief on income earned by all operations in germany for a number of years 
effective rates for the most recent two year period were also reduced by the favorable tax impact of reserve contracts and tax law changes which lowered the statutory rate for two overseas subsidiaries 
partially offsetting these benefits were higher tax rates for some of the overseas operations  the tax consequences of repatriating foreign earnings  state and local taxes levied on domestic income  and nondeductible expense for goodwill acquired in purchase transactions prior to july  the consolidated tax rate in was percent as a result of favorable conclusions to a number of open tax issues and the settlement of a dispute with one foreign tax authority over deductibility of certain expenses

this new accounting standard requires accrual accounting for workers compensation  disability  health insurance continuation  severance pay and other postemployment benefits provided to former or inactive employees when such benefits are attributable to service rendered by the employee  the obligation vests or accumulates  and payment of the obligation is probable 
the effect of adopting sfas no 
was immaterial to the financial statements as the company was already accounting for such costs on an accrual basis 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is generally defined as the ability to generate cash  by whatever means available  to satisfy the short and long term needs of the company 
with respect to cash flow in  the balance of cash and cash equivalents decreased from million at the end of to a total of million at the end of the current period a difference of million 
a significant portion of this change in cash position is attributable to the orsta acquisition which was completed last year 
under terms of the purchase agreement  commercial intertech received cash contributions from the tha and other german regulatory agencies in the form of bank deposits  installment payments  and investment grants and subsidies to cover operating losses for a period of two years and fund pre existing capital expenditure programs of the acquired businesses in chemnitz and rochlitz see note k 
contributions received since the acquisition date in accordance with the agreement have amounted to million  while cash consumed for operating requirements inclusive of working capital needs and capital investments has amounted to million and million  respectively 
the timing of the related receipts and disbursements over the two year period has been such  however  that the orsta operations generated a net cash inflow of million in but consumed million in cash during the current year 
cash generated from commercial intertech s total operating activities amounted to million in  representing a decrease of million or percent from the previous year 
increased working capital to support the global surge in business and cash requirements for the orsta operations at chemnitz and rochlitz were the principal factors in the year over year decline 
income from discontinued operations in of million was noncash in nature and therefore had no effect on cash flow in this fiscal period 
item continued liquidity and capital resources continued with respect to investing activities  cash contributions received in connection with the orsta acquisition amounted to million in versus million in related receipts during the prior period 
capital expenditures in were a record million for the corporation versus spending of million in and million in nearly percent of the current year spending pertained to investment in the us for expansion of production capacity  equipment upgrades to improve manufacturing performance  installation of emission control devices  construction of a new manufacturing facility  machine tools for the manufacture of new product offerings  and purchase of advanced computer systems to support manufacturing processes and administrative functions 
construction of a new manufacturing facility  investment in technologically advanced production equipment  and other operating improvements for the orsta units accounted for most of the capital spending in the overseas segment during capacity expansion  equipment upgrades  emission controls and office automation in the us accounted for the majority of the capital expenditures in the two preceding years 
authorized but unspent capital expenditure programs totaled million at fiscal year end 
significant projects authorized for include ongoing investment in state of the art production equipment for hydraulic systems facilities in the us and united kingdom  the remainder of the funded building construction and equipment purchase programs for hydraulic operations in germany  a major expansion of astron s satellite manufacturing capabilities in the czech republic  and upgraded production capabilities for the fluid purification group 
cash used in financing activities totaled million in principal activities included the retirement of debt  payment of reserve contract premiums  and the distribution of dividends to shareholders 
dividends totaled million in  of which million was paid to shareholders of common stock 
during the year  quarterly cash dividends on common stock were raised to 
per share  up percent from the previous rate of 
per share 
a refinancing program was completed in whereby proceeds from issuance of million in percent senior notes were used to redeem all of the series c senior increasing rate cumulative convertible preferred shares originally issued in principal payments against the senior notes are scheduled to commence in with the final payment to be made in the impact of the refinancing has improved cash flow and increased net income available to shareholders of common stock 
item continued as part of a restructuring program completed in  the company established two leveraged employee stock ownership plans the esops and sold series b cumulative convertible preferred shares to the plans for approximately million 
the esops borrowed funds to purchase the series b shares 
during  the esops completed a refinancing program whereby a floating rate loan was replaced with a million  percent  year term loan privately placed with a group of insurance companies 
this program provided permanent financing for the remaining life of the benefit plan 
the company has guaranteed the repayment of any remaining principal as of december  the outstanding loan balance at october  was approximately million 
internal cash flows are expected to be sufficient to provide the capital resources necessary to support operating needs and finance capital expenditure programs in the coming year 
the company has a million nonreducing credit facility available from a group of lending institutions which expires in the funds available to the company under this agreement may be used for any general corporate purpose 
including this facility  total unused credit lines of million  denominated in both domestic and foreign currencies  were available to the company at fiscal year end 
borrowing rates to start the new year were generally lower than the same period a year ago  reflecting prevailing market conditions 
impact of inflation and changing prices rates of inflation were moderately higher than the previous year  ranging from to percent in most instances 
manufacturing and operating costs generally advanced in line with inflation  but material cost increases outpaced the rate of inflation in most product lines 
selling price increases were implemented to cover rising costs for wages  benefits  raw materials  purchased components and other manufacturing costs  but the continuing trend of competitive pressures and price resistance in the marketplace limited the extent to which cost increases could be passed along to customers in consequently  the corporation relied upon volumetric efficiencies  productivity improvements and cost saving measures to offset the shortfall in pricing and successfully maintain or improve profit margins in most business units 
margins were lower  however  for the astron division where weak industry prices and price discounting in certain market segments have adversely affected profitability over the past three years 
the ability to recover cost increases and maintain margins continues to be a major challenge for most operating units  and the company relies upon cost containment  aggressive purchasing  quality initiatives and cost saving capital investments to combat profit erosion and remain competitive 
item continued business outlook the consolidated backlog of unfilled orders amounted to million at the end of the year which  after adjusting for the effects of exchange rate differences on foreign segments  represents an percent increase over the previous fiscal year end 
ending backlogs were particularly strong for the overseas operations  up percent  but were down percent from the peak levels experienced last year in the domestic sector 
substantially all of the consolidated backlog is deliverable in business conditions to start the new fiscal year for the company s domestic operations are generally weaker than a year ago as demand was lower from customers in certain industry segments during the final quarter of recent reports suggest that economic growth in the us slowed during the latter part of the year and that prospects for an upturn in will depend  heavily  on the outcome of the government s efforts to forge a deficit reduction program and the federal reserve s reaction to that program in setting fiscal policy 
economists are generally predicting a sluggish performance by the us economy early in  followed by lower interest rates and modest economic growth over the latter part of the year 
first quarter earnings for the company s domestic operations are expected to be lower than the record setting results achieved for the same period in  but profit improvements are nevertheless anticipated for all three of our us product groups in during the coming year  the company intends to implement marketing strategies which will expand the customer base and increase share  invest in capital equipment to increase production capacity and improve manufacturing performance  introduce new product offerings  and continue to pursue business acquisitions which will complement existing product lines and allow access to new market segments 
prospects are mixed for the company s overseas operations to start the year 
ongoing efforts to reorganize and make profitable the hydraulic operations in germany will adversely impact earnings during the early part of  while a weakening economic trend has prompted customers in the united kingdom to alter order patterns and reschedule deliveries in some instances 
conditions are much brighter for the astron division  however  where results are expected to be much better in the coming year as a result of improving economies in central europe  a favorable trend in product pricing  and continuing efforts to expand business activities in the former eastern bloc 
elsewhere  the outlook is excellent for continued economic growth in australia and southeast asia where strong performances are anticipated again for our hydraulic and fluid purification operations located in that region 
year over year improvements are also likely for operations in brazil  pending success of the local government to restart the economy and stimulate business growth 
item continued the company continues to invest in capital improvements  identify and implement strategic initiatives  and reduce overheads where possible to lower operating costs and improve profitability 
the competitive advantages which these programs provide  our ability to meet the challenges of globalization and increased international competition  and continuation of moderate growth in world economies cause us to anticipate strong consolidated results again for
