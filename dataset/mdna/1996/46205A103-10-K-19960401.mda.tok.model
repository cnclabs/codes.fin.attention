for example  a reduction in expenditures by radio and television advertisers in the company s markets may result in lower revenues 
the company may be unable to reduce expenses  including certain variable expenses  in an amount sufficient in the short term to offset lost revenues caused by poor market conditions 
the company s television stations are dependent upon must carry regulations for carriage on cable systems in each market 
the constitutionality of must carry regulations is currently being litigated in the us supreme court and if such regulations were invalidated  the company could suffer decreased revenues or increased carriage expenses if the company s stations lose cable carriage or are forced to pay cable systems for carriage 
the broadcasting industry continues to undergo rapid technological change which may increase competition within the company s markets as new delivery systems  such paxson communications corporation as direct broadcast satellite and computer networks  attract customers

the fair value estimates presented are based on pertinent information available to management as of december  as a result of the foregoing  the estimates presented in the company s financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the company could realize in a current market exchange 
although management is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the estimated fair value amounts  such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of the company s financial statements

to the extent that the company pursues future acquisitions or requires additional working capital  the company may be required to obtain additional financing 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to it 
the failure to raise funds necessary to finance the company s future cash requirements could adversely affect the company s ability to pursue its business strategy 
in addition  should the company suffer a significant impairment to its cash flow from operations due to the occurrence of one or more adverse events  its liquidity could become insufficient on a short term basis due to diminished borrowing capacity under the new credit facility and on a long term basis  the company could have insufficient resources to repay indebtedness under the new credit facility or the notes when due
