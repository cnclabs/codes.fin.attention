approximately million of these deferred tax assets will affect equity and intangibles and will not be available to offset future provisions for income taxes 
realization of the net deferred tax assets of million is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the loss and tax credit carryforwards 
although realization is not assured  management believes that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets of million will be realized 
the amount of the net deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  could be reduced or increased in the near term if actual facts  including the estimate of future taxable income  differ from those estimated

the company repurchases common stock in part to satisfy estimated requirements for shares to be issued under the company s employee stock option and stock purchase plans as well as in connection with acquisitions 
past repurchase activity should not be considered an indicator of future repurchases 
since  as part of its authorized repurchase program  the company has sold million put warrants through private placements 
as of december   million of these warrants had expired out of the money 
the remaining outstanding million warrants entitle the holder to sell one share of common stock to the company on a specified date and at a specified price ranging from to per share 
additionally  during this same period  the company purchased approximately million call options that entitle the company to buy on a specified date one share of common stock at a specified price

the remaining million outstanding call options range in price from to per share 
the company has the right to settle the put warrants with stock  cash or a combination of stock and cash equal to the difference between the exercise price and the fair value at the date of exercise 
settlement of the put warrants with stock could cause the company to issue a substantial number of shares  depending on the amounts of the repurchase obligations and the per share fair value of the company s common stock at the time of exercise 
in addition  settlement of put warrants in stock or cash could lead to the disposition by put warrant holders of shares of the company s common stock that such holders may have accumulated in anticipation of the exercise of the put warrants or call options  which may impact the price of the company s common stock 
as discussed above  financing activities in  and related principally to the company s stock repurchase program and payments of notes payable 
the company s stock repurchases included open market and private purchases  and as discussed above  exercise of call options 
in  the company repurchased a warrant previously issued in connection with an acquisition  equivalent to approximately million shares of the company s common stock for a total cost of million 
the sale of common stock primarily to the company s employees as part of its employee benefit plans generated million  million and million in cash during  and  respectively

the company anticipates that current cash and short term investment balances  cash flows from operations and short and long term borrowing capabilities will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements on a short and long term basis 
the company s majority owned subsidiary  ims  has a million bank line of credit 
the company is currently in negotiations with various lenders regarding a line of credit  but there can be no assurance that mutually acceptable terms can be reached and that the company will have a line of credit available in the short term 
to the extent that the company does not utilize bank lines of credit or borrowings to fund its operations on a short term basis  the company may continue to reduce its current cash and may experience future working capital deficits on a short term basis 
factors that may affect future results the company competes in the highly competitive eda market which continues to be characterized by aggressive pricing practices  rapid technological change and new market entrants 
the company s success is dependent upon its ability to develop innovative  cost competitive eda software products and services  and to bring them to market in a timely manner 
the company s future operating results are dependent on the company s ability to successfully implement its strategy to help its customers meet their business objectives by optimizing their product development processes 
the company accomplishes this through a combination of technology and services 
inherent in implementing this strategy are a number of risks that the company must manage and that could affect its future operating results 
these risks include the ability to successfully recruit  train and retain its skilled service professionals and the ability to profitably deliver services that meet customer expectations 
growth of the service business is constrained by the company s ability to hire and train service professionals to keep pace with demand 
the company s profitability could be adversely affected if it is unable to develop its services business as expected 
it is anticipated that international revenue will continue to constitute a significant portion of total revenue 
international revenues are subject to certain additional risks normally associated with international operations  including  among others  adoption and expansion of government trade restrictions  volatile foreign exchange rates  currency conversion risks  limitations on repatriation of earnings and reduced protection of intellectual property rights 
the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
though the company attempts to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations  significant exchange rate movements may have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
the company s operating expenses are partially based on its expectations of future revenue 
the company s results of operations may be adversely affected if revenue does not materialize in a quarter as expected 
since expense levels are usually committed in advance of revenues and because only a small portion of expenses vary with revenue  the company s operating results may be impacted significantly by lower revenue 
based on the company s operating history and factors that may cause fluctuations in the quarterly results  quarter to quarter comparisons should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
although the company s revenues are not generally seasonal in nature  the company has experienced decreases in first quarter revenue versus the preceding fourth quarter which is believed to result primarily from the capital purchase cycle of the company s customers 
due to the foregoing  as well as other factors  past financial performance should not be considered an indicator of future performance 
in addition  the company s participation in a highly dynamic industry often results in significant volatility of the company s common stock price 
any change in revenues or operating results below levels expected by securities analysts for the company or its competitors  and the timing of the announcement of such shortfalls  could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock in any given period
