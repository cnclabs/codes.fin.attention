fiscal sales of  were five percent above fiscal sales 
compared with fiscal  domestic sales declined two percent while international sales of  were up percent 
sfe products and syringe pump sales accounted for nearly percent of the segment s sales 
the growth of these two product lines more than offset the decline in liquid chromatography products and other traditional products of the segment

operating income analysis and review operating income loss by business segment amounts in thousands water quality monitoring instruments    separation instruments  total operating income loss   to comparison water quality monitoring instruments 
this segment generated operating income of  during fiscal  a percent decrease from fiscal during fiscal the company announced the merger of its two divisions and as a result incurred restructuring charges  which accounted for percent of the decrease in operating income 
the restructuring charges are discussed in a following section 
during fiscal  the gross margin percentage  as a percentage of sales  declined four percent 
approximately half of the decrease in the margin is a result of the growth in international sales as a percentage of total sales 
international sales are through dealers who receive discounts off list prices  whereas  domestic sales are through manufacturers representatives who purchase at list prices and are paid commissions 
discounts are recorded as reductions in sales whereas commissions are recorded as selling expenses 
the remainder of the decrease in the margin is the result of increased manufacturing costs  mainly from increases in overhead costs 
for the year  research and engineering expenses increased percent  due primarily to costs incurred relative to the development of a closed pipe flow meter and the continued development of toc analyzers 
selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses remained flat 
decreases in legal fees and the company s profit sharing contribution more than offset increases in wages and related benefits  advertising expenses  and collection expenses 
during fiscal  legal expenses returned to a more normal level from fiscal when the company incurred significant legal expenses defending against a lawsuit brought by marsh mcbirney  inc  an open channel flow meter competitor 
in fiscal  a judgment was entered in favor of the company  however  the plaintiff appealed the decision 
during fiscal  the judgment was sustained by an appellate court 
separation instruments 
this segment incurred an operating loss of  during fiscal compared with a operating loss of  in fiscal during fiscal the company announced the merger of its two divisions and as a result incurred restructuring charges 
if restructuring charges had not been incurred  the segment would have improved its operating performance by percent when compared with the restructuring charges are discussed in a following section 
during  the gross margin percentage  as a percentage of sales  declined two percent 
the margin was negatively affected by the increase in the lifo reserve  this accounted for over half of the decrease in the margin 
the remainder of the decrease was due to the sales mix shifting back to lower margin liquid chromatography products 
research and engineering expenses remained flat  while sg a expenses decreased percent 
reduced expenses to support international dealers and domestic manufacturers representatives  the company s profit sharing contribution  costs associated with equipment on loan to potential customers  advertising expenses  and other marketing related program expenses accounted for the majority of the decrease in sg a expenses 
to comparison water quality monitoring instruments 
this segment generated operating income of  during fiscal  a percent increase over fiscal during  the gross margin percentage declined slightly 
for the year  research and engineering expenses declined nine percent due  primarily  to reduced expenditures for external research and engineering services 
during the year  sg a expenses increased six percent mainly as a result of the legal expenses associated in defending against the lawsuit discussed above 
separation instruments 
this segment incurred an operating loss of  during fiscal compared with a operating profit of  in fiscal during  the gross margin percentage declined slightly 
increased expenditures for external research and engineering services  and materials and supplies represent the majority of the six percent increase in research and engineering expenses 
increased sales salaries  expenses to support international dealers and domestic manufacturers representatives  sales materials  commissions  sales and marketing travel expenses  and patent expenses represented the majority of the percent increase in sg a expenses 
the segment s operating income was reduced as a result of expensive field service and engineering activities required to correct operational problems of the sfx automated supercritical fluid extractor 
these problems were resolved and a reliable product delivered to the segment s customers

net earnings to comparison the company s fiscal year effective income tax rate was percent compared with percent for the previous year 
the decline in the current year s effective income tax rate was the result of lower taxable income relative to increased tax exempt income 
the current year s effective income tax rate was also affected by the company s decision to cancel its incentive tax contract with the state of nebraska requiring the repayment of approximately  of non qualifying tax benefits 
to comparison the company s fiscal year effective income tax rate was percent compared with percent for the previous year 
the decrease was due  to the combination of increased tax exempt income relative to operating income and adjusting for the prior year s estimate of currently payable federal and state income tax 
restructuring charges on july   the company announced the merger of its two divisions 
management believes that the restructuring will result in improved medium to longer term financial performance  and ensure the vitality and competitiveness of the company 
the restructuring resulted in the elimination of approximately positions  many of which were in duplicated management and supervisory positions 
it is expected that these reductions will lower operating and manufacturing costs by approximately to million per year 
the costs associated with this restructuring are approximately  details of the charges are in note k of the financial statements 
the company plans to expand and remodel the superior street facility to house all of the company s operations that are currently distributed between the superior and westgate facilities 
the estimated cost associated with the superior expansion and remodeling will be in the to million range 
the expansion and remodeling will be funded from working capital and the liquidation of investments 
after the expansion is completed the company plans to sell the westgate facility 
liquidity and capital resources the company continues to have a strong financial position with no debt obligations 
at july   working capital was  and the current ratio was a healthy at july   the company had in place with its commercial bank an unused  unsecured million line of credit 
cash flows from operations were  for fiscal year compared with  for the previous year 
a majority of the improvement in cash flows was from management s follow through on the commitment to reduce inventory 
this reduction more than offset the reduction in net income 
additional benefits provided to cash flows came from increases in accrued expenses and accounts payable combined with a smaller increase in accounts receivable 
accrued expenses are up due to costs associated with the company s restructuring 
recent developments in a continued effort to expand its share of the sfe market the company  in august  acquired substantially all the assets of suprex corporation  its leading competitor 
the acquisition required approximately  in cash and the assumption of approximately  in trade payables 
as a result of the acquisition  the company expects an increase in sales of sfe products to the to million range 
the impact on the fiscal operating income is expected to be negligible as a result of the additional costs associated with merging the operations 
the company anticipates that the suprex operations will be merged into its superior street location facility during the second quarter of fiscal currently  an analysis of the current product offerings is being performed to determine the appropriate products to provide to the market 
during fiscal  the company and geomation  inc agreed to delay the acquisition of geomation  inc for one year  until the first quarter of fiscal at that time of the agreement the company loaned geomation  details of the loan are in note e of the financial statements 
factors affecting future results the factors which management believes may affect the future financial performance of the company include  but are not limited to investment in research and engineering activities which lead to improved sales growth  successful integration of acquisitions into the company s operations  increased financial strength of a major competitor  and dealing with external regulatory influences on the company s primary markets 
the primary factor which could affect the company s earnings performance is that the domestic growth rates in the company s core areas of wastewater samplers  open channel flow meters  and liquid chromatography are at or slightly above the general economic growth rate 
the company must allocate and direct its research and engineering resources into development activities which result in products that contribute to profitable sales growth 
it is the company s goal to invest approximately percent of net sales in research and engineering activities 
management s challenge is to direct sufficient research and engineering resources to protect the company s market position in its core product areas  while at the same time investing in research and engineering activities which move the company into new areas with the potential to add significant profitable sales 
recent examples of moves into new product areas include the development of an on line toc analyzer and the unimag closed pipe flow meter 
the company is actively pursuing expansion through the acquisition of companies or products lines in related areas 
while this has the potential to add to the company s sales and income  growth through acquisition carries certain risks 
for example  for the company s recent acquisition of suprex to be successful  in the short term the company must achieve reasonable sales levels of suprex sfe products while at the same time integrating the suprex operations into the company s operations in lincoln  nebraska 
in the longer term the company must successfully integrate its existing sfe products with those acquired from suprex  and build a profitable sfe business 
while management believes these goals can be accomplished  success is not assured 
in the past several years  the management believes that american sigma  inc has made significant investments in new product development and sales and marketing activities 
in the us  this has created a serious challenge to the company s leading market position in wastewater samplers and its strong position in open channel flow meters 
the recent acquisition of american sigma  inc by the danaher corporation has provided additional financial and marketing resources to this competitor 
consolidation is an on going trend in both the environmental products market and the analytical instrument market 
as a result  the company is facing significantly larger competitors who have the financial and organizational resources to compete aggressively in a world wide market 
approximately percent of the company s sales are from environmental products 
this is a regulation driven business which is strongly influenced by both the perceived attitude and actions of governmental entities regarding the promulgation and the enforcement of environmental regulations 
the market effects of the regulatory climate are outside of the company s control  and in any given time period  may be either a positive or negative factor in the company s performance 
for example  in fiscal a significant percentage of the company s decline in us sales in the environmental products area can be attributed to both the anti environmental posture of the congress and the federal budget debate with the resulting uncertainty over the funding of epa programs and enforcement activities 
inflation the impact of inflation on the costs of the company and its ability to pass on cost increases in the form of increased sale prices is dependent upon market conditions and its competitive environment 
inflation in the domestic economy has been relatively low for the past three years and has not had a significant impact on the company
