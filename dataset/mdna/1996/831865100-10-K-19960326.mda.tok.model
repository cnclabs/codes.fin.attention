in addition to the above mentioned capital expenditures  the corporation expects to invest approximately million in these ventures in long term debt  excluding debt of the finance subsidiary  increased from million at the end of to million at the end of the majority of the increase was due to the acquisition of peabody tectank for approximately million 
the long term debt of the finance subsidiary has been reduced from million in to million at december   as the planned liquidation of agristor credit corporation continued 
despite the higher debt level  an increased equity base allowed the total debt to total capital ratio  excluding the finance subsidiary  to remain relatively constant at percent and percent in and  respectively 
given the capital spending and investment activities mentioned above  the corporation projects that the total debt to total capital ratio will be higher in  but should return to a percentage more in line with recent years in in june  the corporation s multi year revolving credit agreement was increased to million and extended to june  the amended agreement carries lower fees and borrowing costs

o 
smith corporation has paid dividends on its common stock for consecutive years 
results of operations revenues in were billion  achieving record levels for the third consecutive year and surpassing revenues of billion by percent and revenues of billion by percent 
despite competitive conditions in all of the markets the corporation serves  each operating company s sales increased over the prior year 
the most significant revenue improvements occurred in the oem segment of the corporation  comprised of the automotive products and electrical products companies  and provided almost percent of the increased revenues in the corporation s gross profit margin in was percent or one percent and one half percent lower than the profit margins experienced in and  respectively 
the reduced margin was due mostly to a series of one time unrelated occurrences at the automotive products company which more than offset the favorable influence of increased volume throughout the corporation 
during  launch costs associated with several new product programs had an adverse impact on margins 
the most significant decline in margins occurred in the third quarter 
extremely heavy demand at the automotive products company for light and heavy truck products created unusual pressures on production schedules  particularly at the company s milwaukee  wisconsin facilities 
the impact of strong demand was accompanied by unprecedented hot weather as well as labor related inefficiencies in its milwaukee operations 
automotive products company achieved record sales of million in surpassing the previous year s record of million by million or percent 
sales in were million 
the record setting sales performance was especially encouraging considering it was achieved in a domestic automotive market for light vehicles that decreased by approximately three percent from the prior year 
automotive continues to benefit from providing full frame assemblies and other products associated with popular models within the light truck segment 
most of the sales increase was attributable to recent new product programs which supply the expanding sport utility market 
demand within the heavy truck market remained strong in and resulted in record sales for the automotive heavy truck operations 
automotive s trend of increasing earnings which commenced in was curtailed in as operating profits were less than the impact of the aforementioned product launch costs  record summer heat  unprecedented product demand  and labor contract issues presented an obstacle that could not be overcome by the increased volume 
automotive anticipates that earnings will benefit from the recently ratified  four year labor agreement 
the new contract should resolve labor productivity issues which negatively affected automotive s aggressive efforts to expand its presence in the light truck sport utility market  as evidenced by several new product launches and redesign programs  and the forecast of a modest recovery in light vehicle sales in should also prove beneficial 
the company will be confronted by costs related to the start up of two new regional assembly plants in and will be further challenged by the costs associated with new products and redesign programs 
the corporation s percent owned mexican affiliate  metalsa  sa  experienced a very good year 
equity in earnings was million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
a significant portion of metalsa s sales are for the export market and are denominated in us dollars 
due to increased export shipments and a lower cost structure reflecting the benefits of realigned operations  the affiliate s results compare positively to total sales as expressed in dollars were down from levels as an increase in dollar denominated export sales was not sufficient to offset the decline in domestic sales 
in  metalsa s sales were approximately the same as the prior year 
earnings in were lower than due to restructuring and product launch costs 
in  a translation loss of 
million was incurred and reflected in earnings 
due to the decline in the value of the peso  in late  the corporation recorded a translation adjustment of million in stockholders equity 
there were no similar adjustments in  as the value of the peso was fairly constant 
electrical products company sales in increased million or almost percent to a record million from sales of million 
sales in were million 
the company s major motor markets continued to expand in although the growth exhibited was not as strong as was experienced in while much of the increased volume in was due to low finished goods levels at which many motor markets entered  the increased volume in was the result of obtaining incremental share in several market segments 
strong global demand for compressors bolstered hermetic motor sales significantly in the company s position as a low cost producer of fractional horsepower fan motors and a revitalized domestic heating  ventilation  and air conditioning industry resulted in a double digit percentage increase over the prior year s sales in this segment 
the company s continued focused penetration of the international markets provided a percent increase in export sales in sales into the motor aftermarket increased significantly in due to new merchandising strategies and favorable alignment with several key wholesale distributors 
profits for the electrical products company in demonstrated substantial improvement from a relatively good earnings year experienced in the increase in earnings over those in resulted from the transfer of production to the company s lower cost facilities which occurred in during  the company continued its successful strategy of concentrating manufacturing activities in the most efficient plant locations 
additionally  the company upgraded capital equipment in all of its plant locations resulting in further productivity gains 
this combination of significantly higher volumes  concentration of production in low cost facilities  and improved technology was responsible for the increased earnings in electrical products is positioned to surpass s strong performance in assuming its ability to retain newly acquired market share and continued strong market conditions entering the new year 
sales for the water products company were million in  increasing slightly from million in and establishing a record for the fourth consecutive year 
sales in were million 
while sales of residential water heaters in benefitted from a shift in demand to the fourth quarter of that year due to an announced price increase effective as of january   sales in early were adversely impacted 
in contrast to the residential inventory situation  the commercial water heater industry entered with low inventory levels 
demand for commercial products in rebounded from the depressed levels experienced in the combination of low inventory levels at the start of the year and an expanded market  coupled with water products strong position in the wholesale channels and broad commercial product offering resulted in a significant gain in market share in although total sales increased only modestly in  earnings for the water products company were seven percent higher than and also established a record for the fourth consecutive year 
the increased volume of the higher margin commercial product more than offset the adverse impact of lower volume and pricing for residential water heaters 
water products anticipates that will provide further growth in sales as the residential market returns to more normal growth patterns and our chinese joint venture begins operations 
smith fiberglass products inc sales of million were modestly higher than sales of million and slightly less than the record sales of million established in while sales were at levels comparable to the prior two years  the mix among the company s various markets was substantially different 
sales of fiberglass pipe to service stations in were significantly lower than and were at the lowest levels in three years 
this decline in the petroleum marketing segment was caused by a significant slowdown in construction  poor weather early in the year  and loss of market share to flexible hose products 
sales to the chemical and industrial market increased over the prior two years as fiberglass pipe continues to gain acceptance as an alternative to its iron and steel counterparts 
shipments to the domestic petroleum production industry showed improvement during the second half of as a result of stable oil prices 
strong export sales to south american oil fields also helped offset declines in the petroleum marketing segment 
earnings for fiberglass products in were lower than the previous two years 
the higher concentration of sales in the company s lower margin product lines was a major cause of the earnings decline 
additional costs associated with establishing a joint venture in china  as well as other new marketing initiatives  also affected earnings 
fiberglass products projections for reflect an improvement in earnings  however a return to the record earnings level of is not expected 
most of the growth will come from new corrosion resistant product offerings to the chemical and industrial market  an increased presence in the international market  and additional export shipments 
revenues for the corporation s other operations were million in  an increase of million and million over and  respectively 
sales in for a 
o 
smith harvestore products  inc harvestore  were million  an percent increase over and the highest total since the major growth in sales occurred in the municipal and industrial segment of the business where a record for unit volume was established in harvestore s agricultural business exhibited mixed results in as sales of its newest chain unloader increased percent over while sales of slurrystore structures declined after five years of volume growth 
earnings in for harvestore were much improved over both and as a result of higher volume 
to further expand opportunities in the municipal and industrial storage market the corporation acquired peabody tectank inc from the pullman company  inc in december tectank is a manufacturer of bolted steel tanks and shop welded steel  stainless steel  and aluminum tanks 
tectank had sales of million in fiscal and will more than double the corporation s presence in the storage tank market 
sales and earnings since the acquisition of this wholly owned subsidiary have been included in the other products segment of the corporation and were not significant to results 
revenues for agristor credit corporation were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the trend of decreasing revenues is reflective of management s desire to liquidate this finance subsidiary 
interest costs and administrative expenses have declined consistently throughout the liquidation process 
the costs associated with non performing contracts were significantly less in than  thereby reducing the loss incurred in management is encouraged by the fact that the other products segment of the corporation has gone from a net after tax loss of 
per share in both and to break even in the future for this segment of the corporation has improved substantially with the aforementioned tectank acquisition increasing penetration of the storage tank market as well as providing an expanded international presence with several foreign sales offices 
selling  general  and administrative sga expense for the corporation in was million compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the majority of the increase during this period was caused by higher employee incentive and profit sharing provisions  increased commissions  and other expenses in support of additional sales volume 
the amount of increase in sga in was substantially less than due to a significant reduction in the amount of bad debt expenditures and re marketing costs associated with repossessed equipment incurred by agristor credit corporation 
as a percent of sales  selling  general  and administrative expenses have declined steadily from percent in to percent in interest expense increased million in to million from million in interest expense in was million 
the increase in interest expense in reflected higher average interest rates 
the decline in interest expense from to was a function of lower debt levels 
the corporation s effective income tax rate decreased to percent in from percent and percent in and  respectively 
the slight decline in rate in was caused primarily by lower state income and franchise tax provisions and tax benefits associated with the corporation s newly created foreign sales corporation 
the relatively high rate in was due to the one percent federal rate increase including the cumulative impact on prior years 
in the fourth quarter of  the automotive products company  water products company  and smith fiberglass products inc each established a joint venture in the people s republic of china 
the companies and their partners are in the process of making the required initial investments 
when all the capital contributions and shareholder loans have been made  ao smith corporation will hold a majority interest in each venture
