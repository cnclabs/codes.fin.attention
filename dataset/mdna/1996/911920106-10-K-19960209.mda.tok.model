revenues from sales of single family homes for increased from  resulting primarily from a increase in the number of housing units delivered and a increase in the average sales price 
the increases in the average sales prices in and were primarily due to price increases 
the gross margin percentage was essentially unchanged over the three year period as increases in sales prices in the three year period were offset by cost increases 
new orders taken in increased from the increase in new orders in reflects the demand for new single family homes which the company believes was brought about by the decrease in mortgage interest rates starting in the second quarter of new orders taken in decreased from the decline in new orders in occurred in the second half of the year which the company believes was attributable to the increases in mortgage interest rates 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of housing revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses declined in as compared to both and actual selling  general and administrative expense for increased million compared to this increase was attributable to increases in volume related expenses million resulting from the increase in deliveries in when compared to and increases in other selling  general and administrative expenses resulting from increased activities and earnings

interest expense interest paid and accrued for increased approximately compared to and increased approximately in compared to the increase in over was primarily due to interest on a majority of the company s debt in the first six months of being stayed during the pendency of the cases

pursuant to the plan  the company issued  shares of common stock on june  to corporate officers and certain other key employees for services rendered in connection with the reorganization of the company 
the company has reflected the issuance as an increase in stockholders equity and an offsetting charge to earnings of million based upon the market price of the common stock on june  financial services revenues revenues for the financial services segment for the periods indicated were as follows dollars in thousands years ended december  us home mortgage corporation and us    other financial services subsidiaries    mortgage provides financing primarily to purchasers of homes sold by the company s housing operations through origination of residential mortgage loans and engages in the sale of such mortgages and related servicing rights to unaffiliated investors 
mortgage s operations are affected  among other things  by general economic conditions  consumer confidence and interest rate volatility 
these factors  together with the number of homes delivered by the company  affect the volume of loan originations which in turn impact the resulting volume of mortgages and servicing rights for sale 
the increase in mortgage s revenues in from was primarily due to an increase in mortgage loan originations and income from the sales of mortgage loans and servicing rights while the decrease in its revenues for from was primarily due to decreased marketing income as a result of increased pricing competition and volatility in the secondary mortgage markets 
financial condition and liquidity housing the company s most significant needs for capital resources are land and finished lot purchases  land development and housing construction 
the company s ability to generate cash adequate to meet these needs is principally achieved from the sale of homes and the margins thereon  the utilization of company owned lots and borrowings under its financing facilities  including the credit agreement see below 
access to quality land and lot locations is an integral part of the company s success 
typically  in order to secure the rights to quality locations and provide sufficient lead time for development  the company must acquire land rights well in advance of when orders for housing units are expected to occur 
the company attempts to minimize its exposure to the cyclical nature of the housing market and its use of working capital by employing rolling lot options  which enable the company to initially pay a small portion of the total lot cost and then purchase the lots on a scheduled basis 
over the last three years  approximately of the units delivered have been on lots acquired under rolling lot option agreements 
the increase in land inventories in from and from was primarily the result of increased activities  including the increase in the company s retirement and active adult second home communities activities 
the company has financed  and expects to continue to finance  its working capital needs from operations and borrowings  including those made under the company s million unsecured revolving credit agreement credit agreement entered into in september which replaced the company s secured working capital facility 
the credit agreement and previous credit facilities have enabled the company to meet peak operating needs and  more currently  to finance the company s recent increase in land inventories 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
also  certain of the properties owned or under option by the company may be located within community development districts districts formed by municipalities to construct and finance certain infrastructure improvements on property in the districts area 
the districts utilize assessment revenue bonds to fund improvements and repay the bonds by annual assessments on district property based on the property s relative value to other district property 
the company provides no credit support for and is not liable for the debt of the districts  except to the extent of actual assessments made by the districts 
the company may utilize districts to a greater extent in the future 
on january   the company filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission relating to the continuous offering pursuant to rule under the securities act of  as amended  of up to million principal amount of debt securities 
the debt securities registered thereunder may be sold in one or more series from time to time 
the offering of the debt securities will be made only by means of a prospectus 
the net cash provided or used by the operating  investing and financing activities of the housing operations for the years ended december   and is summarized below dollars in thousands years ended december  net cash provided used by operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    net increase decrease in cash    housing operations are  at any time  affected by a number of factors  including the number of housing units under construction and housing units delivered 
housing construction and land asset activities increased in over and in over however  housing operating activities for used less cash than in primarily due to increased profitability and the timing of payments related to these activities 
housing operating activities used less cash in than in primarily due to an increase in the number of housing units delivered offset in part by an increase in construction and land asset activities 
cash flow from housing financing activities increased in from primarily due to increased net borrowings under the company s revolving credit facilities to finance increases in housing and land assets necessary to meet increased sales activities 
cash flow from housing financing activities for was used for the repayment of notes and mortgages payable  offset by net borrowings under the company s revolving credit facilities 
the company believes that cash flow from operations and amounts available under the credit agreement will be sufficient to meet its current working capital obligations and other needs 
however  should the company require capital in excess of that which is currently available  there can be no assurance that it will be available 
financial services mortgage s activities represent a substantial portion of the financial services segment s activities 
as loan originations by mortgage are primarily from homes sold by the company s home building operations  mortgage s financial condition and liquidity are to a significant extent dependent upon the financial condition of the company 
financial services operating activities are affected primarily by mortgage s loan originations which result in the sale of mortgage loans and related servicing rights to third party investors 
cash flows from financial services operating activities are also affected by the timing of the sale of loans and servicing rights which generally are sold to investors within days after homes are delivered 
in this regard  cash flows from financial services operating activities for used more cash compared to primarily due to an increase in residential mortgage loan receivables while financial services operating activities in used less cash compared to primarily due to a decrease in residential mortgage loan receivables 
the company finances its financial services operations primarily from internally generated funds  such as from the origination and sale of residential mortgage loans and related servicing rights  and short term debt 
as more fully discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the short term debt consists of a million secured revolving line of credit the mortgage credit facility which matures on august  while the mortgage credit facility contains numerous covenants  including a debt to tangible net worth ratio and a minimum tangible net worth requirement  these covenants are not anticipated to significantly limit mortgage s operations 
the company has no obligation to provide funding to its financial services operations  nor does it guarantee any of its financial services subsidiaries debt 
the company believes that internally generated funds and the mortgage credit facility will be sufficient to provide for mortgage s working capital needs 
other impact of inflation inflation not only affects interest rates on funds borrowed by the company  but also affects the affordability of permanent mortgage financing available to prospective customers 
increased construction costs associated with rising interest rates  as well as increased material costs  compress gross margins in the short term  but may be recovered in the long term through increases in sales prices  although such increases may reduce sales volume 
in recent years  inflation has not had a significant adverse effect on the company 
future accounting requirement in october  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 

for the company  sfas no 
will be effective for the year beginning january  sfas no 
recommends all stock based employee compensation plans  such as the company s incentive stock option plans  be accounted for using the fair value method but allows for the continued application of the intrinsic value concept under existing accounting rules prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
apb 
in general  use of the fair value method would require the company to estimate the fair value of its stock options as of the grant date using an option pricing model such as black scholes and charge this estimate to expense over the vesting period 
the accounting prescribed by apb requires no expense recognition because the options are granted at the prevailing market prices at dates of grant 
sfas no 
requires proforma net income and earnings per share disclosures for those companies which continue to follow apb rather than adopt the fair value method of accounting 
the company currently plans to continue to value its stock options using the guidance of apb and to implement sfas no 
by including the proforma disclosures in the notes to its consolidated financial statements for the year ended december
