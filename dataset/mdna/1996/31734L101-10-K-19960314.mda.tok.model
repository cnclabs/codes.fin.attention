during the fourth quarter of  the company adopted sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  sfas which resulted in a before tax addition of  to depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
after tax  the additional charge was  or per share 
under sfas  the company now evaluates impairment of exploration and production assets on a field by field basis rather than using a one country cost center for its proved properties 
on this basis  certain fields are impaired because they are not expected to recover their entire carrying value from future cash flows 
in addition to the change in grouping of proved properties  the value of certain marketing assets in the company s downstream business were also impaired under sfas as a result  the company recognized a non cash  pre tax charge of  related to its exploration and production assets and  related to its marketing assets 
the fair values of the impaired assets were determined by using the present value of expected future cash flows for the oil and gas properties and sales prices for similar assets for marketing assets 
if estimated future cash flows are not achieved with respect to certain fields  further writedowns may be required 
earnings per common share in  after sfas  were compared to in and in stockholders equity was billion  or per common share  in compared to billion  or per common share  in and billion  or per common share  in the increase in stockholders equity in  and was attributable to net income after payment of annual dividends of per share in  per share in and per share in sales and other operating revenues for were billion compared to billion in and in  a increase primarily due to higher chemicals prices and higher refining volumes

crude oil and refined products and chemicals are priced at the lower of cost last in  first out  lifo or market on an aggregate basis 
materials and supplies are priced at average cost  not in excess of market  in the case of material salvaged  an allowance is made for obsolescence and depreciation 
because of declines in the price of crude oil and refined products  the company recorded a valuation reserve in of  pre tax to reduce the lifo cost of inventory to net realizable value 
the price of crude oil  petroleum products and chemicals increased in allowing restoration through income of the full amount of the reserve established in the excess of replacement cost of crude oil and refined products and chemicals over lifo cost at december  was approximately million 
the impact of the various lines of business on the financial position and results of operations is discussed in the following text under appropriate operating unit subheadings 
exploration and production and natural gas marketing revenues and earnings loss before interest and income tax were million and million  million and million and million and million for  and  respectively

major earnings factors included lower industry refining margins  three utility company power failures  and a scheduled maintenance shutdown of the reformer aromatics complex at the port arthur  texas refinery 
these factors were partially offset by higher refining throughputs  improved yields and lower operating costs 
refining margins were disappointing  specifically the fuels margin which were cents per barrel below  which was a very low year 
aromatics margins were strong in the first half of this was especially helpful at the port arthur  texas refinery where the company is among the industry leaders in aromatics production compared to crude throughput 
overall  poor industry margins continued to negatively affect earnings and mask significant improvements in refining operations 
refinery operations in include a new record throughput of  barrels per day

chemicals was the largest contributor to earnings  as margins for the company s products continued to increase 
in  capital improvements were realized which increased capacity for styrene  for polystyrene and for polypropylene 
total chemical sales volumes were down versus the prior year primarily due to limitations caused by expansion tie ins and equipment downtimes in each plant 
in first quarter a project increased capacity on all production lines of the polystyrene plant in carville  louisiana  and increased annual polystyrene capacity by million pounds  to million pounds 
fina also will build a new million pound crystal polystyrene production line utilizing proprietary technology at the carville site 
it will commence operations in the second quarter of and will increase total polystyrene capacity to billion pounds per year  making the carville plant the largest single site polystyrene facility in the world 
an expansion at the laporte polypropylene plant to increase capacity by million pounds per year was completed in the fourth quarter of ahead of schedule and below budget 
after completion  at a capacity of billion pounds per year  it is the largest polypropylene plant in the world

environmental matters the company was contingently liable at december   under pending lawsuits and other claims  some of which involved substantial sums 
considering certain liabilities that have been set up for the lawsuits and claims  and the difficulty in determining the ultimate liability in some of these matters  internal counsel is of the opinion that the amounts  if any  that ultimately might be due in connection with such lawsuits and claims would not have a material adverse effect upon the company s consolidated financial condition 
the company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
these regulations  which are currently changing  regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and may require the company to include existing and possible future obligations to investigate the effects of the release or disposal of certain petroleum  chemical and mineral substances at various sites  to remediate or restore these sites  to compensate others for damage to property and natural resources and for remediation and restoration costs 
these possible obligations relate to sites owned by the company or others and associated with past or present operations  including sites at which the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party prp under the federal superfund laws and comparable state laws 
the company is currently participating in environmental investigations  assessments and cleanups under these regulations at federal superfund and state managed sites  as well as other cleanup sites  including operating and closed refineries  chemical facilities  service stations and terminals 
the company may in the future be involved in additional environmental investigations  assessments and cleanups 
the amount of such future costs will depend on such factors as the unknown nature and contamination at many sites  the unknown timing  extent and method of the remedial actions which may be required and the determination of the company s liability in proportion to other responsible parties 
environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized depending on their future economic benefit 
expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and that have no future economic benefit are expensed 
liabilities for expenditures of a noncapital nature are recorded when environmental assessment and or remediation is probable  and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
the company has accrued for environmental remediation obligations of  at december  these liabilities have not been reduced for probable recoveries from third parties 
substantially all amounts accrued are expected to be paid out over the next five to six years 
the level of future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations is impossible to determine with any degree of probability 
in  the company expended  for ongoing environmental administration and maintenance activities  health and safety  remediation obligations  superfund taxes  capital expenditures for environmental protection and compliance with federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
total environmental cash expenditures at the company s operating locations are expected to increase over the next several years as the company complies with present and future regulatory requirements 
these costs will be incurred over an extended period of time 
estimated capital expenditures for related to environmental matters are the company has been advised it may be a potentially responsible party prp at federal superfund sites and one state superfund site 
due to the number of prps involved at most sites  the number of possible remedial solutions  the number of years of remedial activity required  and the evolutionary nature of the technology involved  the company is unable to assess and quantify the extent of its responsibilities at the majority of the sites 
the company and cos mar company  a joint venture for which the company acts as operator  have been named as potentially responsible parties for a superfund site  the brio site  in harris county  texas 
the company and cos mar  along with other potentially responsible parties  have signed a consent decree with the epa  agreeing to treat or remove certain hazardous substances 
focc s share of the cleanup costs  both individually and as owner of cos mar  is the epa has listed the hazardous waste disposal area of a refinery located in el dorado  kansas  as a superfund site 
as a former owner of the site  the company would be liable for of the cleanup cost 
the company signed a consent order with the state of kansas and the present owner of the site which recommends cleanup alternatives 
the remediation program has begun and sludge removal is complete 
in response to an administrative order from the texas natural resources conservation commission to prps  the company agreed to conduct an investigation of a closed refinery located near colorado city  texas 
the other named prps have appealed the order 
a comprehensive investigation of the site is now underway 
the company also operates a hydrocarbon abatement system  which captures contaminated groundwater before it reaches the colorado river 
a hazardous waste operating permit issued to the big spring  texas refinery requires an investigation of the sources of soil and groundwater contamination at the site 
an environmental assessment of inactive waste management units is ongoing  and widespread on site and off site groundwater contamination has been confirmed 
the company has taken action to define the extent of contamination and has initiated interim groundwater recovery 
the design of a full scale groundwater collection and treatment system has been completed and the system is currently being installed 
capital resources and liquidity the company s cash liquidity requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and debt reductions over the past three years were financed primarily by a combination of funds generated from operations  borrowings and dispositions of assets 
the company had working capital of million at december   million at december  and million at december  cash flow from operations was million in  million in and million in the cash flow from operations increased primarily because of stronger earnings and improved receivables and payables management 
the cash flow from operations decreased primarily because of an increase in inventories and accounts receivable 
the cash flow from operations increased primarily because of substantial decreases in inventories  and accounts receivable  including an million sale of accounts receivable during the company furthered its debt reduction plan and  as a result  total debt at year end was reduced to million from a level of billion during the first quarter of debt was reduced primarily with proceeds from the sale of assets and funds from operations 
the majority stockholder of the company has not been the principal lender in the past three fiscal years 
in  the company entered into long term note agreements with certain insurance companies that provided for unsecured borrowings aggregating million under series a  series b  and series c senior notes 
proceeds from these notes were used to repay other debt 
the company has an unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks in the amount of million since december  under the facility  the company has available credit in an amount of million through may fifty million dollars of borrowings were outstanding under this facility at december  the company paid dividends of per share in  per share in and per share in the company believes that cash provided by operations  together with borrowings available under the revolving credit facility with banks  will be sufficient to fund the company s working capital requirements  capital expenditures  principal  interest and dividends 
capital expenditures in thousands exploration  production and natural gas    refining  marketing  and supply and transportation    chemicals    corporate and other    total    capital expenditures were above projected capital expenditures in are million 
impact of inflation and changing prices the business of the company is not seasonal but is sensitive to crude oil and natural gas pricing  margins between crude oil and refined products  and chemical margins 
inflation impacts the company by increasing costs of labor and supplies  and increasing costs of acquiring and replacing property  plant and equipment 
the replacement cost of property  plant and equipment is generally greater than the historical cost as a result of inflation 
market conditions continue to be the primary factor in determining the prices and costs of company products
