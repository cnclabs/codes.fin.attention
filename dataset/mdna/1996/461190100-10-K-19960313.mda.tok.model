item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations introduction the company reported a net loss of million per share in  on revenues of million  as compared to net earnings of million per share on revenues of million in  and net earnings of million per share on revenues of million in in  particularly in the fourth quarter  the slower growth of the us economy  coupled with increased trucking industry capacity  led to intense competitive pressures 
these increased pressures reduced average freight rates per total mile by nearly for the year  and over in the fourth quarter  when compared to the same time periods of  and made it more difficult to operate the fleet efficiently  leading to a higher proportion of empty miles to paid miles  and substantially lower operating margins 
further  continued competition for qualified drivers resulted in higher empty truck factors in  and led the company to increase driver wages and driver recruiting expenditures at a time of slowing volumes and declining rates 
lastly  the results were negatively impacted by million of pre tax losses  net of a  gain on sale  at the company s former munitions specialty carrier  c 
i 
whitten transfer company ciw  which was sold on august  all of the above factors combined to reduce the company s profitability significantly in when compared to the results achieved by the company in  which occurred at a time of an expanding us economy  and record industry profits 
the company operated profitably during the first three quarters of  despite the significant losses at ciw 
freight volumes and rates  however  declined sharply in the fourth quarter of as a result of the slowing u 
s economy  and winter seasonal and holiday factors 
the company lost money in the fourth quarter of as a result of the reduced volumes and prices  and the less efficient operation of the fleet 
these unprofitable competitive conditions continued into the first quarter of  and have been compounded by the inclement weather experienced across much of the country in january and february 
the company is implementing a number of steps intended to increase the company s competitiveness including disposing of excess tractors  realigning staffing levels  combining certain aspects of the operations of rrt and rds  and increasing marketing efforts 
management is cautiously optimistic that these and other actions will strengthen the company s operations  and return them to profitability 
however  other factors outside of the company s control  including the growth of the us economy and actions of competitors  may adversely affect the company in to a greater extent 
the company expects to report a loss for the first quarter of a discussion of the impact of the above and other factors on the results of operations in as compared to  and as compared to follows 
compared to key operating statistics change operating revenues millions net earnings average tractors   total loads s revenue miles millions average revenue per revenue mile operating revenues 
operating revenues were essentially unchanged in at million versus million in while total revenues remained unchanged  revenues generated with company operated equipment increased million or  and brokered revenues increased million or 
at the same time  owner operator revenues declined by million  or 
the decrease in owner operator revenues is primarily attributable to the sharply reduced owner operator revenues at ciw in over the increase in total loads volume in is primarily attributable to an increase in the average number of company trucks up  coupled with an increase in brokered traffic  offset by reduced loads hauled by owner operators 
the decrease in revenue per revenue mile price is a result of reduced traffic opportunities in due to the less robust us economy  which required the company to move more equipment with lower priced spot market loads 
in addition  the lower revenue contribution by ciw in over reduced the average company wide rate per revenue mile 
operating expenses 
the following table sets forth the percentage relationship of operating expenses to operating revenues for the years ended december  and operating revenues operating expenses purchased transportation and equipment rents salaries  wages and benefits fuel and other operating expenses operating taxes and licenses insurance and claims depreciation other operating expenses total operating expenses in and  the mix of company operated versus owner operator equipment continued to shift  although less significantly than in recent years  toward company operated equipment as a result of increased competition for qualified owner operators  and the company s ability to secure affordable financing and freight to operate additional company tractors 
approximately of the company s revenue was generated with company operated equipment in  as compared to approximately in the relatively higher use of company operated equipment resulted in increases in salaries  wages and benefits  fuel and other operating expenses and fixed costs related to ownership or lease of the equipment  and decreases in owner operator purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue 
in addition  the company has raised the pay rates for its drivers in order to continue to be able to attract sufficient qualified drivers 
lastly  in february  the company commenced treating all driver pay as taxable compensation  and eliminated driver road expense payments 
this increased taxable driver compensation  resulted in higher payroll related taxes and insurance 
the company s insurance expense decreased to of revenue in from of revenue in this decrease results primarily from reduced liability insurance premium rates due to improved accident control over the past several years  and to higher deductible retentions by the company 
approximately two thirds of the company s insurance expense in represented premium payments which are not susceptible to significant adjustment in the future 
the remaining one third of the expense is comprised of estimates for claim and deductible obligations as a result of accidents and claims 
operating taxes and licenses increased in as compared to as a result of the greater proportion of company operated equipment in  for which the company is responsible for operating taxes and licenses 
depreciation expense decreased in as compared to as the company has replaced owned or capital leased tractors primarily with operating leased tractors 
other operating expenses decreased to of revenue in from in due to reduced communication and other miscellaneous expenses  offset somewhat by increased expenditures for legal and professional fees in as compared to interest expense

operating revenues increased in to million from million in this increase in revenues in is attributable to an increase of approximately in the total number of loads and approximately in the number of revenue miles billed in as compared to the increase in volume in is attributable to an increase in the average number and productivity of the company s trucks  coupled with an overall improvement in general economic conditions 
management attributes this improvement to the strengthening of general economic activity in the full year of as compared to the improvement in revenue per mile is a result of strong shipper demand for the company s services  which allowed the company to selectively choose loads that yield higher revenues  coupled with rate increases implemented in late and throughout operating expenses

extraordinary gain on retirement of debt  net 
on january   in connection with a private offering of million of debt and equity securities  the company retired approximately million of bank debt for approximately million  yielding an after tax extraordinary gain of million in no similar transaction occurred in liquidity and capital resources the company used million of cash and cash equivalents in the year ended december   as compared to generating million in as reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows  in  million of cash was generated from operating activities  million  net  was used in financing activities  and million  net  was used in investing activities 
the company s cash balance was drawn down in as the company s bank lenders allowed the company to make term loan payments from certain restricted money market balances 
the company s day to day financing is provided by borrowings under a million bank credit facility  as most recently amended on january  the credit facility consists of a million term loan with a final maturity of december   and a million revolving line of credit which expires january  quarterly principal payments of  on the term loan commence april  the line of credit includes provisions for the issuance of up to million in stand by letters of credit which  as issued  reduce available borrowings under the line of credit 
borrowings under the line of credit are limited to amounts determined by a formula tied to the company s eligible accounts receivable and inventories  as defined in the credit facility 
the credit facility requires the company to meet certain minimum net worth  debt to net worth and current ratio requirements  prohibits the payment of dividends  and limits capital expenditures to specified amounts which management believes are currently adequate 
borrowings under the credit facility totaled million at december   and outstanding stand by letters of credit totaled million at that date 
the combination of these two bank credits totaled million  leaving million of borrowing capacity available at december  borrowing capacity under the amended credit facility as of march  was million 
the decreased availability results primarily from the financing of plates and permits for the company s tractor and trailer fleet  and to the increased working capital needs of the business during the first quarter of the company has plans to acquire approximately tractors in  of which approximately will replace older tractors and the balance of approximately units will be incremental growth units 
the company has the ability to cancel the tractors anytime prior to days before delivery and in certain cases has already done so  and the growth units will not be accepted if competitive conditions do not improve 
the new tractors will be financed primarily under walk away operating leases  and are not expected to require any significant deposits or down payments 
the company currently believes that cash generated from operating  financing and investing activities and cash available to it under the bank credit facility will be sufficient to meet the company s needs during other factors 
inflation can be expected to have an impact on most of the company s operating costs although the impact of inflation in recent years has been minimal 
management believes the continued intense competition for qualified drivers will lead to higher driver wages and recruiting costs in the future 
changes in market interest rates can be expected to impact the company to the extent that revenue equipment is added and replaced and because the company s bank financing is based on the prime rate 
the trucking industry is generally affected by customer business cycles and by seasonality 
revenues are also affected by inclement weather and holidays because revenues are directly related to available working days of shippers 
customers typically reduce shipments during and after the winter holiday season 
the company s revenues tend to follow this pattern and are strongest in the summer months 
generally  the second and third calendar quarters have higher load bookings than the fourth and first calendar quarters
