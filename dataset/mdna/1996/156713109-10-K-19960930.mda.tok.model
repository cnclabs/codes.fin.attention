item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and outlook the company recognized consolidated earnings from continuing operations and net earnings of  per share on sales of million  a return on equity  for its fiscal year ended june  the company recognized consolidated earnings from continuing operations of  
per share and consolidated net earnings  including a gain on disposal of discontinued operations  of  per share on sales of million  an return on equity  for its fiscal year ended june  the company s financial reporting for the fiscal year ended june  includes on a consolidated basis  for the first time  the accounts of insituform east s partnership interest in midsouth partners 
insituform east s investment in midsouth partners  and therefore the company s  was accounted for using the equity method in prior years 
the fiscal year change in consolidated reporting arises from a change in control of midsouth partners also trading as insituform midsouth  whereby insituform east obtained majority representation on the partnership management committee as a result of a june  arbitration award 
the change in control does not affect insituform east s unaltered equity share in partnership earnings and  therefore  financial consolidation of insituform east s now majority controlled subsidiary partnership has no effect on the previous  current or future shares of contribution by midsouth partners to the overall net earnings of insituform east or the company 
the company attributed its increased results to the record results of capitol copy  its copy machine products and services segment  and to a significant decrease in unallocated net general corporate expenses 
capitol copy recognized sales of million in fiscal year  as compared to million in fiscal year  as it continued to sell more high volume  higher priced units and expanded its service and supply customer base 
capitol copy contributed  up  in net earnings to cerbco 
insituform east  the company s pipeline rehabilitation segment  recognized sales of million in fiscal year  as compared to million in fiscal year  however  such increase is principally attributable to initiation  in fiscal year  of the inclusion of midsouth partners sales in consolidated sales totals 
insituform east contributed  down  in net earnings to cerbco  and attributed the decrease in its fiscal year earnings to a combination of adverse sales volume during the last six months of fiscal year resulting from harsh winter weather conditions and lower backlog levels  reduced margins on contracts performed by midsouth partners and increased semi fixed operating costs associated with expanded production capabilities 
subsidiary contributions were offset by unallocated net general corporate expenses in the amount of  down  including  down  related to the demands made of  and litigation being continued against  the company by two associated  minority stockholders in connection with the unconsummated private sale of a controlling interest in the company abandoned in september from inception in through the year ended june   legal fees and expenses resulting from this litigation totaled approximately million 
in august  a final order and judgment was rendered by the delaware court of chancery in favor of the defendants and denied in toto the plaintiffs request for legal fees and expenses totaling  this opinion was appealed to the delaware supreme court by the plaintiffs 
the supreme court issued its decision in april  concluding that the chancery court s opinion was affirmed in part and reversed in part  and this matter is remanded to the court of chancery for further determination of damages 
once those damages are fixed  the 
chancery 
court should proceed to examine anew any petition for counsel fees on behalf of the plaintiffs 
the plaintiffs filed a motion for post remand relief in may and  after briefings and oral argument  the chancery court issued its decision on september  the order and judgment embodying this ruling have not yet been entered 
for additional information concerning this matter  see part i  item  legal proceedings 
for financial information relating to cerbco s two operating segments  see part i  item b  financial information about industry segments 
after experiencing two favorable quarters in fiscal year  insituform east saw less favorable results in the second half of the year for the reasons stated above 
while there can be no assurances regarding future operating performance  based on the volume and mix of its present and expected backlog of customer orders  insituform east anticipates these less favorable results to extend or expand through the first quarter of fiscal year however  insituform east presently believes that anticipated increases in immediately workable backlog should result in favorable results over the remaining three quarters of fiscal year the company believes the trenchless pipeline reconstruction marketplace is continuing to expand  thereby enticing  however  the entry of ever more imitations and substitute products hoping that cheap price alone may permit them to succeed in a market otherwise dominated by insituform 
in those limited markets where the cheapest priced product may be deemed technically good enough  insituform is at a disadvantage 
strategic participation undertaken by the company in this market share segment to preserve competitive presence  usually at levels materially below normal margins  necessarily dilutes the overall margin performance of the company 
however  a majority of the company s customers already use or are implementing improved procurement specifications and contract award evaluation criteria emphasizing technical value instead of simply low price 
in a value and quality based market  insituform remains at a distinct advantage 
as customers and consulting engineers increasingly rely on quality based purchasing criteria to help ensure long term solutions to their infrastructure needs  they help clearly differentiate proven products such as insituform from cheaply priced trenchless substitutes with technical  performance and installation risks not equally tested by time or independent third parties 
the principal factor affecting insituform east s future performance remains the volatility of earnings as a function of sales volume at normal margins 
accordingly  because a substantial portion of insituform east s costs are semi fixed in nature  earnings can  at times  be severely reduced or eliminated during periods of depressed sales at normal margins or material increases in discounted sales  even where total revenues experience an apparent buoyancy or growth from the addition of discounted sales undertaken from time to time for strategic reasons 
conversely  at normal margins  increases in period sales typically leverage positive earnings significantly 
capitol copy has increased sales in each of the last six years  growing from sales of million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  in a sales and service territory consisting of the cities and counties in the washington  dc metropolitan area  and since july  the contiguous baltimore metropolitan area 
earnings have increased from approximately million to million in this same six year period 
again  while there can be no assurances  the company presently expects continued favorable results from this operating segment throughout fiscal year results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the relative percentages that certain items of expense and earnings bear to the sales of cerbco and the percentage increases in the dollar amounts of each item from period to period
