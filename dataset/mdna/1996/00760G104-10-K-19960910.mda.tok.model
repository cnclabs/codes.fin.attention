overview the company is a specialty consumer finance company engaged in acquiring  securitizing and servicing finance contracts originated by dealers in connection with the sale of late model used and  to a lesser extent  new cars to consumers with sub prime credit 
since commencing the acquisition of finance contracts in may  through june   the company has acquired approximately million of finance contracts  of which million have been securitized in thirteen offerings of asset backed securities

the quarters ended december   march  are before write downs of million  million and million  respectively  taken on prior retained interests in securitized receivables 
excludes finance contracts in bankruptcy  authorized for repossission and still eligible for reinststement 
revenues the company s primary sources of revenues consist of two components gains from securitization transactions and interest income 
gains from securitization transactions 
the company warehouses the finance contracts it acquires and periodically sells them to a trust  which in turn sells asset backed securities to investors 
by securitizing its finance contracts  the company is able to lock in the difference gross spread between the annual rate of interest paid by the consumer apr on the finance contracts acquired and the interest rate on the asset backed securities sold certificate rate 
when the company securitizes its finance contracts  it records a gain from securitization transactions and establishes an asset referred to as retained interest in securitized receivables 
gains from securitization transactions are equal to the retained interest on the securitized receivables plus the difference between the net proceeds from the securitization and the cost including the cost of vsi policy and credit default premiums to the company of the finance contracts sold 
the retained interest on securitized receivables represents the estimated present value of the estimated future cash flows to be received by the company  discounted at a market based rate  taking into consideration i contractual obligations of the obligors  ii amounts due to the investors in asset backed securities  iii various costs of the securitizations  including the effects of hedging transactions  if any  and iv adjustments to the cash flows to reflect estimated prepayments of finance contracts and losses incurred in connection with defaults 
subsequent to securitization  the company continues to service the securitized finance contracts  for which it recognizes servicing fees over the life of the securitization 
retained interest in securitized receivables represents the difference between the weighted average finance contract rate earned and the rate paid on certificates issued to the investors in the securitization  less servicing fees and other costs over the life of the securitization 
retained interest in securitized receivables is computed by taking into account certain assumptions regarding prepayments  defaults  servicing and other costs 
the company reviews on a quarterly basis the retained interest in securitized receivables 
if actual experience differs from the company s assumptions or to the extent that market and economic changes occur that adversely impact the assumptions utilized in determining the retained interest in securitized receivables  the company records a charge against gains from securitization transactions 
the discount rate utilized in determining the retained interest in securitized receivables and gain from securitization transactions is based on the company s estimate of the yield required by a third party purchaser of such instrument 
the company also bases these assumptions on the performance characteristics of the company s finance contract portfolio to date 
the company s default assumptions are based on estimated repossession rates  proceeds from the liquidation of repossessed vehicles  proceeds from vsi policy coverage and recoveries from the company s credit default insurance 
interest income 
interest income consists of i interest income earned on finance contracts ii interest income earned on leases the company ceased funding leases in the quarter ended september   iii servicing fees net of expenses  iv the accretion of finance contract acquisition discounts net of related capitalized costs and v the amortization of capitalized costs net of origination discounts for leases 
other factors influencing interest income during a given fiscal period include a the annual percentage rate of the finance contracts acquired  b the aggregate principal balance of finance contracts acquired and funded through the company s warehouse credit facilities prior to securitization  and c the length of time such finance contracts are funded by the warehouse credit facilities prior to securitization 
finance contract acquisition growth has a significant impact on the amount of interest income earned by the company

credit loss experience an allowance for credit losses is maintained for all finance contracts held for sale and for all finance contracts held for investment 
management evaluates the reasonableness of the assumptions employed by reviewing credit loss experience  delinquencies  repossession trends  the size of the finance contract portfolio and general economic conditions and trends 
if necessary  assumptions are changed to reflect historical experience to the extent it deviates materially from that which was assumed 
if a delinquency exists and a default is deemed inevitable or the collateral is in jeopardy  and in no event later than the th day of delinquency  the company s collections department will initiate the repossession of the financed vehicle 
bonded  insured outside repossession agencies are used to secure involuntary repossessions 
in most jurisdictions  notice to the borrower of the company s intention to sell the repossessed automobile is required  whereupon the borrower may exercise certain rights to cure his or her default or redeem the automobile 
following the expiration of the legally required notice period  the repossessed vehicle is sold at a wholesale auto auction  usually within days of the repossession 
the company monitors vehicles set for auction  and procures an appraisal under the vsi policy prior to sale 
liquidation proceeds are applied to the borrower s outstanding obligation under the finance contract and loss deficiency claims under the vsi policy and credit default insurance policy are then filed 
the company reports the remaining deficiency as a net charge off against the allowance for credit losses for automobile finance receivables owned by the company 
for finance contracts held in securitization trusts  charge offs are accounted for in accordance with the underlying pooling and servicing agreements 
because of the company s limited operating history  its finance contract portfolio is unseasoned 
accordingly  delinquency and charge off rates in the portfolio may not fully reflect the rates that may apply when the average holding period for finance contracts in the portfolio is longer 
increases in the delinquency and or charge off rates in the portfolio would adversely affect the company s ability to obtain credit or securitize its finance contracts and would have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition

gross charge offs equals the aggregate balance of finance contracts liquidated  including those previously sold in securitization transactions  less all recoveries from the sale of the financed vehicles 
repossession and liquidation expenses are included in gross charge offs 
since august  the company no longer deposits money to a segregated account from which losses incurred under a policy would be paid 
net charge offs are gross charge offs reduced by credit default insurance proceeds received relating to the defaulted finance contracts 
net charge off amount divided by the aggregate balance of finance contracts relating to vehicles liquidated 
the company has prepared analyses  based on its own credit experience and available industry data  to identify the relationship between finance contract delinquency and default rates at the various stages of a finance contract repayment term 
the results of these analyses  which have been incorporated into the company s methodology of determining gains from securitization transactions suggest that the probability of a finance contract becoming delinquent or going into default is highest during the seasoning period that occurs between the sixth to the eighteenth month payment period from the acquisition date 
if the rate of the company s finance contract acquisition volume continues to escalate  an increasingly greater portion of the company s finance contract portfolio is expected to fall into the seasoning period described above  which may cause a rise in the overall finance contract portfolio delinquency and default rates  without regard to underwriting performance 
assuming no changes in any other factors that may affect delinquency and default rates  the company believes this trend should stabilize or reverse when the volume of mature finance contracts with lower delinquency and default rates is sufficient to offset the total finance contract portfolio delinquency and default rates 
the company believes delinquencies and losses can be mitigated through an in house collection program 
accordingly  the company responded to the increased rates of delinquencies and losses in the fiscal year ended june  by entering into a sub servicing agreement with its third party servicer in april  providing for the transfer of specific collection functions to the company 
through this arrangement the company assumed responsibility for all customer contact with respect to all existing leases and with respect to finance contracts that were included in the company s december securitization transaction and all finance contracts acquired thereafter 
in addition  the company assumed responsibility for liquidation activities on its entire finance contract portfolio including securitized finance contracts at such time 
because of the company s limited operating history and the rapid growth of its finance contract acquisitions  a significant portion of its finance contract portfolio is unseasoned 
accordingly  delinquency and loss rates in the portfolio may not be indicative of rates the company may experience over time 
there can be no assurance that the performance of the company s portfolio will be maintained  or that the rate of future defaults and or losses will be consistent with prior experience or at levels that will not adversely affect the company s profitability 
repossession experience static pool analysis the company s finance contract portfolio is continuing to grow rapidly 
the company does not record its provision for credit losses based on a percentage of the company s finance contract portfolio outstanding because percentages can be favorably affected by large balances of recently acquired finance contracts 
the company utilizes actual dollar levels of delinquencies and charge offs and analyzes the data on a static pool basis 
the company s goal is to complete the liquidation process as quickly as possible 
all repossessed vehicles are sold at wholesale auction 
the company is responsible for the costs of repossession  transportation and storage 
the company s net charge off per repossession equals the unpaid balance less the auction proceeds net of associated costs and less proceeds from insurance claims 
the following table provides static pool analysis of the company s portfolio as of june  for the periods shown

the increase in fiscal is due to the change in the company s credit default insurance policy 
since august  the company no longer deposits money to a segregated account from which losses incurred under the policy would be paid 
the new policies provide for the company to bear all losses until a deductible amount is met 
the rise in net charge off per unit cost commencing in august reflects the application of the deductible under the policy

liquidity and capital resources the company s business requires substantial cash to support its operating activities 
the principal cash requirements include i amounts necessary to acquire automobile finance contracts pending securitization and ii cash held from time to time in restricted spread accounts to support securitizations and other securitization expenses 
the company also uses material amounts of cash for operating expenses and debt service and  on occasion  to hedge interest rate risk 
the company has operated on a negative operating cash flow basis and expects to continue to do so for so long as the company s volume of finance contract acquisition continues to grow 
the company has funded these negative operating cash flows principally through borrowings from financial institutions and sales of equity securities  among other resources 
there can be no assurance that the company will have access to capital markets in the future or that financing will be available to satisfy the company s operating and debt service requirements or to fund future growth 
if these resources are not available on terms acceptable to the company  the company may have to curtail its finance contract acquisition volume levels 
the company s external capital resources primarily consist of the warehouse credit facilities and the company s securitization program 
when the company securitizes finance contracts it repays a portion of its outstanding warehouse indebtedness with the proceeds from such securitizations  making such portion available for future borrowing 
the company expects to securitize its assets at least quarterly  although there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so 
the company also continues to seek additional arrangements with financial institutions with respect to the disposition of its portfolio assets 
in addition  the company has borrowed against its retained interests to increase liquidity 
the company is exploring the feasibility of securitizing pools of its leases or selling whole leases as possible complements to its current financing arrangements 
the company ceased the funding of leases in the first quarter of fiscal the following table sets forth the major components of the increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents for the periods shown year ended june  dollars in thousands net cash used in operating activities    net cash provided by used in investing activities 



 net cash provided by financing activities    net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents   includes net cash used in acquisition of automobile finance contracts of  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal includes net cash used in provided by warehouse credit facilities of  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal net cash used in operating activities primarily represents cash flows utilized to support the company s acquisition of automobile finance contracts  including amounts representing capitalized acquisition costs  net of cash proceeds of sales  including through securitizations  and repayments from automobile finance receivables 
the cash used to acquire automobile finance contracts is generated primarily by financing activities under the company s warehouse credit facilities  discussed below 
a further significant source of cash used in operating activities is net income offset by non cash revenue items  most notably unrealized gains on securitization transactions  which is expected to generate cash in future periods 
the unrealized gains principally represent the discounted present value of the amount of anticipated collections from securitized receivables over the amounts due to investors in the securitizations 
these amounts were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
during the years ended june   and  the company received cash proceeds of  million and million  respectively  from its retained interests in securitized receivables which were utilized in meeting both its operating needs and its debt repayment requirements under the related financing agreements 
during the first quarter of the fiscal year ended june   the company also sold substantially all of its previously acquired retained interests in securitized receivables  resulting in a non cash use of operating funds of million 
the company generated cash proceeds from investing activities in these transactions of million  providing it with excess cash receipts of  which were also utilized in meeting its operating cash needs 
other non cash adjustments include depreciation and amortization  which amounted to  for the fiscal year ended june    for the fiscal year ended june  and  for the fiscal year ended june   provision for credit losses  which amounted to  for the fiscal year ended june    for the fiscal year ended june  and million for fiscal year ended june   and provision benefit for deferred income taxes of  for the fiscal year ended june   million for the fiscal year ended june  and million for the fiscal year ended june  in addition  as of june  and  the company released  and  respectively  of the escrowed shares of which  shares were released to the executive officers of the company in and  shares were released to the executive officers of the company in and consequently incurred non cash charges of  and  respectively 
the charges did not affect the company s total stockholders equity or working capital 
the company also incurred non cash charges of million and  for the fiscal year ended june  for write downs and valuations allowances  respectively  on retained interests in securitized receivables and a note receivable  respectively  with no such charges in the prior periods 
to the extent that the foregoing activities were net users of cash  such cash was provided primarily by borrowings under notes payable of million for the fiscal year ended june  and million for the fiscal year ended june  secured by retained interests in securitized receivables created in the company s automobile finance contract securitizations 
principal repayments are made from the company s proceeds received from pay downs on such assets  which amounted to million for the fiscal year ended june  and million for the comparable period 
the borrowing base on the retained interests in securitized receivables is determined on each transaction through a calculation that incorporates prevailing prepayment default and loss experience 
consequently  as each securitization transaction becomes seasoned  it experiences a period of higher incidence of default and loss  resulting in a repayment on the notes secured by the allocable retained interests in securitized receivables 
the company made additional principal pay downs of million in excess of proceeds received for the fiscal year ended june  and million for the comparable period 
the company s cash flows and results of operations may be affected adversely in the near term by rising interest rates  since not all costs of funds  which under the company s warehouse credit facilities are at floating rates of interest  can be immediately passed on to consumers  whose finance contracts are at fixed rates of interest 
in addition  rising interest rates would result in a decrease in the company s net spreads on securitization transactions thereby decreasing future projected cash flows from retained interests in securitized receivables 
furthermore  the company s discount rate utilized in determining its borrowing base may also rise  decreasing the amount available to borrow 
moreover  interest rates charged by the company may be more significantly affected by factors other than prevailing interest rates  most notably geographic distribution and varying state interest rate limitations 
the company has a hedging policy which seeks to limit the risks associated with changes in interest rates 
in connection with its securitization transactions  the company enters into pooling and servicing agreements the agreements in which its finance contracts are sold to a trust which  in turn  sells securities to investors 
generally  the company is required to make an initial cash deposit to the trust as form of a credit enhancement for the securitization 
the terms of the agreements generally require that the excess servicing cash flows of the finance contracts be retained in a bank account under the control of the trustee the reserve fund until the reserve fund meets predetermined deposit requirements 
any cash flows in excess of reserve fund requirements are released to the company on a monthly basis 
for the fiscal years ended june   and  the company received  million and million  respectively  in excess servicing cash flows from reserve funds 
in the event that the finance contracts owned by the trusts fail to meet predetermined delinquency and loss performance measures  the agreements require that the trustee retain excess servicing cash flows until the reserve fund attains pre set incrementally higher levels of credit enhancements 
the predetermined performance measures are not always maintained on a consistent monthly basis  thus deferring the release of the cash flows to the company from the reserve fund of the applicable trust 
in addition  certain of the agreements required the company to deposit additional cash into the trust s reserve fund if its initial minimum required levels were not met within a predetermined time frame 
for the fiscal year ended june   the company paid additional cash contributions to certain reserve funds of million and in august paid a million deposit which  management believes to be its final payment to reserve funds under the existing agreements 
the company s warehouse credit facility with iii finance ltd 
for automobile finance contracts provides that the company may borrow the lesser of million less the amount outstanding under the company s lease warehouse credit facility with iii finance ltd

in addition  each warehouse credit facility requires a prepayment fee of of the outstanding principal balance of the finance contracts voluntarily prepaid  including in connection with the sale of finance contracts

in may  the company secured an additional warehouse credit facility with greenwich capital  a subsidiary of long term credit bank of japan which has recently entered into an agreement to sell greenwich capital  to natwest markets for million  which will provide the company with additional flexibility to purchase greater volumes of receivables or warehouse automobile receivables for longer periods 
the facility is secured primarily by the company s finance contracts and bears interest at the rate of the one month libor plus at august   adjusted monthly 
principal payments are made to the extent that principal is paid on the underlying collateral  and are required to be made if the underlying collateral does not meet certain specified conditions

the company is currently in the process of seeking additional capital  however  there can be no assurance as to the availability or timing of such transactions 
inflation while inflation has not had a material impact upon the company s results of operations  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
increases in the inflation rate generally result in increased interest rates and can be expected to result in increases in the company s operating expenses 
as the company borrows funds at variable rates and generally acquires finance contracts at an average interest rate of approximately  increased interest rates will increase the borrowing costs of the company  and such increased borrowing costs may not be offset by increases in the interest rates with respect to finance contracts acquired 
seasonality the company s operations are affected to some extent by seasonal fluctuations 
finance contract acquisitions tend to increase in march through june and september and october  while finance contract acquisitions are lowest in december and january 
delinquencies also tend to be higher during certain holiday periods  particularly at calendar year end
