item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal revenues for the year ended february  fiscal were billion  an increase of approximately million or over the year ended january  fiscal 
this increase was primarily due to the revenues generated by the branch locations acquired from fnow in december and the acquisition of fnow in august  the addition of new network integrators  an additional week of sales in fiscal due to the company s week fiscal year and industry growth 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased from in fiscal to in fiscal this increase was primarily due to the higher gross margin percent realized by the fnow locations which sell directly to end users  partially offset by continued competitive pricing pressures throughout the industry and special inventory related charges of approximately million recorded in the second quarter of fiscal which represented estimates of inventory obsolescence  damaged merchandise and inventory losses 
management has taken and continues to take actions which it believes will minimize the inventory related charges in the future  including consolidating warehouses and upgrading existing and implementing new management information systems 
these actions have reduced and are expected to eliminate the systems stresses and outages and their impact on gross margins that the company experienced during the last half of fiscal competitive pressures and their impact on margins are expected to continue in the future 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million of revenues in fiscal compared to million of revenues in fiscal during fiscal  the company incurred charges of approximately million consisting primarily of severance costs in connection with a reduction in the company s workforce and a charge related to certain management information systems projects reevaluated and realigned following the acquisition of fnow 
other causes of the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses include operating costs for the fnow locations  costs to service the higher volume of revenues  larger network  new programs and expanded vendor and sku base  and expenses and depreciation relative to the enhancement of existing and implementation of new management information systems 
these increases were offset in part by savings following the elimination of certain peripheral ventures 
in addition  certain costs were incurred in fiscal  including a million reserve for litigation and arbitration matters and costs relating to the implementation of ie ie is a project designed to transform the company to a process driven model 
it is anticipated that the workforce reductions and other cost cutting measures implemented by the company will somewhat mitigate the higher selling  general and administrative costs required to support the operations of fnow 
amortization of intangibles increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to goodwill related to the fnow acquisition 
investment and other income declined in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the use of available cash for the payment of cash dividends and share repurchases  the acquisition of certain assets of branch locations from fnow in december  capital expenditures and the repayment of fnow s bank and finance company debt following the acquisition in august interest expense increased from fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of the company s more frequent use of its available financing arrangements for inventory financing and working capital purposes and the addition of million of long term debt in october the company s effective tax rate for fiscal was a benefit compared to a provision for fiscal the effect of non deductible goodwill amortization on the pre tax loss in fiscal was the primary reason for the difference in the effective tax rate

the addition of new network integrators  continued demand from existing network integrators for premium brand name and advanced technology products and industry growth were primarily responsible for the increase in revenues 
however  the company believes that operating inefficiencies caused by systems stresses and outages  discussed below  during the last half of fiscal caused a loss of potential sales 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal the decrease in gross margin percent is primarily attributable to intensified competitive pricing pressures as certain manufacturers expanded their distribution channels and the impact of management information systems stresses and outages  offset in part by the higher volume of revenues generated from higher margin advanced technology products and as a result of taking advantage of purchasing and early payment discount opportunities 
the systems related stresses and outages were caused by the cumulative effect of operating out of multiple warehouses  the addition of new vendors and sku s and the expansion of on line services to the company s network integrators 
this resulted in reduced customer service levels and unfavorably impacted gross margins as the company reduced prices to customers  incurred inventory losses  and incurred additional freight costs to expedite shipments

in fiscal and fiscal  revenues from these eliminated peripheral ventures were less than of consolidated revenues and operating losses were million and million  respectively
