fiscal compared to fiscal sales decreased from million to million  a decrease 
although the company relocated and expanded one store in august and opened one new store in each of november and which added to sales  these increases where offset by a comparable store sales decrease of  because of warm and dry weather in california during the third quarter of fiscal  when compared to the same period last year  which severely impacted the sales of winter related merchandise 
specifically  sales of winter related products decreased 
in addition  the slow christmas sales experienced by retailers nationally  along with the impact of a sluggish economy in southern california  also affected the company s sales 
gross profit for the period decreased as a percent of sales from to  primarily as a result of increased inventory shrinkage  as well as  markdowns taken to stimulate the sales of winter related merchandise 
selling  general and administrative expenses remained relatively constant as a percent of sales  compared to last year  even though sales decreased  which obscured the full impact of management s implementation of cost reducing programs 
the primary components of selling  general and administrative expenses are labor  rent and other occupancy costs and advertising 
interest expense increased to million from  due to an increase in average debt outstanding

due to decreased net income 
fourth quarter compared to fourth quarter sales increased from million to million  a increase 
the company relocated and expanded one store in august and opened one new store in november which added to sales  however  these increases where offset by a comparable store sales decrease of  due to the adverse impact of unseasonably warm weather in california on the sales of winter related merchandise 
gross profit for the period decreased as a percent of sales from to  primarily as a result of increased inventory shrinkage 
because less ski related merchandise was purchased during fiscal due to management s focus on improving procurement practices  markdowns taken to stimulate sales of winter related merchandise were high by historical measures  although equal to the prior year as a percent of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percent of sales from to reflecting the impact of management s recently implemented cost reduction program 
interest expense remained relatively constant   compared to  for the same period last year 
lower interest rates were offset by larger average debt outstanding 
the effective income tax rate as a percent of pretax loss for the fourth quarter is compared to for the same period of fiscal net loss decreased from million to million and loss per share decreased from 
to 
despite lower gross profit margins due to relatively lower selling  general and administrative expenses 
fiscal compared to fiscal sales increased from million to million  a increase 
the company relocated and expanded one store in june and opened one new store in november which added to sales 
in addition  comparable store sales increased  a disappointing increase given that california returned to more typical winter weather patterns in fiscal after warm and dry weather in fiscal resulted in the lack of snowfall in ski areas frequented by southern california residents  and the fact that five stores were temporarily closed in fiscal due to the january  northridge earthquake 
christmas sales were slow  similar to the experience of retailers nationally  and ski clothing and equipment sales did not increase as expected despite improved skiing conditions  possibly due to stagnant economic conditions in southern california 
gross profit for the period increased as a percent of sales from to  primarily because lower margin sales from promotional and off site sales events during the third quarter of fiscal constituted a smaller portion of overall sales than during the third quarter of however  higher margins in the third quarter of fiscal were partially offset by reduced margins during the fourth quarter of fiscal as disappointing sales of winter related products prompted significant post ski season markdowns in order to stimulate sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses remained relatively constant as a percent of sales  compared to last year 
the primary components of selling  general and administrative expenses are labor  rent and other occupancy costs and advertising 
interest expense increased to  from  due to higher interest rates and an increase in average debt outstanding 
the effective tax rate as a percent of pretax income for fiscal is

these rates differ from the statutory rate of as a result of permanent differences between financial reporting and tax basis income and the relatively low level of pretax income 
net income increased to  from a loss of  primarily due to the previously discussed increase in sales and gross profit margins 
earnings per share increased from

due to increased net income 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary capital requirements are for inventory  expansion and remodeling 
historically  the company s liquidity needs have been met by cash from operations  credit terms from vendors and bank borrowings 
the company believes that these sources will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated cash requirements for the next to fiscal years 
net cash provided by operating activities was million and million for fiscal and  respectively  while for fiscal  net cash used in operating activities was  net loss accounted for the use of million and  cash in fiscal and  respectively 
net income provided cash of  in fiscal depreciation provided million  million and million of cash for fiscal   and  respectively 
during fiscal and inventories decreased million and million as a result of aggressive markdowns taken to stimulate sales of ski related products 
in addition  the implementation of a perpetual inventory system helped reduce overall inventory during fiscal during fiscal  inventories increased million primarily due to slower than expected sales during the christmas season and the fourth quarter 
accounts payable decreased million for fiscal primarily due to reduced inventory 
for fiscal accounts payable increased million as a result of increased inventory 
for fiscal the increase in accounts payable was due to changes in the timing of payments 
there were no income taxes payable at either march  or due to the loss or low taxable income and overpayment of estimated taxes 
for fiscal  taxes payable decreased million due to the payment of taxes accrued in fiscal net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the company used a substantial portion of this cash to open new stores 
in each of fiscal and  one store was relocated and one new store was opened 
two new stores were opened in fiscal in fiscal  and  ongoing capital expenditures for the company s existing stores totalled million  million and million  respectively 
historically  net cash used or provided by financing activities has resulted primarily from the advance or pay down of a revolving credit line 
during fiscal through fiscal  the company maintained a revolving line of credit with wells fargo bank  na the prior lender 
during fiscal  the company was authorized to borrow from up to million to up to million  based on the company s projected seasonal needs  at an interest rate of prime plus 
for fiscal  and and  peak borrowings on that credit line were million  million  million  respectively 
in addition  the prior lender provided an additional million in the form of a term commitment for the purpose of financing the opening of future new stores  of which no money was borrowed during fiscal the balance  when drawn on this term commitment  was to be amortized over a year period  beginning june  during the last two quarters of fiscal  the company violated certain financial covenants set forth in the loan agreement with the prior lender 
these violations were either waived by the prior lender or were rendered moot because the prior lender s loan was paid off with the proceeds from the new credit facility described below 
in may  the company obtained a two year credit facility from bankamerica business credit  inc  an affiliate of bank of america the new lender  which provides a new line of credit to borrow up to million less the amount of any outstanding draws on a maximum of million in authorized letters of credit and or any applicable limitations on maximum borrowings 
maximum borrowings generally may not exceed of the value of eligible inventory and may also be reduced  under certain circumstances  to reflect reserves or other adjustments 
interest shall accrue at prime plus or at the election of the company and assuming certain conditions have been satisfied  at an annual rate equal to over the new lender s libor rate 
the initial proceeds of million from the new financing were used to extinguish all of the company s obligations under the credit facility with the prior lender on may  the company s obligation to the new lender is secured by a first priority lien on the company s non real estate assets  and the company is subject to several restrictive covenants as set forth in the loan and security agreement with the new lender which is attached as an exhibit to this form k 
the principal operating covenants require the company to maintain minimum levels of net worth and cash flow coverage  restrict capital expenditures and lease payments  and limit the amount of dividend payments 
the company currently is in full compliance with these covenants and expects to remain in compliance during the term of the credit facility 
management also believes that these operating covenants provide the company with greater flexibility than did the operating covenants set forth in the agreement with the prior lender 
however  unexpected conditions could cause the company to alter its plans to avoid a breach of the agreement with the new lender or could cause the company to violate a restrictive covenant or otherwise breach that agreement 
if a breach occurs  the new lender will have all rights customarily provided to a secured lender  including the right to foreclose on the secured collateral or to accelerate the maturity of the loan obligations 
no cash dividends have been declared on common stock in fiscal the company intends to retain earnings for use in the operation and limited expansion of its business and  therefore  does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
in addition  the amount of dividend payment is restricted in the agreement with the new lender 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations as noted previously  the months of november  december and january have historically accounted for the largest percentage of the company s net sales and all its net income 
as is typical with other sporting goods retailers  the company s sales volume increases significantly during the christmas holiday season and the peak ski season generally corresponds to this three month period 
the company s operating results are also influenced by the amount and timing of snowfall at the ski areas frequented by those living in southern california  particularly the mammoth mountain ski resort in the eastern sierra nevada mountains 
the company believes that snowfall at the mammoth mountain ski area generally is an indicator of the company s likely sales of ski apparel and equipment 
first  because of prevailing weather patterns  the mammoth snowfall is generally similar to that of southern california ski areas 
second  for more than twenty years  the company has experienced better customer demand for skiing apparel and equipment when there were early snowfalls and excellent ski conditions at mammoth 
an early snowfall is more likely to influence sales because it extends the demand for ski apparel and equipment 
a late snowfall may have the opposite effect 
the snowfall at mammoth mountain over the past years has ranged from to inches and has averaged inches for the three months ended january the following table sets forth the snowfall at mammoth mountain for the three month period ended january over the last five years three months snowfall ended january in inches even though fiscal snowfall for the three months ended january is above average  of the snowfall occurred in the month of january and therefore did not produce the positive effect on sales that might have been expected by a more even distribution of snowfall over the three month period 
in addition  the effect of significant early snowfall on company sales was less than expected during fiscal management believes this was possibly due in part to then stagnant economic conditions in southern california 
the effect of snowfall on the company s results has been mitigated to some extent by management s attempt to diversify the company s product mix 
sales of ski apparel and equipment have decreased over the last five fiscal years from to of total sales revenue 
suppliers in the ski industry require that commitments must be made for purchases of apparel and equipment by april for fall delivery  and only limited quantities of merchandise can be reordered during the fall 
consequently  the company places its orders in the spring anticipating a good snowfall in the winter 
if the snowfall does not at least provide an adequate base or occurs late in the season  as was the case in fiscal and  or if sales do not meet projections as occurred in fiscal  the company may be required to mark down its ski merchandise 
generally  ski merchandise carries a higher margin than other sporting goods items
