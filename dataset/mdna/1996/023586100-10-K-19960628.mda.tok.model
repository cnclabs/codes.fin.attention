pursuant to separate indemnification agreements  the company has agreed to indemnify the defendants the fullest extent permitted by law or the company s articles of incorporation or by laws  for all expenses and damages incurred by the defendants in this proceeding  subject to certain exceptions 
the director defendants have filed for protection under chapter of the federal bankruptcy laws  resulting in the issuance of an order automatically staying the execution of the judgment against those defendants 
those defendants  in cooperation with the company  filed plans of reorganization in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of arizona all of which propose the same funding and treatment of the plaintiffs claims resulting from the judgment in the shoen litigation 
the plans of reorganization  as amended and restated on february   were confirmed by the bankruptcy court on march  the plans  as confirmed  shall collectively be referred to as the plan 
on october   the company repurchased  shares of common stock held by maran  inc a nevada corporation maran  in exchange for approximately million and entered into a settlement agreement with mary anna shoen eaton shoen eaton whereby in exchange for approximately million  shoen eaton released the director defendants and the company from any liability relating to shoen litigation

the company also paid to thermar approximately million of statutory post judgment interest on such amount 
as a result of the foregoing transactions  the balance of the judgment has been reduced to approximately million  plus interest claimed by the plaintiffs 
with respect to the remaining plaintiffs in the shoen litigation  the plan provides for the payment by the company of approximately million in exchange for  shares of common stock held by four of the plaintiffs and for the payment by the company of approximately million to certain of the plaintiffs as damages 
as of the date hereof  an issue remains regarding whether or not the remaining plaintiffs are entitled to statutory post judgment interest at the rate of per year 
as of june   total accrued interest on the outstanding balance of the judgment is approximately million and is accruing at the rate of approximately  per day 
briefing regarding post petition date interest and the computation thereof was completed june  a july  hearing date has been set by the bankruptcy court 
those reserved issues do not affect the finality of the bankruptcy court s order confirming the plan confirmation order 
if the dispute regarding post petition date interest is decided adversely to the director defendants and the company  they intend to appeal any such decision 
pending the final resolution of the post petition date interest dispute including all appeals by either side  the company intends  if necessary  to deposit either cash or  in appropriate circumstances  an irrevocable letter of credit into an escrow account to secure payment of the post petition date interest 
the amount of the escrow deposit would be in such case equal to the accrued interest to the date funds are deposited into escrow 
as provided in the plan  the escrow deposit  plus interest thereon  will remain until all aspects of the post petition date interest dispute have been finally decided  including dischargeability litigation which the plaintiffs filed against the director defendants in the bankruptcy court as an alternative means of trying to collect post petition date interest 
the dischargeability litigation has not been set for trial and is likely to await the outcome of the other aspects of the post petition date interest dispute 
on march   the bankruptcy court issued a confirmation order in each director defendant s chapter case 
this order provided that the effective date for the plan ie  the date on which the company will pay the plaintiffs an aggregate of approximately million and the plaintiffs will surrender their common stock will be no later than october  absent compelling circumstances justifying an extension of that date 
as of the date hereof  the company has not yet determined all of the sources of cash which will be used to fund the plan 
the company has identified approximately million of surplus or non essential assets  including  but not limited to  surplus real estate and mortgage notes  which will be sold to raise a portion of the cash needed to fund the plan 
in order to comply with certain covenants in the company s current credit agreements following the repurchase of the remaining plaintiffs stock  it may be necessary to increase stockholders equity by issuing capital stock 
such capital stock may consist of dividend paying preferred stock  series b common stock  common stock  or a combination of the foregoing 
because the company has not determined all of the sources of cash to fund the plan  the company is unable to determine with certainty the impact the plan will have on the company s prospective financial condition  results of operations  cash flows  or capital expenditure plans 
however  as a result of funding the plan  the company may incur additional costs in the future in the form of dividends on any dividend paying stock issued to fund the plan and or interest on borrowed funds 
furthermore  following consummation of the plan  and without giving effect to any capital stock which may be issued as part of the plan funding  the company s outstanding common stock would be reduced by  shares  in addition to the  shares repurchased from maran on october   the  shares repurchased from lss on january   and the  shares repurchased from thermar on february  other uncertainties remain about the plan  including the tax treatment of the payments made and to be made by the company pursuant to the plan 
specifically  the company plans to deduct for income tax purposes approximately million of the payments made or to be made by the company to the plaintiffs  which will reduce the company s income tax liability 
while the company believes that such income tax deductions are appropriate  there can be no assurance that any such deductions ultimately will be allowed in full 
accordingly  for tax and other reasons  the plan could result in material changes in the company s financial condition  results of operations  and earnings per common share 
furthermore  in the event the fair value of the consideration paid by the company to the plaintiffs is in excess of the fair value of the stock repurchased by the company  the company will be required to record an expense equal to that difference 
based upon the uncertainties surrounding the funding of the plan  the amount of such expense  if any  is not estimable as of the date hereof 
no such expense was recorded for book purposes related to the maran shoen eaton  lss and thermar transactions 
no provision has been made in the company s financial statements for any payments to be made to the plaintiffs in the future 
for the reasons set forth above  the plan could have the effect of reducing the company s net income
