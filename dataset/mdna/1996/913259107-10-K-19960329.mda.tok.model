s earnings performance primarily reflects increased electric base revenue from higher energy sales by unitil s retail operating companies as well as the continued ability to effectively manage and control the system s operating costs 
in  unitil continued its history of steadily increasing its dividend 
common stock dividends in were per share  an increase of over the s annual dividend and a dividend payout ratio of 
at its january meeting  the unitil board of director s increased the quarterly dividend by to per share  resulting in the current effective annualized dividend of per share 
year in review the system s total electric base revenue was up by in due to an overall increase in kilowatt hour sales and kilowatt billing demands of and  respectively 
this increase was mainly due to continuing growth in the demand for energy by the system s largest industrial and commercial customers 
in  kilowatt hour sales grew by to this group of customers 
in addition  extreme seasonal weather patterns in also played a significant role on sales to the more weather sensitive residential and commercial customer groups 
in the third quarter  electric sales used for cooling purposes was supported by one of the hottest third quarters on record in new england 
in contrast  there was a significant decline in weather sensitive energy sales during the first quarter of the year  during one of the mildest winter heating seasons in years 
the weather in this quarter  as measured by heating degree days  was warmer than the same period last year 
as a result  electric kilowatt hour sales to residential customers  whose usage was impacted most by the mild first quarter  remained relatively unchanged from the prior year 
the following table details total kilowatt hour sales in each of the last three years by customer group kwh sales s residential    commercial    large commercial industrial    other sales    total kwh sales    the mild winter in the first quarter of also had a negative impact on gas sales for the year 
in  gas base revenue decreased by due to lower gas firm therm sales compared to the prior year 
the bulk of the decrease in firm therm sales was caused by a decrease of more than in sales to residential customers  reflecting the extremely mild winter heating season 
the following table details total firm therm sales in each of the last three years by customer group firm therm sales s residential    commercial    industrial    total therm sales    with more normal winter weather  growth of both electric and gas sales in the first quarter of should show marked improvement over in addition  electric energy sales to industrial and commercial customers are also expected to continue to increase in as new businesses look to unitil for their energy services and existing customers expand their operations 
in particular  the company will be aggressively marketing its energy banktm program throughout energy banktm is an innovative economic development program designed to bring low cost energy to new and expanding industrial customers 
with rates in the range of cents kwh this program offers electric energy at a price that is equal to the national average industrial rate and is below the current average industrial rate in new england

operating expenses fuel and purchased power reflects the cost of fuel used in electric generation and wholesale energy and capacity purchased to meet the unitil system s electric energy requirements 
fuel and purchased power expenses normally recoverable from customers through periodic cost recovery adjustment mechanisms increased million  or in compared to the change reflects an increase in the system s total energy requirements in  partially offset by reduction in the average unit cost of the system s power supply portfolio 
power supply markets continued to be very competitive in  providing many opportunities to achieve cost savings through active participation in the market and management of the system s resource portfolio 
the combined resource portfolio of the unitil system is comprised of a variety of power supply sources  including owned generation  utility purchase power contracts and purchases from non utility generators 
the unitil system s total energy supply resources for were comprised of from subsidiary owned generation  from various utility purchased power contracts  and representing purchases from non utility generation units 
in compared to  fuel and purchase power expenses were relatively unchanged reflecting favorable pricing of existing long term power supply commitments and competitive short term power supply markets 
purchased gas reflects gas purchased and made to supply the system s total gas energy requirements 
purchased gas decreased by approximately  or in as compared to significant decreases in gas prices due to favorable gas supply markets more than offset the increase in therms purchased including gas purchased for interruptible sales 
purchased gas increased by almost  or in as compared to  based on an increase of in therms purchased  offset by a lower unit cost of gas 
purchased gas is normally recoverable from customers through the cost of gas adjustment mechanism 
under order  the federal energy regulatory commission ferc has allowed gas pipeline suppliers to recover prudently incurred costs resulting from the transition into a deregulated environment 
the company s combination gas electric utility operating subsidiary  has been incurring ferc approved transition charges from its natural gas pipeline supplier since through the end of  the amount of transition costs incurred by the company totaled approximately  these costs are being recovered directly from gas customers customers through the cost of gas adjustment mechanism

the company expects full recovery of these costs through billings to customers 
operation and maintenance expense increased by about  or in compared to this increase primarily reflects higher conservation and load management program expenditures which are recoverable from customers through periodic cost recovery mechanisms 
in  expenditures on this component of operation and maintenance expenses was over million a increase over s conservation and load management program expenditure level 
excluding these costs  the system s total operating and maintenance costs were relatively unchanged in compared to this performance primarily reflects the success of the company s disciplined approach to cost management practices and procedures 
in  operation and maintenance expense increased by almost  million  or 
almost one third of the increase in operating and maintenance was due to a rise in expenditures on demand side management and conservation programs during  as compared to the remaining increase in s operating and maintenance reflects modest overall growth of about  or in the system s operation and maintenance costs 
the majority of this increase was due to extensive gas distribution system maintenance and repairs conducted in depreciation  amortization and taxes depreciation and amortization expense increased more than for both and over the prior year due primarily to a higher level of plant in service 
amortization of the cost of abandoned properties principally relates to the abandonment of an investment in the seabrook nuclear power plant by the company s massachusetts retail operating subsidiary 
a portion of the former investment in this project is being recovered in rates to electric customers as allowed by the massachusetts department of public utilities 
federal and state income taxes remained relatively unchanged in compared to despite an increase in net income before taxes of approximately  or 
this result primarily reflects non recurring tax benefits realized by the company from a donation of land to the park project in fitchburg  massachusetts and the tax loss realized on the state of new hampshire s taking by eminent domain of the company s corporate headquarters in exeter  new hampshire

interest expense interest expense  net remained relatively unchanged in over  as interest income and reduced short term borrowing costs offset increased long term debt related interest costs 
higher long term debt interest costs in  compared to the prior year  reflect the conversion of short termdebt into long term debt in late by the company s new hampshire retail operating subsidiaries 
interest expense decreased approximately in compared to  due primarily to the refinancing of long term debt at lower interest rates 
also contributing to lower interest costs was the general decline in short term borrowing costs during this period 
capital requirements and liquidity the unitil system companies require capital for the acquisition of property  plant and equipment in order to improve  protect  maintain and expand their electric and gas operating systems 
capital necessary to meet these requirements are derived primarily from the company s retained earnings and through the system s dividend reinvestment and common share purchase plan 
when internally generated funds are not available  it is the company s policy to borrow interim funds on a short term basis to meet the capital requirements of its subsidiaries and  when necessary  to repay short term debt through the issuance of permanent financing on an individual company basis 
the size and timing of such financings depend on developments in the securities markets  the ability to meet certain financing covenants and the receipt of appropriate regulatory approval 
the company attempts to maintain a conservative capitalization structure  which contributes to both the stability of unitil and its ability to market new securities

regulatory matters at the state level in both new hampshire and massachusetts  and at the federal level  recent regulatory activity has focused on determining how to deregulate the retail sale of electricity to allow for a more competitive market 
as the trend continues towards competition in the electric utility industry  unitil has actively participated in industry  legislative and regulatory proceedings on the issues of competition and industry restructuring at both the federal and state levels  favoring a reasonable and orderly transition to competition and more choice for all customers 
both the new hampshire public utilities commission the nhpuc and the new hampshire legislature have been involved in discussions and analysis relative to competition in the industry 
early in  the nhpuc issued an order in response to a petition by a power marketer seeking to sell to certain industrial customers of an investor owned new hampshire utility 
in that order the nhpuc ruled that utilities in new hampshire do not have exclusive franchise territories as a matter of law and directed the marketer to seek a declaratory order from the federal energy regulatory commission regarding its proposed transactions 
this decision has been appealed to the new hampshire supreme court 
in june new hampshire senate bill sb  was signed into law 
sb establishes a legislative committee to consider changes in the structure of the electric utility industry 
the act also directs the nhpuc to begin a retail competition pilot program and to act within five months to establish standards for utility discounts to industrial customers 
the legislative committee and its subcommittees met regularly during the summer and fall of several members sponsored new legislation  including legislation currently being debated that would require utilities to file restructuring plans with the nhpuc by june  with statewide retail competition by june the nhpuc has issued its preliminary guidelines for the retail wheeling pilot program incorporating implementation by may and is expected to issue its final guidelines in march the nhpuc issued its final guidelines on discount rates for industrial customers in november the nhpuc aproved the company s energy banktm program in accordance with these guidelines in december during  the massachusetts department of public utilities the mdpu concluded the initial hearings in an electric industry restructuring docket and has issued an order requiring the three largest massachusetts electric utilities to file restructuring plans in february and the remaining massachusetts electric utilities including fg e to file restructuring plans three months after the mdpu issues orders regarding the first three plans 
ceco  e h  and fg e have all received regulatory approval for the company s energy banktm program 
energy bank is an innovative economic development program designed to bring low cost energy to new and expanding industrial customers 
with rates in the range of cents kwh this program offers electric energy at a price that is equal to the national average industrial rate and is below the current average industrial rate in new england 
in addition to providing substantial benefits to new and expanding industrial customers in the form of very competitive and responsive market pricing  energy bank will also provide significant benefits to all the system s customers in the form of local economic development activity  reduced power costs  and lower costs to all customers through the issuance of power dividends 
the last formal regulatory hearings to increase base rates for unitil s three retail operating subsidiaries occurred in for concord electric company  for fitchburg gas and electric light company and for exeter hampton electric company 
a majority of the system s operating revenues are collected under various periodic rate adjustment mechanisms including fuel  purchased power  cost of gas and conservation program cost recovery mechanisms 
environmental the company continues to work with federal and state environmental agencies to assess the environmental contamination in the vicinity of former gas manufacturing sites operated by fitchburg gas and electric light company  the company s combination gas and electric operating subsidiary 
based on information developed over the last several years  it has been discovered that there is environmental contamination at a former gas manufacturing plant in fitchburg  ma the sawyer passway site 
in december the company accepted a tier b permit from the massachusetts department of environmental protection dep to address the site pursuant to the requirements of the massachusetts contingency plan 
further investigations are necessary to assess the extent and nature of the contamination  and to evaluate potential remedies 
reports on those investigations are due to be filed with the dep in early because these investigations are at an early stage management cannot  at this time  predict the costs of future analysis and remediation 
the costs of such assessments and any remedial action determined to be necessary will initially be funded from traditional sources of capital and recovered from customers under a rate recovery mechanism approved by the mdpu 
the company also has a number of liability insurance policies that may provide coverage for environmental remediation at this site
