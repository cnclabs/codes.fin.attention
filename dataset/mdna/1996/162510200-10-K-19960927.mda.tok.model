item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general in  the company perceived a shift in demand in the women s retail apparel industry toward lower price points 
in order to sustain sales in a difficult retail environment  the company introduced new products at lower prices to meet this perceived demand  thus altering its historic corporate strategy of aiming toward the high end of upper moderate price points 
as a result of intense competition in this lower priced segment of the market  where the company had a limited operating history  sales of the company s products slowed  inventory levels increased and the company was forced to sell a larger portion of its products through off price channels 
toward the end of fiscal  the company initiated a major restructuring of its operations in order to return to its historic product positioning and regain profitability 
the focus of the company s restructuring has been to strengthen its management team  reduce selling  general and administrative expenses and reposition its product line 
andrew grossman joined the company in september and implemented a product and pricing repositioning strategy  most of the financial benefits of which the company expects to be realized in future periods 
in anticipation of the repositioned product lines and as a result of continued weak product demand  the company has limited the production of its product lines pending the return of adequate demand 
the impact of the restructuring on the company s selling  general and administrative expenses has been more immediate selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from million in fiscal to in fiscal to in fiscal nearly half of this decrease resulted from staff reductions throughout the company from a high point of  in fiscal to at the end of fiscal in addition  the company decided to close a number of its unprofitable outlet stores and does not intend to open any new stores in the foreseeable future 
in order to support the development and growth of the company s licensed nautica product line  however  selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in subsequent years as sales volume of the company s licensed nautica product line increases

fiscal year ended june net sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses 
restructuring expenses unusual expenses interest expense net loss fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  net sales decreased by million  or  compared to the prior year 
approximately million is due to the decrease in dress sales as a result of the discontinuation of dresses as a product category 
the sales decrease is also the result of lower sales at regular and incentive prices combined with an increase in off price sales at deeper discounts than the prior year 
sales by the company s outlet stores decreased by million compared to the prior year 
this decrease is largely due to the closing of six outlet stores in fiscal and a decline in same store sales of approximately million 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was as compared to for the previous year

net sales for fiscal included sales to off price channels of million  compared to million in fiscal off price sales as a percentage of net sales declined from in fiscal to in fiscal sales by the company s outlet stores increased by million compared to the prior year

gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to from as compared to the prior fiscal year 
as discussed above  the increase  as a percentage of net sales  resulted primarily from a lower percentage of clearance and off price sales in fiscal and also from the product repositioning  which was partially offset by continued higher levels of promotional allowances 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million  from of net sales in fiscal to of net sales in fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to the implementation of cost reduction programs throughout the organization 
payroll and related costs accounted for almost half of the decrease 
other areas with significant decreases included freight  rent  cooperative advertising  professional fees  and travel and entertainment 
in connection with the corporate restructuring program discussed above  during the first quarter of fiscal the company recorded restructuring expenses of million 
these costs primarily related to employee severance as the company continued to reduce overhead costs 
in january  the company signed favorable early termination agreements with the landlords of certain retail outlet stores  for which the company had taken a reserve as part of its restructuring expenses at june  as a result  the company was able to reduce the restructuring reserve  accrued in  by approximately million 
the benefit of this reduction was offset by certain additional expenses provided for by the company relating to prospective continued restructuring of its retail and overseas operations

during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded million in unusual expenses related to certain legal matters

the s f agreement was terminated as of june nautica license agreement in september  the company entered into the nautica license agreement  pursuant to which the company will arrange for the manufacture of  market  distribute and sell a new women s career and casual sportswear line under the nautica name

future financing requirements at june   the company had a working capital deficiency of million 
the company requires the availability of sufficient cash flow and borrowing capacity to finance its existing product lines and to develop and market its licensed nautica product lines 
the company expects to satisfy such requirements through cash flow from operations  its line of credit under the amended financing agreement  and  in the near term  continued credit support from josephine chaus

chaus would extend the letter of credit beyond july  in addition  although bnyf historically has waived compliance with certain covenants and permitted certain overadvances and has  pursuant to the september amendment  agreed to relax such covenants and permit specified levels of overadvances through june   there can be no assurance that it will continue to do so in the future 
moreover  growth of the company s existing product lines and or the development of the company s licensed nautica product line could increase the amount of the potential shortfall in borrowing availability after the current fiscal year 
inflation the company does not believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation which recently have been experienced in the united states  where it competes  have had a significant effect on its net sales or profitability 
seasonality historically  the company s sales and operating results fluctuate by quarter  with the greatest sales occurring in the company s first and third fiscal quarters 
it is in these quarters that the company s fall and spring product lines  which traditionally have had the highest volume of net sales  are shipped to customers  with revenues generally being recognized at the time of shipment 
as a result  the company experiences significant variability in its quarterly results and working capital requirements 
moreover  delays in shipping can cause revenues to be recognized in a later quarter  resulting in further variability in such quarterly results
