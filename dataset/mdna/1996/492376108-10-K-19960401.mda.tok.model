the registrant s senior note agreement limits the payment of dividends on common stock 
under the most restrictive covenant  the payment of common stock dividends is not permitted at december  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities at december  and was and  respectively 
the decline in the ratio of current assets to current liabilities at december   compared to december   is due primarily to i the classification of the registrant s  of outstanding senior debt as short term because the registrant was in default of certain financial covenants and was currently unable to obtain waivers beyond may  and ii advances on accounts receivable sold under the accounts receivable agreement 
at december  and  the ratio of total debt to total capitalization was and  respectively 
the increase in the ratio of total debt to total capitalization is primarily due to lower stockholders equity 
the registrant has recorded deferred income tax assets of  on its consolidated balance sheet as of december  in order to fully realize this deferred income tax asset  the registrant will need to generate future taxable income of at least  prior to expiration of net operating loss carryforwards which will begin to expire in based upon the registrant s recent pre tax earnings adjusted for significant nonrecurring items  the sale of certain assets of the consumer products business and cost savings related to the restructuring announced march  and projections of future taxable income over the period in which the deferred income tax assets are deductible  management believes it is more likely than not that the registrant will realize the benefit of the deferred income tax asset 
there can be no assurance  however  that the registrant will generate any specific level of continuing earnings 
as of december   the registrant had an accounts receivable agreement receivable agreement maturing on january  to meet the seasonal working capital needs of the registrant 
the receivable agreement permits the registrant to sell its trade accounts receivable on a nonrecourse basis 
under the receivable agreement  the maximum amount that can be advanced to the registrant pursuant to the sale of trade accounts receivable at any time is  which amount is reduced on april  to  the reduction occurred because the sale of assets of the consumer products business reduced the working capital needs of the registrant 
the registrant retains collection and service responsibility  as agent for the purchaser  over any receivables sold 
advances under such receivable agreement are subject to certain limitations 
as of december   receivables as shown on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet have been reduced by net proceeds of  from advances pursuant to the sale of receivables under the registrant s receivable agreement 
the receivable agreement contains covenants identical to the senior notes 
in addition  at december   the registrant owed  under a note payable to a bank due april  with interest accrued at the prime rate unsecured note payable 
the unsecured note payable was originally related to a  bank line of credit  which effective october  was reduced by the lender to the then outstanding balance of  due to a decline in the registrant s financial performance 
the line of credit contains covenants identical to the senior notes 
on january   the registrant borrowed  from the same bank under a note payable secured by certain machinery and equipment secured note payable 
on march   the registrant used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of certain assets of the consumer products business to pay the  secured note payable  and to prepay  of senior notes and  of the unsecured note payable 
after the payment of the secured note payable  the indebtedness of the registrant was unsecured 
in connection with the sale of certain assets of the consumer products business  the registrant obtained waivers of certain financial covenants through may  from the lenders under the senior notes  the lender under the unsecured note payable and the purchaser under the receivable agreement collectively referred to as lenders and an extension of the maturity date of the unsecured note payable to may  discussions between the lenders and the registrant are continuing with respect to the further extension of the maturity of the unsecured note payable  additional waiver of financial covenants and additional reduction of indebtedness 
although the registrant has obtained waivers or amendments from the lenders on three previous occasions  there can be no assurance that the lenders will agree to further waivers 
if additional waivers of financial covenants or the extension of the maturity date of the unsecured note payable are not obtained  the lenders would be entitled to exercise certain remedies  including the acceleration of the due date for payment of the senior notes or the unsecured note payable  and the terminination of the receivable agreement 
based upon the past experience of the registrant in obtaining waivers or amendments from its lenders and because the registrant expects to use a portion of the proceeds from the sale of inventory and collection of accounts receivables of the consumer products business to further reduce debt  the registrant believes that the lenders will extend the due date of the unsecured note payable  will not accelerate the due date for payment of the senior notes and will not terminate the receivable agreement 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of such belief of the registrant 
at december   the registrant had unused sources of liquidity consisting of cash and cash equivalents of  additional advances under the receivable agreement of  a tax net operating loss carryforward of  a minimum tax credit carryforward of  and other tax credit carryforwards of  the registrant believes that its financial resources  including proceeds from the sale of certain assets of the consumer products business and other internally generated funds  are adequate to meet its foreseeable needs  subject to the satisfactory resolution of current discussions with the lenders
