item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the performance of a radio station group  such as jacor  is customarily measured by its ability to generate broadcast cash flow 
the primary source of the company s revenue is the sale of broadcasting time on its radio stations for advertising 
the company s significant operating expenses are employee salaries  sports broadcasting rights fees  programming expenses  advertising and promotion expenses  rental of premises for studios and transmitting equipment and music license royalty fees 
the company works closely with local station management to implement cost control measures 
the company s revenue is affected primarily by the advertising rates the company s radio stations are able to charge 
these rates are  in large part  based on a station s ability to attract audiences in the demographic groups targeted by its advertisers  as principally measured by arbitron metro area ratings surveys 
most advertising contracts are short term and run only for a few weeks 
most of the company s revenue is generated from local advertising  which is sold by the station s sales staff 
in  approximately of the company s gross revenues was from local advertising and approximately was from national advertising 
a station s local sales staff solicits advertising  either directly from the local advertiser or through an advertising agency for the local advertiser 
national advertising sales for most of the company s stations are made by the company s national sales managers in conjunction with the efforts of an independent advertising representative who specializes in national sales and is compensated on a commission only basis 
sports broadcasting and the full service programming features play an integral part in the company s operating strategy 
as a result  because of the rights fees and related costs of broadcasting professional baseball  football and hockey  as well as the costs related to the full service programming features of its am radio stations  the company s broadcast cash flow margins are typically lower than its competitors

and subsidiaries general  continued the company s first calendar quarter historically produces the lowest revenue for the year  and the second and third quarters historically produce the highest revenue for the year  due in part to revenue received during the summer months related to the broadcast of major league baseball games 
during  however  the company recorded higher broadcast revenue and broadcast operating expenses during the third and fourth quarters than those recorded during the second quarter due to the major league baseball strike 
as a result of the strike  second quarter revenue and operating expenses were lower 
for the entire twelve months of  the strike did not have a material impact on the company s station operating income broadcast revenue less broadcast operating expenses 
the company s operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that do not produce commensurate revenues in the period in which the expenses are incurred 
as a result of arbitron s quarterly reporting of ratings  the company s ability to realize revenue as a result of increased advertising and promotional expenses may be delayed for several months 
the comparability of financial information for the years ended december   and is affected by the july purchase of radio station kbpi fm formerly kazy fm in denver  colorado  the may sale of telesat cable tv  the june purchase of radio station wofx fm formerly wppt fm in cincinnati  ohio and interim operation of such station from april to june under a lma  the august purchases of radio stations wjbt fm  wzaz am  and wsol fm formerly whjx fm  each located in jacksonville  florida and wduv fm and wbrd am each located in tampa  florida 
with these acquisitions  the company expects to realize certain cost savings and increased ratings through format modifications and thereby improve operating results in these markets 
the acquisitions discussed above and the pending acquisitions of citicasters inc and noble broadcast group  inc 
will increase the company s net revenue  broadcast operating expenses  depreciation and amortization  corporate general and administrative expenses and interest expense 
accordingly  past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods

and subsidiaries general  continued general economic conditions have an impact on the company s business and financial results 
from time to time the markets in which the company operates experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect revenue of the company 
however  management believes that this impact is somewhat softened by the company s diverse geographical presence 
liquidity and capital resources the company began with no outstanding debt and million in cash and cash equivalents 
during  the company used million in cash for acquisitions of radio stations and licenses and for loans made in connection with the company s jsas and million in cash to purchase shares of its common stock 
these funds came from cash on hand together with cash provided from operating activities and draws under the company s credit agreement aggregating million 
during  the company made capital expenditures of approximately million 
the company estimates that capital expenditures for will be approximately million which includes approximately million to purchase the building currently housing the offices and studios of its tampa radio stations and to complete the relocation of the offices and studios of its atlanta radio stations 
the company estimates that capital expenditures for the properties to be acquired from citicasters and noble would be approximately million in the month period following the consummation of the acquisitions 
the actual level of spending will depend on a variety of factors  including general economic conditions and the company s business 
in february  the company entered into the existing credit facility which provided for a million reducing revolving facility that reduces on a quarterly basis commencing march  the existing credit facility bears interest at floating rates based on a eurodollar rate and or a bank base rate 
jacor communications  inc 
and subsidiaries liquidity and capital resources  continued in connection with the acquisition of citicasters inc  the company anticipates entering into a new credit facility the new credit facility which would provide for availability of million pursuant to a reducing revolving facility that would reduce on a quarterly basis commencing one year from the date of the facility 
it is anticipated that the new credit facility would bear interest at floating rates based on a eurodollar rate or a bank base rate 
the company also anticipates that the new credit facility will provide the company with additional credit for future acquisitions as well as working capital and other general corporate purposes 
the company currently expects to fund its acquisition of noble and expenditures for capital requirements from available cash balances  internally generated funds and the availability of borrowings under the existing credit facility 
the company anticipates that it will fund the acquisition of citicasters inc with a combination of funds provided by the sale of approximately  shares of jacor common stock pursuant to a registration statement filed on form s with the securities and exchange commission on march  and the new credit facility and excess cash on hand 
these funds together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the company s liquidity and capital needs for the foreseeable future 
as a result of entering into the existing credit facility in the first quarter of  the company will write off approximately million of unamortized cost associated with its credit agreement 
in connection with entering into the new credit facility  the company anticipates that it will write off approximately million of unamortized cost associated with its existing credit facility 
the issuance of additional debt will negatively impact the company s debt to equity ratio and its results of operations and cash flows due to higher amounts of interest expense  although the issuance of additional equity will soften this impact to some extent 
also  if the company were not able to complete the acquisition of citicasters inc due to certain circumstances  the company would incur a one time charge of million relating to the non refundable deposit 
if debt were used to finance such payment  it would negatively impact the company s future results of operations and impede the company s future growth by limiting the amount available under the existing credit facility
