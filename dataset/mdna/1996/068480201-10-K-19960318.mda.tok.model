item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on july   the company consummated the merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of the company with plains petroleum company plains by issuing million shares of its common stock to the former plains stockholders 
as a result of this merger  plains became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
also  on july   the company changed its fiscal year end from september to december effective january  the merger is being accounted for using the pooling of interests method 
the pooling of interests method combines previously reported results as though the combination occurred at the beginning of the periods being presented 
merger costs have been expensed during the year 
the financial statements of the company and plains for the  and years have been restated and adjusted for the merger with plains and the change in fiscal year end 
due to this restatement  these financial statements are not comparable to the financial statements for the same periods as previously presented by the separate companies 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had cash and short term investments of million  working capital of million  property and equipment of million and total assets of million 
compared to december   cash and short term investments decreased million  working capital increased million and property and equipment increased million 
total assets increased million as the increase in property and equipment was funded by a million increase in long term debt 
during  the company actively invested in oil and gas properties in its areas of activity  which increased both property and equipment and long term debt 
during  the company generated operating cash flow of million before working capital changes  which is million less than the amount generated in  as production increases were offset by merger costs incurred during the year 
after working capital changes  cash flow provided by operations was million  a decrease of three percent from excluding merger costs  cash flow from operations before working capital changes was million  million after working capital changes 
as of december   the outstanding balance under the bank line of credit was million  a net increase of million from the balance at december  in july  the company entered into a million credit agreement 
the line of credit matures on july  and is funded by a consortium of six banks 
the line of credit is unsecured and provides for interest rates based on libor or prime rates at the company s option 
the availability under the credit agreement is based on the bank s review of the collateral value of the company s oil and gas properties 
the current borrowing base is million determined from a review of the oil and gas reserves as of december  for plains and march  for barrett 
the borrowing base is scheduled for a review in early based on the company s december  reserves 
during the year  the company invested million in property and equipment principally in the piceance  wind river and arkoma basins 
the company s drilling activities were primarily to develop and extend producing fields 
included in oil and gas property additions is million to purchase interests in proved properties to acquire bcf of gas and  barrels of oil 
during  the company increased its gas reserves by percent to bcf and its oil reserves by percent to million barrels 
the company replaced percent of its production 
on an energy equivalent basis  the company s reserves are percent natural gas 
proved undeveloped reserves are percent of the company s total reserves  virtually unchanged from december  thirty four percent of the company s reserves are located in the hugoton embayment  percent are located in the piceance basin  and percent are located in the wind river basin 
reserve quantities increased percent on an energy equivalent basis over the last year  while the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows increased million  percent  primarily due to reserve additions and an increase in the sales price of oil and gas 
as of december   the company was receiving an average of per barrel for its oil production and per mcf for its gas production 
reserve extensions and discoveries added million to the standardized measure  and purchases of proved reserves added million to the valuation 
in addition the change in sales prices and production costs increased the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows by million 
these additions were offset by a million reduction due to reserves produced during the year and million for additional income taxes being deducted in the computation 
the company s reserve values remain sensitive to gas prices in the current volatile commodities market 
the company uses gas price swaps to hedge the sales price of its oil and natural gas 
in a typical swap agreement  the company and a counter party will enter into an agreement whereby one party will pay a fixed price and the other will pay an index price on a specified volume of production during a specified period of time 
settlement is made by the parties for the difference between the two prices approximately the same time as the physical transactions 
the intent of hedging activities is to reduce the volatility associated with the sales price of oil and gas production 
as of december  the company held positions to hedge bcf of gas and  barrels of oil for periods through march  of these positions   mcf of gas were being hedged to reduce risks associated with gas trading activities  and the balance was associated with producing activities 
these positions include various hedging instruments based on exchange based sales prices  index denominated prices or a combination of both 
the positions are more fully described in the notes to the financial statements 
during december the gas commodities market used as a basis for the company s hedging activities became unusually volatile causing significant differences between the underlying commodity price and the market price of the company s gas production in certain basins 
as a result  the company recorded an expense of million in the fourth quarter due to the lack of correlation between the hedging instrument and the sales price of underlying natural gas 
the company s merger with plains and its drilling activities have increased its reserve base and its productive capacity and  therefore  its potential cash flow 
continued low gas prices may adversely affect cash flow 
the company intends to continue to acquire and develop oil and gas properties in its areas of activity as dictated by market conditions and financial ability 
the company retains flexibility to participate in oil and gas activities at a level that is supported by its cash flow and financial ability 
management believes that the company s borrowing capacities and cash flow are sufficient to fund its currently anticipated activities 
the company intends to continue to use financial leverage to fund its operations as investment opportunities become available on terms that management believe warrant investment of the company s capital resources 
results of operations vs 
during  the company incurred a net loss of million 
per share compared to net income of million 
per share in the results include merger and reorganization costs of million 
excluding the merger costs  the company s net income after taxes would be million 
per share 
revenues increased percent from to million and operating expenses  including million of merger and reorganization costs  increased percent to million 
oil and gas production revenue increased percent to million 
lease operating expenses increased million and depreciation  depletion and amortization increased million 
production revenues increased million primarily due to a percent increase in gas production to bcf  mcf per day 
oil production increased percent to  barrels  barrels per day 
average gas sales prices decreased percent to per mcf  while average oil prices increased percent to per barrel 
gas production accounted for percent of total production on an energy equivalent basis 
the hugoton embayment and piceance basin properties accounted for and percent  respectively  of total gas production 
the powder river and permian basins accounted for and percent  respectively  of total oil production 
the decreased gas sales price was due to an overall deterioration in gas markets during most of the year 
lease operating expenses of million averaged 
per mcfe per boe of production compared to 
per mcfe per boe in depreciation  depletion and amortization increased million primarily due to production increases 
during  depreciation  depletion and amortization on oil and gas production was provided at an average rate of 
per mcfe per boe compared to an average rate of 
per mcfe per boe in the gross margin on trading activities was virtually unchanged from at  gas trading volumes increased percent to bcf in during  the company hedged bcf percent of its gas trading volumes to achieve the margins on specific transactions at a cost of million 
in addition  the company hedged bcf percent of gas production for a net gain of  the hedging gain related to production is net of million for an expense recorded in the fourth quarter due to a lack of correlation of the hedging instruments to the underlying commodity as of december  the company enters into the hedging arrangements to minimize its exposure to price risks associated with commodities markets 
although hedging transactions associated with its production minimize the company s exposure to losses as a result of unfavorable price changes  the transactions also limit the company s ability to benefit from favorable price changes 
at the end of december   the basis differential between the commodities markets and the market price of the company s gas widened to historic levels 
because the increase in the commodities price was not accompanied by a similar increase in the market price of the company s gas  the company recorded an expense for the difference due to the inefficient hedge and positions that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
with respect to trading activities  the company will not generally enter into a commitment for either a purchase or a sale unless i it has established a commitment for an offsetting sale or purchase  or ii it has established a hedge arrangement with a counter party that creates the same matching position 
general and administrative expenses of million are one percent greater than the previous year 
the amount is net of million of operating fee recoveries compared to a million recovery in general and administrative expense in is generally a combination of the separate companies expenses  since the integration of the two entities did not occur until late in the year  and included costs for the company to expand its business in existing and new activity areas 
the company expects a reduction in general and administrative expenses due to the elimination of duplicative costs throughout interest expense increased significantly from  in to million in as the company financed a portion of its growth with bank debt 
the company incurred a expense of million to combine barrett and plains and to integrate the separate company s operations 
the costs consist primarily of million of investment banker and other professional fees to evaluate and consummate the merger and million for employee termination and benefit costs 
during  the company recorded a million income tax expense even though it incurred a loss before taxes due to non deductible merger costs 
excluding non deductible merger costs  the company would have had a  tax benefit 
the company s results of operations depend primarily on the production of natural gas which accounted for percent of the company s reserves and percent of its production during therefore  the company s future results will depend on both the volume of natural gas production and the sales price for gas 
the company continues to explore for oil and gas to increase its production 
the lack of predictability of both production volumes and sales prices may influence future operating results 
vs 
during  the company earned net income of million 
per share compared to net income of million 
per share in the results include a tax benefit of million due to an increase in financial reporting value of the company s net operating loss carryover 
without the tax benefit from the net operating loss carryover  the company s net income after taxes in would have been million 
per share 
the results include a tax benefit of million from the value of the tax loss carryover and an expense of  for the cumulative effect of adopting sfas no 
to recognize accumulated post retirement benefit liabilities as of january  net income before income taxes and the cumulative effect of the change in accounting method was million in compared to million in revenues increased three percent from to million  and operating expenses increased nine percent to million 
production revenue decreased million  and trading revenues increased million 
these changes were offset by a decrease of million in lease operating expenses  an increase of million in depreciation  depletion and amortization and an increase of million in the cost of trading 
production revenues decreased million as a five percent increase in gas production was offset by a six percent decrease in the average gas sales price and a seven percent decline in the average oil sales price 
oil production was virtually unchanged from to during  the company produced  mcf of gas per day and  barrels of oil per day 
gas production accounted for percent of total production on an energy equivalent basis of bcf of gas equivalent million barrels of oil equivalent 
during  the average gas sales price was per mcf in and the oil sales price was per barrel in 
the decreased oil and gas sales prices were due to an overall market reduction in the commodity prices of the products 
lease operating expenses of million averaged 
per mcfe per boe of production compared with 
per mcfe per boe in depreciation  depletion and amortization increased million primarily due to production increases 
during  depreciation  depletion and amortization on oil and gas production was provided at an average rate of 
per mcfe per boe compared to an average rate of 
per mcfe per boe in the gross margin on trading activities decreased to  from million in gas trading volumes increased percent to bcf in the reduced results are due to a reduction of margins available for gas trading activities 
general and administrative expenses of million are percent greater than the previous year 
the amount is net of million of operating fee recoveries compared to a million recovery in the increased general and administrative expense is due to additional costs incurred by the company to expand its activities and to explore in other areas 
during  the company recorded a million net income tax expense compared to a net income tax expense in the expense is net of a million reduction in the valuation allowance provided for the deferred income tax benefit of the net operating loss carryover 
the valuation allowance was reduced to reflect increased oil and gas reserves that are expected to generate future taxable income and the tax gain realized on the sale of the wattenberg properties
