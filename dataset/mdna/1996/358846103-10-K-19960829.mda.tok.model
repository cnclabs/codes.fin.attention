other risk factors the nature of the company s worldwide operations involves a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar 
accordingly the company is exposed to the inherent risks of international currency markets and governmental interference

management believes the company s business has not been adversely affected by inflation in the past 
the company has generally been successful in passing cost increases on to its customers by means of price increases 
due to the high degree of competition presently being experienced in the marketplace  it is possible that continued cost increases could lead to an erosion in the company s margin 
additional risks and uncertainties include dependence of the company on international trade and worldwide economic conditions  dependence of the company on the continued services of key management and operating executives including lynn fritz and dennis pelino  risks associated with the company s continuing aggressive acquisition strategy  including the diversion of management s attention to the assimilation of the operations and personnel of acquired companies  adverse short term effects on the company s operating results  integration of financial reporting systems and acquired assets  and the possible inability of the company s information systems to keep pace with the increasing complexity and rapid growth of the company s business  the increasing level of investment required by the transition of the company to an integrated logistics company providing a full range of international transportation and global supply chain management services  and diversion of management s focus and resources as a result of pending litigation  and other risks disclosed in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission
