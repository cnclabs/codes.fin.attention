one of the most important facets of the company s operations is transactions processing and related services 
substantially all of the revenues from transaction processing are shown on the company s consolidated statements of income as net revenues from clearing operations 
increased transaction processing and related services have resulted in increases in certain revenues  including net revenues from clearing operations  interest revenue from margin loans to clients of southwest s correspondents and to correspondents for their own security inventory positions and money market administrative fees 
the resultant increases in retained earnings have increased the capital of the company which in turn has permitted the company to expand all areas of its operations 
other major sources of revenues are commissions from southwest s client transactions and interest revenue from margin loans to its own clients  stock loan transactions and other interest bearing assets 
investment banking  advisory and administrative fees include revenues derived from the underwriting and distribution of corporate and municipal securities  unit trusts and money market and other mutual funds

commissions and other employee compensation increased  to  an increase of  during fiscal as compared to the same period last year due to higher commission revenue generated by southwest brokers and an increase in bts registered representatives  who are independent contractors and are paid at higher rates than southwest s representatives

the number of bts registered representatives at june  was compared to at june  while the number of employees increased to at june  from at june   this increase occurred as a result of the acquisition of barre  therefore  it did not contribute significantly to compensation expense for fiscal other expense categories remained consistent with fiscal net income for the year decreased  a decrease of  to  in from  in due to the decreased revenue from operating areas in offset by fairly constant operating expenses 
liquidity and capital resources more than of the company s assets consist of cash  marketable securities and receivables from clients  clients of correspondents and correspondents themselves representing borrowings from southwest to finance the purchase of securities on margin  which are secured by marketable securities  broker dealers  and clearing organizations 
all assets are financed by the company s equity capital  short term bank borrowings  interest bearing and non interest bearing client credit balances  correspondent deposits  and other payables 
southwest maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts which represents amounts  in the judgment of management  that are necessary to adequately absorb losses from known and inherent risks in receivables from clients  clients of correspondents and correspondents themselves 
as of june   the allowance was approximately  net cash used in operating activities during the current year was  cash was used to fund fluctuations in the receivable from broker  dealer  and clearing organization accounts  assets segregated for regulatory purposes and securities owned 
the fluctuations in these accounts are generally short term in nature and are funded by southwest s short term credit arrangement 
southwest has credit arrangements with several commercial banks  which include broker loan lines up to  to finance securities owned  securities held for correspondent accounts  and receivables in client margin accounts 
these credit arrangements are provided on an as offered basis and are not committed lines of credit 
as of june   the company had  in outstanding loans under these arrangements 
outstanding balances under these credit arrangements are due on demand  bear interest at rates indexed to the federal funds rate  and are collateralized by securities of southwest and its clients 
in the opinion of management  these credit arrangements are adequate to meet the short term operating capital needs of southwest 
southwest is subject to the requirements of the securities and exchange commission and the new york stock exchange relating to liquidity  capital standards and the use of client funds and securities 
the company has historically operated in excess of the minimum net capital requirements 
effects of recently issued accounting standards the company will adopt statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for stock based compensation fas in fiscal year fas will not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations  as the company does not intend to adopt the value based measurement concept  but will require extensive disclosures regarding the company s stock option plan 
effects of inflation management does not believe that changes in replacement costs of fixed assets will materially affect the company s operations 
the rate of inflation  however  affects the company s expenses  such as employee compensation  rent and communications 
increases in these expenses may not be readily recoverable in the price the company charges for its services 
inflation can have significant effects on interest rates which in turn can affect prices and activities in the securities markets 
these fluctuations may have an adverse impact on the company s operations
