it should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes contained in the financial section of this report 
results of operations compared to revenues with increased production capacity  consistent supply of product  enhanced marketing programs and favorable clinical data  revenues increased substantially to million versus million in along with the factors already noted  increased acceptance of its prostate cancer treatment in the medical community and increased public awareness of the medical advantages of the theraseed treatment method versus other existing methods of treating prostate cancer were major factors in driving the substantial sales increase 
additionally  the company believes sales were positively affected in by further publication of supportive data from the clinical study of patients treated with theraseed 
this study had shown no local recurrence of prostate cancer and low rates of incontinence and impotence within the study group 
costs and expenses as a result of the increase in sales  cost of sales rose 
however  cost of sales as a percent of sales fell to versus in this percentage improvement was primarily attributable to increased utilization of production capacity and economics of scale partially offset by increased depreciation 
although management believes that cost of sales as a percentage of revenue may continue to decline should sales in future periods exceed those achieved in  no assurances can be given with respect to the operating margins in future periods 
in particular  continued improvements in manufacturing operations and optimization of the production process may cause smaller improvements in net margin 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses also increased in dollar amount but declined as a percent to sales in to versus in in particular  advertising and public relations expenses increased significantly from to to support activities associated with increased sales 
also  headcount expenses increased in response to the additional workload created by the higher sales 
the addition of a cyclotron and facilities caused depreciation and amortization to increase or  from to page operating margins increased to in versus in due to increased sales and a reduction in sg a expenses as a percent of sales reflecting efficiency gains from increased volumes 
other income and expense was slightly higher in versus due to a lower level of construction in progress in that  in turn  limited the amount of interest expense capitalizable 
earnings earnings increased more than to  or 
per share in from s earnings of  or 
per share 
such increase again was primarily due to increased sales and a reduction in sg a expenses as a percent of sales reflecting efficiency gains from increased volumes 
at december   the company s deferred tax asset balance was  since emerging from its development stage in  the company has utilized approximately  of operating loss carryforwards through december  and has achieved twenty consecutive profitable quarters since to realize income benefit from its remaining operating loss carryforwards at december   it will be necessary for the company to generate future taxable income of approximately  prior to the expiration of the operating loss carryforward periods 
based on the company s results of operations subsequent to receiving fda clearance in for its product  and on expected future results of operations  management currently strongly believes these net operating loss carryforwards will be fully utilized prior to their statutory expiration 
historical comparison revenues revenues increased more than to million versus million for in  theragenics emerged from a two year manufacturing changeover that distanced the company from unreliable outside vendors 
as the company s experience with cyclotron operations and subsequent radioactive processes grew  the realities of these operations became clear 
no single cyclotron can be expected to run at full power for weeks a year 
in addition to the need for regular maintenance  these operations require a cool down period before maintenance can be performed 
these cool down periods are imperative as safety of the company s employees ie  minimizing radiation exposure is among the company s highest priorities 
during the first part of  production dependability of the cyclotron dictated the pace of sales growth 
once consistent supply was demonstrated  the company began reclaiming marketing momentum 
fueling this momentum were favorable five year clinical data july and the dedication of page additional financial resources to marketing 
costs and expenses as a result of the increase in sales  cost of sales rose 
however  cost of sales as a percent of sales fell from in to in this decrease in percent of cost of sales to sales reflected the economies of scale associated with the large fixed cost component of the company s expense base 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased more than would have been expected if operations had continued under the same structure as existed in changes were made in the advertising  public relations and investor relations areas in which increased sg a costs 
these changes proved to have significant success in increasing sales and investor awareness 
other income and expense improved by  due to reduced interest expense 
both the higher level of construction in progress in that increased the amount of interest expense capitalizable and the replacement of an existing loan at interest with a new loan at were the causes of this reduced interest expense

the expansion project for addition of cyclotrons three and four which began in is estimated to cost approximately  when completed 
as of february   approximately  has already been expended on this project with the remainder scheduled for expenditure before the second quarter of management believes that funding for the remainder of this project should be available from current cash balances  cash from future operations and theragenics credit facility 
in the last three years  the company s working capital has been obtained from internally generated funds and borrowings from banks 
working capital totaled million at december   including  representing the current portion of an outstanding long term obligation 
this compares to million at year end which also included  representing the current portion of outstanding long term obligations 
in the first quarter of  theragenics received funding on a million loan secured by the company s cyclotron facility the term loan 
the term loan was to mature in and bore interest at per annum 
in the third quarter of  theragenics received funding on a million loan secured by the company s cyclotron facility including a second cyclotron the term loan 
the term loan matures in and bears interest at per annum

at year end   of the bank credit facility was available but unused 
although internal forecasts had indicated that there would be a need to access the credit facility in the fourth quarter of  strong page fourth quarter results did not require the company to do so 
management believes that cash flow from operations  the availability of funds under its bank credit agreements and the availability of other forms of financing should permit the company to meet its anticipated capital expenditures and working capital needs as well as to service its debt and fund future growth as new business opportunities arise 
inflation and changing prices management does not believe that inflation has had an abnormal or unanticipated effect on the company s operations
