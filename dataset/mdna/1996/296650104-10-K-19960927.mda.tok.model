item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operation the company operates a one segment business 
it principally manufactures power supplies and components for military and industrial use 
sales volume is dependent to a large extent on product mix in any given fiscal period 
this mix is in turn subject to the dictates of customer needs and delivery requirements 
these factors principally account for any variation in sales and operating income from year to year 
sales for fiscal years ended june    and were   and  respectively 
the corresponding cost of sales were   and  respectively 
although sales in increased by approximately over the previous year the gross profit percentage increased only marginally 
this was due not only to the shipping of orders with relatively low profit margins  but also due to the fact that a pre tax write off of  relating to inventory was taken in the fourth quarter 
this write off also resulted in the net earnings per share during the current fourth quarter being somewhat lower than the fourth quarter earnings per share of the two preceding years 
as was the case last year  the company has been accepting orders with reduced profit margins because of the increasingly competitive nature of the marketplace 
the company is making efforts to resolve this situation by expanding its efforts to develop technologies and products of a more proprietary nature for sale in the commercial and military marketplace 
the company s efforts and investment in the advancement and refinement of both military and industrial technologieshas resulted in the company being able to apply for various patents which are currently pending 
the company has received a notice of allowance from the united states patent office on one product  which indicates that the issuance of the actual patent is imminent 
current demographics indicate a need for the products for which the company is currently seeking patents  particularly in the military marketplace  as well as a worldwide need for the company s long range radar transmitters and components for high power ac locomotives 
the management currently anticipates that the course of action the company has taken will enhance the company s revenues and profitability in future periods based on these indicated needs 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by approximately  in as compared to this increase was due principally to an increase in salaries of approximately  for sales personnel 
earnings before income taxes increased in to  from  in net earnings per share increased to 
from ii the statements of cash flows indicates an increase in inventories of  this is brought about by the liquidation of progress payments in the amount of  which were netted against inventories at the end of last year

the one exception to this is proceeds received from the sale of marketable securities  which proceeds were used to purchase common stock of the company 
this transaction is more fully explained in the notes to the financial statements set forth in item of this annual report and in liquidity and capital expenditures immediately below 
liquidity and capital expenditures the company s working capital is an appropriate indicator of the liquidity of its business  and during the past three fiscal years  the company  when possible  has funded all of its operations  including financing activities  with cash flows resulting from operating activities 
the company did not borrow any funds during the last three fiscal years and does not currently anticipate that it will borrow any funds during fiscal year the company s working capital for fiscal years ended june    and was   and  respectively 
the principal reason for the decrease in working capital between and was the repurchase by the company of its common stock during in the total amount of  on march   the company purchased a combined total of  shares of common stock from the entwistle company and global securities at a total cost of  in addition  the company purchased  shares of common stock from the company s esop during for a total purchase price of  under existing authorizations  as of august   funds in the amount of  were available for the continuing repurchase of the company s shares of common stock

during fiscal years through  interest rates on short term investments ranged from to 
this factor accounts for the fluctuation of interest income during much of the five year period 
interest income was  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal interest income fiscal  however was affected by the decrease in our investment base arising from the capital expenditures of  in and purchase of the company s common stock in the amount of  during ii fiscal as set forth above 
a majority of the company s investment base is represented by united states government treasury securities and certificates of deposit 
consequently  the company does not feel that there is any significant risk associated with its investment policy 
management feels that the company s reserve for bad debts of  is adequate  since given the customers with whom the company deals  particularly the united states government and its agencies  the amount of bad debts over the years has been minimal 
the company does not currently offer  nor does management currently contemplate offering in the future  any post retirement or employment benefits 
consequently  no accruals or liabilities have been provided for in the financial statements
