item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is a diversified entertainment company which produces  distributes  markets and promotes television programs and recorded music both domestically and internationally 
the television industry is broadly divided into three major segments i production  involving the development  financing and making of television shows  ii distribution  involving the promotion and exploitation of completed television shows  iii and broadcast  involving the airing or broadcast of programming over network affiliated stations  independent stations and cable or satellite television 
the us broadcast television market is served principally by network affiliated stations  independent stations and cable and satellite television operators 
during prime time hours primarily pm to pm in the eastern and pacific time zones and pm to pm in the central and mountain time zones  network affiliates primarily broadcast programming produced for the networks 
in non prime time  network affiliates telecast network programming  off network programming reruns  first run programming programming produced for distribution on a syndicated basis and local programming produced by the local stations themselves 
independent television stations  during both prime and non prime time  telecast self produced programming  off network programming or first run programming from independent producers or syndicators 
in general terms  a syndicator is a company that sells programming to independent television stations and network affiliates 
programming acquired by stations on a syndicated basis is acquired either for a cash license fee or in exchange for a certain amount of commercial advertising time within the program which is retained by the syndicator for sale to an advertiser barter  or for a combination of cash and barter 
the company domestically distributes programming for television produced by the company or unrelated third parties in the first run and rerun syndication markets 
in general  the company receives its revenues from program license fees paid by broadcasters and or by selling advertising time for programs distributed on a barter basis 
barter syndication is the process whereby a syndicator obtains clearances from television stations to broadcast a program in certain agreed upon time periods  retains advertising time in the program in lieu of receiving a cash licensing fee  and sells such retained advertising time for its own account to national advertisers at rates based on projected ratings and viewer demographics 
from time to time  certain stations may obtain cash consideration from the company in addition to programming in exchange for advertising time and or a commitment for a particular time period 
by placing the program with television stations throughout the united states  the syndicator creates an ad hoc network of stations that have agreed to carry the program 
the creation of this ad hoc network  typically representing a penetration of at least of total us television households calculated by means of a generally recognized system as measured by nielsen media ratings  enables the syndicator to sell the commercial inventory to sponsors desiring national coverage 
the rates charged by a syndicator for advertising time are typically lower than the rates charged by the networks for similar demographics since the networks coverage of the market is generally greater 
see business television operations domestic television distribution 
rates for the sale of advertising time are established on the basis of certain levels of audience rating and  in some cases  a demographic make up of the viewing audience assumed by the company 
because the company s arrangements with advertisers do not permit the company to receive advertising revenue on the amount by which the actual ratings or demographic make up as determined by nielsen media ratings or similar ratings services exceed the assumed ratings or demographic make up  it is in the interest of the company to establish as high an assumed rating and as favorable a demographic make up as possible 
if the television program does not achieve the assumed rating or demographic make up  the company may be obligated to offer the advertiser additional advertising time make goods on the same program or on other programs 
make goods are the predominant means by which the company satisfies such obligations to advertisers 
alternatively  the company may be obligated to refund a portion of the advertising revenue derived from such sales 
there can be no assurance in advance that the actual rating or demographic make up of a particular program will support the rates initially charged for advertising time on such programs 
the company generally reports net revenues from barter syndication after deducting a reserve for potential make goods 
historically  such reserve has been sufficient to cover the actual provision for make goods  although there is no assurance that such reserve will continue to be adequate 
sponsors that regularly purchase advertising time in the company s programs include procter gamble  bristol myers squibb  mci  beecham  kellogg company  nestle and rjr nabisco 
sales are typically made through advertising agencies representing the sponsors 
the barter syndication licenses granted by the company provide that the company retains a negotiated amount of commercial time per program for sale to national advertisers  with the remaining commercial time retained by the station for local sale 
a significant percentage of the company s revenues from television operations is derived from barter sales approximately  and  respectively  for each of the years in the three year period ended december  
barter sales may fluctuate significantly based on ratings of a particular program and general economic trends  such as advertising rates 
in most cases  the company s distribution revenues are based on a percentage of the net revenues derived from the sale of advertiser sponsorships and or from cash license fees 
the company normally advances all distribution costs for items such as advertising  promotion  and tape shipping and duplication and recoups such expenses out of program revenues 
the company s fee for distribution is generally between and of net revenues  and its fee for advertiser sales representation is generally between and of net revenues 
however  each fee arrangement is separately negotiated and may be subject to variation 
amounts remaining in excess of the company s distribution fees and recoupable expenses including a portion of the amounts derived from the sale of advertising time are either remitted in full to the producer from whom the company obtained the distribution rights  or if the company has a profit participation in the program  are shared between the company and the producer in accordance with a pre determined allocation 
in some instances  the company will make an advance payment to the producer to cover production costs or will guarantee the producer certain minimum license fees 
for the broadcast season  the company made advance payments and or certain guarantees with respect to superhuman samurai syber squad  sirens and the new family feud 
for the broadcast season  the company made no such guarantees 
the company has committed to provide  of the  per episode production budget for up to episodes of sinbad for the broadcast season 
television production costs are capitalized as incurred 
the income forecast method is used to amortize these costs based upon the revenues recognized in proportion to management s estimate of ultimate revenues to be received 
unamortized costs are reviewed periodically and compared with net realizable values on a project by project basis  and losses are provided to the extent necessary 
advertising revenues are recognized upon the commencement of the license period of the program and when the advertising time has been sold pursuant to non cancelable agreements  provided the program is available for its first broadcast 
the portion of recognized revenue which is to be shared with the producers and owners of the licensed program material participations payable and due to producers is accrued as the related revenue is recognized 
minimum guaranteed amounts from domestic television sales generally are recognized when the license period begins and the program becomes available pursuant to the terms of the license agreement 
foreign minimum guaranteed amounts or outright fees are recorded as revenues and contracts receivable on the date of the license agreement unless the program is not yet available for exhibition 
revenues under foreign production agreements are recognized as completed episodes are delivered 
deferred revenues consist principally of advance payments received on television contracts for which the products are not yet available for broadcast or exploitation 
domestic revenues from recorded music are recorded as units are shipped to customers 
the company provides for estimated future returns of recorded music product at the time when the products are initially sold 
these reserves are based upon historical experience 
actual returns are charged against the reserve 
foreign distribution of recorded music is effected through a distributor in exchange for guaranteed non refundable advances against future royalties 
non refundable guarantees from foreign sales are generally recognized as the company satisfies its delivery requirements to its foreign distributor 
royalties earned by artists from sales of recorded music product are charged to expense as the related revenues are recognized 
advances to artists against future royalties are recorded as assets if the company estimates that the amount of advances will be recoverable from future royalties to be earned by the artist  based upon the past performance and current popularity of the artist to whom the advance is made 
such artist advances and recording costs for new recording artists and for artists where recovery cannot be estimated are charged to expense as incurred 
pursuant to this policy  capitalized artist advances are reviewed on a quarterly basis  and any portion of advances that subsequently appears not to be fully recoverable from future royalties to be earned by the artist is charged to expense during the period in which the loss becomes evident 
as a result  some quarters or years will have fluctuating levels of these expenses depending on the number or type of artists signed or on changes in recording activities from period to period 
in the event of subsequent sales for any such artists for which the related advances were expensed  the company will have a higher margin for these sales than for sales by the company s other artists 
a small number of television programs and musical recordings historically has accounted for a significant portion of the company s revenues in any given fiscal period 
in addition  the company s television distribution revenues have historically been higher in the third and fourth quarters as a result of the commencement of the television season in the fall of each year 
as a result of the strip syndication of baywatch  the third quarter of reflected substantially all of the cash and a portion of the barter sales expected on the re run syndication of the series to date 
additional barter sales on the strip syndication will be recognized in subsequent periods 
in october  in order to further strengthen its position in the game show business  the company formed a joint venture with interpublic  which joint venture acquired substantially all of the assets of mark goodson productions  lp and a related entity 
effective january   the company agreed to acquire sole ownership of such joint venture 
the assets acquired included ownership rights to approximately goodson games show formats  including the currently televised network game show the price is right 
any change in programs from period to period or the discontinuation of certain projects may materially adversely affect a given period s results of operations 
therefore  year to year results may not be comparable  and results in any quarter may not be indicative of results for an entire year

the company may acquire domestic or foreign distribution rights to a particular television program in exchange for a minimum guarantee against a specified percentage of future licensing and or advertising sales revenue less certain costs of distribution
