item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the partnership wishes to caution readers that the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  the partnership s actual results and could cause the partnership s actual results in future years to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of the partnership 
financial condition the partnership derives its income from its interest in operating partners  whose income is generated from the operations of the inns 
operating partners receives all lodging and other revenues derived from  and is responsible for the payment of all expenses directly attributable to  the operation of the inns 
set forth below is information as to lodging and food and beverage revenues and expenses generated from the operations of the inns in thousands operating revenues lodging    food beverage    totals    direct operating expenses lodging    food beverage    marketing    utilities    repairs maintenance    rent    insurance property taxes    other    totals    operating revenues in excess of direct operating expenses    in  as part of its plan  operating partners restructured its mortgage notes under the restated loan agreement and arranged a priming loan to fund necessary capital improvements and finance operating deficiencies 
the improved condition of the inns coupled with proper management and assisted by the stable economy  have enabled the partnerships to significantly increase average daily room rates adr 
operating revenues have  therefore  increased to improve the cash flows to cover operating expenses  pay debt service includingthe tranche a loan  make necessary and required repairs and maintenance and repay the tranche b loan 
the ability of the partnerships to pay operating expenses  service debt and create required reserves depends upon the ability of the partnerships to increase future cash flows from operations 
unless cash flows from operations are sufficient  the partnerships may not be able to continue as going concerns  although it is the intention of the partnerships to continue to operate as going concerns 
it is  however  the present intention of operating partners to sell the moravia inn 
operating partners believe that the moravia inn will not contribute to the long term cash flow requirements of the partnerships  and therefore the sale proceeds can better be utilized to reduce the priming loan debt 
operating partners have no present intention to list any of the other inns for sale 
as required under the priming loan and restated loan agreement  approval by the lenders will be required for the sale of the moravia inn 
the partnerships investment in the inns continues to be subject to the risks generally incident to the ownership of real estate  including those relating to the uncertainty of cash flow to meet fixed obligations  adverse changes in national economic conditions  adverse changes in local market conditions  changes in interest rates  the availability of financing for operating or capital needs  changes in real estate tax rates and other operating expenses  adverse changes in governmental rules and fiscal policies  acts of god which may result in uninsured losses  condemnation and other factors that are beyond the control of the general partner  the partnership  operating partners or w h 
results of operations total revenues excluding non recurring income from the prime settlement increased to  in from  in and  in total non recurring income from the prime settlement was  in and  in the partnerships net loss was  for the year ended december  as compared to a loss of  in  and a loss of  in  including the prime settlement proceeds 
excluding the prime settlement proceeds received in and  the loss in of  decreased from the loss in of  and  in the following table compares the room revenues  occupancy percentage levels and adr for the years indicated lodging revenues in thousands    occupancy percentage adr the inns have been able to increase their respective adr s by changing the mix of market segments hotel guests categorized as individual business  leisure and government guests  etc 
and groups such as corporate  association  tours  crews  etc  from lower adr to higher adr segments 
attracting and maintaining the higher adr segments has been accomplished by increased marketing and sales promotions and the attractiveness of the inns as a result of the capital improvement program completed in and the continuation of capital improvements through in addition  the inns have been able to capture new accounts from businesses that have moved into the market 
in attracting the market segments with higher adr  the inns have had to remove most of their lower adr market segments such as airline crews and tour groups 
this repositioning of market segment business contributed to the decline in occupancies in due to the intense competition  including recent conversions of competitor hotels to hii franchises  and saturation of available rooms where the inns are located  the partnerships and w h believe it will continue to be difficult to substantially increase the respective occupancy levels at the inns 
another contributing factor to the projected stagnant occupancy is that approximately one third of the inns are highway oriented location properties  which in general have lagged behind in demand  as compared to midscale and urban  suburban and airport location properties 
also  these highway oriented inns have an external dated appearance due to their age  which contributes to their median occupancies 
it is anticipated that the inns can continue to improve their mix of market segments and thereby increase their adr s and improve profit margins 
this is expected to be accomplished by seeking the higher rated segments through continued participation in hii national advertising and marketing  priority club promotions and w h marketing and sales 
also  the inns plan to attract and target segments of business previously unattainable due to the conditions of the inns prior to the capital improvements 
the inns have been removing the lower rated market segments  in order to have the capacity to accept more higher rated segments that may have been previously denied a guest room 
food and beverage revenues for declined slightly to  from  in and  in the decline is attributed to the change in mix of market segments  since some of the market segments that pay a lower adr and were displaced  used the restaurant and banquet facilities at the inns more than some of the higher adr segments 
also  the food and beverage revenues have historically fluctuated with occupancies at the inns 
direct operating expenses in were  as compared to  in and  in the increase in lodging expenses is reflective of inflationary increases in labor costs  and increases in expenses that are incurred in servicing the higher rated market segments  such as room amenities  travel agent commissions  and guest supplies 
increases in food and beverage expenses are attributable to the inflationary increases in labor costs and food costs 
repair and maintenance costs have increased in over  which is reflective of the age of the inns 
in an effort to attract the higher rated market segments  the inns have increased spending in marketing  such as advertising costs and hotel promotions 
the inns utility cost increases are attributable to the less than favorable weather conditions in as compared to  and some utility rate increases incurred at a few of the inns 
the increase in property taxes is associated with increases in real estate and personal property tax rates at certain of the inns  as assessment values have stayed relatively stable in to that of the increases in other expenses  included in direct operating expenses  reflect higher administrative and general expenses directly incurred in the operations of the inns and in costs that vary with revenues  such as franchise fees paid to hii  management fees paid to w h  and credit card commissions 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased in  due to the original debt acquisition costs having been fully amortized in the first quarter of the reduction in interest expense is the result of the reduction in the outstanding principal balance of the mortgage notes from the  of prime settlement proceeds received in liquidity and capital resources the changes in cash and cash equivalents are summarized as follows net cash provided by operating activities   net cash used by investing activities    net cash provided by financing activities  net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents in  cash provided by operating revenues exceeded cash used for operating expenses of the inns and of the partnerships  resulting in net cash being provided by operating activities 
cash used by investment activities equaled  in  of which  was utilized for capital improvements and refurbishments 
in addition  there was a net increase in the restricted cash and cash equivalents of  in  including the funding to the ff e reserve of of gross revenues  which totaled  offset by the reduction of  in the funds required to be maintained in the property tax escrow account and the application of  that remained unexpended in from the mandatory advance balance under the priming loan to fund the capital improvements and refurbishments 
in  borrowings from the priming loan provided cash for financing activities 
the partnerships borrowed  under the tranche a loan and an additional  under the tranche b loan 
the entire balance of the tranche b loan was repaid from excess working capital in  in the amount of  in addition the remaining balance of the mandatory advance was drawn down for the capital improvements 
non cash activities in included the reduction of long term debt by  from the proceeds from the prime settlement 
in  cash flows from operating activities increased  as compared to  as a result of increased revenues from operations and control of operating expenses 
this resulted in net cash being provided by operating activities 
in  net cash used by investing activities was  and included additions to property and equipment of  partially offset by a  decrease in the restricted cash accounts 
the restricted cash accounts included the net reduction in the ff e reserve of  the capital expenditures of  which were funded from the ff e reserve exceeded the  funded to the ff e reserve at of revenues  plus interest earned on the account net of an increase of  in the interest reserve and tax escrow accounts 
in  borrowings from the priming loan provided cash for financing activities 
the partnerships borrowed the remaining  under the tranche a loan and  under the tranche b loan 
the entire tranche b loan borrowed to supplement cash flow deficiencies in the first quarter of was repaid from excess working capital in the second quarter of in  cash provided by operating revenues exceeded cash used for operating expenses of the inns and of the partnerships  resulting in net cash being provided by operating activities 
cash used in investing activities equaled  in  of which  was utilized for capital improvements and refurbishments and  of increases in restricted cash 
the restricted cash accounts included the net increase in the ff e reserve of  funding plus interest earned of  less capital expenditures of  and increases of  in the interest reserve and tax escrow accounts 
the partnerships borrowed  from the tranche b loan to supplement operating cash flow deficiencies during the first quarter of the entire tranche b loan was repaid from excess working capital during the second quarter of until the priming loan is paid in full  no principal is required to be paid on the mortgage notes from operating cash 
in and  interest on the mortgage notes was payable at per annum and at per annum in  with the interest rate increasing to per annum after including on the deferred amount 
the outstanding principal amount of the mortgage notes has been reduced by  from the proceeds of the prime settlement  during   during  and  during 
the partnerships ongoing cash requirements are for working capital  debt service and the funding of required reserves 
the partnerships source of liquidity is the operations of the inns  which during the winter months have been insufficient to fund working capital  debt service and required reserves 
the partnerships may however  borrow up to  of the tranche b portion of the priming loan for operating cash deficiencies  but must repay any amount borrowed  if for any month cash on hand exceeds working capital requirements  as defined in the priming loan 
there were no tranche b borrowings outstanding as of december  approximately  of working capital cash was on hand as of december  presently the partnerships have a capital replacement reserve of approximately  which is available only for capital improvements and refurbishments 
beginning in  the ff e reserve was required under the priming loan  to be funded on a monthly basis at of revenues 
the required funding of the ff e reserve increased to of revenues in  and thereafter 
the interest reserve account contains approximately  the interest reserve account was established through the initial priming loan  and  at the option of the lenders  may be used to cure any default under the priming loan 
no additional funding to the interest reserve is required under the priming loan 
no distributions will be made to unitholders until the priming loan is paid in full  proper required reserves are maintained  and proper payments are made on the mortgage notes which would include principal reduction 
there is no guarantee that there will ever be excess cash for such distributions to unitholders 
the partnerships anticipate moderate growth in the economy  in the travel and hospitality industries  in the real estate market and in the comparative attractiveness of the inns resulting from the capital improvements although neither the partnership nor any of its advisors can give any assurances as to the strength or duration of any such economic growth 
the partnerships anticipate that such economic growth coupled with the improvements constantly being made to the physical condition of the inns  continued professional management and marketing of the inns  will result in the improvement of occupancies  room rates and related revenues  and thus create better profit margins 
the partnerships anticipate that their future earnings  together with the advances under the priming loan  will enable the partnerships to pay all operating expenses  pay debt service and satisfy the current requirements under the hii franchise agreements 
however  while the partnerships budgets and capital plans reflect their present best estimates of future events  those events are beyond the control of the partnerships  the general partner and w h and no assurances can be given that the partnerships will have the liquidity to meet future operating and capital commitments 
further  the holiday inns franchise of ten of the inns will expire on june  and the franchises of two additional inns will expire on december  before the expiration of the franchise for any holiday inn property  the property is inspected by hii and that inspection forms the basis for a property improvement plan pip  the completion of which is a condition to the renewal of the franchise for the property 
hii has inspected and prepared pip s for ten of the inns  the franchises of which expire in hii has indicated that they may not renew the franchises of two of the inns and accordingly has not prepared a pip for them 
based on those pip s  operating partners current estimate of the cost of the capital expenditures could be in the range of  although operating partners believes that the scope of work and related costs are subject to negotiation 
accordingly  operating partners has begun the process of evaluating  for each inn  the relative benefits and costs of renewing the holiday inn franchise for the inn  operating the inn under other franchises that may be available  and operating the inn without a franchise affiliation 
in addition  operating partners will evaluate improvements and expenditures included in each pip in order to identify those items that operating partners believes will enhance the inn s ability to compete in its market and will add value to the inn  and those improvements or expenditures that operating partners believes to be less necessary or to add little value 
operating partners will then negotiate with hii the scope of work included in each pip and the length of time that will be required to complete such improvements 
generally  in connection with the renewal of the franchise for an inn  operating partners will have one year  which may be negotiable  from the franchise expiration date to complete the capital improvements included in the pip 
it is anticipated that those capital improvements will be financed partially from the ff e reserve and from additional financing  if available 
however  under the priming loan and restated loan agreements  approval by the lenders will be required for any franchise changes  capital expenditures or additional financing 
operating partners operating expenses have been and are expected to be subject to inflationary pressures 
depending on levels of economic activity and competitive pressures  the room rates and food and beverage charges at the inns may also increase with inflation  but not necessarily in proportion to the pressures affecting expenses 
under the internal revenue code  a publicly traded partnership  such as the partnership  is taxable as a corporation unless it satisfies certain conditions 
however  subject to various limitations  publicly traded partnerships in existence on december  are generally exempt from taxation as a corporation until after if the partnerships operations continue as described herein  the partnership should not be taxed as a corporation until after however  a publicly traded partnership which adds a substantial new line of business is not eligible for such exemption and it is possible that the internal revenue service could contend that the partnership should be taxed as a corporation after november   the date of the termination of the lease 
if the partnership were taxable as a corporation  its operating losses should eliminate any tax liability for some time
