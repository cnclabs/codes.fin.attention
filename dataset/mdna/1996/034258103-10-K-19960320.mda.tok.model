item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition general 
the company s results of operations depend to a great extent on the banks net interest income  the difference between income earned on its loan and investment portfolios and the interest paid on its deposits and borrowed funds  the size of the provisions for loan losses and losses on real estate operations and operating expenses 
net interest income is primarily affected by the level of earning assets as a percentage of total assets  the level of interest bearing liabilities  yields earned on assets and rates paid on liabilities 
earnings are also affected by non interest income which consists primarily of mortgage servicing fees  transaction account fees  gains and losses on sales of the investment portfolio and real estate operations 
the levels of operating expenses and income taxes also affect earnings 
the following is a discussion and analysis of the company s consolidated results of operations for the last three years and its financial condition at the end of fiscal and in order to understand this section in context  it should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
results of operations andover generated net income of million or per share  million or per share and million or per share in  and  respectively 
andover s return on average assets decreased to in compared to in and in return on average stockholders equity decreased to in compared to in and in the financial performance in was negatively impacted by a pre tax charge to earnings of million taken in connection with the failed acquisition of finest financial corp  the parent company of pelham bank and trust company 
operating results in were positively impacted by a rise in earning assets resulting from the acquisition of community  partially offset by an increased effective income tax rate as compared to the declining economy and real estate markets led to high levels of non performing assets during through  non performing assets were  and of total assets at december   and  respectively 
while progress continued to be made during in reducing non performing assets  a provision for loan losses in the amount of million was recorded 
the continued progress in reducing non performing assets and changing risk characteristics of the loan portfolio led to no provision for loan losses recorded in and additionally  losses on real estate operations negatively impacted earnings and totalled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net interest and dividend income 
net interest and dividend income was million in  up from million in and million in net interest income increased million during as a result of higher average earning asset volumes 
market interest rates have been fairly volatile over the past four years 
interest rates increased dramatically during after two years of historically low levels and peaked in the fourth quarter of during  market interest rates decreased from the levels experienced in  although they remained at levels above those experienced in and while interest rates have declined during  the rates paid and yields earned have both increased during the year due to the lagged nature of many of the company s assets and liabilities 
this combination led to an increase of basis points in the yield on average earning assets during to while the rate paid on average interest bearing liabilities increased basis points to 
the net impact of these increases led to a decline of basis points on the net yield on earning assets during to from in the increase in net interest and dividend income in over of million was primarily attributable to the increased average earning asset volumes  partially offset by a declining yield on those assets 
the decrease yield of basis points during to in light of the increased interest rate environment is due to large volumes of fixed rate assets originated in prior years when rates were lower as well as the time delay in the repricing of the adjustable rate assets 
there was a slight increase in the rate paid on liabilities during  totalling basis points to an overall rate of 
the combination of these two factors led to a basis point decline in the net yield on earning assets during to 
the amount of foregone interest income from nonaccruing and restructured loans totalled million in  million in and  in in  average earning assets increased to  million  due to an increase in average loans resulting from retained loan originations as well as loan purchases 
in  average earning assets increased to million from s level of million 
this increase is due to the growth strategy of the company to increase the net interest margin via the acquisition of community as well as internal growth in loans and investments 
total average loans increased million during primarily due to retained loan originations and whole loan purchases and total average loans increased million during primarily due to the community acquisition 
the yield on real estate loans increased basis points during to while dropping basis points in to 
the reasons for the yield on real estate loans going in an inverse direction with market interest rates is once again due to the lag in the repricing of the variable rate loans as well as the repricing limitation of only during one year 
the yield on consumer loans increased basis points during to and basis points during to 
the yield on commercial loans increased basis points during to and basis points in to 
consumer and commercial loans were affected by the increase in the prime rate during the past two years 
commercial loans were also favorably impacted by a reduction in nonaccrual loans and higher amortized fee income during the volatility in the interest rates has also impacted the yields earned on the investment portfolio 
the yield on short term investments increased basis points during to and basis points in to 
the yields earned on investment securities decreased slightly in to while also dropping basis points in to 
the yield on mortgage backed securities increased basis points during to and decreased slightly in to 
the rate paid on deposits increased basis points in to and basis points in to 
core deposits  which include now account  savings and money market accounts  continued to decrease in both of the past two years as customers continue to shift into higher paying term certificates of deposits 
while the company was able to keep the rates paid on the core deposits fairly low overall during  there was an increase in the rate paid as compared to a decrease in the core deposit rates in certificates of deposit increased million and the rate paid increased basis points during while also increasing million and basis points  respectively  in in order to fund the growth in average earning assets  the company has continued its reliance on borrowed funds as an alternative source of funds 
during  the average balance on borrowed funds increased million and the rate paid increased basis points to while in  average balances increased million and the rate paid increased basis points to 
overall  the continued compression in the margins over the past two years have led to an interest rate spread of in  down basis points from in the decline in the spread in totalled basis points

rate volume analysis 
the following table shows the changes in interest income and interest expense caused by changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and changes in interest rates

the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to the statement of operations 
assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses involves substantial uncertainties and is based upon management s evaluation of the amounts required to meet estimated losses in the loan portfolio after weighing various factors 
among the factors management may consider are the quality of specific loans  risk characteristics of the loan portfolio generally  the level of nonaccruing loans  current economic conditions  trends in delinquencies and charge offs  and collateral values of the underlying security 
ultimate loan losses may vary significantly from current estimates and future additions may be necessary 
in addition  regulatory agencies  as an integral part of the examination process  review the company s allowance and may require the company to provide additions to the allowance based on their assessment  which may differ from management s assessment 
the provision for loan losses in was million 
there was no provision for loan losses in and net charge offs amounted to million in compared to million in and million in among the factors used to determine that a provision was necessary in were the level of nonaccrual and restructured loans  delinquencies and charge offs 
additionally  growth in the loan portfolio of over contributed to the need for a provision in the contributing factors that led to management s conclusion that no provision for loan losses was needed in and were the decline in the risk characteristics of loans over the prior two years and the resulting allowance coverage as a percentage of nonaccruing loans 
additionally   in loan loss recoveries and  in interest payments applied as principal reductions on nonaccrual loans contributed to management s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses in while management believes it has been prudent in its analysis of the allowance for loan losses and in estimating the net fair values of other real estate owned  management is unable to predict the ultimate course of the economy or the extent of its impact on the company s financial condition 
see financial condition risk elements and notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
non interest income loss 
the company recorded income from non interest sources of million in and million in  as compared to a net loss from non interest sources of million in the increases of million in and million in were primarily due to a reduction in the losses on real estate operations and increases in mortgage banking income 
net gains from sales and redemptions of investments totalled  in   in and  in see financial condition investments and notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the company recorded net gains on assets held for sale of  in and  in as compared to net losses of  in the gains in were primarily due to a reduction of the unrealized loss on loans held for sale whose fair value was below amortized cost at december  the losses in were primarily the result of selling mortgage backed securities in a rising interest rate environment 
included in was a realized loss of  on the transfer of loans originally held for sale to the loan portfolio as well as an unrealized loss based on the fair value of loans held for sale as of december  the gains in were primarily due to the ability of the company to sell higher yielding mortgage backed securities in an environment where interest rates were falling offset by a provision of  taken as a result of accelerated prepayments and estimated future prepayments on loans serviced for others 
see financial condition investments and notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
andover may incur gains and losses on the sale of the loans that it originates 
these loans are generally securitized prior to sale in the form of mortgage backed securities which are guaranteed by a government agency and are then held for sale 
because loans held for sale are stated at the lower of cost or market value and mortgage backed securities held for sale are stated at fair value  periods of rising interest rates cause decreased values of loans and mortgage backed securities held for sale  resulting in a charge to income 
the company frequently enters into forward delivery contracts to reduce exposure to this risk from rising interest rates 
forward delivery contracts may  however  increase exposure to the risk from declining interest rates if sufficient loans or mortgage backed securities held for sale bearing interest rates specified by the contracts are not available to meet the delivery schedules under the contracts 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
losses on real estate operations totalled million in  million in and million in real estate operations consist of the provision for the valuation allowance  operating and administrative costs of maintaining other real estate owned and gains or losses on sales of properties 
the company accounts for other real estate owned at the lower of cost or estimated net fair value 
declines in value subsequent to foreclosure or substantive repossession result in a charge to the valuation allowance 
replenishing the valuation allowance caused by charge offs taken as a result of declines in value resulted in a charge of  million and million to real estate operations in  and  respectively 
deterioration in the new england real estate market during through led to high levels of other real estate owned and corresponding administrative costs 
gains on sales of other real estate owned totalled  in  million in and  in reflecting  in part  the appropriate carrying values for the properties sold during the year 
the costs of foreclosing on loans  as well as the administrative costs of maintaining the non performing assets  correspond with the volume of problem assets and totalled million in  million in and million in these costs will continue to be incurred until the level of non performing assets significantly decreases 
see financial condition risk elements and note to the consolidated financial statements 
mortgage banking income represents the gross servicing fee income less amortization of capitalized excess mortgage servicing rights 
mortgage banking income totalled million in  million in and  in the increased income in each of the years was due to a reduction in the amortization of the excess mortgage servicing rights as well as an increase in the total loans serviced for others 
as a servicer for investors  the company generally retains a fee out of the interest paid by the borrower

the company intends to continue purchasing mortgage servicing to increase the use of its existing servicing capacity and increase loan service revenue 
the company also expects to continue selling mortgages in the secondary market and that servicing income related to this activity will continue for the forseeable future 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
other income totalled million  million  and million in  and  respectively  and was derived primarily from customer service charges and fees 
deposit account service charges representing the largest component of such other income  totalled million in  million in and million in the increase in was due to a service charge increase while the increase in resulted from an increase in the total number of deposit accounts resulting from the acquisition of community 
loan late charges and other fees have increased over the past two years in relation to the increase in total loans 
in  the company recognized gains of  on the sale of a non marketable security   on the sale of a former branch facility and another  on the sale of the student loan portfolio in the first quarter of the year 
other income which has remained relatively flat over the past three years includes income from liberty securities  rental income from tenants  safe deposit and atm fees and other miscellaneous charges 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
non interest expense 
non interest expenses increased million or to million in non interest expenses increased million or to million in the increased in was primarily due to the million charge taken in connection with the failed acquisition of finest financial corp 
as well as costs associated with operating a larger institution 
the increase in resulted from the acquisition of community and thus higher salaries and overhead costs 
salaries and employee benefits increased  to million in and increased million in to million 
the increase in was the result of a higher head count  opening the new bank subsidiary and merit increases 
the increase in was primarily due to the acquisition of community and increased headcount needed in running a larger institution 
additionally in  the company enhanced various benefit programs such as the esop  k employer contribution and continuing education that resulted in an additional  charge to earnings 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
office occupancy and equipment increased  to million in and increased  in to million 
the primary reason for the increase in and was the improvement of technology and computer systems throughout the organization  resulting in higher depreciation expense 
the company also accelerated depreciation of obsolete equipment and computers 
additionally  in  the bank incurred a charge to earnings that totalled  for the early termination of a lease as well as increased costs for two additional branches resulting from the acquisition of community 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
data processing expenses totalled million in   in and  in data processing expenses increased  in due to a higher loan and deposit base resulting from the acquisition of community as well as from the purchase of mortgage loan servicing 
data processing expenses increased in  primarily due to operating a larger institution 
mortgage banking expenses totalled  in   in and  in these expenses include amortization of the purchased servicing rights  as well costs associated with the servicing portfolio for outside investors 
the increase of  in was due primarily to the increased amortization of the purchased servicing rights 
the modest decrease in was due to a reduction in the costs associated with the servicing portfolio 
deposit insurance premiums were  million and million  and  respectively 
deposit insurance premiums decreased  in due primarily to the premium refund from the fdic in the third quarter in the amount of  additionally  the assessment rate dropped during the latter half of resulting in overall cost reductions 
deposit insurance premiums increased  in due to a higher deposit base 
the banks are in the lowest risk category in calculating fdic insurance premiums 
marketing expenses totalled  in   in and  in marketing expenses increased  in due to promotions related to the opening of andover bank nh as well as a number of other discretionary promotions for various retail products 
the decrease in was due to a reduction in the marketing of various residential loan products and promotions 
professional fees  including corporate legal expense and accounting and audit expenses  totalled  in   in and  in the modest increase in was due primarily to costs related to the opening of abnh 
the merger expense of million in was related to the costs associated with the terminated merger agreement with finest financial corp 
in the second quarter 
this non recurring charge included costs incurred by the investment advisors and the legal and audit professionals 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
other operating expenses totalled million in  million in and million in the increases of  in and  in are both due to running a larger organization with a new bank added in and two branches acquired in the consecutive increases result from higher postage expenses  office supplies and printing costs as well as telephone costs and directors fees 
federal and state income tax expense 
the company recorded tax expenses of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of the company s assets and liabilities 
measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based upon the provision of enacted tax laws and the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates 
management believes the existing net deductible temporary differences that give rise to the net deferred income tax asset will reverse in periods in which the company generates net taxable income 
for the years ending december   and   the company generated taxable income of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
taxable income differs from pretax book income primarily as a result of loan losses and provision for losses on other real estate owned being recognized in a different period than for book income 
the company recorded a reduction of the valuation allowance due to increased recoverable federal income taxes of  in  million in and million in at december   the net deferred tax asset is supported by recoverable income taxes of approximately million 
the total income tax expense has been increased to reflect the adjustment to the deferred tax assets for the tax impact of the massachusetts tax rate reduction as part of the bank tax reform law signed by the governor of massachusetts on july  management believes that the net deferred income tax asset at december  will be realized based upon the significant reduction in the level of non performing assets over the past several years 
it is management s belief that the valuation allowance is adequate to reduce the total deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
it should be noted  however  that factors beyond management s control  such as the general state of the economy and real estate values  can affect future levels of taxable income and that no assurance can be given that sufficient taxable income will be generated to fully absorb gross deductible temporary differences 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
financial condition total assets increased million  or  to  million at december  the growth in total assets was primarily due to an increase in total loans of million  offset by a decrease in the investment portfolio of million 
total assets at december  amounted to  million  an increase of million or from million at december   primarily resulting from the acquisition of million in total assets of community during the year 
loans 
total loans at december   prior to the allowance for loan losses  amounted to million compared with million at december   an increase of million or primarily due to the purchase of million in residential and commercial whole loans

origination volumes have also been affected by the interest rate environment over the past five years and are sensitive to market rates  particularly in the refinancing arena 
as can be determined by the following table  loan originations were extremely high in the years with the lowest interest rates 
loan originations dropped in due to the higher interest rates existing during most of the year 
residential loan originations totalled million in  million in and million in the originations are not fully reflected in loans outstanding due to the securitization of residential real estate loans into mortgage backed securities held for sale of million in  million in and million in as well as regular amortization and prepayments 
the majority of the company s residential loans are underwritten to be eligible for sale in the secondary market 
andover sells most of the eligible year fixed rate loans it originates 
a loan which the company intends to sell in the secondary market may be sold directly or converted into mortgage backed securities and sold in that form 
residential loans sold either directly or in the form of mortgage backed securities amounted to million in and million in  versus million in and million in the portfolio of residential mortgage loans serviced for others totalled million at december   compared to million at december  and million at december  the following table shows the composition of the company s loan originations and loan purchases for the years indicated years ended december  in thousands real estate loans residential fixed rate      residential variable rate      total residential originations      commercial      construction and land      total real estate loan originations      residential variable rate whole loan purchases  commercial whole loan purchases  total real estate purchases  total real estate loan originations and purchases

while originations of corporate loans  comprised of commercial real estate  commercial  construction and land loans  are sensitive to the interest rate environment  the capacity for borrowing and real estate values have a more critical role 
during the declining real estate markets in the early s  commercial real estate and development loans were particularly hard hit 
origination volume for corporate loans decreased in and  corresponding with the declining real estate values 
origination volume for these loans have increased in each of the past three years  reflecting the stabilizing values and the company s interest in corporate lending 
total originations of corporate loans were million in  million in and million in loans transferred into real estate owned totalled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
commercial real estate  construction and land  and commercial loans involve significant risks compared with single family residential mortgage and consumer lending 
see item  business lending activities 
consumer loans outstanding decreased slightly to million at december   from million at year end during the first quarter of  student loans totalling million were sold at a gain of  additionally  originations of consumer loans are also sensitive to changes in the interest rate environment and have decreased during the past two years to million in risk elements the following table shows the composition of non performing assets at december in thousands nonaccruing loans      restructured loans     total non performing loans      other real estate owned      total non performing assets      total non performing assets as a percentage of total assets during  continued progress was made in reducing non performing assets with a reduction of million or 
due to the rising interest rate environment of  several borrowers had difficulties in meeting their obligations  therefore  the bank modified their interest rate  causing an increase in restructured loans 
andover had experienced a sharp increase in the level of non performing assets and a corresponding rise in foregone income  loan losses and other costs associated with non performing assets beginning in due to the deteriorating new england real estate market and economy 
interest income of approximately million would have been recorded in on nonaccruing loans if those loans had been on a current basis in accordance with their original terms

effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan sfas  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosure sfas 
these statements require changes in both the disclosure and impairment measurement of non performing loans 
at december   total impaired loans were million  or which million had related allowances of million and million which did not require a related allowance 
all of the million in impaired loans have been measured using the fair value of the collateral method 
during the period ended december   the average recorded value of impaired loans was million and the related amount of interest income recognized was  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
nonaccruing loans 
management places loans  regardless of collateral values  on nonaccrual status when interest is past due days or more 
all previously accrued but uncollected interest is reversed against current period interest income when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
when collection procedures do not bring a loan to performing status  andover generally institutes action to foreclose upon the property or to acquire it by deed in lieu of foreclosure 
loans for which payments are less than days past due are placed on nonaccrual status where there exists serious doubt as to the ultimate collectibility of the loan 
the following table shows the composition of nonaccruing loans at december in thousands residential real estate      commercial real estate      construction and land  commercial      consumer total nonaccrual loans      allowance for loan losses      allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonaccruing loans allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non performing loans allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans during  loans on nonaccrual decreased to million  spread among all loan categories 
the increase in was primarily due to the acquisition of community 
a significant portion of andover s nonaccruing loans are secured by mixed use commercial and multi family real estate located in lawrence  massachusetts 
this city has been especially hard hit with declining real estate values and increasing vacancies in multi family investor owned properties  which represents the majority of andover s collateral on troubled loans in lawrence 
continued deterioration in this market area will adversely impact the collectibility of residential and commercial real estate loans and may result in an increased level of non performing assets in at december   approximately million of nonaccruing loans  million of restructured loans and million of other real estate owned were secured by residential properties located in lawrence  of which the largest non performing loans include loans to three borrowers totalling million  million and million  respectively 
the amount of accruing loans secured by properties in lawrence totalled approximately million at december  the two largest relationships with borrowers included in the accruing lawrence portfolio totalled million and million  respectively  at december  substantially all of the accruing loans at year end in lawrence were secured by residential properties 
restructured loans 
a restructured loan is one for which the bank has modified the terms to provide a temporary reduction in the rate of interest and  in most instances  an extension of payments of principal or interest or both due to the deterioration in the financial position of the borrowers 
restructured loans are not returned to performing status until the obligation has performed for a reasonable period of time  its ultimate collectibility is no longer in doubt and is at a market rate of interest 
restructured loans totalled million and million at december  and  respectively 
interest rate modifications typically do not exceed one year 
the weighted average interest rate on restructured loans as of december  was 
interest income that would have been recognized in if restructured loans had been performing in accordance with their original terms was  the actual amount of interest on these loans that was recognized in interest income in was  other real estate owned 
andover s other real estate owned has remained at rather high levels after rising significantly in and due to the deterioration in the new england real estate market and economy 
a valuation allowance was established in and represents management s evaluation of collectibility  prior loss experience  selling costs and quality of the properties included in other real estate owned 
the following table shows the composition of other real estate owned at december in thousands residential real estate      commercial real estate     multi family real estate      construction and land      valuation allowance    total other real estate owned      substantive repossessions  for which the bank had not completed legal transfer of ownership  included in the above table  totalled  and million at december  and  respectively 
all other real estate owned is carried at the lower of the carrying value of the loan or the estimated net fair value of the property constructively or actually received 
initial writedowns to net fair value are charged to the allowance for loan losses and totalled million in  million in and million in subsequent provisions for losses due to the deterioration in real estate values are charged to real estate operations and totalled  in  million in and million in gains of  million and  were recognized on sales of million  million and million in other real estate owned in  and  respectively 
of the properties included in other real estate owned at december   andover had outstanding purchase and sales agreements or firm offers of million on properties with a carrying value approximating that amount 
there is no assurance such sales will be consummated 
due to the level of nonaccrual loans at december   continued foreclosures are likely to occur in resulting in additional foreclosure and related operating expenses 
the impact of existing non performing assets on future interest income will be largely dependent upon converting these assets to earning status  either through a return to performing status or through foreclosure and subsequent disposition of the property  which remain somewhat limited in the current real estate market 
it is expected that the level of foreclosures and related expenses will continue to adversely impact earnings in there are no binding commitments for capital expenditures on other real estate owned at december  see item  business risk elements 
allowance for loan losses 
the following table summarizes the activity in andover s allowance for loan losses during the five years ended december in thousands balance at beginning of year      balance of acquired institution  provision   charge offs residential real estate     commercial real estate     construction and land  commercial   consumer total charge offs      recoveries residential real estate commercial real estate construction and land commercial consumer total recoveries  net charge offs      balance at end of year      ratio of net charge offs to average loans outstanding net charge offs totalled million in  million in  and million in the ratio of net charge offs to average loans  however  has continued its steady decline from the levels experienced in and total only for the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans decreased to at december   from and at december  and  respectively 
management analyzes the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at least quarterly 
see results of operations provision for loan losses 
management measures the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses by assigning loans into risk categories based on a loan classification system modelled after the bank regulatory classification system 
while management believes that its allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover potential losses  there are uncertainties regarding future events  particularly in the currently weakened new england real estate market and economy 
further deterioration in the real estate market or economy may result in additional nonaccruing loans  charge offs and a need for provisions for loan losses to maintain an adequate allowance 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the banks allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the banks to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
allocation of the allowance for loan losses to the various categories of the portfolio is also made periodically  based on management s judgment in weighing various factors  including the quality of specific loans  the level of nonaccruing loans in the various categories  current economic conditions  trends in delinquencies and prior charge offs  and the collateral value of the underlying security 
because the allowance for loan losses is based on various estimates  including loan collectibility and real estate values  and includes a high degree of judgment  subsequent changes in the general economic prospects of the borrowers may require changes in those estimates 
the banks monitor the loan portfolio and related allowance through the use of account plans prepared for nonaccruing loans  other real estate owned and other loans identified by management as needing closer monitoring 
the account plans are prepared for loans which have been assigned adverse credit risk ratings and have been considered in determining the appropriate level of allowance for loan losses 
the largest exposure to a single borrower included in non performing loans at december   was loans totalling approximately million  consisting primarily of multi family real estate 
the changes in the allowance allocated to each category of loan directly corresponds to the level of nonaccrual loans and adversely classified loans 
those levels have a direct correlation to the level of deterioration in the new england real estate market and economy 
andover historically has experienced minimal losses in its residential mortgage loan portfolio and  therefore  allocations applicable to this portfolio are lower

investments and mortgage backed securities as of december   andover s investment portfolio totalled million  a decrease of from millon at year end a large part of the decrease in the investment portfolio was due to the sale of million in investments available for sale with the proceeds used to fund a residential whole loan purchase in the fourth quarter of the company manages the investment portfolio in accordance with the investment policy adopted by the board of directors 
the primary objectives are to provide interest and dividend income  to ensure adequate liquidity and achieve an acceptable asset liability gap position 
the primary component of the total investment portfolio is mortgage backed securities  which accounted for of total investments at december  the remaining portion of the total investment portfolio consists of us government and federal agency obligations  and other investment grade securities 
substantially all of the mortgage backed security portfolio as of december   represent undivided interests in pools of mortgages which have been formed into pass through securities and sold to investors by the government national mortgage association gnma  the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc and the federal national mortgage association fnma 
securities issued by gnma  a wholly owned us government corporation  are fully guaranteed as to the timely payment of principal and interest 
securities issued by fhlmc and fnma  government sponsored corporations  carry each corporation s guarantee as to the timely payment of interest and the ultimate payment of principal 
cash flows from the underlying mortgages of all mortgage backed securities are passed through to andover in the form of monthly payments of interest  scheduled principal amortization  and prepayments of mortgage balances 
these securities  therefore  have unpredictable cash flows 
at december   the investment portfolio had million in collateralized mortgage obligations cmo s  a decline of million from last year 
the underlying collateral of these cmo s consists of residential mortgages and these derivative securities are not considered high risk as defined by the regulatory agencies 
included in federal agency obligations at december  were million in step up bonds issued by the federal home loan bank and fhlmc 
these bonds have guaranteed interest rate increases and are callable at par 
the approximate market value of adjustable rate bonds and mortgage backed securities included in the investment portfolio totalled million and million  respectively  at december  debt securities are classified as held to maturity only when there is positive intent and ability to hold them to maturity 
such securities are recorded at amortized cost 
trading securities are debt and equity securities held principally for the purpose of selling in the near term 
the company does not have any securities designated as trading securities 
such securities are recorded at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses recorded in earnings 
investments available for sale are any debt or equity security not classified as either held to maturity or trading securities 
investments available for sale are recorded at their fair value with changes in fair value recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity  net of the related income taxes 
upon the adoption of sfas  the company transferred million of various securities into investments available for sale 
the net unrealized gain on the investments available for sale included in stockholders equity  net of applicable income taxes  was million at december  under the provision of the fasb s special report  a guide to implementation of sfas accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities questions and answers  the company reclassified certain investments with an amortized cost of million and a net unrealized gain of  from held to maturity to available for sale in december of during  there was a decline in market interest rates 
this caused a change in the unrealized gain of approximately million in the investment portfolio from a net unrealized loss of as of december  to a net unrealized gain of million as of december  the changes in interest rates and their impact on the unrealized gain or loss in the investment portfolio is not a material factor in the company s overall investment strategy 
this is largely due to the fact that neither the changes nor their impact can be controlled and the company seeks a way to diversify the asset mix  earn an adequate spread and allow for liquidity 
additionally  investment purchases are often match funded by long term advances in order to achieve a consistent spread on the investment

that shift is best evidenced by the percentage of total deposits held on certificates from as of december  to as of december  total deposits increased million during to million as of december   primarily due to the acquisition of community s million in deposits 
additionally  the increasing interest rates in enabled the bank to aggressively market its deposit products and successfully increase its time certificate balances

the board of directors reviews and approves the alco policy annually and monitors related activities on an ongoing basis 
the main objective is to provide a steady and  to the degree possible  increasing net interest margin  even during periods of volatile market interest rates 
the critical day to day roles of the alco are implemented by two committees the risk management committee and the rate management committee 
the former s primary responsibility is to monitor and assess risk  develop strategies and tactics to deal with various risk factors and to monitor the implementation of agreed upon tactics 
the rate management committee is primarily responsible for setting deposit interest rates and is involved in other banking product pricing issues 
during  the bank was able to aggressively promote and attract additional deposit balances in light of the increasing interest rate environment 
as deposit rates continued to increase in  the banks continued to attract term certificate balances as depositors shifted their funds out of core deposits into alternative products 
during the past several years  the bank continued to rely on borrowed funds as an alternative source of funds to grow interest earning assets 
during  the company continued to follow its past practice of selling  while retaining the servicing rights  certain fixed rate residential mortgage loans which were  for the most part  converted prior to sale to mortgage backed securities 
in conjunction with the mortgage selling secondary market activity  the bank uses forward contracts in order to reduce exposure to interest rate risk 
the amount of forward coverage of the pipeline of mortgages is set on a day to day basis by a line manager  within policy guidelines  based on the company s assessment of the general direction of interest rates and the levels of mortgage origination activity 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s gap analysis  which involves comparing the difference between assets and liabilities that mature or reprice during a given period of time  is one measurement of its sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations 
these differences are a primary component of the risk to net interest income

for example  fixed rate mortgage loans are shown in the table in the time period corresponding to scheduled principal amortization and anticipated prepayments based on their respective weighted average maturities  weighted average rates and annual conditional prepayment rates at december  that vary from as compared with at december  adjustable rate loans  securities  certificates of deposit and borrowed funds are allocated to the period in which the rates could be next adjusted or final contractual maturity on fixed rate instruments 
mortgage backed securities were allocated using weighted average maturities  weighted average coupons and annual conditional prepayment rates of at december   versus at december  although a substantial portion of regular savings and now accounts are considered core deposits by management and  therefore  relatively insensitive to interest rates  and despite the fact that any future changes to the interest rates paid on these accounts is at the sole discretion of management  based upon the company s assessment of current market conditions  such accounts have been included in the other deposits category and have been allocated between each time period in recognition of the lagged variable rate feature 
the amounts for have been adjusted based on an updated assessment of the rate sensitivity of core deposits and is consistent with the interest rate sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities illustrated in the above table would vary substantially if different assumptions were used or if actual experience differs from that indicated by such assumptions

the company made payments of dividends to stockholders in the amount of million  million and  respectively  for the years ended december   and the goal of the company s liquidity management process is to assess funding requirements so as to efficiently meet the cash needs of borrowers and depositors  while also providing funds for attractive investment opportunities 
the banks have a diverse base of funding 
sources of liquidity include maturation  amortization and prepayment of the investment and loan portfolios 
another source of liquidity is funds purchased from other banks  the sale of securities under repurchase agreements and borrowings from the fhlb  of which andover bank is a voluntary member 
the banks may also obtain funds from the federal reserve bank of boston by pledging certain assets 
at december   the company had home equity  reserve credit and commercial unused lines of credit totalling million 
outstanding commitments to originate real estate loans totalled million 
unadvanced portions of real estate loans amounted to million 
standby letters of credit were  loans sold with recourse totalled million 
management believes that its sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet these commitments if and as called upon 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
cash flows provided by operating activities decreased by million to million at december  and increased by million to million at december  the change in both years was primarily due to an increase or decrease in assets held for sale 
cash flows from investing activities decreased by million from to and increased million from to the decrease in was due to fewer purchases of investments held to maturity 
the increase in was due to an increase in total loans combined with slower prepayment experience of the mortgage backed securities 
cash flows provided by financing activities decreased million from to  primarily due to a smaller increase in total deposits and higher repayments on fhlb advances 
cash flows provided by financing activities increased million from to  primarily due to the issuance of million of notes payable during combined with an increase in total deposits 
capital resources at december   the company reported total capital of million  or of total assets as compared to million  or at december  the company and the banks continue to maintain capital ratios in excess of all applicable regulatory minimums 
the capital position of banks and bank holding companies are regulated by various federal and state agencies

therefore  the banks are entitled to pay the lowest deposit premium possible 
impact of inflation the consolidated financial statements and related consolidated financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on operations of andover is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services
