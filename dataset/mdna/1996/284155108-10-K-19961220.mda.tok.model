item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth  as a percentage of net revenues  certain consolidated statement of operations data for the periods indicated 
year ended september  net revenues gross profit income from operations income before income taxes net income net revenues 
the company s net revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and increased an additional to million in fiscal contract revenues declined by  and  in fiscal and respectively 
net product revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and increased an additional to million in fiscal the increase in net product revenues in each period was primarily a result of increases in commercial product revenues 
commercial product revenues  driven by increased unit sales  increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and increased an additional to million in fiscal the increases in unit volumes in each period were attributable to stronger demand for the company s products in the video multimedia  instrumentation and communications markets  offset in part by a decline in demand for the company s disk drive controller products in the data processing market 
disk drive product demand continued to decline in while unit sales of power control parts to the data processing market tripled 
the company s average selling prices decreased slightly in fiscal and remained flat from to however  the company expects the average selling prices of its commercial products to decrease over time 
the company s military product revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and decreased to million in fiscal the growth in military product revenues between and was a result of increases in average selling prices  partially offset by reductions in unit volumes 
in  the decrease in military product revenues was a result of a unit volume decrease which was partially offset by an increase in average selling prices 
the company continues to focus on its four target markets in the commercial product sector and is not currently designing new products for the military 
accordingly  the company expects military product revenues to decrease in the future 
export sales were  and of net revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in export sales was primarily the result of the development of japanese and taiwanese markets for the company s products 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
gross margin 
the company s gross margin increased from in fiscal to in fiscal and then decreased slightly to in fiscal the increase in gross margin from fiscal to fiscal resulted from reductions in manufacturing variances and in unit manufacturing costs associated with process improvements and higher utilization of manufacturing capacity due to increased levels of shipments  offset in part by decreases in average selling prices for commercial products as well as certain manufacturing difficulties associated with third party foundry services and the transition to new test and fabrication equipment 
the decrease in gross margin from fiscal to resulted from continued reductions in average selling prices and increases in unfavorable manufacturing yield variances associated with third party foundry services 
while the company is working on programs to reduce these manufacturing variances  there can be no assurance that the company will not encounter similar difficulties in the future  and gross margin may continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and increased an additional to million in fiscal the increases in research and development are primarily the result of costs associated with additional employees and consultants and  to a lesser extent  increased expenditures for mask sets  silicon and other materials 
during these periods  the company s research and development activities focused on incorporating cmos process technology into the company s commercial product line  which resulted in the introduction of a number of new cmos products 
the company also introduced new bipolar products from fiscal through fiscal at a rate exceeding the pre levels 
the company expects to incur higher absolute research and development expenses in the future  although these expenses are expected to remain relatively constant as a percentage of net revenues 
there can be no assurance  however  that net revenues will grow at the same rate as the anticipated research and development expenses 
marketing  sales  general and administrative expenses 
marketing  sales  general and administrative expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and increased an additional to million in fiscal for  selling and administrative expenses included added compensation expenses for additional personnel  increased sales commissions due to increased sales  increases in the level of advertising expenses  and  higher absolute marketing  sales  general and administrative expenses due to reporting and other requirements of a public company 
in  selling and administrative expenses included added compensation expenses for additional personnel  increased sales commissions due to increased sales and increases in the level of advertising expenses 
interest and other income expense  net 
interest and other income expense  net was  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal interest and other income expense  net in fiscal included a charge of  resulting from a proposed initial public offering that was not completed 
the increase in interest expense in fiscal reflects increased borrowings under the company s working capital lines of credit 
the increase of interest income in resulted from investing proceeds from the company s initial public offering in october of in cash equivalents and short term investments 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
provision for taxes on income 
provisions for taxes on income for fiscal  and were lower than the statutory rate principally due to the benefit of net operating loss carryforwards offset by alternative minimum taxes  state taxes and foreign withholding taxes 
at september   the company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  that expire in the years through in addition  the company had federal general business credit carryforwards of approximately  that expire in the years through and foreign tax credit carryforwards of  that expire in through under certain provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  the availability of the company s net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to limitation if it should be determined that there has been a change in ownership of more than of the value of the company s stock

factors affecting future results this annual report on form k contains historical information as well as forward looking statements 
forward looking statements concern matters that involve risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to those set forth below  that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
in any event  the matters set forth below should be carefully considered when evaluating the company s business and prospects 
elantec s operating results have been  and in the future may be  subject to fluctuations due to a wide variety of factors including the timing of or delays in new product and process technology announcements and product introductions by the company or its competitors  competitive pricing pressures  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  changes in the mix of product sold  availability and costs of raw materials  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  industry wide wafer processing capacity  economic conditions in various geographic areas  and costs associated with other events  such as underutilization or expansion of production capacity  intellectual property disputes  environmental regulation  or other litigation 
further  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or potential competitors or that the companies operating results will not be adversely affected by increased price competition 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has been subject to significant economic fluctuations at various times that have been characterized by rapidly fluctuating product demand  periods of over and under capacity  and accelerated erosion of average selling prices 
a material change in industry wide production capacity  shift in industry capacity toward products competitive with the company s products  rapidly fluctuating demand  or other factors could result in a rapid decline in product pricing or unit volumes which could adversely affect the company s operating results 
to address future capacity requirements  the company plans to complete an extensive production expansion at its primary manufacturing facility in milpitas  california 
this expansion program faces a number of substantial risks including  but not limited to  delays in construction  cost overruns  equipment delays or shortages  manufacturing start up or process problems  or difficulties in hiring key managers and technical personnel 
from time to time  the company has experienced production difficulties that have caused delivery delays and quality problems 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience manufacturing problems and product delivery delays in the future as a result of  among other things  changes to its process technologies  ramping production  installing new equipment at its facilities and constructing new facilities in california 
further  the company s has a single wafer fabrication facility 
if the company were unable to use this facility  as a result of a natural disaster or otherwise  the company s operations would be materially adversely affected 
the company s manufacturing expansion will result in a significant increase in fixed and operating expenses 
as commercial production at the new fabrication facility commences  the operating costs will be classified as cost of revenues  and the company will begin to recognize depreciation expense relating to the facility 
accordingly  although the company expects the milpitas fabrication facility to contribute to revenues in fiscal  the company will recognize substantial operating expenses associated with the facility in  which could reduce gross margins 
specifically  as commercial production begins in fiscal  the company anticipates incurring substantial operating costs and depreciation expense relating to the facility before production of substantial volume is achieved 
accordingly  if revenue levels do not increase sufficiently to offset these additional expense levels  or if the company is unable to achieve gross comparable to the company s current products  the company s future results of operations could be adversely impacted 
new products  process technology and start up costs associated with the milpitas wafer fabrication facility will require significant research and development expenditures 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner  that new products will gain market acceptance or that new process technologies can be successfully implemented 
if the company is unable to develop new products in a timely manner  and to sell them at gross margins comparable to the company s current products  the future results of operations could be adversely impacted 
the company s manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining adequate raw materials on a timely basis 
the number of vendors of certain raw materials  such as silicon wafers  ultra pure metals and certain chemicals and gases  is very limited 
in addition  certain materials used by the company require long lead times and are available from only a few suppliers 
for example  the company uses four inch silicon wafers in its wafer fabrication processes 
from time to time  vendors have extended lead times or limited supply of four inch wafers to the company 
the company s results of operations would be adversely affected if it were unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner or if there were significant increases in the costs of raw materials 
part of the company s future bipolar product development strategy includes the development of an alternative form of silicon on insulator soi technology called bonded wafers 
the company believes that  if successful  the bonded wafer technology could provide technologically advanced products at a lower cost than the current dielectric isolation complementary bipolar technology 
however  there can be no assurance that the development of the bonded wafer technology can be successfully accomplished in a timely manner or that it will proved the desired improvements over the company s current technology 
significant delays in the development of the bonded wafer technology or manufacturing problems associated with transferring the company s current product line to this technology would have a material adverse affect on the company s business and results of operations 
in addition  delays in the development of this technology would adversely affect the company s new product development program 
the semiconductor industry is extremely capital intensive 
to remain competitive  the company must continue to invest in advanced manufacturing and test equipment 
in fiscal  the company expects to expend approximately million in capital expenditures and anticipates significant continuing capital expenditures in the next several years 
there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to seek financing to satisfy its cash and capital needs or that such financing will be available on terms satisfactory to the company 
if such financing is required and if such financing is not available on terms satisfactory to the company  its operations would be materially adversely affected 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions  which have resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation 
in recent years  there has been a growing trend of companies to resort to litigation to protect their semiconductor technology from unauthorized use by others 
the company believes its products do not infringe upon any valid patents 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s position in these matters will prevail 
there can be no assurance that additional future claims alleging infringement of intellectual property rights will not be asserted against the company 
the intellectual property claims that have been made  or may be asserted against the company in the future  could require that the company discontinue the use of certain processes or cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products 
additionally  the company may incur significant litigation costs and damages to develop noninfringing technology 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to obtain such licenses on acceptable terms or to develop noninfringing technology without a material adverse effect on the company 
the company is subject to a variety of regulations related to hazardous materials used in its manufacturing process 
any failure by the company to control the use of  or to restrict adequately the discharge of  hazardous materials under present or future regulations could subject it to substantial liability or could cause its manufacturing operations to be suspended 
the company s common stock has experienced substantial price volatility and such volatility may occur in the future  particularly as a result of quarter to quarter variations in the actual or anticipated financial results of the company  the companies in the semiconductor industry or in the markets served by the company  or announcements by the company or its competitors regarding new product introductions 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies stock in particular 
these factors may adversely affect the price of the common stock 
liquidity and capital resources from fiscal through fiscal  the company financed its operations primarily from cash provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal resulted primarily from proceeds received from the aisin agreement  depreciation and net income  offset in part by an increase in inventories 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal resulted primarily from net income of million and depreciation of million  offset in part by increased working capital  principally from increased accounts receivable and inventories 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal resulted primarily from net income of million and depreciation of million  offset in part by increased working capital  again principally from increased accounts receivable and inventories 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the company s investing activities in fiscal and were principally the purchase of property and equipment 
in addition to property and equipment purchases  million net cash was invested in available for sale investments 
cash purchases of property and equipment totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal at september   there were outstanding commitments for capital expenditures of approximately million 
the company plans to spend million on capital expenditures during fiscal  primarily on expanding manufacturing capabilities in milpitas  california 
net cash used in financing activities was  in fiscal and  in fiscal financing activities in fiscal and were primarily repayments on capital lease obligations and long term debt 
net cash provided by financing activities in was million primarily due to proceeds of the company s initial public offering in october of which were offset by repayments on capital lease obligations and long term debt 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in fiscal in october  the company raised net proceeds of approximately million by issuing common stock in its initial public offering 
this financing activity was partially offset by payments on long term debt during of million  primarily on long term notes and capital leases 
at september   the company had working capital of million and cash and cash equivalents of million 
at september  the company had a nonrevolving lease line of credit for up to million  which can be utilized for up to of the value of the equipment financed 
amounts drawn under this line are periodically converted into three year notes 
the nonrevolving lease line of credit expires in december the company expects to secure a new lease line of credit upon expiration of the existing line 
at september    was outstanding  and approximately million remained available under the line 
amounts drawn under this line as well as under the notes are payable at interest rates ranging from prime plus to prime plus to at september  
the company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents  its current line of credit and cash from operations will be sufficient to support its operating and capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
any major change in the nature of the company s business  such as the acquisition of products  the design of products not currently under development or the need for significant new capital expenditures  could change the company s capital requirements 
to the extent the company requires additional cash  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such financing on terms favorable to the company  or at all
