item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction and background the company s sales and net income have increased significantly in the past several years primarily as a result of its acquisitions 
following each acquisition  the company implemented programs to take advantage of distribution and operating synergies among its businesses 
this implementation is reflected in an increase in the company s sales and in the decline in selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of the company s sales 
from mid through the end of  sales of most of the company s products were adversely affected by the worldwide slowdown in the electronic components industry  which reflected general recessionary trends in all major industrialized countries 
in addition  sales to defense related industries declined from the end of the first quarter of until the second half of despite this slowdown  vishay realized record net earnings in each year throughout this period 
this was a result of its acquisitions and focus on the bottom line  including the implementation of operating efficiencies 
in  the company s growth was fueled not only by its acquisition of vitramon  but also by the dramatic expansion in the electronic components industry 
this resulted in vishay s record net earnings of million in since early  demand for most passive electronic components has been extremely strong and  in the case of certain products such as tantalum capacitors  has exceeded available supply  resulting in increased backlogs and favorable pricing 
during the last quarter of and into the first quarter of the company has experienced an overall softening in demand for its products  resulting in a decrease in backlogs 
the company believes this may be primarily a result of the unusually large build up of vishay components in its customers inventories during the first half of the company believes it is too early to discern whether this slowdown is indicative of a longer term trend  the company  however  will continue to closely monitor its orders and backlog 
the company s strategy includes transferring some of its manufacturing operations from countries with high labor costs and tax rates such as the united states  france and germany to israel  mexico  portugal and the czech republic in order to benefit from lower labor costs and  in the case of israel  to take advantage of various government incentives  including government grants and tax incentives 
management believes that the company is well positioned to reduce its costs in the event of a decline in demand by accelerating the transfer of production to countries with lower labor costs and more favorable tax environments 
the company realizes of its revenues outside the united states 
as a result  fluctuations in currency exchange rates can significantly affect the company s reported sales and to a lesser extent earnings 
currency fluctuations impact the company s net sales and other income statement amounts  as denominated in us dollars  including other income as it relates to foreign exchange gains or losses 
generally  in order to minimize the effect of currency fluctuations on profits  the company endeavors to i borrow money in the local currencies and markets where it conducts business  and ii minimize the time for settling intercompany transactions 
the company does not purchase foreign currency exchange contracts or other derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency exposures 
as a result of the increased production by the company s operations in israel over the past several years  the low tax rates in israel as compared to the statutory rates in the united states have had the effect of increasing the company s net earnings 
the more favorable israeli tax rates are applied to specific approved projects and normally continue to be available for a period of ten years or  if the investment in the project is over million  for a period of years  which has been the case for most of the company s projects in israel since new projects are continually being introduced 
in addition  the israeli government offers certain incentive programs in the form of grants designed to increase employment in israel 
future grants and other incentive programs offered to the company by the israeli government will likely depend on the company s continuing to increase capital investment and the number of the company s employees in israel
