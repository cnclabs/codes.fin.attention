item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  included elsewhere in this form k 
overview the company purchases and processes rough rice into branded and commodity rice for sale in both international and domestic markets 
demand for branded rice products  which have accounted for approximately of the company s net sales over the last two fiscal years  is relatively constant and margins are typically higher than those for commodity rice products 
demand for commodity rice products is relatively constant globally  but demand for us grown commodity rice is dependent upon supply and its cost relative to other sources of supply 
supply and costs for both branded and commodity products depend on many factors including governmental actions  crop yields and weather  and such factors can persist through one or more fiscal years 
an example of this occurred in late when rough rice prices approximately doubled as a result of shortages caused by poor weather conditions in japan and the entry of japan into the world market as a net importer of rice 
following this significant price increase  prices then fell from january to july by approximately to september levels as supplies of rice in that country improved and world markets stabilized 
the company generally benefited from the price variability experienced in the to period because the company was able to increase sales prices in some markets  the company was able to sell rice inventories acquired at lower prices at increased sales prices  and the company participated in the japanese business through its california facilities 
in general  management believes that it is insulated from many of the effects of rough rice price fluctuations for the following reasons i the company s net sales are proportionately weighted toward the relatively higher margin branded products  ii approximately one half of the company s rough rice purchases  excluding rough page rice milled under contract for others  are made as spot market purchases and matched against commodity orders at prices providing a favorable margin to costs  iii the company s high rice inventory turnover rate of approximately five times per year reduces the company s exposure to seasonal price fluctuations  and iv the company s diversity of rice sources and rice customers increases the ability of the company to take advantage of supply and demand imbalances 
acquisition accounting comet acquired a voting interest in ari on april  and an additional voting interest as a result of the acquisition on may   which was accounted for as a purchase by comet of ari

accordingly  the carrying value of the property was reduced to its approximate net realizable value after accrual of certain costs by a non recurring charge of million in the three months ended december  the transaction is expected to be consummated in calendar management believes it is in the best interest of ari to proceed with disposition of the property in an expeditious manner due to the improvement in liquidity it will provide and to the note indenture requirement for sale of the property within eighteen months of the date of issuance of the notes to avoid certain penalties 
management expects to invest the sales proceeds in other projects

the company s net sales increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal export sales increased by million while domestic sales increased by million 
export sales improved primarily due to higher volume which increased by approximately eight million equivalent rough rice hundredweight 
approximately of this increase resulted from sales to the caribbean  mexico and south america with the remaining improvements coming from the asian and european markets 
domestic sales benefited from higher average sales prices which increased primarily due to higher value added retail sales from ari s existing customer base 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to higher sales volume  partially offset by lower gross profit per hundredweight sold 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal as a result of reduced prices when japanese demand abated while the average cost of rough rice milled for markets in the united states  the caribbean  mexico and south america increased

page liquidity and capital resources ari requires liquidity and capital primarily for the purchase of rough rice and to invest in property  plant and equipment necessary to support operations 
historically  ari has financed both working capital and capital expenditures through internally generated funds and by funds provided by credit lines 
inventories increased due to a variety of factors which included generally higher price levels and higher inventories in vietnam and for saudi arabia business 
historically  the rice ari sold in saudi arabia was processed and packed in the united states and shipped to saudi arabia 
in october  ari entered into an agreement with ajwa rmti  an operator of a receiving  processing  storage and bagging facility in jeddah  saudi arabia  to receive bulk rice from ari and pack rice on a exclusive basis 
by shipping rice in bulk to ajwa rmti  ari reduces vessel loading and freight costs 
shipments to ajwa rmti under this agreement began in june  and shipments to saudi merchants from the ajwa rmti facility began in october the carrying value of the houston properties was reduced to million as a result of an agreement to sell the property two miles west of downtown houston 
the sale is expected to be consummated in calendar the receivable from erly increased primarily due to a million loan from the proceeds of the mortgage notes and its associated interest income 
in a public offering completed in august  ari issued million in principal amount of mortgage notes due the notes 
portions of the net proceeds of million were used to repay million of existing term debt  to make a million loan to erly due  and to reduce borrowings outstanding under the million revolving credit loan 
the notes provide for interest payments semiannually  accruing fixed interest at an annual rate of  an effective yield rate of in addition to fixed interest  the notes bear contingent interest of of consolidated cash flow as defined up to a limit of million of consolidated cash flow during the fiscal year in which such interest accrues 
contingent interest accrues in each semiannual period as defined in which consolidated cash flow in such period and the immediately preceding semiannual period is equal to or greater than million 
contingent interest is payable semiannually  but ari may elect to defer all or a portion of any such payment to the extent that a the payment of such portion of contingent interest will cause ari s adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio as defined for the two consecutive applicable semiannual periods to be less than and b the principal of the notes corresponding to such contingent interest has not then matured and become due and payable 
consolidated cash flow as defined for the year ended march  was as follows page consolidated cash flow in thousands three months ended june   september   december   march   year ended march   contingent interest of thousand and zero for the semiannual periods as defined ended june  and december   respectively were accrued during fiscal as the applicable fixed charge coverage ratio was less than  ari has elected to defer payment of the thousand contingent interest liability 
other assets increased primarily as a result of capitalized issuance costs for the notes that will be amortized over the life of the notes through the revolving credit loan  which was amended effective june   bore interest at the prime rate of interest plus 
this facility was replaced on june  by a new revolving credit loan discussed below 
funds available for borrowing under this revolving credit loan at any time could not exceed of eligible accounts receivable or of accounts receivable backed by acceptable letters of credit from customers and of eligible inventory 
the revolving credit loan was primarily collateralized by a first priority security interest in trade receivables  inventory  and certain key man life insurance 
at march   the outstanding balance on this loan was million and on april  the borrowing base under the loan was million 
during the year ended march   ari s maximum borrowing under the loan was million 
on june  ari replaced its existing million revolving credit loan with a revolving credit loan from a new lender  harris trust and savings bank harris 
funds available for borrowing under this revolving credit loan at any time may not exceed of eligible accounts receivable or of accounts receivable backed by acceptable letters of credit from customers  of eligible rough rice inventory  and of eligible finished goods inventory 
the line is collateralized by substantially all of ari s accounts receivable and inventory 
in addition  this facility contains restrictive covenants which  among other things  require the attainment of certain financial ratios and provide limitations on capital expenditures  lease obligations  and prohibit dividend payments 
the line also contains certain cross default provisions with the indenture as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the harris revolving credit line bears interest at ari s option at either the prime rate or the london interbank offered rate plus an applicable margin based upon ari s adjusted funded debt page ratio as defined  with outstanding principal and interest due upon termination of the agreement  which continues in full force and effect until may  or until earlier terminated by ari upon five days prior written notice subsequent to may  the company intends to satisfy its obligations under the notes as well as future capital expenditure and working capital requirements primarily with cash flow from operations and from funds available under existing and new revolving lines of credit 
management believes that cash flow from operations and the line of credit will provide sufficient liquidity to enable it to meet its currently foreseeable working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
ari anticipates funding the acquisition of the olive business and meeting its additional working capital requirements primarily through expanding the existing revolving credit facility 
capital expenditures  limited by the note indenture to million per fiscal year with carryover provisions as defined therein if the consolidated cash flow as defined therein does not exceed million per year  were million and million for the years ended march  and  respectively 
management anticipates the million limitation will allow for maintenance of existing facilities and will also support limited growth 
ari s preferred b and c stock carries annual cumulative  non participating dividends of million and thousand respectively 
no dividends have been declared or paid as of march  as of march   the preferred b dividends accumulated but not declared are million and the preferred c dividends accumulated but not declared are million
