item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations competition the electric utility industry has begun a major transition that could lead to expanded market competition and less regulatory protection 
future deregulation of electric wholesale and retail markets will create opportunities to compete for new and existing customers and markets 
as a result  profit margins and asset values of some utilities could be adversely affected 
the pace of deregulation  future prices of electricity  and the regulatory actions which may be taken by the psc in response to the changing environment cannot be predicted 
however  the company is aggressively pursuing actions to position itself strategically for the transformed environment 
to enhance its flexibility and responsiveness to change  the company s electric and gas utility  sce g  operates strategic business units 
maintaining a competitive cost structure is of paramount importance in the utility s strategic plan 
sce g has undertaken a variety of initiatives  including reductions in operation and maintenance costs and in staffing levels 
in january the psc approved as discussed under liquidity and capital resources the accelerated recovery of sce g s electric regulatory assets and the shift of depreciation reserves from transmission and distribution assets to nuclear production assets 
sce g believes that these actions as well as numerous others that have been and will be taken demonstrate its ability and commitment to succeed in the new operating environment to come 
regulated public utilities are allowed to record as assets some costs that would be expensed by other enterprises 
if deregulation or other changes in the regulatory environment occur  the company may no longer be eligible to apply this accounting treatment and may be required to eliminate such regulatory assets from its balance sheet 
such an event could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations in the period the write off is recorded 
the company reported approximately million and million of regulatory assets and liabilities  respectively  excluding amounts related to net accumulated deferred income tax assets of approximately million  on its balance sheet at december  liquidity and capital resources the cash requirements of the company arise primarily from sce g s operational needs  the company s construction program and the need to fund the activities or investments of the company s nonregulated subsidiaries 
the ability of the company s regulated subsidiaries to replace existing plant investment  as well as to expand to meet future demand for electricity and gas  will depend upon their ability to attract the necessary financial capital on reasonable terms 
the company s regulated subsidiaries recover the costs of providing services through rates charged to customers 
rates for regulated services are generally based on historical costs 
as customer growth and inflation occur and the regulated subsidiaries expand their construction programs  it is necessary to seek increases in rates 
as a result  the company s future financial position and results of operations will be affected by the regulated subsidiaries ability to obtain adequate and timely rate and other regulatory relief 
due to continuing customer growth  sce g entered into a contract with duke fluor daniel in to design  engineer and build a mw coal fired electric generating plant near cope  south carolina 
construction of the plant started in november commercial operation began in january the estimated cost of the cope plant  excluding afc  is million 
in addition  the transmission lines for interconnection with sce g s system cost million 
on july   sce g filed an application with the psc for an increase in retail electric rates 
on january  the psc issued an order granting sce g an increase of which will produce additional revenues of approximately million annually 
the increase will be implemented in two phases 
the first phase  an increase in revenues of approximately million annually based on a test year  or  commenced on january  the second phase will be implemented in january and will produce additional revenues of approximately million annually  or 
more than current rates 
the psc authorized a return on common equity of 
the psc also approved establishment of a storm damage reserve account capped at million and collected through rates over a ten year period 
additionally  the psc approved accelerated recovery of substantially all of sce g s electric regulatory assets excluding accumulated deferred income taxes and the remaining transition obligation for postretirement benefits other than pensions  changing the amortization periods to allow recovery by the end of the year sce g s request to shift approximately million of depreciation reserves from transmission and distribution assets to nuclear production assets was also approved

environmental matters the clean air act requires electric utilities to reduce substantially emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide by the year these requirements are being phased in over two periods 
the first phase had a compliance date of january  and the second  january  the company s facilities did not require modifications to meet the requirements of phase i 
the company will most likely meet the phase ii requirements through the burning of natural gas and or lower sulfur coal in its generating units and the purchase and use of sulfur dioxide emission allowances 
low nitrogen oxide burners are being installed to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions to the levels required by phase ii 
air toxicity regulations for the electric generating industry are likely to be promulgated around the year by december  the company had filed compliance plans related to phase ii requirements with dhec 
the company currently estimates that air emissions control equipment will require capital expenditures of million over the period to retrofit existing facilities  with increased operation and maintenance costs of approximately million per year 
to meet compliance requirements through the year  the company anticipates total capital expenditures of approximately million 
the federal clean water act  as amended  provides for the imposition of effluent limitations that require various levels of treatment for each wastewater discharge 
under this act  compliance with applicable limitations is achieved under a national permit program 
discharge permits have been issued for all and renewed for nearly all of sce g s and genco s generating units 
concurrent with renewal of these permits  the permitting agency has implemented more rigorous control programs 
the company has been developing compliance plans for this program 
amendments to the clean water act proposed in congress include several provisions which  if passed  could prove costly to sce g 
these include limitations to mixing zones and the implementation of technology based standards 
the south carolina solid waste policy and management act of directed dhec to promulgate regulations for the disposal of industrial solid waste 
dhec has promulgated a proposed regulation  which if adopted as a final regulation in its present form  would significantly increase sce g s and genco s costs of construction and operation of existing and future ash management facilities 
the company has an environmental assessment program to identify and assess current and former operations sites that could require environmental cleanup 
as site assessments are initiated  estimates are made of the cost  if any  to investigate and clean up each site 
these estimates are refined as additional information becomes available  therefore  actual expenditures could differ significantly from original estimates 
amounts estimated and accrued to date for site assessments and cleanup relate primarily to regulated operations  such amounts are deferred and are being amortized and recovered through rates over a ten year period for electric operations and an eight year period for gas operations 
deferred amounts totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
estimates include  among other items  the costs associated with the matters discussed in the following paragraphs 
sce g owns four decommissioned manufactured gas plant sites which contain residues of by product chemicals 
sce g maintains an active review of the sites to monitor the nature and extent of the residual contamination 
in september the epa notified sce g  the city of charleston and the charleston housing authority of their potential liability for the investigation and cleanup of the calhoun park area site in charleston  south carolina 
this site originally encompassed approximately eighteen acres and included properties which were the locations for industrial operations  including a wood preserving creosote plant and one of sce g s decommissioned manufactured gas plants 
the original scope of this investigation has been expanded to approximately acres  including adjacent properties owned by the national park service and the city of charleston  and private properties 
the site has not been placed on the national priority list  but may be added before cleanup is initiated 
the prps have agreed with the epa to participate in an innovative approach to site investigation and cleanup called superfund accelerated cleanup model  allowing the pre cleanup site investigation process to be compressed significantly 
the prps have negotiated an administrative order by consent for the conduct of a remedial investigation feasibility study and a corresponding scope of work 
field work began in november sce g is also working with the city of charleston to investigate potential contamination from the manufactured gas plant which may have migrated to the city s aquarium site 
in the city of charleston notified sce g that it considers sce g to be responsible for a million increase in costs of the aquarium project attributable to delays resulting from contamination of the calhoun park area site 
sce g believes it has meritorious defenses against this claim and does not expect its resolution to have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
regulatory matters sce g filed for electric rate relief in to encompass primarily the remaining costs of completing the cope generating station 
as discussed under liquidity and capital resources  the psc issued an order on january  increasing electric retail rates
