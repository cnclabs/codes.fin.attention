php s government service contracts required the company to manage health care providers in a variety of delivery settings 
in  management realized that the knowledge  expertise and skills which the company had acquired in managing health care providers for government agencies could also be applied to serve the commercial managed care market 
at the same time  management supplemented the company s existing competencies with additional skills and capabilities in order to take full advantage of the opportunities available in commercial managed care 
the company added to existing capabilities by making several key acquisitions  investing in information systems and recruiting experienced managed care executives 
with this added expertise  php has expanded its commercial business so that  in fiscal and  its commercial business accounted for approximately of php s total revenues

the company s revenues have increased from million in to million in gross profit margins increased to and in and  respectively  after having decreased to and in and  respectively 
the company earned net income of million and  in and  respectively  after net losses of million and million in and  respectively

this slight decrease is the net result of an increase in the commercial managed health care service division and a decrease in the government managed health care service division 
the fiscal commercial managed health care service division revenues included million of non recurring construction and pre operational revenue on the bcbsnj isoc project 
exclusive of the non recurring construction and pre operational revenue earned on the bcbsnj isoc project in fiscal year  commercial managed health care service division revenue increased by million or to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this net increase is the result of several increases and decreases 
the largest increase in commercial managed health care service division revenue was due to an increase in operational revenue on the bcbsnj isoc project which commenced operations in january and was therefore operating throughout fiscal but only four months during fiscal the second largest increase in commercial managed health care service division revenue was provided by the chp  the company s medicaid hmo in the district of columbia  and resulted from an expanded enrollment and a new contract at a higher premium rate 
additional revenue increases resulted from revenue earned during the current period for isoc development efforts related to strategic ventures in connecticut  georgia  and other markets  revenue resulting from the commencement of operations in november at the company s subsidiary  virginia chartered health plan  inc vachp  a medicaid hmo operating in selected markets in the commonwealth of virginia  increased utilization at two existing isoc projects for large employers  increased software sales at the company s wholly owned subsidiary  health cost consultants hcc  a case management and utilization review services company  and the commencement of operations at a new isoc project for a large employer in january in addition to the commercial managed health care service division revenue decrease related to the construction and pre operational phases of the bcbsnj isoc project  other revenue decreases resulted from the sale of two outpatient surgery centers in september  and the non recurrence of construction and pre operational revenues earned in the prior year related to an isoc project for a large employer which became operational in january government managed health care service division revenue decreased by million to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this decrease is primarily related to the completion of seven ambulatory care projects  two mental health projects  and four medical staffing projects 
offsetting these revenue decreases were revenue increases resulting from the commencement of operations on two new long term care nursing home projects in june  the commencement of operations on a new ambulatory care project in october  the commencement of operations on a new medical staffing project in january  an expanded inmate population and an increase in the contract rate on a total managed care correctional facilities project  an increased contract rate on a long term care nursing home project  and the expansion of services and a corresponding increase in contract rate on one primus project 
the company s gross profit increased by or million to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  gross profit increased to in fiscal compared to in the prior fiscal year 
this overall gross profit improvement resulted from a significant increase in the commercial managed health care service division as well as an increase in the government managed health care service division 
the commercial managed health care service division gross profit increase was primarily attributable to an expanded enrollment and a new contract at a higher premium rate at the company s medicaid hmo in the district of columbia 
a gross profit increase also resulted from the commencement of activity on the operating portion of the bcbsnj isoc project in january  and the commencement of operations in december at the company s medicaid hmo in the commonwealth of virginia 
these commercial managed health care service division gross profit increases were tempered by a decrease resulting from the sale of the remaining two outpatient surgery centers in september the government managed health care service division gross profit increase was due to an increased contract rate at a long term care nursing home project  increased utilization  improved cost control  and higher award fee revenue at three ambulatory care projects with the navy  an expansion of services and a corresponding increase in the contract rate on one primus project  and an expanded inmate population and an increased contract rate on a total managed care correctional facilities project 
government managed health care service division gross profits decreased due to the completion of certain projects as cited above for causing revenues to decrease  and due to a decrease in utilization and the contract rate at one navcare project which was completed in september general and administrative expenses increased or million to million in fiscal from million in the prior year 
as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal compared to during the prior year 
the increase is primarily a function of the company s commercial managed health care initiatives and is due to increased general and administrative expenses associated with chp and its growing enrollment  additional general and administrative expenses associated with the new vachp subsidiary  increased corporate compensation costs related to the hiring and retention of existing and additional management personnel and support staff  and increased facility expenses resulting from the company s new expanded corporate headquarters office space 
operating income increased more than fivefold from million in fiscal to million for the current year 
operating margin increased to from 
this increase was due to the increased gross profit margins  reduced by increased general and administrative expenses 
interest expense increased  or  to  for fiscal from  in fiscal this increase is primarily a result of the interest on the million in convertible subordinated debentures sold by the company on december  partially offsetting this increase is a decrease in interest expense resulting from a decrease in the average outstanding long term debt of the company resulting from the sale of the reston office building in july  and the sale of the remaining two outpatient surgery centers in september interest income increased by  from  in fiscal to  in the current year 
this increase is due to the interest earned on the approximately million in cash and cash equivalents currently available to the company resulting from the sale of million in convertible subordinated debentures in december in fiscal the company recognized a gain of million related to the sale of a interest in its vachp subsidiary for million in cash 
the effective income tax rates of and for fiscal years and  respectively  represent the combined federal and state income tax rates adjusted as necessary 
the gain resulting from the sale of a interest in vachp to university health services  inc  is a non taxable transaction and therefore no provision for income taxes was included in the company s results of operations for fiscal exclusive of this gain  the combined effective income tax rate for the year would have been 
net earnings increased by million  from  to million  for fiscal years and  respectively  resulting in primary earnings per share of 
in 
fully diluted  compared with primary and fully diluted earnings per share of in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the company s revenues increased by or million  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this growth was almost entirely due to the commercial managed health care services division 
commercial managed health care services division revenue more than doubled from million for the year ended april  to million for the year ended april   an increase of million 
this substantial increase in revenue occurred through an acquisition and the commencement of new projects 
the bcbsnj project generated of the division s revenue growth 
during  the company completed the pre operational and construction phases of the bcbsnj contract and in january and february commenced operation of nine community based health care centers and related isoc services 
the company expects that the bcbsnj fiscal revenues will be less than the amounts recognized in fiscal due to million of non recurring construction and pre operational revenues in chp provided of the revenue growth in the commercial managed health care services division 
this growth was primarily due to twelve months of operations in fiscal versus only eight months of operations in fiscal  beginning with its acquisition in august chp s revenue also increased due to a favorable new contract with the district of columbia which commenced in october and an expansion of membership enrollment 
additional revenue increases resulted from expanded utilization at existing primary care projects and the commencement of operations at a new project for northwestern steel and wire 
offsetting these revenue increases was a decrease in revenue  resulting from the sale of three outpatient surgery centers in april and the remaining two outpatient surgery centers in september government managed health care services division revenue decreased marginally by from million in to million in this flat level of revenue was attributable to offsetting increases and decreases 
revenue increases were due to an expanded inmate population and increased contract rate with the arkansas department of corrections  a non recurring write off of million in fiscal resulting from actual costs being greater than expected  and a contractual expansion of services at an existing primus project 
revenue decreases resulted from the completion of several contracts including a large medical staffing contract completed in july  three on site ambulatory contracts completed throughout fiscal  and a large mental health project completed in march other revenue consisted of the operations of the reston  virginia office building which was acquired in may and sold in july operational revenues associated with this building decreased from million to  in and  respectively 
the company s gross profit increased by million  almost tripling from million in to million in this increase was due to significant improvement in both the government and commercial managed health care services divisions 
the commercial managed health care services division gross profit increase was almost entirely attributable to chp 
chp s gross profit improvement resulted from a favorable new contract with the district of columbia which commenced in october and an expansion in enrollment 
a decrease in gross profit resulted from the sale of three outpatient surgery centers in april and the remaining two centers in september the government managed health care services division gross profit increased in for two reasons 
first  the company incurred two large write offs in fiscal that were non recurring 
one write off of million related to a primus contract with the army 
this contract was modified in fiscal and currently operates at a modest profit 
the company pursued an equitable claim adjustment with the federal government for million related to this contract 
the claim was settled for  in september the second write off of million related to two long term care nursing home contracts 
this write off was prompted by lower than anticipated margins as one of the facilities reached full utilization  an anticipated rate increase at one facility that did not materialize  and actual costs in excess of previous estimates 
the company did not experience similar write offs in fiscal the second reason for the gross profit increase in compared with is an overall decrease in costs at the company s primus navcare projects 
during  the company experienced improved cost control in part resulting from the reduction of services to more properly match the explicit contract requirements 
in addition to the increases discussed above  the government managed health care service division gross profits decreased due to the completion of a large medical staffing project in july general and administrative expenses increased or million  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this increase is predominantly a function of the company s initiatives in the commercial managed health care service division and is due to twelve months of general and administrative expenses associated with chp in fiscal  compared with only eight months in fiscal  and increased corporate salary costs related to both the hiring of additional managed health care professionals in conjunction with the company s commercial market initiatives and the expansion of support service personnel 
interest expense decreased  or million  to million in from million in this decrease is primarily a function of the decrease in the company s long term debt resulting from the sale of three outpatient surgery centers in april  the sale of the reston office building in july  and the sale of the remaining two outpatient surgery centers in september miscellaneous income and expense changed by  from an expense of  in to income of  in this increase is the net result of a few large income and expense items in fiscal included in the fiscal amount is an expense or loss amount of  related to the sublease of the company s former headquarters facility in alexandria virginia  an income amount of  related to the removal of a valuation allowance which had been established in fiscal related to receivables from officers  an income amount of  related to the removal of a valuation allowance against a note receivable from a tenant in the reston  virginia building  and a gain amount of  related to the sale of the remaining two outpatient surgery centers 
the effective income tax rates of in fiscal and in represent the combined federal and state income tax rates adjusted as necessary 
the income tax rate is less than the income tax rate primarily as a result of a valuation allowance relating to certain deferred tax assets 
the company earned net income of  in compared with a net loss of million in  resulting in primary and fully diluted earnings per share of in  compared with a primary loss per share of 
in 
fully diluted 
liquidity and capital resources typically  the company s principal sources of funds are operations and bank borrowings 
in december  however  the company issued million of convertible subordinated debentures resulting in net proceeds of million 
the company used these proceeds to extinguish all outstanding bank debt and will use the remaining amount to fund expansion of its commercial managed care services division 
during the year ended april   operations provided million in cash 
this represents an increase in cash provided by operations of million compared with the million used by operations in the prior year 
the primary cause of this increase in cash provided by operations was an increase in net earnings from million to million 
this increase in net earnings and the resultant impact on cash provided by operations was lessened by an increase in accounts receivable  particularly a million in current premium for april due from the district of columbia which was received a few days after year end on may  the company s number of days revenue in average outstanding receivables was days in and days in this increase is a result of the current premium and other amounts due from the district of columbia referred to above  and certain other business ventures the company is pursuing in its commercial managed health care service division 
investing activities used  in cash during compared to million provided during the cash used during is due to acquisitions of property and equipment reduced by proceeds from the sale of stock in a subsidiary 
during the prior year the company generated net cash from investing activities  principally through the sale of its office building in reston  virginia  and the sale of two of its outpatient surgery centers 
financing activities provided million in cash during compared to million used in financing activities during in december the company sold million of convertible subordinated debentures resulting in net proceeds of million 
with these proceeds the company completely repaid all outstanding bank debt 
during the prior year the company s use of cash as a result of financing activities was due to the repayment in full of non recourse notes and certain prepayments of term notes as a result of the sale of its office building in reston  virginia and  certain repayments of revolving promissory notes and term notes as a result of the sale of two of its outpatient surgery centers 
the company believes that the current cash and cash equivalents  anticipated cash flow generated by operations and its borrowing capabilities will be sufficient for known future capital needs of the company 
there may be  however  further expansion opportunities which require additional external financing and the company may  from time to time  consider obtaining such funds through the public and private issuance of equity or debt securities 
impact of inflation inflation is considered in all contract proposals with contract terms in excess of one year 
the consideration of inflationary factors is particularly important with respect to unit price  fixed rate labor hour  and fixed price contracts 
historically  inflation has not had a significant impact on the operations of the company 
while health care costs nationally are increasing  the company s primary exposure relating to this trend has been related to salaries of health care professionals and costs of pharmaceuticals which the company estimates and prices into all of its long term contracts 
the company believes that only one of its existing contracts could be significantly impacted by other inflationary health care trends 
the company may however become involved in future contracts where inflation and increasing health care costs may be an important factor
