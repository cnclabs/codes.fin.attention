item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s revenues are derived primarily from service charges on pawn loans and the sale of unredeemed goods  or merchandise sales 
loans are made for a day term with an automatic extension of days in texas  days in oklahoma and days in maryland 
loans made in washington  dc are made for a day term with no automatic extension 
all loans are collateralized by tangible personal property placed in the custody of the company 
the annualized service charge rates on the loans are set by state laws and range between and in texas and and in oklahoma  depending on the size of the loan 
service charge rates are to on an annualized basis in maryland  with a monthly minimum charge 
in washington  dc  loans up to bear a flat charge per month  while loans over bear a annualized rate 
in its texas stores  the company recognizes service charges at the inception of the loan at the lesser of the amount allowed by the state law for the initial day term or  in accordance with state law 
in oklahoma  maryland and washington  dc  the company recognizes service charges at the inception of the loan at the amount allowed by law for the first days 
pawn service charge income applicable to the remaining term and or extension period is not recognized until the loan is repaid or renewed 
if a loan is not repaid prior to the expiration of the automatic extension period  if applicable  the property is forfeited to the company and held for resale 
as a result of the company s policy of accruing pawn service charges only for the initial day term  unredeemed merchandise is transferred to inventory at a value equal to the loan principal plus one month s accrued interest 
the company s accounting policy defers recognition of an amount of income equal to the amount of pawn service charges relating to the extension period until the loan is repaid or renewed  or until the merchandise is resold 
as a result of this policy  the company s annualized loan yield is lower than certain of its publicly traded competitors 
conversely  this revenue recognition policy results in inventory being recorded at a lower value  which results in realization of a larger gross profit margin on merchandise sales than would be realized by certain of the company s publicly traded competitors 
this policy  in the company s opinion  lessens the risk that the inventory s cost will exceed its realizable value when sold 
however  if the pawn loan is repaid or renewed  or if the forfeited merchandise is resold  the amount of income which would be recognized by the company or certain of its publicly traded competitors would be the same over time 
although the company has had significant increases in revenues due primarily to acquisitions and secondarily to new store openings  the company has also incurred increases in operating expenses attributable to the additional stores and increases in administrative expenses attributable to building a management team and the support personnel required by the company s growth 
operating expenses consist of all items directly related to the operation of the company s stores  including salaries and related payroll costs  rent  utilities  equipment depreciation  advertising  property taxes  licenses  supplies and security 
administrative expenses consist of items relating to the operation of the corporate office  including the salaries of corporate officers  area supervisors and other management  accounting and administrative costs  liability and casualty insurance  outside legal and accounting fees and stockholder related expenses

liquidity and capital resources the company s operations and acquisitions during the past three years have been financed with funds generated from operations  bank borrowings  seller financed indebtedness and the private placement of convertible debentures in april and may of the company maintains a  long term line of credit with bank one  texas  na the credit facility 
the credit facility bears interest between the bank s prime lending rate and the bank s prime lending rate minus one half of one percent  and matures in december the credit facility allows the company to borrow funds based upon of loans and service charges receivable and of inventory of the company 
as of july    was drawn under this credit facility and an additional  was available to the company pursuant to the available borrowing base 
the credit facility requires that interest be paid monthly with the principal due upon maturity 
it is secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
under the terms of the credit facility  the company is required to maintain certain financial ratios and comply with certain technical covenants 
the company was in compliance with these requirements and covenants during fiscal and as of october  in may  the company acquired three pawnshops in baltimore  maryland in an asset purchase including fixed assets  layaways and pawn loans from an unaffiliated corporation which is wholly owned by a former employee of the company  for an aggregate purchase price of  consisting of  cash paid to the seller  and legal  consulting and other fees of  in june  the company acquired three additional pawnshops in baltimore  maryland in an asset purchase including fixed assets  layaways  pawn loans and inventory from an unaffiliated corporation for an aggregate cash purchase price of  consisting of  paid to the seller  and legal  consulting and other fees of  the company financed substantially all of the cash purchase price for both of these acquisitions through its credit facility 
the purchase price for these acquisitions was determined based upon the volume of annual loan and sales transactions  outstanding loan balances  inventory on hand  and location and condition of the facilities 
as of july   the company s primary sources of liquidity were  in cash and cash equivalents   in service charge receivables   in loans   in inventories and  of available and unused funds under the company s credit facility 
the company had working capital as of july  of  and a liabilities to equity ratio of to net cash provided by operating activities of the company during fiscal was  consisting primarily of net income before non cash depreciation and amortization of  less cash used to fund the increase of balance sheet items of  net cash used for investing activities during fiscal was  which was comprised of cash used for increasing pawn loans of  and cash paid for acquisitions and other fixed asset additions of  during fiscal net cash provided by financing activities was  during fiscal  which consisted of net increases in the company s debt of  supplemented by cash provided from the exercise of stock options and warrants of  the profitability and liquidity of the company is affected by the amount of loans outstanding  which is controlled in part by the company s loan decisions 
the company is able to influence the frequency of forfeiture of collateral by increasing or decreasing the amount loaned in relation to the resale value of the pledged property 
tighter credit decisions generally result in smaller loans in relation to the estimated resale value of the pledged property and can thereby decrease the company s aggregate loan balance and  consequently  decrease pawn service charges 
additionally  small loans in relation to the pledged property s estimated resale value tends to increase loan redemptions and improve the company s liquidity 
conversely  providing larger loans in relation to the estimated resale value of the pledged property can result in an increase in the company s pawn service charge income 
also larger average loan balances can result in an increase in loan forfeitures  which increases the quantity of goods on hand and  unless the company increases inventory turnover  reduces the company s liquidity 
in each of the company s last three fiscal years  at least of the amounts loaned were either paid in full or renewed  and it is management s current intent to maintain this ratio 
the company s renewal policy allows customers to renew pawn loans by repaying all accrued interest on such pawn loans  effectively creating a new loan transaction 
in addition to these factors  the company s liquidity is affected by merchandise sales and the pace of store expansions 
management believes that the credit facility  current assets and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to accommodate the company s current operations for fiscal the company has no significant capital commitments as of october  the company currently has no written commitments for additional borrowings or future acquisitions  however  the company intends to continue to grow and will likely seek additional capital to facilitate expansion 
the company will evaluate acquisitions  if any  based upon opportunities  acceptable financing  purchase price  strategic fit and qualified management personnel 
the company currently intends to continue to engage in a plan of expansion through existing store acquisitions and new store openings 
while the company continually looks for  and is presented with  potential acquisition candidates  the company has no definitive plans or commitments for further acquisitions 
the company has no immediate plans to open any other new stores 
if the company encounters an attractive opportunity to acquire or open a new store in the near future  the company will seek additional financing  the terms of which will be negotiated on a case by case basis 
in september and october  the company acquired four individual stores in its mid atlantic division 
these acquisitions were financed with proceeds from the company s credit facility and acquisition term notes provided by the company s primary lender 
forward looking information certain portions of this report contain forward looking statements  particularly the portion captioned liquidity and capital resources contained in item  part ii 
factors such as changes in regional or national economic or competitive conditions  changes in government regulations  changes in regulations governing pawn service charges  unforeseen litigation  changes in interest rates or tax rates  future business decisions and other uncertainties may cause results to differ materially from those anticipated by some of the statements made in this report 
such factors are difficult to predict and many are beyond the control of the company 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the amount of loans made or unredeemed goods sold by the company or its results of operation 
seasonality the company s retail business is seasonal in nature with its highest volume of sales of unredeemed goods occurring during the second fiscal quarter of each year and its lowest volume of sales of unredeemed goods occurring during the first fiscal quarter of each year 
the company s lending activities are not seasonal in nature 
new accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  effective august   the company will adopt fas establishing financial accounting and reporting standards for stock based employee compensation plans 
the pronouncement defines a fair value based method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity instrument and encourages all entities to adopt that method of accounting for all of their employee stock option compensation plans 
however  it also allows an entity to continue to measure compensation cost for those plans using the intrinsic value based method of accounting as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
entities electing to remain with the accounting in apb must make pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if the fair value based method of accounting defined in fas had been applied 
the company will account for stock based employee compensation plans under the intrinsic method pursuant to apb and will make the disclosures in the footnotes as required by fas in march  the fasb issued financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of fas  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  effective august   the company will adopt fas  which requires that long lived assets ie  property  plant and equipment and intangible assets will be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net book value of the asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss will be recognized if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and before interest from the use of the asset is less than the net book value of the asset 
generally  the amount of the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the net book value of the assets and the estimated fair value of the related assets 
the company does not expect any material impact on the company s results of operations or its financial position upon adoption of this statement in the first quarter of fiscal
