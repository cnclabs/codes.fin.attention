general the company s sales are derived from the production and sale of printed materials 
the product is sold and manufactured by each of the operating subsidiaries  and each product is customized depending on the needs of the customer 
all of the operating subsidiaries provide commercial printing services 
in addition  one of the subsidiaries also provides financial printing services 
each printing company has its own separate operations which include sales  estimating  customer service  prepress  production and postpress operations and accounting 
the company s headquarters  located in houston  provides centralized cash management  financial reporting and certain administrative services to all of the subsidiaries 
the company s financial results in a given period may be affected by the timing and magnitude of acquisitions 
in addition  gross profit margins of acquired companies typically have been lower and general and administrative expenses higher in the initial years following their acquisition 
as a result  cogi s overall gross profit margins may be lower following an acquisition while the acquired company is adapting to and implementing the company s management practices 
the company competes in the general commercial and financial printing sectors  which are characterized by individual orders from customers for specific printing projects rather than long term contracts  with continued engagement for successive jobs dependent upon the customer s satisfaction with the services provided 
as such  the company is unable to predict  for more than a few weeks in advance  the number  size and profitability of printing jobs in a given period 
consequently  the timing of projects in any quarter could have a significant impact on financial results in that quarter

impact of recently issued accounting standards in  the financial accounting standards board issued statements establishing accounting standards for the impairment of long lived assets and assets to be disposed of and stock based compensation 
statement of financial accounting standard sfas requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be realizable

as of march   the company has not adopted these statements  however  the company anticipates that application of these statements will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations
