the increase in cash of  from november  to december  was attributable to the issuance of common stock through a private placement and the exercise of options and warrants see note to the consolidated financial statements that resulted in an additional  cash 
the cash raised through the sale of common stock has been used for capital expenditures of  to increase inventory by  to reduce debt by a net amount of  to reduce trade accounts payable and accrued liabilities by  and to increase prepaid expenses and other assets by  prior to the private placement  these expenditures were funded using the company s line of credit

during the first quarter of  the company completed an evaluation of the production requirements necessary to meet all federal regulatory requirements as a fully integrated pharmaceutical manufacturer and to provide the production capacity needed to meet long term sales growth

given the current cash position  the company s short and long term liquidity will not be significantly affected 
in february  the company entered into a supply agreement with its supplier of freeze dried products 
the agreement required that the company establish a  letter of credit 
the term loan with nationsbank was used to fund this letter of credit 
the funding of the letter of credit reduces the amount that the company can borrow under the term loan but does not increase the company s debt unless the letter of credit is utilized by the supplier 
as of march   the supplier has not made a presentation for payment under the letter of credit

payments made in advance to the clinical research organization resulted in prepaid expenses increasing 
in late  the company began an initial phase i study using an injectable alovex tm formerly carn in cancer patients involving six cancer types 
the estimated cost of this study is  in the middle of  the company may begin a second large scale clinical trial for the testing of aliminase tm oral capsules for the treatment of ulcerative colitis 
the cost of this trial is expected to be approximately the same as the one that began in the third quarter of in november  the company signed a licensing agreement with a supplier of calcium alginates and other wound care products

the company does not expect that these cash resources will be sufficient to finance the major clinical studies necessary to develop its products to their full commercial potential 
additional funds  therefore  may have to be raised through equity offerings  borrowings  licensing arrangements  or other means 
ii management s discussion and analysis  continued the company is subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
certain of the company s proposed products will require governmental approval prior to commercial use 
the approval process applicable to prescription pharmaceutical products usually takes several years and typically requires substantial expenditures 
the company and any licensees may encounter significant delays or excessive costs in their respective efforts to secure necessary approvals 
future united states or foreign legislative or administrative acts could also prevent or delay regulatory approval of the company s or any licensees products 
failure to obtain requisite governmental approvals or failure to obtain approvals of the scope requested could delay or preclude the company or any licensees from marketing their products  or could limit the commercial use of the products  and thereby have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity and financial condition 
the production capacity of the costa rica plant is larger than the company s current usage level 
management believes  however  that the cost of the costa rica facility will be recovered through operations 
the upgraded facility will provide for the production of products needed for large scale clinical trials 
at march   the company had no material capital commitments other than its promissory notes  leases  agreement with suppliers and clinical trials described above

sales of these products decreased from  to  fourth quarter sales of the wound and skin care products decreased from  to  or 
the company s wound and skin care products have been marketed primarily to hospitals and select acute care providers 
this market has become increasing competitive as a result of pressures to control health care costs 
hospital and distributors have reduced their inventory levels and the number of suppliers used

overall wound care prices were lowered by an average of 
in addition to these cost pressures  over the last several years the average hospital stay has decreased over resulting in more patients being treated at alternative care facilities and at home by home health care providers 
this also had a negative impact on sales since the company s sales force had been primarily focused on the hospital market 
to counter the market changes  the sales force is now also aggressively pursuing the alternative care markets 
to continue to grow its wound care business  the company realized that it had to expand from the million hydrogel market in which it currently competes to a much larger segment of the billion dollar plus wound care market 
to achieve this objective  an aggressive program of new product development and licensing was undertaken in with the goal to create a complete line of wound care products to address all stages of wound management

this increase is attributable to the increased sales of bulk manapol r  which has a substantially lower profit margin   as compared to the company s wound and skin care products
