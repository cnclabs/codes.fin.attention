such percentage rents minimize the risk to the company of the adverse effects of inflation 
most of the leases at the shopping center properties require the tenants to pay a substantial share of operating expenses  such as real estate taxes  insurance and common area maintenance costs  and thereby reduce the company s exposure to increased costs 
in addition  many of the leases at the shopping center properties are for terms less than ten years  which may enable the company to seek increased rents upon renewal of existing leases 
the northeastern section of the united states has been experiencing an economic recession  and while the impact of this economic trend seems to be reversing  if the recession were to continue for a prolonged time  funds from operations could decline as some tenants may have trouble meeting their lease obligations
