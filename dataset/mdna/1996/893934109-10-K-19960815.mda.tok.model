item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general effective june   old transmontaigne merged with and into old sheffield 
the merger was accounted for as reverse acquisition 
after the merger  the previous holders of old transmontaigne common stock owned approximately of the outstanding new common stock  and designees of old transmontaigne accounted for a majority of the company s board of directors 
therefore  the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes principally information for old transmontaigne and  where relevant  current information relating to the company 
the company is  and old transmontaigne was  a holding company which pursues  through its subsidiaries  business opportunities in the downstream sector of the petroleum industry 
the company s principal operating subsidiary is coz  which is engaged in the transporting  storing and terminaling and the wholesale marketing of refined petroleum products primarily unleaded gasoline  no 
diesel oil and jet fuel in the mid continent region of the united states and in the gathering  storing and transporting of crude oil in east texas 
coz owns and operates miles of pipeline the norco pipeline  the razorback pipeline and the cetex pipeline and ten storage or terminal facilities in seven states 
old transmontaigne recognized a  increase in net earnings to  for the year ended april   primarily due to significantly improved pipeline  terminal and products supply and distribution net operating margins and related increases in volumes of product transported  handled and sold at its principal operating locations  while also controlling general and administrative expenses and reducing interest charges 
old transmontaigne incurred net losses from the year ended september  through the year ended april   primarily due to the under utilization of its pipelines and terminals  realization of small or negative margins from bulk product sales and wholesale marketing activities and a lack of adequate equity capital 
pipeline utilization averaged for the year ended april   for the year ended april   for the seven months ended april  and for the year ended september  terminal utilization averaged for the year ended april   for the year ended april   for the seven months ended april   and for the year ended september  the under utilization of the pipelines and terminals was primarily the result of old transmontaigne s inability to finance the inventory required to more fully utilize these facilities 
net operating margins were insufficient to cover general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization  and interest and other financing costs which were incurred to support and finance its activities 
volatile market prices of refined petroleum products during these periods also resulted in losses from inventory write downs and from the sales of products at prices lower than cost 
subsequent to april   old transmontaigne established new inventory management policies  procedures and operating controls  and also added managerial personnel to supervise the products supply and distribution operations in an effort to control inventory levels and related carrying costs  and more effectively manage inventory price risks 
the company s risk and product management committee reviews the total inventory on a weekly basis in order to ensure compliance with the company s inventory management policies  including all hedging activity 
the company has adopted policies whereby its net inventory position subject to price risk requires the prior approval of the risk and product management committee 
there can be no assurance that these actions will serve to reduce the level of inventory and successfully manage inventory price risks over the long term 
liquidity and capital resources the company is continuing old transmontaigne s practice of securing sources of long term capital prior to committing to new projects 
in april  old transmontaigne sold million of common stock to institutional and individual investors 
million of this amount was advanced to coz to reduce its bank debt 
the remaining million was invested in interest bearing instruments pending identification of further investment opportunities 
in december  old transmontaigne entered into a new bank credit agreement with a money center bank which provides for revolving credit of up to million  including cash advances and letters of credit 
the credit agreement has a final maturity date of november  and provides for interest at either the bank s base rate or a designated premium over short term eurodollar rates 
as of april   approximately million was outstanding under the credit agreement 
in april  old transmontaigne completed a private placement for million of common stock at per share to existing stockholders and institutional investors 
since april  old transmontaigne has raised million in common equity and established a new million revolving loan facility to provide working capital and to support letters of credit for coz 
at april   million million in cash and million of unused borrowing capacity of this amount was available to fund new capital expenditures and acquisitions in the downstream petroleum industry 
capital expenditures were    and  million for the years ended april  and  the seven months ended april  and the year ended september   respectively 
the company has budgeted approximately  for capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended april  actual future capital expenditures will depend on numerous factors  including the availability of appropriate acquisitions  the demand for pipeline  terminaling and storage services  local  state and federal governmental regulations  environmental compliance requirements  fuel conservation efforts  and the availability of financing on acceptable terms 
old transmontaigne had working capital of  at april  management believes the company s current working capital position  future cash provided by operating activities  borrowing capacity under its credit agreement and its relations with institutional lenders and equity investors should enable it to meet its future capital requirements  although there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain additional capital when needed on acceptable terms 
results of operations old transmontaigne s revenues were derived primarily from three activities transporting refined petroleum products and crude oil in pipelines  storing and terminaling refined petroleum products and refined petroleum products supply and distribution 
the company s revenues are also derived primarily from these activities 
pipeline revenues are based on the volume of refined petroleum products or crude oil transported and the distance from the origin point to the delivery point 
the norco and razorback pipelines transport refined petroleum products and their rates are regulated by the ferc 
the cetex pipeline transports crude oil and its rates are not regulated 
terminal revenues are based on the volume of refined petroleum products handled  generally at a standard industry fee of cent per gallon 
terminal fees are not regulated 
storage fees are generally based on a per gallon rate  which varies with the duration of the storage arrangement  the refined petroleum product stored and special handling requirements 
the operating costs of the pipeline and terminal businesses include wages and employee benefits  utilities  communications  maintenance and repairs  property taxes  rent  insurance  vehicle expenses  environmental protection costs  materials and supplies 
the products supply and distribution business includes bulk sales of refined petroleum products and the wholesale distribution of refined petroleum products from terminals 
bulk purchase and sale transactions in quantities of  barrels to  barrels are common and are generally made at very small margins 
wholesale distribution of refined petroleum products from proprietary and nonproprietary terminal truck loading rack locations are primarily represented by truck load sales of  gallons of refined petroleum product 
these sales are generally also made at small margins 
year ended april  compared to year ended april  revenue and operating information for the year ended april  and is summarized below 
products supply and pipeline terminal distribution operations operations operations total in thousands volumes    revenues     net operating margin     volumes    revenues     net operating margin    pipeline volumes are expressed in barrels gallons per barrel  and terminal and products supply and distribution sales volumes are expressed in gallons 
net operating margin represents revenues less direct operating expenses for pipeline and terminal operations  and revenues less cost of refined petroleum products purchased for products supply and distribution operations 
the net operating margin from pipeline operations increased or  to  for the year ended april  as compared to  for the year ended april  this increase primarily was due to a increase in volumes shipped and increased utilization which resulted in a increase in revenues of  during the period 
the increase in revenues partially was offset by a increase in operating costs of  primarily due to incremental power costs due to increased volumes  additional personnel costs and reductions in the reimbursement of certain costs previously paid by third parties 
the net operating margin from terminal operations increased  approximately  to  in this increase resulted from a increase in volumes  primarily from the little rock  arkansas terminal  offset in part by an increase in terminal operating costs of in the net operating margin from product sales increased  during the year ended april  compared to the year ended april   while net revenues increased  on additional volume of  gallons sold 
the improved net margins were primarily due to increased bulk and rack product sales volumes  and higher market prices for products sold in the peak seasonal period of gasoline demand occurring in old transmontaigne s last fiscal quarter ended april   during which period gasoline prices reached a five year high of over 
per gallon 
during the year ended april   general and administrative expenses increased approximately over the year ended april   primarily due to increases in salaries and related employee benefits costs associated with the hiring of additional personnel 
equity in earnings of affiliates primarily represent old transmontaigne s share of the earnings of lion oil company lion 
old transmontaigne s owned subsidiary  continental ozark holdings  inc coh  owns a interest in lion 
minority interest represents the other coh shareholders interest in the earnings of lion 
during the year ended april   equity in earnings of affiliates net of the related minority interests increased to approximately  from approximately  for the year ended april   primarily due to improved crack spreads at lion 
interest expense represents interest on the revolving bank line of credit used to finance inventory and accounts receivable and interest on the company s senior subordinated debentures 
interest expense decreased  or  primarily as a result of lower average balances outstanding under the line of credit 
other financing costs include fees paid for letters of credit issued to product suppliers and loan commitment fees paid in connection with the revolving loan facility 
interest income during the year ended april   was attributable to the investment in interest bearing securities of approximately million of cash held for future investments during the period 
primarily as a result of the increases in pipeline  terminal  and products supply and distribution net operating margins  reduction in interest expense and the increase in interest income  discussed above  net earnings for the year ended april  increased  to  from a loss of  for the year ended april  year ended april  compared to the seven months ended april  and the year ended september  revenue and operating information for the year ended april   the seven months ended april  and year ended september  are summarized below products supply and pipeline terminal distribution operations operations operations total in thousands volumes    revenues     net operating margin    seven months volumes    revenues     net operating margin loss     volumes    revenues     net operating margin loss     the norco pipeline system was acquired in november pipeline volumes are expressed in barrels gallons per barrel  and terminal and products supply and distribution sales volumes are expressed in gallons 
net operating margin represents revenues less direct operating expenses for pipeline and terminal operations  and revenues less cost of refined petroleum products purchased for products supply and distribution operations 
net operating margins from pipeline operations remained relatively constant over the periods 
net operating margins were  for the year ended april    for the seven months ended april  and  for the year ended september  terminal operations generated net operating margins of  for the year ended april    for the seven months ended april  and  for the year ended september  this increase in net operating margins during these periods was due primarily to the increased volumes and revenues attributable to the acquisition of the little rock south terminal in may and the increased utilization of the rogers terminal 
as a result  terminal operations volumes handled increased to  gallons for the year april  from  gallons for the twelve months ended september   and revenues increased to  from  for the earlier period 
although terminal operations volumes increased significantly during these periods  operating expenses remained relatively constant  thereby increasing the net operating margins in these periods 
net operating margins losses on product sales were  for the year ended april    for the seven months ended april  and  for the year ended september  during these periods  there were significant fluctuations in refined petroleum product purchase and sale prices reflecting the volatility of world wide energy markets 
in many cases this resulted in reduced or negative margins on sales of refined petroleum products and an inventory write down 
during the seven months ended april   old transmontaigne recorded a write down of approximately  to reduce inventories to the lower of cost or market 
the write down was a result of a steep decline in refined petroleum product prices in the latter part of revenues from product sales also declined subsequent to april  as a result of discontinuing the business of a limited partnership in which old transmontaigne owned a one third interest and was the managing general partner 
the partnership conducted trading operations primarily in the cash market by purchasing and selling refined petroleum products and crude oil 
while significant revenues were generated during the seven months ended april  and the year ended september   the effect on net earnings losses during these periods was not significant 
general and administrative expenses increased from the year ended september  through the year ended april  as a result of the acquisition of the norco pipeline  the growth of the razorback pipeline rogers terminal operations  the acquisition of the little rock south terminal  and the expansion of product supply and distribution activities  all of which increased personnel costs and related supporting administrative expenses 
there was a increase in depreciation and amortization expense from the year ended september  through the year ended april   primarily due to the acquisition of the little rock south terminal 
equity in earnings losses of affiliates  net of the related minority interest  was  in the year ended april    in the seven months ended april   and  in the year ended september  during these periods  the operating results of lion fluctuated widely as a result of volatile crude oil and refined petroleum products prices and crack spreads 
during periods of fluctuating prices  lion experiences reductions in crack spreads when market prices of refined petroleum products do not change in correlation to increases in crude oil prices 
interest expense during the periods from through fluctuated with changes in the average outstanding loan balances and with changes in the interest rates on the loans  which ranged from to during these periods 
the average outstanding loan balance increased from approximately  for the year ended september  to approximately  and  for the seven months ended april  and the year ended april   respectively 
interest expense also includes interest on outstanding senior subordinated debentures during these periods 
the loss on cancellation of aircraft lease of  recorded in the fourth quarter of the year ended april  was a non recurring expense in connection with the termination of a long term lease 
the company does not own or have any lease obligations with respect to corporate aircraft 
old transmontaigne incurred net losses for the year ended april   the seven months ended april   and the year ended september  of   and  respectively  primarily as a result of the under utilization of its pipeline and terminal facilities  a lack of adequate working capital to finance inventory requirements and the fluctuations in the net operating margins  discussed above
