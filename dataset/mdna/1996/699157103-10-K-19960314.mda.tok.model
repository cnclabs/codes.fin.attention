item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general historically  the company concentrated most of its drilling activities onshore in texas in exploratory prospects 
however  during the period through  the company deemphasized exploratory drilling and committed most of its available funds to the acquisition and enhancement of producing gas and oil properties and development drilling 
in  the company returned its primary focus to exploratory drilling through the use of three dimensional seismic technology 
the company s gas and oil producing activities are accounted for using the full cost method of accounting 
accordingly  the company capitalizes all costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of gas and oil properties and with the exploration for and development of gas and oil reserves 
normal dispositions of gas and oil properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recognized 
certain directly identifiable internal costs of property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized 
such costs capitalized in  and totaled approximately   and  respectively 
depletion of such costs is provided using the units of production method based upon estimates of proved gas and oil reserves with gas and oil production being converted to a common unit of measure based upon their relative energy content 
depletion per equivalent unit of production ebo was  and for  and  respectively 
costs from unproved properties are excluded from depletion until evaluated 
in accordance with the full cost method of accounting  the net capitalized costs of gas and oil properties full cost ceiling limitation are not to exceed their related estimated future net revenues discounted at  and lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties  net of tax considerations 
results of operations the company s business activities are characterized by frequent  and sometimes significant  changes in reserve base  sources of production  product mix gas versus oil volumes and prices received by the company for its gas and oil 
consequently  year to year or other periodic comparisons of the company s results of operations can be difficult and may not fully and accurately describe the company s condition

liquidity and capital resources working capital increased  as of december  compared to december  current assets exceeded current liabilities by  at december  compared to a deficit of  at december  current assets decreased primarily due to a decrease in undeveloped leases held for sale of  offset by an increase of  in accounts receivable 
current liabilities decreased because of a decrease in accounts payables of  resulting from the company s payment of its vendors 
in july   the company and its bank lender amended and restated the company s revolving credit facility and renewed and extended the company s outstanding indebtedness under the facility 
interest only is payable on the outstanding principal balance of the revolving facility on the last day of each month through and including may  under the restated credit facility  the revolving loan will automatically convert to a four year term loan on june   payable in equal installments of principal plus accrued and unpaid interest  with the final payment being due and payable on may  the aggregate principal amount of the company s borrowings outstanding at any one time are limited to the lesser of  or the borrowing base then in effect 
at march   the borrowing base was  and the aggregate principal amount outstanding at the same date was approximately  commitment fees of per annum on the difference between the loan commitment amount and the average daily amount of the loan are due quarterly 
the borrowing base is redetermined by the bank semi annually on or about may and november of each year 
the note bears interest at the bank s prime rate and is secured by substantially all of the company s oil and gas properties 
the restated loan agreement contains various restrictive covenants and compliance requirements  including maintenance of certain financial ratios  limitations on additional indebtedness and restrictions on the payment of dividends 
the company incurred costs of  in its oil and gas property acquisition and development activities  including undeveloped leases held for sale  for the year ended december  such costs were financed by the utilization of working capital in addition to the sale of selected properties for  net cash provided by operating activities of  and net cash provided by financing activities of  which was attributable to net bank borrowings in the amount of  and net proceeds of  from the issuance of common stock 
historically  the company concentrated most of its drilling activities onshore in texas in exploratory prospects 
however  from through the company followed a policy of deemphasizing exploratory drilling and committing most of its available funds to the acquisition and enhancement of producing oil and gas properties and development drilling 
beginning in  the company again emphasized exploratory activities  primarily through the use of three dimensional seismic technology 
based on the company s projected oil and gas revenues and related expenses  management believes that its internally generated cash flow  coupled with proceeds from the company s recent private placement of common stock and borrowings under the company s lending facility  will be sufficient to fund its current operations 
in addition  the company continually reviews and considers alternative methods of financing 
trends and prices the company s revenues  cash flows and borrowing capacity are affected by changes in oil and gas prices 
the markets for oil and gas have historically been  and will continue to be  volatile 
prices for oil and gas typically fluctuate in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand  market uncertainty  seasonal  political and other factors beyond the control of the company 
the company is unable to accurately predict domestic or worldwide political events or the effects of such other factors on the prices received by the company for its gas and oil 
the company historically has not entered into transactions to hedge against changes in oil and gas prices  but may elect to enter into hedging transactions in the future to protect against fluctuations in oil and gas prices 
during  the average sales price received by the company for its oil was approximately per bbl  as compared to in  while the average sales prices for the company s gas was approximately per mcf in  as compared to per mcf in at march   the price received by the company for its oil production ranged from to per bbl  while the price received by the company  at that same date  for its gas production ranged from to per mcf
