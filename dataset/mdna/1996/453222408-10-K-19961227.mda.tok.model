approximately  and of revenue for  and  respectively  was derived from services provided to medicare beneficiaries 
primarily all of the payments for these services are made by the medicare program based on reimbursable costs incurred in rendering the services 
payments are made via an interim payment rate as services are rendered 
cost reports are filed with medicare on an annual basis  which are subject to audit and retroactive adjustment by medicare 
the company reports revenue only for those costs that it believes are probable as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
of recovery under the applicable medicare statutes and regulations and reports its accounts receivable balances at net realizable value 
the company utilizes an extensive system of internal controls to ensure such proper reporting of revenues 
the company employs personnel with significant medicare reimbursement experience to prepare its cost reports and to monitor its operations on an ongoing basis to identify and seek to minimize those costs which are not reimbursed 
as a part of its system of internal controls  the company uses a detailed analysis process in calculating its medicare revenue at the time services are rendered 
this process considers the nature and amounts of the disputed costs as described in more detail below along with several authoritative  legal and historical sources of information including applicable statutes and regulations  such as those contained in the title xviii of the social security act  particularly sec 
v a reasonable cost and cfr cost related to patient care  health care financing administration hcfa publication home health agency manual  applicable sections of hcfa publication provider reimbursement manual and intermediary letters and program memoranda issued by hcfa 
administrative decisions and rulings on related issues by the provider reimbursement review board and administrative law judges 
judicial decisions from federal district courts on relevant cases 
consultation with independent industry experts such as medicare cost reimbursement consultants 
opinions of outside legal counsel who specialize in dealing with medicare reimbursement issues 
historical knowledge gained internally from past medicare audits 
meetings and other communication with medicare intermediaries  blue cross association and hcfa 
this detailed analysis process is updated on a quarterly basis  taking into account any new information such as decisions relating to the company s disputed costs  and administrative and judicial decisions relating to similar issues that may affect the determination of the net realizable value of accounts receivable or of liabilities to repay amounts received for disputed costs 
results of this detailed analysis process are extrapolated to other unaudited cost reporting years for all of the company s operations  including operations that have not yet been audited by medicare  to estimate the gross amount of reimbursement that would be affected 
the company  through this ongoing control and monitoring process  provides a reserve by means of a revenue reduction for any costs incurred which the company believes are not probable of recovery 
this reserve is reported as a reduction of accounts receivable for disputed costs for which the company may not ultimately receive payment 
the company has also reported as a liability disputed costs for which it has received payment  which may have to be returned to medicare 
accordingly  the company believes that its accounts receivable are stated at net realizable value  and that it has recorded all probable liabilities for repayment of disputed costs 
over the years  medicare auditors employed by the medicare fiscal intermediaries have  in connection with their retrospective audit process  taken certain positions with respect to certain types of costs  claiming that they are not reimbursable and thus not recoverable by the company from the medicare program 
these positions are based on interpretations promulgated after the period covered by the cost reports and applied retroactively  interpretations of cost reimbursement principles that are contrary to the company s interpretations  or on what the company believes to be misapplications of specific reimbursement principles  that could not have been foreseen at the time services were rendered and revenue recorded 
these positions taken by medicare auditors are usually determined from medicare s notice of program reimbursement npr which typically are not received until two to three years after the services are rendered 
in those situations where the company decides to not challenge an npr finding  any revenue relating to these costs  as well as the extrapolated impact  if any  on other open costs reporting years  if not written off or provided for earlier  is written off as a revenue reduction at that time 
the results of all nprs are included in the analysis process in calculating net medicare revenue as described above 
the company has received nprs challenging million of costs as of september  there was an additional million of costs at september  related to open cost reporting years that are similar to the costs that have been challenged on nprs 
together these amounts million at september  comprise the total amount the company considers to be disputed costs 
the major cost category in dispute  accounting for approximately of total disputed costs  is the treatment of certain personnel costs relating to the company s community liaison positions  which medicare auditors allege are unreimbursable sales costs  other costs in dispute relate to the cost of physical therapists employed by the company  the method of allocation of administrative and general costs to branch operations and certain corporate expenses 
these disputed costs including the extrapolated impact of million at september  arose in the fiscal years ended september  million  million  million  million  million  and million 
the amount of disputed costs has increased over the last several years as the company s operations have grown  medicare auditors have taken positions to disallow certain costs in certain cost reports as non reimbursable  and the company has extrapolated that amount of costs that may be challenged to other unaudited cost reporting years 
the normal medicare administrative appeal process may take several years to resolve these types of disputes 
the company disagrees with the positions taken by the medicare fiscal intermediaries auditors and the health care financing administration  and is vigorously pursuing these matters through administrative and legal channels 
the disputed cost analysis process related to the community liaison and physical therapist positions which comprise of disputed costs encompassed all of the authoritative  legal and historical sources discussed above 
based on this review the company believes that the majority of the community liaison costs are probable of recovery  and that a relatively small portion of these costs are not probable of recovery 
the company has established  and is continuing to add to  a reserve for the portion of these costs not considered probable of recovery 
since the reserves have been established  the company has continued to review whether the level is appropriate 
nothing has occurred in the legal or administrative process which the company is pursuing concerning the disputes which has caused the company to conclude that the reserve should be changed 
therefore  no change has been made in the rate of reserve used to record additional reserves on community liaison related costs incurred on an ongoing basis 
on the physical therapist issue  the company believes medicare has no basis in the regulations for its disallowance of certain costs related to physical therapists employed by the company  and therefore the company has not established a reserve for these disputed costs 
legal opinions have been received on both the community liaison and physical therapist issues from an attorney specializing in medicare reimbursement issues indicating that it is probable that the company will prevail in both issues 
the company received in march a favorable ruling on the physical therapist issue by the hhs provider reimbursement review board prrb 
in may  this ruling was reversed by the health care financing administration 
the company has appealed the decision to the us federal district court in minneapolis 
because the prrb previously ruled in the company s favor  the company believes it has a strong basis for a favorable outcome on such an appeal 
in june  the prrb ruled that approximately of the  of community liaison costs subject to review as part of this hearing were reimbursable to the company 
in august  the health care financing administration reversed this ruling 
the company had previously recorded a reserve equal to of all revenue related to the  of costs as well as other personnel costs relating to the company s community liaison position 
after careful assessment of the prrb and health care financing administrator decisions and the facts and documentation supporting the nature of the personnel costs at issue  the company continues to believe that the majority of the community liaison costs are recoverable under the medicare program 
the company has concluded that the reserve on this issue in total remains appropriate and have appealed the decision to the us federal district court in minneapolis 
the company  based on its analysis process  believes that recovery of  of total disputed costs including the extrapolated impact may not be probable and  accordingly  has established reserves which totaled that amount as of september  the net amount of disputed costs which the company believes is probable of recovery has been included in revenues in the respective years in which services were rendered and  to the extent not paid to the company  is included in accounts receivable 
total accounts receivable net of reserves due from medicare at september  were  including the receivables net of reserves for disputed costs of  as of september  the company had received  in payments from medicare for disputed costs 
medicare may seek repayment for such amounts and accordingly  the potential liability for repayments is recorded as accrued liabilities third party 
the company believes it is probable that it has not incurred any other liability to repay disputed costs 
in view of the expectation that resolution of the disputed costs will not likely be accomplished within the next twelve months  related net receivables of  as of september  have been classified as a non current asset 
operating activities provided   and  in cash during  and  respectively 
total accounts receivable current and long term increased during  decreased during and increased during the increase in was due primarily to the increase in disputed costs 
the decrease during was due to improved collection efforts and timing of payments from medicare 
the increase in was due to the medicare disputes noted above
