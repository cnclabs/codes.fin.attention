as a result  routine monthly costs and expenditures have continued to decrease since mid prior to june all costs were substantially lower as the company was primarily performing research and development activity related to the horizon battery  and related technologies and costs for the production facility were borne by a strategic corporate partner 
effective the fourth quarter of  the company formalized its arrangement with bdm and agreed to a technology license agreement whereby the company will license bdm s manufacturing technology for use in producing the horizon battery 
in accordance with the terms of the agreement  the company agreed to pay bdm  cash  issue  shares of common stock in equal installments over a three year period  issue  shares of common stock if the company decides to maintain the license beyond the original three year term  and to grant  options to purchase common stock at per share

in  the company successfully demonstrated that it could manufacture the horizon battery in commercial quantities 
as a result of such efforts  in december  the company received a production purchase order from chrysler which could result in up to million in battery sales cumulatively over the next three years 
chrysler has the right to withhold or cancel orders 
in addition  numerous horizon production and prototype batteries were sent to customers all over the world  seeding target markets 
significant technical improvements were also made in the battery s performance in in the areas of specific energy  power and cycle life 
the major portion of development is completed  and in management will focus efforts on capitalizing on market opportunities as customers move from test phases to integration of horizon technology into their commercial products 
in addition  management has significantly reduced operating costs from mid levels in an effort to conserve cash 
the company s cash sources in are largely dependent on the successful commercialization of the horizon battery 
management expects the level of battery sales to increase in late as the company receives commercial orders under the chrysler production purchase order as well as from other customers currently testing the battery 
management does not expect sales from these orders to generate sufficient funds to support its overall working capital and capital expenditure needs in  therefore  it is expected that additional debt and or equity financing will be necessary

however  if the minimum required balance is not maintained  nasdaq may choose to delist the stock of the company from trading which would restrict the liquidity of the common stock 
delisting by nasdaq would be an event of default under the terms of the april debentures  which could trigger a requirement to repay the respective debentures immediately 
april debentures with a principal balance of  were outstanding at december  although management is devoting substantial efforts to successfully commercialize its horizon technology and to secure additional funding sources  there is no assurance that such efforts will be successful 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the company to continue as a going concern
