problem assets even though non performing assets declined during the year  recognition  control  and disposition of problem assets non performing loans and reo continues to be a primary objective of the association 
the association s ratio of non performing loans to total loans was   and at june    and  respectively 
the association attributes the decrease in its non performing loans primarily to the disposition of real estate acquired through foreclosure including some real estate properties damaged in the northridge earthquake in january however  the association s primary lending area  southern california  continues to experience weak real estate values that may cause an increase in nonperforming assets and a corresponding increase in provisions for loan losses in the future 
results of operations general 
the company reported net earnings of million for the year ended june   compared to net earnings of million for the year ended june  and a net loss of million for the year ended june  the increase in earnings for fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase in net interest income before provision for loan losses 
the increase in earnings in fiscal over was primarily due to a reduction in provision for loan losses of million in from the amount recorded in interest income 
interest income was million  million and million for the years ended june    and  respectively 
the million increase in interest income in compared to resulted from an increase in the average balance of interest earning assets of million and an increase in the average yield on interest earning assets of to 
the million increase in interest income in compared to resulted from an increase in the average balance of interest earning assets of million  partially offset by a decrease in the average yield on interest earning assets of to 
interest expense 
interest expense was million  million  and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
the million increase in compared to resulted from an increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities of million and an increase in the average cost on interest bearing liabilities of to 
the million increase in compared to resulted from an increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities of million  as well as an increase in the average cost on interest bearing liabilities of to 
the increase in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities in fiscal and resulted primarily from increasing market rates during the period 
net interest income before provision for loan losses 
net interest income before provision for loan losses was million  million  and million for the years ended june    and  respectively 
the increase in compared to was primarily a result of the net interest margin increasing to from during the year 
net interest income before provision for loan losses remained relatively unchanged in as compared to although there was a decline in net interest margin in as compared to this was offset by asset growth 
provision for loan losses 
during   and the association established million   and million  respectively  of provisions for losses on loans 
management believes the increase of million in compared to was necessary in order to replenish the allowance for loan losses to a level that management believes to be adequate following increased charge offs during compared to and the decrease of million in compared to was primarily a result of the reduction in nonperforming assets 
non performing loans decreased million to million during fiscal in  the association was only beginning to acquire title or resolve properties damaged in the january northridge earthquake 
as of the end of fiscal  the association had either acquired title to all of the earthquake affected properties or entered into workout agreements allowing the owners of the remaining damaged property to make partial payments 
the million provision for loan losses in reflected management s assessment of the loan portfolio in consideration of various factors  including the trends in the association s nonperforming assets during that time  continued declines in the southern california economy and the real estate markets in the association s primary lending area  the northridge earthquake and the regulatory environment 
management considers the level of non performing assets  the regional economic conditions and relevant real estate values and other factors when assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan loss 
the southern california economy and real estate markets in the association s primary lending area remained weak during although management considers the level of allowance for loan losses at june  to be adequate 
there can be no assurance that the association will not have to establish additional loss provisions in the future 
other income 
other income increased by  or  in to million as compared to fee income for deposits and loans serviced increased due to a larger loan and deposit base 
in addition  commissions from the sale on noninsured deposit products increased due to improved sales volumes 
other income declined by  or  in to million as compared to primarily as a result of a reduced volume of loans originated and sold 
other expense 
other expense increased  or  from million in to million in compensation and employee benefits increased  or in as compared to due to increases in salaries and accounting for the esop plan 
fdic insurance increased  in compared to the previous year due to an increase in the deposit balances that the insurance premium is based upon 
other general and administrative expense increased  primarily relating to data processing due to the association converting to new deposit software and hardware  and increased consulting costs relating to these changes 
the following is a summary of other general and administrative expenses for the fiscal years ended june  in thousands professional fees data processing advertising and promotional bank service charges miscellaneous loan expenses consulting fees other    income taxes benefit 
income taxes increased by million from million in to million in income taxes increased by million from a million benefit in to a million expense in the increases are due to the increase in earnings before income taxes 
financial condition the company s consolidated assets totaled million at june   compared to million at june  stockholders equity totaled million at june   compared to million june  the increase in assets is primarily attributable to the implementation of the company s growth strategies funded by deposit promotions and fhlb advances 
loans and mbs including assets held or available for sale increased to million at june   from million at june  loans originated and purchased for investment increased slightly to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the same period the previous year 
at june   the association s multifamily loan portfolio totaled million  or of total loans 
of the association s million of charge offs in fiscal  million  or  were for multifamily loans 
see business allowances for loan and real estate losses 
multifamily loans are generally considered to involve a higher degree of credit risk and to be more vulnerable to deteriorating economic conditions than one to four family residential mortgage loans 
these loans typically involve higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of such loans generally depend on the income produced by the operation or sale of the property being sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service 
recessionary economic conditions of the type that have prevailed in the company s primary lending market area tend to result in higher vacancy and reduced rental rates and net operating incomes from multifamily residential properties 
loan sales increased to million for the year ended june   compared to million for the same period ended june  the increase in loan sales is primarily a result of an increase in funding of fixed rate loans that were generally held for sale during this period 
loans serviced for others increased slightly to million at june  from million at june  primarily due to the increase in fixed rate loans sold with servicing retained 
capital resources and liquidity regulatory capital requirements firrea and implementing ots capital regulations require the association to maintain certain minimum tangible  core and risk based regulatory capital levels 
the following table summarizes the regulatory capital requirements for the association at june  as indicated in the table  the association s capital levels exceed all three of the currently applicable minimum capital requirements 
june  tangible risk based capital core capital capital balance balance balance dollars in thousands regulatory capital    required minimum    excess capital    in addition  fdicia required the ots to implement a system of regulatory sanctions against institutions that are not adequately capitalized  with the sanctions growing more severe the lower the institution s capital 
under fdicia  the ots issued regulations establishing five separate capital categories well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized  differentiated by core capital ratio  level of core capital to risk weighted assets and risk based capital ratio 
see business regulation and supervision prompt corrective action requirements 
an institution is treated as well capitalized if its core capital ratio is at least  its ratio of core capital to risk weighted assets is at least and its risk based capital ratio is at least 
the following table summarizes the capital ratios of the well capitalized category and the association s regulatory capital at june  as compared to such ratios 
as indicated in the table  the association s capital levels exceeded the three minimum capital ratios of the well capitalized category

at june   a total of  shares had been repurchased at prices ranging from to per share 
for the year ended december    shares had been repurchased under a previous repurchase plan 
the company may resume repurchasing shares shortly and complete the repurchase over the next several months 
the increase in the company s book value per share reflects both the company s earnings and the reduced number of shares outstanding resulting from the stock repurchase program 
sources of funds and liquidity the association s primary sources of funds are deposits  principal and interest payments on loans  proceeds from the sale of loans and advances from the fhlb 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by interest rates  economic conditions  and competition 
although competition for deposits in the southern california area is substantial  the association experienced an increase in deposits 
the association also has other potential sources of liquidity  such as securities sold under agreements to repurchase and liquidating existing short term assets 
the association has continued to maintain the required minimum levels of liquid assets as defined by ots regulations 
this requirement  which may be varied at the direction of the ots depending upon economic conditions and deposit flows  is based upon a percentage of deposits and short term borrowings 
the required ratio is currently 
the association s average liquidity ratios were  and at june   and  respectively 
management currently attempts to maintain a liquidity ratio as close to the minimum as possible 
liquidity levels reflect management s strategy to invest excess liquidity in higher yielding interest earning assets such as loans 
the company s cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications cash flows from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities 
cash flows from operating activities consisted primarily of cash flows from the sale of loans held for sale which totaled million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
the association originated loans for sale of million  million  and million during fiscal years   and  respectively 
net cash used by investing activities consisted primarily of loan originations and investment purchases  offset by principal collections on loans and proceeds from principal reductions on mbs and maturities of other investment securities 
loans originated and purchased for investment were million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
proceeds from maturities and principal payments of investment securities and sales of mbs available for sale were million  million  and million for fiscal years ended   and  respectively 
net cash used by financing activities consisting primarily of net activity in deposit accounts and proceeds from funding and repayments of fhlb advances 
the net change in deposits was an increase of million for fiscal  an increase of million for fiscal  and a decrease of million for fiscal the net proceeds from fhlb advances were million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
the major variances in the statements of cash flows for fiscal   and included in this report can be explained largely by the change in the association s liquidity management activities 
see financial statements and supplementary data 
due to the association s growth strategies in fiscal and  the association s use of fhlb advances increased 
in fiscal  the association s use of fhlb advances increased due to a decrease in deposits 
at june   the association had million in advances outstanding from the fhlb 
during fiscal  the maximum amount of fhlb advances that the association had outstanding at any month end was million 
management anticipates increased borrowing from the fhlb in fiscal see business sources and funds borrowings 
liquidity levels were maintained in fiscal with a higher level of reliance on short term borrowings 
the association s most liquid assets are cash and short term investments 
the levels of these assets are dependent on the association s operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at june   cash and short term investments totaled million 
at june   the association had outstanding commitments to originate loans of million 
the association anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan origination commitments 
certificates of deposit which are scheduled to mature in one year or less from june   totaled million 
while management anticipates that there may be some outflow of these deposits upon maturity  due to the current competitive rate environment  these are not expected to have a material impact on the long term liquidity position of the association 
other sources of capital and liquidity for the company include distributions from the association and borrowings  such as repurchase transactions 
dividends and other capital distributions from the association are subject to regulatory restrictions 
see business regulation and supervision savings and loan holding company regulation payment of dividends and other capital distributions by association and market for the registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters 
asset liability management the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of falling interest rates therefore  the net earnings of an institution with a positive gap theoretically may be adversely affected due to its interest earning assets repricing to a greater extent than its interest bearing liabilities 
conversely  during a period of rising interest rates  theoretically  the net earnings of an institution with a positive gap position may increase as it is able to invest in higher yielding interest earning assets at a more rapid rate than its interest bearing liabilities reprice 
in addition  a positive gap may not protect an institution with a large portfolio of arm loans from increases in interest rates for extended time periods as such instruments generally have periodic and lifetime interest rate caps 
additionally  the association s arm loans are predominantly tied to cofi  a lagging market index  and rapid increases in interest rates could have a negative impact on the association s earnings 
accordingly  interest rates and the resulting cost of funds increases in a rapidly increasing rate environment could exceed the cap levels on these instruments and negatively impact net interest income 
declining interest rates have  in general  benefited the association primarily due to the effect of the lagging market index which has resulted in the interest income declining at a slower rate than interest expense 
this effect of the lagging index has been partially offset by the increase in refinancings of portfolio loans to lower yielding loans 
the association has managed its interest rate risk through the aggressive marketing and funding of adjustable rate loans  which generally reprice at least semi annually and are generally indexed to cofi 
as a result of this strategy  and based upon the assumptions used in the table set forth below  at june  the association s total net interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year exceeded its total interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing in the same time by million  representing a one year cumulative gap ratio of positive 
this compares to million at june   which represented a positive gap ratio of 
the decline in is primarily the result of the shortening time remaining to maturity on the association s certificate accounts 
at june  certificate accounts maturing in one year or less totaled million compared to june  which totaled million 
the increase in certificates with terms to maturity of one year or less  is primarily a result of customers desire for shorter term certificates 
furthermore  the association moderately increased the level of short term borrowings during fhlb advances and borrowings with maturities of one year or less totalled million at june  compared to million at june  the association closely monitors its interest rate risk as such risk relates to its operational strategies 
the association s board of directors has established an asset liability committee  responsible for reviewing its asset liability policies and interest rate risk position  which generally meets weekly and reports to the board of directors on interest rate risk and trends on a quarterly basis 
the association s cumulative gap position is at a level satisfactory to management 
there can be no assurances that the company will be able to maintain its positive gap position or that its strategies will not result in a negative gap position in the future 
the level of the movement of interest rates  up or down  is an uncertainty and could have a negative impact on the earnings of the association 
the association does not currently engage in the use of trading activities  high risk derivatives and synthetic instruments or hedging activities in controlling its interest rate risk 
such uses are permitted at the recommendation of the asset liability committee with the approval of the board of directors  however  the association does not intend to engage in such practices in the immediate future 
the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at june   which are anticipated by the association  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
except as stated below  the amount of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to repricing or the contractual terms of the asset or liability 
specifically  the association assumed a prepayment rate ranging from to on arm loans  and to on fixed rate loans 
additionally  the association utilized deposit decay rate assumptions ranging from to for passbook accounts  to for checking accounts and for money market deposit accounts in the one year or less category

includes assets held or available for sale 
interest sensitivity gap represents the difference between net interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as arm loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their arm loans may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
net interest income net interest income represents the difference between income on interest earning assets and expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income also depends upon the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rate earned or paid on them

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the association s operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the association are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the association s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services

impact of new accounting standards in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement establishes financial accounting standards for stock based employee compensation plans 
sfas no 
permits the company to choose either a new fair value based method or the current apb opinion intrinsic valued based method of accounting for its stock based compensation arrangements with pro forma disclosures of net earnings and earnings per share computed as if the fair value based method had been applied 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  it is not expected that sfas no 
will have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
this statement specifies when financial assets and liabilities are to be removed from an entity s financial statements  specifies the accounting for servicing assets and liabilities  and the accounting for assets that can be contractually prepaid in such a way that the holder would not recover substantially all of its recorded investment 
under sfas  an entity recognizes only assets it controls and liabilities it has incurred  derecognizes assets only when control has been surrendered  and derecognizes liabilities only when they have been extinguished 
sfas requires that the selling entity continue to carry retained interests  including servicing assets  in assets it has derecognized 
such retained interests are based on their relative fair values at the date of transfer 
transfers not meeting the criteria for sale recognition are accounted for as a secured borrowing with pledge of collateral 
under sfas certain collateralized borrowings may result in asset derecognition when the assets provided as collateral may be derecognized based on whether the secured party takes control over the collateral and whether the secured party is permitted to repledge or sell the collateral  and the debtor does not have the right to redeem the collateral on short notice 
extinguishments of liabilities are recognized only when the debtor pays the creditor and is relieved of its obligation for the liability or when the debtor is legally released from being the primary obligor under the liability  either judicially  or by the creditor 
sfas requires an entity to recognize its obligation to service financial assets  that are retained in a transfer of assets  in the form of a servicing asset or liability 
the servicing asset or liability is to be amortized in proportion to and over the period of net servicing income or loss 
servicing assets and liabilities are to be assessed for impairment based on their fair value 
sfas modifies the accounting for interest only strips or retained interests in securitizations  such as capitalized servicing fees receivable  that can contractually be prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that the holder would not recover substantially all of its recorded investment  to require their classification as available for sale or as trading securities 
interest only strips and retained interests are to be recorded at market value 
changes in market value are included in stockholders equity as unrealized holding gains or losses net of the related tax effect 
sfas is effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after december   and is required to be applied prospectively 
the association enters into transactions covered by sfas  including sales of securities under agreements to repurchase  collateralized borrowings from the federal home loan bank and others 
the association does not anticipate a material impact on transactions covered by sfas
