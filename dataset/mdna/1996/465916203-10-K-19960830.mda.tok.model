item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general iwerks is engaged in the business of designing  engineering  manufacturing  marketing and servicing specialty theatre systems which employ a variety of projection  show control  motion simulation and software technologies 
the company also owns and operates or has a financial interest in both mobile and fixed location motion simulation theatres 
since its inception in  iwerks has expanded on its initial proprietary large format film projection product to include motion simulation  degree video  large format projection  group interactive  and d attractions 
the company also developed and built a fleet of mobile motion simulation attractions which it owns and operates 
to support these systems  the company has produced a library of film software which it licenses to operators of its systems 
with this diverse array of software driven entertainment products  in iwerks developed a strategy for entertainment centers that would incorporate each of its products along with food service and retail sales 
to support this strategy  the company committed significant resources to film software  research and development and expansion of its corporate infrastructure 
in may iwerks acquired omni films international  inc  a sarasota  florida competitor 
fiscal was a year of significant change for the company 
a principal operating strategy of the company had been the development of a new type of entertainment venue which the company referred to as cinetropolis entertainment centers 
as conceived by the company  this product combines iwerks attractions with restaurants and specialty retail concepts in a highly themed environment to create a movie based entertainment center 
the company devoted significant resources in fiscal and to the development and marketing of this new entertainment concept 
included in this effort was substantial research and development expenditures in fiscal and to complete two new attractions  the company s virtual adventures attraction and iwerks attractions 
in addition  during these periods and in the first half of  the company committed significant resources to the production of film software for exhibition at cinetropolis centers 
in addition  the company significantly expanded its corporate infrastructure during this period to support an anticipated successful roll out of its cinetropolis strategy 
these efforts contributed to a net loss recognized by the company in fiscal of approximately million 
in fiscal  the company took a number of steps designed to return the company to profitability 
the company brought in new management  consolidated its operations into one primary location  implemented a reduction in force and reoriented its product strategies 
however  by taking these steps during the fiscal year  the company was required to recognize a number of accounting charges which contributed to the company s net loss for the year 
nevertheless  management of the company believed that the cumulative effect of these decisions will result in a more cost efficient operation with fewer layers of management and more rapid and direct decision making 
the company streamlined its management and concentrated its operations under the supervision of four new executives 
roy a 
wright was appointed chief operating officer in december and assumed the position of chief executive officer on july  the company implemented  during fiscal  a significant reduction in force and consolidated all of its principal operations at its burbank  california facility 
the company employed persons at september  compared to at august   representing a reduction in personnel 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company approved a restructuring plan which involved the closure of its sarasota  florida manufacturing facility 
the relocation of these operations to burbank  california was expected to be complete by fall of calendar in august  the company relocated its portable touring operations from newport beach  california to burbank  california 
with the completion of the sarasota consolidation  all of the company s operations other than regional sales offices are located in burbank  california 
the lack of market response to the company s cinetropolis product strategy led to a determination by new management to refocus the company s approach to the owned and operated market 
the company has modified its approach to the cinetropolis product strategy 
it continues  however  to focus on opportunities to participate in the ownership and operation of its attractions 
the company owns and operates a fleet of portable ride simulation theatres and is exploring other potential touring opportunities 
the company continues to evaluate opportunities to participate in the operation of its fixed base attractions either through direct equity ownership or through licensing arrangements 
in this regard  the company is focusing on less capital intensive strategies without the high level of commitment of management and other resources employed in the past 
the foregoing resulted in several charges during fiscal that affected the company s results of operations 
the company incurred increased professional and consulting fees during the year in connection with its review of operations  which are included in sg a for the year 
the level of sg a was negatively impacted by a  restructuring charge associated with the company s decision to restructure its manufacturing operations and effect a reduction in force 
the change in the company s cinetropolis product strategy resulted in accounting charges in the aggregate amount of million  primarily consisting of a write down of million in the carrying value of the company s film inventory and a write down of million in the carrying value of certain property and equipment associated with the company s virtual adventures attraction 
in addition to the accounting charges discussed above  there is included in the results of operations for the fiscal year an adjustment of approximately  relating to the write down of certain accounts receivable and other assets 
during fiscal  the management restructuring  facility consolidation  and reductions in staff contributed to improve margins and reduce selling  general and administrative expenses 
these actions along with an increase in total revenues have resulted in net income in all four quarters of fiscal as discussed in the following results of operations 
results of operations iwerks derives its revenues primarily from three sources sales of hardware systems  owned and operated primarily portable simulation theatres  and licensing of films 
to a lesser extent  revenues are also earned from service to existing theatre owners and production of films for third parties 
revenues on sales of theatre systems are recognized on the percentage of completion method over the life of the contract  typically the majority of such revenues are recognized in the to weeks prior to shipment of the theatre system 
accordingly  the timing of shipment schedules as dictated by the customer can result in variability of quarterly revenues and earnings 
the gross margin for each contract varies based upon pricing strategies  competitive conditions and product mix 
revenues from owned and operated o o consist of portable ride simulation theatre revenues derived primarily from corporate sponsorship or ticket sales at state fairs  air shows  and similar events  as well as revenues derived from fixed site joint venture revenues which includes the company s contractual share of the sites revenues or profits as applicable 
admission revenues from the portable ride simulation theatres are subject to variability due to the seasonal nature of these events and are higher during the summer months 
sponsorship and contract revenues for the portable theatres are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
the company typically licenses its film software under one year film license agreements and revenues and related expenses are recognized at the beginning of the license period 
the company recognizes revenues and costs associated with the production of custom films at the time of completion and acceptance by the customer 
accordingly  the timing of completion of custom films can result in substantial variability of quarterly revenues and gross margin 
the company typically realizes a smaller margin from the sale of custom films in comparison to its theatre system sales 
on may   the company acquired omni films international  inc for an aggregate of million in cash net of cash received and including acquisition costs and  shares of the common stock of the company 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method and the related goodwill of  is being amortized over years 
the operations of omni films have been consolidated with the operations of the company since the date of acquisition 
a significant portion of the company s sales are made to customers located outside of the united states  primarily in asia  canada and europe 
during fiscal  and   and of the company s revenues  respectively  were derived from sales outside of the united states 
the company expects that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of its revenues in the near future and maintains an office in hong kong to support sales to asia 
international operations and sales may be subject to political and economic risks  including political instability  currency fluctuations  changes in import export regulations  tariff and freight rates 
in addition  various forms of protectionist trade legislation have been proposed in the united states and in certain other countries 
any resulting change in current tariff structures or other trade and monetary policies could adversely affect the company s international operations 
political and economic factors have been identified by the company with respect to certain markets in which it competes 
there can be no assurance that these factors will not result in customers of the company defaulting on payments due to the company  or in the reduction of potential purchases of the company s products 
typically  sales are denominated in united states dollars and are backed by letters of credit  which reduce the risks attendant to international sales 
revenues revenues for the fiscal year ended june   and are analyzed in the following table fiscal year ended june  hardware sales service    owned and operated    film licensing    film production and other    total revenues for the fiscal years ended june   and were   and  respectively 
the increase in total revenues from to resulted from the significant increase in revenues from portable theatre events o o  a increase in film licensing and several custom film contracts for which there were no similar contracts in either or revenues in increased in all three primary revenue sources with a increase in hardware sales  a increase in owned and operated especially from foreign sources  and a increase in film and other software licensing 
historically  a majority of the iwerk s revenues have been generated by the sale of hardware which is generally considered a one time sale even though it initiates a recurring stream of film and other software license revenues thereafter 
the company s strategy to develop recurring revenues includes both film and other software licensing and owned and operated o o 
o o revenues are derived from portable theatre events  cinetropolis license and trademark fees  and revenues from a growing network of joint venture fixed location simulation theatres 
o o revenues have increased from to and from to in fiscal  these revenues include foreign source revenues from taiwan  puerto rico  argentina  and a cancellation settlement for an event in japan 
the fleet of touring ride simulation theatres grew from at the close of fiscal to early in fiscal sponsorship events during the period were primarily with one customer and are currently scheduled through the first fiscal quarter in film licensing revenues increased from to  in part because of the omni films acquisition  and increased from to because of the increase in the number of film license agreements 
theatre hardware sales decreased from to notwithstanding the million increase in hardware sales derived from the addition of the omni product line in may and increased from to on increased demand for the company s theatre systems 
revenues in fiscal were favorably affected by a single contract which accounted for approximately million and the hardware sales to cinetropolis sites in the amount of million 
no similarly large contracts occurred in fiscal other revenues have various sources including exclusivity agreements  distribution rights  forfeited deposits and settlements on canceled contracts 
cost of sales primarily includes costs of theatre systems sold  expenses associated with operating portable ride simulation theatres  and costs associated with film production and licensing fees 
the cost of theatre systems include the cost of components  customization  engineering  project management  assembly  system integration and installation 
also included are royalties payable to a former joint venture partner and estimated warranty expenses 
the costs associated with film license fees primarily reflect amortization of film production costs and royalties paid to third parties over the lives of certain films 
the cost of sales associated with operating portable ride simulation theatres include costs for personnel  depreciation  event fees  fuel  insurance and maintenance 
the company s results of operations may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of theatre system shipments  the mix of theatre system contracts  the completion of custom film sales  the amount of revenue attributable to portable ride simulation theatres and film licensing agreements 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales was  and for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
the improvement in gross profit margin from to came in spite of the million accounting charge to cost of sales reflecting a write down of certain assets  primarily film costs 
without this charge  the gross profit margin improved from in to a gross profit margin in this increase came from improved results from portable theatre events with corporate sponsorships and improved margins on higher service revenues 
the profit margin from the sale of theatre hardware improved from a gross profit margin in to in because of the additional theatre hardware sales from the omni product line 
the gross profit margin improved in to primarily because of the company s focus on hardware profit margins as well as attention to pricing and improved margins in o o particularly the portable theatre events where the margin was favorably impacted by cancellation fees associated with a canceled contract  which amounts were partially offset by costs incurred in anticipation of performance under the contract 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a include personnel costs  trade shows and other promotional expenses  sales commissions  travel expenses  public relations costs  amortization of goodwill  professional fees and divisional administrative costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses were   and  for the years ended june   and  respectively 
from to  sg a increased 
this increase resulted in part  from the acquisition of omni in may and the related additional sales and marketing costs of approximately million and acquisition related goodwill amortization of  for which there was a full year of charges 
other increased expenses include litigation costs associated with the class actions claims of million and increased bad debts of million 
the decrease in sg a from to resulted primarily from reduction in marketing and administrative costs associated with the closure of the sarasota  florida facility  and from the litigation costs and bad debt charges  for which there were no comparable charges in research development research and development costs decreased significantly during fiscal as compared to because of the substantial completion of the new product projects  namely virtual adventures and iwerks  in expenditures on research and development during decreased further as the development effort on the iwerks quatro tm projection system has been substantially completed 
the first sale of quatro tm began in fiscal and it has become the projection system of choice for smaller simulation theatres 
the company has applied for patent protection of certain features on the quatro tm and all claims have been allowed on the company s patent application 
interest income expense interest income for  and was   and  respectively 
the increase from to  as well as from to  resulted primarily from higher invested cash balances during the respective periods 
interest expense for  and of   and  resulted primarily from financing costs on the portable ride simulation theatres 
three portable units were added during and seven additional units were added near the end of the financing for the five units placed in service at the beginning of fiscal was not completed until immediately prior to the end of the fiscal year and did not impact interest expense for fiscal net income net income loss for the fiscal years ended june   and was   and  respectively 
as noted earlier  the losses incurred in fiscal resulted primarily from large research and development costs associated with virtual adventures and iwerks  higher than anticipated costs associated with the initial deliveries of these new products and the increased selling  general and administrative sg a costs associated with the cinetropolis strategy 
the loss incurred in fiscal resulted from the costs of consolidating the sarasota  florida facility to burbank  the restructuring costs  the write down of certain assets as a result of the redirection of the company s product strategy  and the costs associated with settlement of the class action lawsuit 
the net income recorded for fiscal reflects an improvement in both sales and profit margins and a reduction in sg a costs 
seasonality and fluctuating quarterly results the following tables set forth unaudited data regarding operations for each quarter of fiscal and and the percentage of the company s revenue and expenses represented by each item of the respective quarter 
this quarterly information has been prepared on the same basis as the annual consolidated financial statements and  in management s opinion  contains all normal recurring adjustments necessary to fairly state the information set forth herein 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
fiscal fiscal first second third fourth first second third fourth dollars in thousands quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter revenue         cost of sales         selling  general and administrative         research and development interest income expense  net income loss before provision for taxes      provision for taxes net income loss     percentage of annual total first second third fourth first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter revenue cost of sales selling  general and administrative research and development interest income expense  net income loss before provision for taxes provision for taxes net income loss the company s operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing of theatre system shipments  the mix of theatre system contracts  the completion of custom film contracts and the amount of revenues from portable simulation theatre and film licensing agreements 
historically  the first fiscal quarter generated the lowest quarterly revenue 
with the increase in revenues from portable theatre events  where most revenues are generated during the summer outdoor events season  this trend was broken in fiscal hardware sales will likely continue to experience inexplicable quarterly fluctuations as they are substantially dependent on the customers varying delivery and installation requirements 
over the last eight quarters  certain events have caused unusual fluctuations 
in the third quarter of fiscal  cost of sales increased dramatically as a percent of sales as a result of a one time million write down of certain assets  primarily film costs  and third and fourth quarter sg a increased as a result of restructuring charges including those related to the operational consolidation and the closure of the sarasota  florida facility and litigation costs associated with the class action lawsuit 
in fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses increased in the third quarter as performance compensation was accrued upon achieving a level of profitability  and revenues and profit margin were favorably impacted in the third quarter because of cancellation fees received in respect to a cancelled contract 
a significant portion of the company s operating expenses are relatively fixed  and planned expenditures are primarily based upon forecasts 
however  the sales cycle for the sale of a single attraction by the company typically ranges between six and nine months 
the company has little control over the timing of customer purchases 
in addition  the company has experienced significant increases in operating expenses to grow its corporate infrastructure 
liquidity and capital resources since its inception  the company has financed its operations primarily from net proceeds from the private placement of million in preferred stock  net proceeds of million from the initial public offering of common stock in fiscal  and cash flow from operations 
the company has also received cash in the amount of million for the sale of certain distribution rights 
at june   the company s principal source of liquidity included cash of million  investments in debt securities of million  and million of trade receivables 
in addition  the company had a million bank line of credit and its omni subsidiary had a million bank line of credit   under these lines were drawn down at june  in fiscal  approximately million in cash was provided by operations 
increases were primarily provided by an increase of million in net advance deposits collected on pending projects in excess of accumulated costs to date and an increase in accrued expenses of million 
offsetting these cash sources was an increase of million in trade accounts receivable reflecting a decision to accept selected project payment plans with selected terms 
the company s major investing activities in fiscal included approximately million in film  million in property  plant and equipment and million in connection with portable simulation theatres 
additional cash resources were used to pay a related party debt of million for the acquisition in may of a minority interest and an additional million for the remainder interest in iwerks touring technologies  inc from a company officer 
in fiscal  approximately million in cash was provided by operating activities  primarily from net income of million  depreciation and amortization of million  and a decrease in accounts receivable of million 
offsetting these cash sources were increases in inventories and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  and decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million 
the company s major investing activities included the purchase of debt securities and to a lessor extent the purchases for property and equipment and additions to the film library 
during fiscal  the major financing activities were the repayment of notes payable and the  proceeds from the financing of five reactors that were placed in service early in the fiscal year 
at june   the company had cash and debt securities investments of approximately million  up from approximately million at june  in addition  the company has a million bank line of credit  none of which was drawn down at june  and the company is in compliance with all material covenants required under that line of credit 
the company anticipates that its operating and investment activities in fiscal and beyond  including expected investments in o o joint ventures which could be significant  will use cash and expects that its cash balance will decline 
however  the company believes that its existing cash balances  the proceeds of the debt securities it owns as they mature  potential financing from the company s million line of credit  and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements through fiscal  after which time it may be required to raise additional cash through the sale of equity or debt securities 
in addition  to the extent the company experiences growth in the future  or its cash flow from operations is less than anticipated  the company may be required to obtain additional sources of cash 
outlook with the exception of the historical information  the matters discussed above include forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward looking statements are costs of sales and the ability of the company to manufacture and maintain pricing at a level to sustain gross profit margins  the level of selling  general and administrative costs  the performance by the company under its existing purchased and sponsorship contract and the ability to obtain new contracts  the success of the company s owned and operated strategy  the success of the company s film software  the effects of competition  and those other factors discussed above in management s discussion and analyses of financial condition and results of operations  and elsewhere in this report
