unless otherwise noted  this discussion addresses the company s continuing operations 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
all references are to fiscal year unless otherwise noted 
reorganization on january   the company s board of directors announced a reorganization designed to improve the performance and growth of the shoney s restaurant concept 
the reorganization included divestiture of certain non core lines of business including lee s famous recipe  a chain of over quick service restaurants specializing in chicken  and mike rose foods  inc  a manufacturer of dressings  sauces  condiments and various dry blend products for the foodservice industry 
the divestiture process now is completed  with the sale of lee s famous recipe closing on september  and the sale of mike rose foods  inc closing on november  these discontinued lines of business had net property  plant and equipment of million at october  and million at october   had annual revenues of million and million for the and fiscal years  respectively  and had earnings before interest and taxes of million and million for the and fiscal years  respectively 
in fiscal  these discontinued lines of business represented approximately of net property  plant and equipment  of consolidated revenues and of consolidated earnings before interest and taxes 
the discontinued lines of business were disposed of for amounts in excess of their carrying values 
certain one time charges associated with the reorganization and divestitures were accrued as they were incurred 
the sale of lee s famous recipe resulted in a gain of approximately million  net of tax 
the sale of mike rose foods  inc  which will be reflected in the company s first quarter results of operations  will result in a gain of approximately million  net of tax 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations revenues the components of the change in revenues from continuing operations during and are summarized as follows amount amount millions millions sales from restaurants opened or acquired higher sales price sales at prior year prices restaurant sales for rd week equipment and other sales manufacturing and commissary sales franchise revenues other income total comparable store sales of the company s restaurants declined before considering menu price increases of  resulting in a real decline in comparable store sales for of 
for and  comparable store sales of the company s restaurants increased and  respectively  resulting in a real decline of for and for after adjusting for menu price increases 
the company s shoney s restaurants have experienced declining comparable store sales since management believes that the declines in comparable store sales at its shoney s restaurants are the result of numerous factors including a more competitive environment  a decline in operational performance  and the cumulative negative effects of the company s delay in remodeling it s shoney s restaurants 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  one of the company s shoney s restaurants was included  along with restaurants of several other national restaurant chains  in a national television news magazine program on restaurant industry cleanliness and food handling practices 
following the airing of this program  the company s shoney s restaurants experienced significant declines in comparable store sales 
comparable store sales declines in fiscal through weeks are now less than the declines experienced in the fourth quarter of or the fiscal year 
the company has implemented a number of programs since to improve operational performance  regain market share and improve comparable store sales 
a major remodeling program was begun in late through which company owned shoney s restaurants had been remodeled by the end of during  an additional company owned shoney s restaurants will be remodeled 
management believes that the store remodeling program is one element in its overall improvement program necessary to protect market share and encourage retrial by former customers 
in  management determined that the overall quality of shoney s restaurant management needed to be significantly strengthened to achieve desired customer service levels 
during  the company implemented a targeted operational improvement program focused on the company s markets most in need of improvement 
this program included a thorough evaluation of restaurant management personnel  a thorough review of the physical condition of each restaurant  and an intensive training program which focused on restoring operational excellence in food preparation along with a significant emphasis on hospitality and customer satisfaction 
the results of these programs generally have been positive in that performance at targeted restaurants has outpaced the performance of similarly situated units that were not a part of the improvement program 
although management believes that the improvement program addresses the important operational performance issues  it currently appears that achievement of significant positive comparable store sales will take longer than originally anticipated 
significant changes in restaurant management have continued during  however  the pace of change was hampered by a very competitive labor market 
compensation  benefits  and performance based reward systems have been redesigned to better align management s incentive compensation with company objectives for achieving customer satisfaction and operational excellence 
new incentive programs reward unit level managers for improved comparable store sales and cash flow 
the company s historical bonus plans have been largely oriented toward cost controls  which can sometimes result in management decisions that are counter productive to achieving high levels of customer satisfaction 
management believes that the new incentive programs achieve a better balance between increasing revenue through customer satisfaction and profitability 
in october  the company announced a store test of an owner manager program for shoney s restaurant general managers 
in this program  general managers make an investment in their restaurant and  in return  are eligible to earn incentive compensation based on a percentage of the increase in cash flow of their restaurant 
the test program includes the elimination of one layer of supervisory management  places greater operational control and responsibility in the restaurant general manager  and places regional supervisors in a business partner consultant role to the general managers 
management believes that the new owner manager program balances the need to achieve customer satisfaction and thereby increase sales with the need to control costs and operate efficiently 
the test began in december  therefore  no meaningful results are available 
however  management believes that the success of similar manager compensation programs at other restaurant companies including sonic  outback steakhouses  harmon international  and chick fil a indicates that this type program has a high probability for success 
during  the company retained the firm of bernstein rein of kansas city as the new advertising agency for its shoney s restaurants 
in the fall of  the company announced that andy griffith would serve as the celebrity spokesperson for shoney s restaurants in a series of radio and television commercials along with related point of sale marketing materials 
customer response to the andy griffith commercials  which began in november  has been very positive and management believes this campaign will be an important element in its overall marketing strategy 
the company continues to focus its marketing efforts on building upon the strong shoney s restaurants brand and to position shoney s restaurants as the place for families to enjoy classic american food 
the following table summarizes the change in number of restaurants operated by the company and its franchisees during the most recent three fiscal years 
company owned units opened company owned units closed franchised units opened franchised units closed net increase decrease in restaurants during the fourth quarter of  the company implemented a restructuring plan which included the closure of under performing restaurants  consisting of shoney s restaurants  captain d s  and fifth quarter restaurants 
with the exception of one fifth quarter restaurant closed in the first week of november  all these restaurants were closed at the end of the fiscal year 
in addition to these restaurants  five shoney s restaurants and one captain d s had been closed earlier in resulting in restaurant closures for the year 
with respect to the units closed  the company recorded a restructuring expense of million in the fourth quarter of  principally to provide for the write down of assets to their net realizable value and the accrual of future lease costs in excess of estimated sub lease rental income 
approximately million of other restructuring expenses  consisting principally of severance for three executives displaced by the reorganization and restructuring  had been included in the restructuring expense in the first three quarters of fiscal  resulting in a total restructuring expense of million 
the revenues and loss before interest and taxes related to the units closed were million and million  respectively 
manufacturing and commissary sales declined by approximately million in the decrease in commissary and manufacturing sales was a result of the following factors a decline in the number of franchised restaurants which purchased food and supplies from the commissary  a decline in annual average purchases made by such franchisees  resulting principally from an decline in the comparable store sales of the company s franchised shoney s restaurants coupled with increased competition from alternative wholesale food distributors  and a decrease in sales by the company s meat processing facility of million  principally due to the loss of business from the company s largest franchisee  tpi enterprises tpi 
the company has formed a commissary advisory board with six franchisees elected by their peers to provide input as to how the company can better meet the needs of its franchise customers 
the company s goal is to be a low cost provider of the high quality food and supplies for each of our restaurant concepts 
the company is installing a computerized order entry system to permit customers to place weekly food and supply orders through restaurant level computers linked with the commissary central computer system 
the system will save time for restaurant managers and increase time available for customer service at the restaurants 
management believes this system will enhance efficiency at the commissary and permit savings to be shared through lower costs of food and supplies 
ultimately  improvements in commissary sales will be linked to improvements in average unit volumes of franchised restaurants as well as expansion of commissary sales to franchisees who are not customers 
the company is pursuing customers outside its franchised system for its meat processing facility 
in addition  the company is negotiating with tpi to purchase its shoney s and captain d s restaurants 
if that transaction is completed  the meat supply business for those restaurants would be shifted back to the company s meat processing facility 
if the meat processing facility s sales to tpi are not replaced  the efficiency of the company s meat processing operation will be negatively impacted  however  such amounts are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company

when compared to restaurant revenues  these revenues have a higher percentage of food costs and a lower percentage of operating expenses 
there is no restaurant labor associated with these revenues 
food costs as a percentage of revenues declined by in  principally as a result of the significant decline in commissary revenues 
food costs as a percentage of revenues was down very slightly in when compared to as higher food costs at the restaurant level primarily as the result of a new menu in the shoney s restaurants were offset by lower food costs associated with manufacturing and commissary revenues 
during  the company experienced higher costs for meat products and lower margins in its manufacturing division which contributed to the higher food costs 
restaurant labor increased as a percentage of revenues in due to increased labor hours incurred in connection with the shoney s restaurant improvement program  a decrease in commissary and manufacturing revenue which have no associated restaurant labor  and higher salaries being offered to attract and retain quality restaurant personnel 
wage rates for non tipped hourly restaurant employees have risen approximately and pay rates for restaurant management personnel have risen an average of during labor costs as a percentage of revenues have also increased because the company has not instituted sufficient menu price increases to recoup these costs as the company was striving to build customer traffic and regain market share 
the company anticipates it will implement greater menu price increases in and more in line with historical norms 
operating expenses  as a percentage of revenues  increased during as a result of a million decline in total revenues coupled with a variety of costs incurred in conjunction with the company s restructuring and the operational improvement program for shoney s restaurants

during the fourth quarter  the company completed a review of its self insured worker s compensation reserves  which included additional analyses focusing on the trend in development of prior years incurred claims 
the analyses indicated that the company s recorded reserve was below the expected range of possible future losses 
management determined that it was appropriate to strengthen the worker s compensation reserves to better reflect the likely outcome of its liability within the possible range of loss 
accordingly  at the end of the fourth quarter  the company increased its worker s compensation reserves by approximately million 
in addition  operating expenses had been favorably affected in by a million settlement of litigation against a former worker s compensation insurance carrier 
accordingly  worker s compensation expenses increased by million in compared to  as a result of these two matters 
operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased in due to higher depreciation and other costs associated with the company s remodeling program of its shoney s restaurants  which were partially offset by the settlement of a lawsuit for million against a former worker s compensation insurance carrier which reduced insurance expense 
the company anticipates continued pressure on restaurant operating margins in  until improvements in comparable store sales are achieved 
management intends to closely monitor and manage these costs to the maximum extent practical 
a summary of general and administrative expenses and interest expense as a percentage of revenues for the last three fiscal years is shown below general and administrative interest expense general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased during the increased level of general and administrative costs was principally caused by the significant restructuring of the company s management group  which included increased salary costs related to hiring new management employees as well as severance costs for certain employees displaced in the management reorganization
