the decrease in asp was the result of intense price pressure and maturation of the pentium product

over the past year the company has noted a shift in the business model of government contracts as well as lower government spending such as those experienced due to government shut downs this year

the lower spending in is the result of a return to more normal spending levels than the company had in when expenditures for legal and professional services were approximately  higher than normal  the result of activities associated with the osborne computers bankruptcy filing  and a  increase in the company s cost of directors and officers insurance 
the higher spending in of million as compared to the of costs of million includes those costs discussed immediately above and an incremental increase attributable to orchid of approximately million including  of goodwill amortization
