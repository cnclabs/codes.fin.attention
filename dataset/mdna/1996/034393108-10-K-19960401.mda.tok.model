item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview andrea electronics corporation is an end user focused  applications driven technology company 
during its six decades of operations  the company believes that it has compiled a record of audio excellence in radio  television  military communications  and most recently  telecommunications and personal computer communications 
today  the company s mission is to provide state of the art communications products for the voice interface markets that are emerging from the convergence of the telecommunications and personal computer industries 
applications that exemplify this convergence include computer telephony  speech recognition  speech over the internet with additional extensions to multimedia  voice dictation  voice interactive games and educational software 
the company believes that end users of these and other voice driven applications will require microphone and earphone products that provide high levels of voice quality  particularly  in noisy environments  for use with personal computers  business and residential telephones  military headsets  cellular and other wireless telephones  and avionics communications systems 
while no assurance can be given  the company believes that its active noise cancellation and active noise page reduction technologies will allow the company to meet the demand for such products 
the company s product development and marketing strategy seeks to leverage its own research and development resources and direct marketing and sales staff by seeking collaborative relationships with large enterprises in the personal computer  telecommunications  software publishing  and defense industry 
reflecting the implementation of this strategy  the company began to distribute its andrea anti noise registered trademark products to the personal computer and electronics retail and direct market during the second half of  executed a procurement agreement with ibm corporation in june  began a collaborative relationship with bellsouth products  inc in and entered into a licensing and technical support agreement with bellsouth in october  and began a collaborative relationship with grumman aerospace corporation subsequently acquired by northrop grumman corporation in following the expiration of the exclusivity provisions of the ibm agreement in december  the company has extended its sales and marketing efforts to include all major computer hardware and software manufacturers and providers

while the demand for its traditional intercom products by the military market has declined  the company believes that there are a significant number of military applications for its anc and anr headsets and communications systems 
a primary purpose of the company s collaborative relationship with northrop grumman is to develop products specifically for these applications 
the company believes that these new anc anr products and systems  together with other anc microphone products that are being marketed to the us military under other initiatives  can be marketed to new military customers as well as the company s traditional military customers 
the company originally had anticipated completion of the initial product qualification process under the collaborative relationship with northrop grumman during the first half of this qualification process  however  has been delayed  and although the process is continuing  no assurance can begiven that it will be completed or  if so  the approximate date of such completion
