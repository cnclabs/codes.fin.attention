item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the operating results of property and casualty insurance companies are subject to significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter and from year to year due to the effect of competition on pricing  the frequency and severity of losses  including the effect of natural disasters on losses  general economic conditions  the general regulatory environment in those states in which an insurer operates  state regulation of premium rates and other factors such as changes in tax laws 
the property and casualty industry has been highly cyclical  with periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity followed by periods of severe price competition and excess capacity 
the company did business only in the state of california until  when it began operations in georgia and illinois 
during  approximately of its direct premiums written were in california 
since november  the company s california insurance operations have been subject to the provisions of proposition  a state wide initiative passed by the california voters 
the provision of proposition that has the most significant current impact on the company is a requirement that no rate may be used by a property and casualty insurer in california after november  that has not been approved by the california insurance commissioner the commissioner 
in february  the commissioner approved new rates which were designed to improve the company s competitive position for new insureds 
these rate changes  which became effective on may   provided for decreases in premium rates for insureds new to the company or its agents 
further rate modifications were approved and made effective on october  the and rate changes have resulted in a substantial increase in new business being submitted to the company 
automobile policies in force in california have increased by approximately  to  since the new rates were first established  an annual rate of increase of over  compared with an annualized growth rate of over the prior eighteen month period 
net premiums written since july  have increased at a compounded rate of  compared with average annual premium growth of over the preceding five and one half years following passage of proposition in results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  premiums earned in increased  primarily reflecting unit growth 
average premium per policy for the year was substantially unchanged 
net premiums written in increased over a year earlier  continuing a growth trend which began in the second quarter of the loss ratio in loss and loss adjustment expenses related to premiums earned was  compared with in in contrast to the previous several years  the and loss ratios reflect smaller contributions from favorable loss reserve development from prior periods 
the expense ratio policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses related to premiums earned was  compared with in the improvement reflects both economies related to greater premium volume and smaller provisions for agent and employee incentive bonuses in total losses and expenses  excluding interest expense of million  were million  resulting in an underwriting gain for the period of million  compared with an underwriting gain of million in investment income in was million  compared with million in the after tax yield on average investments of million fixed maturities at cost  equities at market was  compared with on average investments of million in the effective tax rate on investment income was in  compared with in the slightly higher tax rate reflects an increase in the proportion of investment income derived from dividend income on equities  principally perpetual preferred stocks  compared to tax exempt income 
the maintenance of above average yields during a period of declining interest rates is  in part  the result of the bond restructuring program undertaken in when bonds acquired in lower interest rate environments were sold with proceeds reinvested at significantly higher rates 
the redemption of bonds acquired during higher interest periods has been a negative influence on realized yields which will continue in and bonds matured and called in totaled million  compared with million in  and approximately million of calls and maturities are expected in average yields being obtained during the first quarter of on new investments are some basis points lower than the average portfolio yield 
realized investment gains in were million  compared with realized losses of million in the losses reflect principally yield enhancing swaps of both fixed maturities and equity securities  including perpetual preferred stocks  undertaken to recapture capital gains taxes paid in prior years 
the gains arose in part from the early redemption of fixed maturity investments 
the income tax provision of million in represented an effective tax rate of  compared with an effective rate of  in the increase in the rate is attributable principally to the realization of capital gains in  in contrast to the realization of losses in net income in was million  or per share  compared with million  or per share  in per share results are based on million average shares in both years 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  premiums earned in increased  reflecting unit growth 
average premium per policy was substantially unchanged by the may  rate revisions 
direct premiums written in the first half of increased over a year earlier  continuing the growth trend which began in the second quarter of during the last half of  this increase accelerated to over the prior year as a result of the may  rate revisions 
the loss ratio in was  compared with in the higher loss ratio in reflects a much smaller contribution from favorable loss reserve development from prior periods and a reduction in the estimate of salvage and subrogation recoverable for prior accident years 
the major earthquake which struck southern california on january  resulted in net loss claims  after reinsurance recoveries  of approximately million  which added less than to the loss ratio 
earthquake losses were immaterial as the company writes only a small amount of homeowners insurance 
approximately one half of the net earthquake losses incurred were related to the company s principal line  automobile insurance  while the other half was related to the homeowners line 
the expense ratio policy acquisition costs and other expenses related to premiums earned was  compared with in total losses and expenses  excluding interest expense of  were million  resulting in an underwriting gain for the period of million  compared with an underwriting gain of million in investment income in was million  compared with million in the after tax yield on average investments of million fixed maturities at cost  equities at market was  compared with on average investments of million in the effective tax rate on investment income was in  compared with in  reflecting an increase in the proportion of tax exempt interest income 
the decline in realized investment yields reflects principally the redemption and maturity of bonds and preferred stocks acquired in higher interest rate environments 
realized investment losses in were million  compared with realized gains of million in the losses reflect principally yield enhancing swaps of both fixed maturities and equity securities  including perpetual preferred stocks 
the gains arose in significant part from the redemption of fixed maturity investments 
the realized capital losses were undertaken to recapture capital gains taxes paid in prior years 
the income tax provision of million in represented an effective tax rate of  compared with an effective rate of  in the decrease in the rate is attributable principally to the decrease in fully taxable underwriting income  and the resulting higher proportion of tax exempt investment income 
net income in was million  or per share  compared with million  or per share  in per share results are based on million average shares in and million average shares in year ended december  compared to year ended december  premiums earned in increased 
the year to year increase in the final quarter was  following sequential quarterly increases decreases of  and 
premiums written in increased  with the quarterly pattern increasing sequentially throughout the year 
this improvement largely reflects new business submitted by newly appointed agents who had previously represented other insurers which had withdrawn from the california market 
premium rates were unchanged from a year earlier 
the loss ratio in was  compared with in the ratio was computed without adjustment for the impact of the proposition rate refund provision 
the historically low loss ratios in both years reflect  principally  the seasoned characteristics of the company s existing book of business and the continued favorable loss severity trends in the automobile bodily injury line in california 
reduced exposure to unprofitable assigned risk business contributed to the improvement  as did continued favorable loss reserve development 
the more competitive rates which will apply to new business effective on may  are expected to produce an increase in the proportion of new  unseasoned risks insured by the company 
loss experience on new business is characteristically less favorable than that of seasoned business 
the expense ratio policy acquisition costs and other expenses related to premiums earned was in  compared with in the expense ratio has remained at or below in each of the last five years 
total losses and expenses  excluding interest expense of  were million  resulting in an underwriting gain for the year of million  or of premiums earned  compared with an underwriting gain of million in  or of premiums earned in the latter result excludes a provision of million for rate refunds relating to the proposition rate rollback mandate 
the rollback issue was resolved in may by a negotiated settlement reached with the california department of insurance doi 
refunds were completed in august  fully extinguishing the company s proposition rollback liability 
net investment income in was million  compared with million in average invested assets in fixed maturities at cost equities at market were million  a year to year increase of 
reflecting the declining trends in interest rates in  the average pre tax yield for the period was in and in the effective tax rate on investment income was in and in the year to year decrease of approximately basis points in the overall portfolio yield was significantly related to the maturity and call of approximately million of relatively high coupon fixed maturity investments acquired in prior higher interest rate environments 
realized investment gains were million in and million in the gains arose in significant part from calls of fixed maturity investments 
sales of equity securities in  particularly in the fourth quarter  produced losses of million  partially offsetting the taxable gains generated by the early call of fixed maturity investments 
income before taxes was million  compared with million in the provision for final settlement of the proposition refund obligation in reduced income before income taxes by million 
the income tax provision in was million  an effective tax rate of  compared with a tax provision of million  an effective rate of  in the corresponding period 
excluding the impact of the rate refund in  the effective tax rate in was 
the effective tax rate is lower than the statutory corporate rate  in and in  because a substantial part of net investment income is derived from tax exempt bonds and dividends entitled to the corporate dividend exclusion 
except for the increase in the corporate statutory tax rate to from  effective as of january   the impact of the omnibus tax reconciliation act of was insignificant 
net income in was million  or per share  compared with million  or per share  in per share results are based on million average shares in and million shares in the provision for final settlement of rate refunds in the period reduced net income by million  or 
per share 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided from operating activities in was million  while funds derived from the sale  redemption or maturity of investments was million  of which approximately was represented by the sale of equity securities 
the amortized cost of fixed maturity investments increased by million during the year 
equity investments  including perpetual preferred stocks  increased by million at cost  and short term cash investments increased by million 
the amortized cost of fixed maturities available for sale that were sold  called or matured during the year was million 
the market value of all investments fixed maturities and equity securities held at market as available for sale exceeded the amortized cost of million at december  by million 
that unrealized gain  reflected in shareholders equity net of applicable tax effects  was million at december  compared with an unrealized loss of million at december  the increase in market values since december  reflects principally the substantial decline in intermediate and long term interest rates which occurred during the period 
the company s cash and short term investments totaled million at december  together with funds generated internally  such liquid assets are more than adequate to pay claims without the sale of investments 
traditionally  it has been the company s policy not to invest in high yield or junk bonds 
in  the company adopted a policy to place a small proportion of its investments in the taxable sector in bonds rated lower than investment grade  but not lower than ba by moody s or bb by standard poor s 
at december  bond holdings rated below investment grade totaled million at market cost million  or of total investments 
all but million of such holdings were downgraded to their current ratings subsequent to purchase 
the average rating of the million bond portfolio at amortized cost was a  while the average effective maturity  giving effect to anticipated early call  approximates years 
the modified duration of the bond portfolio at year end was years  reflecting the heavy weighting of high coupon issues  including housing issues subject to sinking funds and other issues which are pre refunded or are expected to be called prior to their maturities 
duration measures the length of time it takes to receive all the cash flows produced by a bond  including reinvestment of interest 
because it measures four factors maturity  coupon rate  yield and call terms which determine sensitivity to changes in interest rates  modified duration is a much better indicator of price volatility than simple maturity alone 
bond holdings are broadly diversified geographically  and  within the tax exempt sector  consist largely of high coupon revenue issues  many of which have been pre refunded and escrowed with us treasuries 
general obligation bonds of the large eastern cities have generally been avoided 
the company holds no direct obligations of orange county  california  which has filed for protection under the bankruptcy laws 
the company does  however  hold million principal amount of bonds issued by entities within orange county  some of which may be affected by losses arising from participation in the orange county investment pool 
exclusive of those bonds that have been either insured or pre refunded with us treasuries  the company s total holdings of issues affected by investments in the orange county pool approximates million based on market value at december  the company has reviewed those holdings and believes that it will incur no losses as a result of the orange county bankruptcy filing 
holdings in the taxable sector consist principally of senior public utility issues 
fixed maturity investments of million at amortized cost include million of sinking fund preferreds  principally utility issues 
included in the sinking fund preferred holdings are two investment grade utility issues which are held in trust and structured as inverse floaters  dividends on which vary inversely to short term interest rates 
the aggregate market value and cost of those holdings was million and million  respectively  at december  the year end yield at market on those holdings approximated 
the only other securities which may be considered derivatives are a small amount of adjustable rate preferred stocks 
except for company occupied buildings  the company has no direct investments in real estate and no holdings of mortgages secured by commercial real estate 
equity holdings of million at market cost million  including perpetual preferred issues  are largely confined to the public utility and banking sectors and represent about of total shareholders equity 
the only significant debt of the company at december   was a three year revolving credit agreement covering two bank loans totalling  dated december  the proceeds of the loans were used to repay a prior  loan  and to contribute  to the company s insurance subsidiaries 
the agreement renews annually  at which time it may be extended for an additional year to maintain the three year maturity date 
the interest cost of the loans is variable and related to libor london interbank rate 
based on the rate effective march through september   the net interest cost of the loans approximates 
the company expects that the revolving loans will be renewed and extended to with no difficulty 
the loans may be repaid in whole or in part with no penalty 
the source of any repayments are expected to be derived from dividends from the company s insurance subsidiaries or other external financing 
in march  the company s employee stock ownership plan the plan purchased  shares of mercury s common stock in the open market at a price of per share 
the purchases were funded by a million bank loan to the plan which is guaranteed by the company 
the shares are being allocated to employees over a five year period  with the initial allocation made in december  and the debt is being retired by company contributions to the plan over the same time period 
since dividends on unallocated shares held by the plan are tax deductible if they are used for debt service  as are company contributions to the plan  the net  after tax interest cost to the company for the borrowed funds used for the plan stock purchase is less than the nominal fixed rate of interest on the loan 
in december  the naic adopted a risk based capital formula for casualty insurance companies which establishes recommended minimum capital requirements for casualty companies 
the formula has been designed to capture the widely varying elements of risks undertaken by writers of different lines of insurance having differing risk characteristics  as well as writers of similar lines where differences in risk may be related to corporate structure  investment policies  reinsurance arrangements and a number of other factors 
the company has estimated the risk based capital requirements of each of its insurance subsidiaries as of december  each of the companies policyholders surplus exceeded the highest level of recommended capital requirements 
as of december   the company had no commitments for capital expenditures 
industry and regulatory guidelines suggest that the ratio of a property and casualty insurer s annual net premiums written to statutory policyholders surplus should not exceed to based on the combined surplus of all of the licensed insurance subsidiaries of million at december   and net written premiums for the twelve months ended on that date of million  the ratio of writings to surplus was approximately to supplementary data summarized quarterly financial data for and is as follows in thousands except per share data quarter ended march june sept
