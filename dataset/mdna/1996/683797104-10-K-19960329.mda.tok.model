the securities industry is highly competitive and sensitive to many factors and is directly affected by general economic and market conditions  including the volatility and price level of securities markets  the volume  size  and timing of securities transactions  the demand for investment banking services and changes in interest rates  all of which have an impact on commissions  trading and investment income as well as on liquidity 
in addition  a significant portion of the company s expenses are relatively fixed and do not vary with market activity 
consequently  substantial fluctuations can occur in the company s revenues and net income from period to period due to these and other factors 
the company anticipates increasing competition from commercial banks and thrift institutions as these institutions begin to offer investment banking and financial services traditionally only provided by securities firms 
the company also anticipates increasing regulation in the securities industry  making compliance with regulations more difficult and costly 
at present  the company is unable to predict the extent of changes that may be enacted  or the effect on the company s business 
the company s long term plan is to continue to grow existing offices by hiring experienced professionals  thus maximizing the potential of currently leased space 
equally important is the search for viable candidates for acquisition 
as opportunities are presented  it is the intention of the company to pursue growth by acquisition where a comfortable match can be found in terms of corporate goals and personnel and at a price that would provide the company s shareholders with value 
results of operations due to the reduction in long term us interest rates early in fiscal and strong improvement in corporate earnings in compared to  financial markets began a strong recovery from the weakness experienced in this reversal of interest rate trends and the continuing downward drift of rates during set the stage for increasingly strong markets in  particularly in equities and mutual funds 
the lowering of rates spurred consumer confidence and spending and created record volumes in equity markets 
in addition  improved spreads between the amount charged customers on outstanding balances and the company s average cost of funds resulted in substantially higher levels of interest profit

retail commission volume contracted as wary investors refrained from making commitments while they attempted to gauge market direction

liquidity and capital resources the increase in the company s financial assets during the last three years has been primarily the result of the expansion in its business and the growth in earnings 
customer related receivables and securities inventory are highly liquid and represent a substantial percentage of total assets 
the principal sources of financing the company s assets are stockholders equity  customer free credit balances  proceeds from securities lending  bank loans and other payables 
during this period  the company has not utilized long term financing 
cash generated from operations  increased earnings  proceeds from stock purchased by employee stock plans  and cash proceeds upon the exercise of employee stock options supplemented bank borrowings during the past three years 
at december   fahnestock had bank lines of credit and call loan arrangements with outstanding borrowings thereunder of the company paid cash dividends to its shareholders totalling  on february  from internally generated cash 
because of the company s strong financial condition  size and earnings history  management believes adequate sources of credit would be available to finance higher trading volumes  branch expansion  and major capital expenditures  as needed 
inflation because the assets of the company s brokerage subsidiaries are largely liquid  and because securities inventories are carried at current market values  the impact of inflation generally is reflected in the financial statements 
however  the rate of inflation affects the company s costs relating to employee compensation  rent  communications and certain other operating costs  and such costs may not be recoverable in the price of commissions charged 
to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets  it may adversely affect the company s financial position and results of operations
