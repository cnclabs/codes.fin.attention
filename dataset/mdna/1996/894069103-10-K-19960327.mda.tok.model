item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation financial highlights overview transworld bancorp had the highest yearly earnings in its history during earnings were up  or over  also a record year  with increasing over the positive earnings trend has occurred despite a southern california economy that is still recovering from the recession 
return on average equity was  up from in and in the company declared a for stock split that was paid march  adjusting for the split  the per share price increased by approximately from december to december the board of directors also declared a for stock split on january  this ninth stock dividend in the past nine years was paid on march  to shareholders of record on february  all of the per share figures in this report have been adjusted for both of these stock splits 
loans and leases outstanding increased by  or  reversing a trend of declining loan totals during this last recessionary period 
the increase in loans helped improve net interest income  as did interest earned on the investment portfolio  the two primary factors behind the increase in net income 
s return on average assets improved to compared to in and in results of operations net interest income net interest income increased for the second year in a row  rising by  or  over net interest income for was up over which in turn was up over the increase came from a shift to higher yielding earning assets as well as increased yields across all earning asset categories 
the increase in net interest income in came from improved yields on earning assets as well as growth in total earning assets 
the net interest margin on earning assets was in compared with in and in interest and fees on loans improved by  or  over due to improved yields  versus growth of only  or in prime rate increases in the fourth quarter of and again in february of increased loan yield  but were partially offset by the prime rate reduction in june of and again in december of the latest reductions in prime rate will have a negative impact on yields which optimally will be offset by increasing the loans outstanding 
interest earned on the investment portfolio on a fully taxable equivalent basis grew by  or compared to growth in and growth in the improved results were due to both an increase in the average level of the securities portfolio and an increase in the portfolio yield from in to in the portfolio yield increased because rates available in the bond market were up and we were able to use our liquidity to invest in securities 
we were also able to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued take advantage of the rising rate environment by investing cash from maturing securities 
maintaining yield without lengthening maturities or increasing risk is our primary investment objective in interest expense increased during by  or  compared to an increase of in and a decrease of in the increase by the federal reserve board in interest rates during and the beginning of substantially affected the overall cost of funds which increased from in to in  reversing the decrease from in to in this increase in the cost of liabilities was split mainly between interest paid on deposits which was up  and interest paid on securities sold under agreements to repurchase which increased  the increase in interest on repurchase agreements came from the movement of an average million of deposits into repurchase agreements by a large national customer in the first quarter of this company eventually moved their deposits of approximately million and their repurchase agreements to a large financial institution with national capabilities in the beginning of the fourth quarter of provision for credit losses the credit loss provision charged to expense for was  a decrease from the  provided for and the  provided in the company was able to reduce its expense provision because of a reduction in net charge offs which declined to  for compared to  in and  in 
the balance in the reserve for loan losses has continued to increase over the same time from  in to  in the company s credit risk analysis indicates that its current level of reserves is adequate to cover any current known risks in the portfolio 
the current level of reserve to outstanding loans at year end was 
the southern california economy showed modest improvement in the second half of we anticipate this will continue through and  as a result  do not currently anticipate any material credit erosion in the loan portfolio 
non performing loans at the end of dropped to  or of outstanding loans and leases compared to  or of outstanding loans and leases at the end of the company underwent examinations by the california state banking department in and the federal deposit insurance corporation as of december   both of which management deemed satisfactory 
noninterest income noninterest income increased by  or over  reversing a decline in noninterest income from to the decline in was due to sale of the bankcard merchant processing unit in late the company continues to receive income from bankcard merchant servicing but at a smaller  net of expenses basis from the outsourcing provider 
service charges on deposit accounts increased by  or  after decreasing in increased sales of cash management products modestly helped to securities that had been purchased at discounts 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued other operating income showed the best improvement in the noninterest income category during  rising  or  from the improvement was generated by the small business administration sba department during its second full year of operation 
loan servicing income increased by  while fees taken into income from the sale of sba loans increased from  in to  in and to  in with the temporary shutdown of the small business administration in washington in late  income generation from our sba department for the first quarter of will be significantly reduced 
noninterest expense the company was able to control noninterest expenses in  keeping the overall increase to over and over the addition of a new  full service branch in the second quarter of was the reason we were not able to decrease expenses below levels 
as has been pointed out in prior reports  the first quarter of was affected by the northridge earthquake which accounted for approximately  in one time building repair expenses 
the larger than normal increase in salaries and employee benefits can be attributed to the new office in camarillo  california 
occupancy expenses declined by and were not affected by the new office because no lease payments were due until furniture  fixtures and equipment expenses increased due to the costs of outfitting the new office  while depreciation costs increased for new computer and atm equipment in other offices 
the company will continue to upgrade and replace old computer and atm equipment in other offices during both occupancy and furniture  fixtures and equipment expense will be impacted in with the relocation of the san fernando branch office 
this lease expires in april and the company is moving from an office we have occupied for years to new  larger quarters about three blocks away 
rental expenses will be comparable with the old office but leasehold and equipment expense will be increased due to the relocation 
the company lost its north hollywood branch office to a fire in october  which destroyed the interior of the office and all its contents 
the exterior structure was also severely damaged 
no employees or customers were hurt as the fire occurred on a weekend 
we were able to immediately reestablish operations and relocated in a trailer while we began the process of rebuilding the office 
the damage  and the additional expenses incurred  are completely covered by insurance and the company will suffer no financial loss from the fire 
deposit and loan totals have not been impacted 
fdic insurance costs declined substantially from the levels of and the reduction is due to a rate reduction by the fdic because of the bank insurance fund bif reaching its level of of deposits sooner than expected 
the expense for could be minimal if congress does not assess banks to replenish the savings and loan insurance fund saif 
if they do  the cost will be higher 
data processing costs increased due to volume changes in the cash management services and services we purchase item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued from third party vendors 
increases in other operating expenses are due to normal volume growth and increased pricing on other outside services used by the company 
assets and liabilities it was pointed out last year that one of our primary objectives for was to increase the size of the loan portfolio 
the growth achieved was below our expectations 
loan activity did not pick up until the fourth quarter of the year 
positively  unfunded lines of credit increased to  at december  compared to  at the end of which should manifest in borrowings when loan demand increases 
based on current conditions we believe commercial customers will increase use of their lines of credit in we also anticipate adding to the investment portfolio during  primarily in us agency securities in the one to five year range 
federal funds sold should remain approximately of assets 
cash and due from banks decreased both at year end and in average balances for the year 
the company has been able to reduce float  and the average reserve requirement has decreased with the closure of the large deposit account referred to earlier 
although noninterest bearing deposits decreased somewhat at year end  the average outstanding balance for the year was up  over the average outstanding for while interest bearing deposits decreased at year end by the average for the year decreased only 
the mix of deposits changed in as customers moved money from checking and savings and lower yielding money market accounts into certificates of deposit 
this raised our interest costs during  but since most of these certificates carried maturities of less than one year  current renewal costs are substantially lower on these cd s 
other real estate owned ore decreased substantially in  falling from  to  at december   primarily as a result of the sale of one large piece of ore totaling  in march of with the economy improving the company is not anticipating ore to increase noticeably in equity capital improved by  or  during  as a result of an increase in retained earnings and the exercise of employee stock options totaling  the unrealized gain loss on securities available for sale also improved from a  loss at december  to a  gain at december  these items increased the book value of our common stock from an adjusted at year end to at year end item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued liquidity and capital asset liability management the policy our asset liability committee uses to maintain and monitor the company s sensitivity to changing rates has worked well in helping the company s profitability in light of the fluctuations in interest rates  deposits  and borrowed funds 
the company uses gap analysis to measure interest rate risk in terms of the mismatch between the stated repricing and maturities of the company s earning assets and liabilities within defined time frames 
the company s cumulative one year gap position at december  was  or of earning assets as seen in the interest rate sensitivity table 
this means that the company is asset sensitive and that an increase in interest rates will cause earnings to increase as a larger portion of assets than liabilities reprice in additionally  the company is more sensitive to decreases in interest rates  thus earnings would be impacted if interest rates continue to drop in interest rate sensitivity immediately in thousands adjustable months months months years years assets securities      fed funds sold  loans      total earning assets       sources interest bearing deposits      short term borrowings  long term debt demand deposits  securities sold under agreement to repurchase   total sources       incremental gap       percent of earning assets cumulative gap      percent of earning assets immediately adjustable loans are defined as loans that are tied to the prime rate or other indexes which can change at any time 
immediately adjustable deposits are those where the company can adjust the rate without prior notice 
the company uses adjustable deposits to fund adjustable rate loans 
the remaining assets and liabilities are categorized by either the next time the asset or liability may be repriced item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued or the maturity date  whichever is sooner 
the company does not use off balance sheet interest rate instruments to hedge interest rate risk 
liquidity management liquidity refers to the company s ability to maintain cash flow sufficient to meet the cash needs of depositors and borrowers and to fund its operations 
the company continues to have a stable  low cost base of core deposits generated from our eleven office branch system 
in reviewing the statement of cash flows for we find that operating activities generated  in cash for compared to the  generated in cash flows from investing activities showed that the company used a portion of its excess cash funds to increase yield by investing a greater portion of balance sheet assets in loans and securities 
high levels of cash and cash equivalents were being maintained during and because of the highly volatile deposit balances from the previously mentioned large national deposit account that left in late these liquid instruments have been reduced to a lower level of  at year end reflecting the current liquidity needs of the company 
liquidity remains strong  and gives the company more than adequate funds to increase the loan portfolio during capital the company s capital position materially strengthened in the risk based capital ratio at the end of improved to  up from at december   well above the minimum risk based capital ratio required by the fdic and federal reserve bank of 
the company improved its tier i ratio to at december  compared to in the leverage ratio which measures equity capital as a percent of total assets was at december  compared to at december  the fdic definition for a well capitalized bank requires a total risk based capital ratio equal to  or greater than   a tier i risk based ratio equal to  or greater than  and a tier i leverage ratio equal to  or greater than  
your company exceeds all of the above requirements 
the company will continue to use earnings as the main source of additional capital in and sees no problems in maintaining proper capital ratios
