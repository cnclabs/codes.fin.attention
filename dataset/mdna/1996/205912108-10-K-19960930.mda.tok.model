this growth in fiscal was negatively impacted due to violations of the company s revenue recognition policies that occurred in the company s international business as described below 
total revenue increased in fiscal compared with fiscal principally due to the increase in client server software license revenue  which reflected the release of the company s new products during fiscal and the last half of fiscal software license revenue software license revenue increased in fiscal compared with fiscal this growth in software license revenue primarily reflected the strong demand for the company s eis products  which include commander decision and commander olap  its predecessor 
in the eis market  software license revenue grew in fiscal compared with the prior year 
in fiscal  software license revenue was flat for the company s financial reporting and retail decision support products principally due to the transitional changes experienced as a result of reorganizing the sales and marketing organizations and aligning them by specific industry markets

client server software maintenance revenue increased in fiscal compared with fiscal due to the growth in client server software licenses  partially offset by the conversion of certain agents to distributors 
the conversion of certain agents to distributors impacted the comparability of software maintenance revenue in fiscal and fiscal when an agent converts to a distributor  sales are made directly to the distributor rather than the end user  and the distributor assumes the obligation of providing maintenance 
in addition  the revenue from distributors is recognized net of fees which fees are approximately the same as agent fees  but unlike agent fees  are not recorded as selling expenses  and revenue from agents is recognized before deducting their fees 
as a result  the conversion of agents to distributors reduced reported software maintenance revenue in fiscal  without a material impact on operating profits

cost of revenue and support expense increased in fiscal and in fiscal principally due to increased royalty fees payable to arbor software corporation as a result of increased software license revenue from certain comshare products which use arbor s essbase  and higher employee related costs and outside consulting fees related to the growth in implementation and consulting services revenue 
internal research and product development expense in fiscal was relatively flat compared with fiscal due to the size of the development staff remaining relatively unchanged since july and the increased use of third party software tools in comshare products  the royalty fees for which are classified as cost of revenue and support

general and administrative expense increased in fiscal  compared with fiscal  after excluding the million gain on the sale of undeveloped land which was included in general and administrative expense in fiscal general and administrative employee expenses related to relocation  travel and incentives contributed to the increase in fiscal total costs and expenses for the fiscal year ended june  included a million non cash charge to write off certain capitalized software 
the write off was a result of strong customer interest in the company s newest generation product  commander decision  for customizable decision support applications  which substantially reduced the realizable value of the company s older desktop products 
the write off also reflected the reduction of the estimated useful service life of the company s products and the amortization period of its capitalized software costs  prompted by the company s acceleration of its product development cycles in response to changes in the technological environment in the decision support applications market 
an unusual charge of million was recorded in fiscal  due to the non cash write off of capitalized software associated with the company s mainframe products 
the write off was the result of the company s fiscal product plans to focus primarily on desktop and client server software and the decreased industry emphasis on mainframe decision support software products 
in addition  the company implemented a marketing strategy to migrate its existing clients using mature mainframe products to its new client server products 
the above factors would reduce the future revenue from mainframe software  and as a result the company wrote off the remaining capitalized mainframe software
