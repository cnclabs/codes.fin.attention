effects of inflation the major sources of revenue for the company  ie  adviser fees  administrative fees and distribution plan payments  are calculated as percentages of assets under management 
if  as a result of inflation  expenses rise and assets under management decline  lower fee income and higher expenses will reduce or eliminate profits 
if expenses rise and assets rise  bringing increased fees to offset the increased expenses  profits may not be affected by inflation

if inflation leads to increases in the price of gold or in the price of real estate  the value of the company s investments in precious metal properties or real estate may be increased
