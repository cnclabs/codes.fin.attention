the  increase in interest expense for fiscal is attributable to an increasing balance of inventory purchased under the company s various floor plan lines of credit to stock the new outlets  an increase in inventory dedicated to rental from approximately  in fiscal to more than  in fiscal  as well as changes in floor plan terms by case 
effective january   case changed factory to dealer terms in a program they have named focus 
while interest free floor plan terms for case s most expensive units wheel loaders and excavators remains at six to eight months  the terms on case s smaller units were shortened from six months to four months interest free 
for the first time  case is also granting a cash discount if the dealer pays for the machine outright rather than utilizing the interest free floor planning 
the company was able to take advantage of the cash discounts for some of its purchases in fiscal  which had an immediate effect on interest expense 
the ii interest free floor planning period was not utilized  however 
nevertheless  management believes that the positive impact of the discounted cost as these units are sold will more than offset the increased interest expense

selling  general and administrative expenses were  or percent of sales for fiscal compared to  or percent of sales for fiscal the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales reflects the spreading of fixed overhead costs over an increased revenue base which was partially offset by  in certain one time administrative costs associated with the integration of the sparks  nevada and hayward  california outlets 
the  increase in interest expense for fiscal is attributable to an increasing balance of inventory purchased under the company s various floor plan lines of credit to stock our new outlets  and to increasing interest rates in general 
fiscal year  as compared with fiscal year the company reported sales of  for fiscal which was an increase of approximately  or percent over net sales of  for the nine month period ended july  this substantial increase in revenues resulted from a generally good economy  low interest rates  an increase in housing starts and three more months of operations than were included in fiscal revenues

cost of goods sold was approximately percent of net sales during the fiscal year  which is consistent with the prior fiscal year 
management s efforts to use its purchasing power to negotiate better prices and terms for parts  reduce or eliminate customer discounts  and other management initiatives were offset by lower margins on new equipment sales  resulting from the company s stated goal of achieving increased market share 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from percent of net sales in fiscal to percent of net sales in fiscal as variable administrative expenses increased at a slower rate than revenues 
interest expense for fiscal was  compared to  on an annualized basis for fiscal year this increase in interest expense reflects the expiration in fiscal of the interest free terms granted by case in connection with the acquisition of the seven stores  as well as the higher inventory levels and floor plan debt required to support the increase in net sales
