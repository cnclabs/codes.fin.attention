item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial information  the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other information included elsewhere in this form k 
the company s fiscal year ends on april fiscal years are identified according to the calendar year in which they end 
for example  the fiscal year ended april  is referred to as fiscal overview the company is engaged in a single line of business  the retail sale of residential furniture  and the company s revenues are principally derived from such sales 
the company also has a proprietary credit card program which is operated to promote its furniture business 
in april  after significantly revising its credit card program and appointing a new outside service provider  the company launched the seaman s plus r credit card as an integral part of its furniture business 
for fiscal  net finance charge income from the company s credit card operations represented of net sales 
the company s most significant category of operating expenses is the cost of sales  which includes the cost of goods sold  warehousing  distribution and delivery net of delivery charges to customers expenses  rent and depreciation for the stores and buying staff expenses  including payroll 
the category of selling  general and administrative expenses is the other significant element in the company s cost structure 
they include store excluding rent and depreciation expenses  advertising  corporate administration excluding buying staff expenses and the costs of the credit card program  including write offs 
the company imports a substantial amount of merchandise directly from foreign suppliers 
imported merchandise represented approximately to of the company s cost of goods sold during the periods discussed hereinafter 
the company pays for all of such imported merchandise in us dollars based on us dollar prices fixed at the time of the company s order 
the company does not issue open purchase orders as to price and therefore does not bear foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk in connection with such import purchases  that risk is borne by the company s suppliers 
while foreign currency exchange rates affect the us dollar prices that suppliers quote to the company  the company is not obligated to purchase merchandise if a supplier seeks to increase the price established at the time of the company s order 
the company is able to purchase replacement merchandise from both domestic and foreign suppliers 
in connection with the lbo in february  the company incurred debt of approximately million  which influenced both strategic and day to day management decisions 
the company then experienced a considerable  unanticipated decline in sales volume  operating income and liquidity in the years through due  inter alia  to changes in business philosophy including  for example  reducing retail gross margin  de emphasizing the package r concept and expanding seaman s emphasis on sales events in its advertising and the debt burden that resulted from the lbo 
the company s situation was exacerbated by a significant economic recession that was especially severe in the northeastern united states 
although the lbo debt was restructured in november  in december the company was facing possible cross defaults under its senior and subordinated debt obligations and  in january  filed for chapter bankruptcy protection 
see business lbo and subsequent reorganization 
shortly after filing for bankruptcy protection  the company closed of its then stores 
the company emerged from chapter proceedings in october with its outstanding indebtedness having been reduced from approximately million to approximately million 
as part of its chapter proceedings  the company also adopted fresh start reporting 
current senior management of the company was appointed by the board of directors immediately following the company s emergence from chapter results of operations fiscal year ended april  compared to fiscal year ended april  net sales for fiscal of million increased by million or compared to net sales for fiscal year the increase resulted from the opening of nine new stores commencing in september comparable store sales for fiscal were million  a decrease of million or compared to comparable store sales of million for fiscal management believes that this decrease is primarily attributable to the weak sales environment in the furniture industry and severe winter weather conditions in the company s markets 
net finance charge income of million for fiscal increased by million or from fiscal  primarily due to an increase in the average accounts receivable balance in fiscal compared to fiscal since the company instituted the seaman s plus r credit card in april  proprietary credit sales grew from of total sales in fiscal to in fiscal and have more recently leveled off at in fiscal as a result of the foregoing increases  total revenues for fiscal were million  an increase of million or over the comparable prior year period 
cost of sales increased by million or between the two periods  principally due to the increase in net sales  the opening of nine new stores and a warehouse  and decreased gross margins due to the competitive retail environment 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million or between the two periods  principally due to the opening of nine stores and an increase in the allowance for bad debts due to the higher customer accounts receivable balance 
the company also incurred increased advertising expenses due to its entrance into a new market 
as a result of the foregoing  income from operations was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal net interest expense of  for fiscal decreased from million in fiscal due to increased interest income attributed to higher cash balances 
the company s interest expense primarily consists of interest on its capital leases and on the mortgage it holds for its islip warehouse 
the provision for income taxes for fiscal is based upon an effective income tax rate of 
as of april   the company had a long term deferred tax asset of million and a current deferred tax asset of million 
the long term deferred tax asset is primarily related to net operating losses 
there are limitations on the time periods during which these deferred tax assets can be used and on the amounts that the company can use each year 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the foregoing  the company s net income for fiscal was million compared to net income of million for fiscal fiscal year ended april  compared to fiscal year ended april  net sales for fiscal of million increased by million or compared to net sales for fiscal year of such increase  million resulted from the opening of five new stores commencing in september and the balance was primarily attributable to the implementation of new management strategies  including a redirected advertising focus and an increased emphasis on the company s credit card operations  including the implementation of the seaman s plus r credit card 
comparable store sales for fiscal were million  an increase of million or compared to comparable store sales of million for fiscal management believes that this increase is primarily attributable to the redirected advertising focus  customer acceptance of the seaman s plus r credit card  the ongoing store redesign and renovation program and the use of a broadened merchandise mix in the company s stores 
finance charge income of million for fiscal increased by million or from fiscal  primarily due to an increase in sales made on the seaman s plus r credit card of million in fiscal compared to fiscal sales made on the seaman s plus r credit card increased to approximately of net sales in fiscal from approximately of net sales in fiscal as a result of the foregoing increases  total revenues for fiscal were million  an increase of million or over the comparable prior year period 
cost of sales increased by million or between the two periods  principally due to the increase in net sales  but decreased as a percentage of net sales from for fiscal to for fiscal the decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the company s operating leverage  which supported the increase in net sales without corresponding increases in fixed operating costs in particular  warehousing expenses  and an improvement in retail gross margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million or between the two periods  principally due to the opening of five stores and an increase in the allowance for bad debts due to the higher customer accounts receivable balance 
as a percentage of net sales  however  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal the decrease as a percentage of net sales was principally due to operating leverage  in particular with respect to advertising and corporate administration expenses 
additionally  the company maintained cost controls while continuing to increase its net sales volume 
as a result of the foregoing  income from operations improved to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal net interest expense of million for fiscal remained constant as compared to fiscal the company s interest expense primarily consists of interest on its capital leases and on the mortgage it holds for its islip warehouse 
the provision for income taxes for fiscal  is based upon an effective income tax rate of 
as of april   the company had a long term deferred tax asset of million and a current deferred tax asset of million 
the long term deferred tax asset is primarily related to net operating losses that occurred following the lbo 
there are limitations on the time periods during which these deferred tax assets can be used and on the amounts that the company can use each year 
in fiscal  the company recorded a non recurring income tax benefit of million  which was principally a result of the utilization of tax operating loss carryforwards 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the foregoing  the company s net income for fiscal was million compared to net income of million for fiscal fiscal compared to twelve month period ended april  the twelve month period ended april  includes five months of activities while the company operated as a debtor in possession under chapter of the bankruptcy code and seven months after the company emerged from its chapter proceedings 
while these five and seven month periods are not comparable  they have been arithmetically combined for purposes of an analysis of variance from fiscal results 
in the following discussion  the twelve month period ended april  is referred to as fiscal net sales for fiscal of million increased by million or compared to net sales for fiscal principally due to the opening of three new stores during fiscal comparable store sales were million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
while comparable store sales were flat in fiscal  management believes that fiscal was an important transitional year in that for the first time since fiscal  the company did not suffer a decline in comparable store sales  declines which had ranged from approximately to during such fiscal years 
finance charge income of million for fiscal decreased by million or compared to fiscal although the dollar amount of accounts receivable increased in fiscal  the level of interest bearing receivables during fiscal declined as a result of an increase in marketing promotions offering deferred interest periods to customers using the company s proprietary credit card 
the decline in the interest bearing accounts receivable resulted in lower finance charge income 
as a result of the foregoing  total revenues for fiscal of million increased by million or over fiscal cost of sales increased by million or between the two fiscal years  principally due to the increase in net sales  but decreased as a percentage of net sales from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to an increase in retail gross margin resulting from changes in pricing policy whereby price mark downs were limited to only advertised items during sales promotions rather than reducing prices on all merchandise storewide as had been done in the past 
the remaining items in the stores  although competitively priced  were not reduced from their day to day prices 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million or between the two fiscal years  and also decreased as a percentage of net sales from in fiscal to in fiscal this decline  which was achieved despite higher net sales  was primarily due to a reduction in bad debt expenses  primarily resulting from improved collection procedures 
reductions in rent for the company s headquarters  in payroll and in data processing costs also contributed to the decline in both absolute and percentage terms 
as a result of the foregoing  income from operations was million for fiscal compared to a million loss from operations for fiscal net interest expense of million for fiscal increased by compared to fiscal primarily due to a non recurring imputed interest credit in fiscal reorganization charges resulting from the company s chapter proceedings decreased from million in fiscal to zero in fiscal due to the company s emergence from chapter proceedings in october at that time  the company recognized a one time extraordinary credit of million as a result of the cancellation of outstanding indebtedness in connection with its bankruptcy court approved plan of reorganization 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company recorded a non recurring income tax benefit in fiscal of million  which was principally a result of the utilization of tax operating loss carryforwards 
in fiscal  no such benefit was recorded and the company reported no tax expense 
as of april   the company evaluated the realizability of its aggregate deferred tax assets  which arose as a result of temporary differences between book and taxable income and net operating loss carryforwards  and determined it was appropriate to reverse a portion of the evaluation allowance previously recorded 
the results of that were to increase paid in capital by million for that portion of the deferred tax assets which arose prior to the company s emergence from its chapter proceedings and to record million as a benefit against the income tax provision for the portion of the deferred tax assets that arose subsequent to the company s emergence from its chapter proceedings 
as a result of the foregoing  the company s net income for fiscal was million as compared to million for fiscal which was principally attributable to the above described cancellation of indebtedness 
liquidity and capital resources at april   the company had working capital of million 
the company s principal sources of liquidity are earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization  and borrowings under the million revolving credit and security agreement the loan agreement with the bank of new york commercial corporation and natwest bank na as co lenders the lenders 
the company s principal uses of cash are working capital needs  capital expenditures and debt service obligations  including capitalized lease costs 
the company s cash and cash equivalents decreased in fiscal  and without the proceeds from the loan agreement  the company could continue to experience negative cash flows principally because of potential increases in the customer accounts receivable balance  capital expenditures and potential increases in inventory to support higher sales volume 
the company s working capital increased from million at april  to million at april  cash and cash equivalents declined from million at april  to million at april  as of april   the company had stockholders equity of million 
the company s largest asset at such date was accounts receivable of million net of bad debt reserves 
at april   million was outstanding under the loan agreement including letters of credit of approximately  at april   the company had an additional million in long term debt  consisting of capitalized lease obligations and an industrial revenue bond in connection with its central islip  new york warehouse facility 
see properties 
the company entered into the loan agreement on april  the term of the loan agreement is three years 
the loan agreement includes provisions for issuance of up to million aggregate amount of letters of credit 
the company granted to the lenders a security interest in the company s customer receivables and all general intangibles as defined in the loan agreement 
the loan agreement contains covenants and provisions which are customary for a secured revolving credit facility 
the funds available under the loan agreement will be used primarily for capital expenditures and general corporate purposes 
at the same time that the company entered into the loan agreement  it redeemed certain receivables backed securities designated class a credit card participation certificates  series in the amount of million  from a third party investor not affiliated with the company 
these certificates were issued in april by the seaman furniture credit card master trust which originated by seaman receivables corporation  a wholly owned special purpose finance subsidiary of the company 
capital expenditures during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal were  million  million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures during fiscal were primarily attributable to the acquisition of a new computer system that became operational in july  for new store openings and for existing store renovations 
capital expenditures during fiscal and were principally for new store openings and store renovations and most recently a radio frequency system for the islip warehouse 
see business store redesign and renovation 
unless a customer is making a purchase using the seaman s plus r credit card  the company generally requires customers to make a down payment generally of the sales price at the time an order is placed  with the balance payable upon or prior to delivery of the merchandise 
with the introduction of the seaman s plus r credit card  the percentage of sales paid with cash  check or major credit cards for which customers are generally required to provide a down payment absent a special promotion has changed from approximately in fiscal  to approximately in fiscal to approximately in fiscal the balance of the company s sales for each of such periods was financed internally from working capital on the company s proprietary credit card 
customer deposits at april   april  and april  were million  million and million  respectively 
the relatively low level of customer deposits on a given date compared to net sales for a period reflects both the company s quick delivery policy and customer use of the seaman s plus r credit card 
as the company generates more sales with the seaman s plus r credit card  the level of customer deposits is not expected to change in tandem with changes in net sales 
when the company opens a new store in an existing market  it is able to leverage its fixed costs for advertising and corporate administration to cover the new store 
while its fixed costs for warehousing may not increase if there is existing warehouse capacity  increased expansion even in existing markets will ultimately lead to increased warehousing costs 
as the company opens stores in new markets  however  the company s fixed costs for warehousing  advertising and corporate administration are likely to increase as existing warehousing facilities are not likely to be able to service new  geographically distant markets  existing advertising programs will not promote the company and its merchandise in such new markets and new personnel will likely be needed to manage the new market areas 
however  additional expansion in a new market area should not result in greater fixed costs as the new warehouse facilities  advertising programs and administrative framework should be sufficient to support reasonable  planned expansion in such markets 
in addition  as the company expands into urban areas that are less populated than the greater new york metropolitan area  and as the company opens stores in suburban areas in new and existing markets  the company expects average sales per store and sales per square foot of selling space to be less than that of existing stores due to differences in population density and size of local market 
the company currently expects that the borrowings under the loan agreement together with the cash from operations  will be sufficient to meet the company s planned capital expenditures  long term debt composed of capital lease obligations and principal on the company s industrial revenue bond and repayments on the revolving line and currently anticipated working capital requirements through the end of fiscal inflation inflation has not had a material impact on the company s operating and occupancy costs
