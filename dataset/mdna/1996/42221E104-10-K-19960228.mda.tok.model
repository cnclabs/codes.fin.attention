many federal and state proposals have been made in the past to reform the healthcare system 
the company anticipates that federal and state legislatures will continue to assess alternative healthcare systems and payment methodologies 
the company is unable to predict which  if any  of these healthcare reform proposals may be adopted 
while the company does not believe it would be materially adversely impacted by most of the proposed reforms  certain proposals could have such an impact and the imposition of a single payor system in any state could potentially eliminate the company s business in that state
