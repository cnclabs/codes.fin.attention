food and beverage costs as a percentage of sales increased from in to in primarily as a result of the commodity cost increase noted above 
labor costs increased from in to in since a significant portion of our labor costs are fixed  labor expense increases as a percentage of sales as average sales volumes decline 
as a result of the lower sales volumes experienced in some of the newer stores  the registrant reviewed store staffing models in and tested a reduced labor staffing model in several markets 
the new staffing model has reduced the amount of fixed labor expenses and provided more flexibility in improving the labor costs in stores with lower sales volumes 
restaurant operating expenses  including relatively fixed occupancy costs  were also negatively impacted by the lower sales volumes and increased from in to in restaurant depreciation and amortization  including amortization of store pre opening expenses  decreased as a percent of sales from in to in this change is the result of an increase in depreciation as a percent of sales due primarily to lower sales volume offset by a relative reduction of pre opening expenses

in addition to the change in the amortization period  the registrant expensed an additional  of preoperational expenses in the fourth quarter of for stores that were opened before so that accounting treatment would be consistent for all restaurants

at december   the registrant had outstanding borrowings of  under the revolving term note agreement 
during  the registrant opened three new units and closed one 
capital expenditures for these new units  the purchase of an office building  and the refurbishing and remodeling of existing units totaled  and were funded by cash flows of  from operations and borrowings from the  line of credit 
the registrant plans to open nine units in total cash expenditures for the expansion are estimated to be approximately  the registrant believes that cash flow from operations together with borrowings from the revolving term note agreement will be sufficient to fund the planned expansion as well as the ongoing maintenance and remodeling of existing restaurants 
the registrant completed a registered public offering in october of  of convertible subordinated debentures due these debentures are subject to limited annual redemption by the bondholders and to limited redemption on the death of a beneficial owner 
the annual redemption is capped at of the original gross proceeds and occurs on each november redemptions on death are subject to a cap of  per holder per year 
pursuant to these two redemption options  the registrant redeemed  in principal amount of these debentures during and expects a similar principal redemption to occur in during december  the registrant repurchased  in principal amount of these debentures in the open market for a discounted purchase price of  with settlement dates in december and january during december  the registrant repurchased  in principal amount of the debentures in the open market for a discounted purchase price of  as a result of these transactions  which were funded through additional draws on the registrant s revolving term note  the remaining outstanding balance of the debentures at december  was  the registrant believes that cash flow from operations and additional borrowings from the revolving term note will be sufficient to fund the expected principal redemptions in during the first quarter of  the board of directors approved a guaranty by the registrant of a loan of  to the chairman of the board from first union national bank of tennessee 
the loan bore interest at such bank s prime rate plus  had an initial term of months and was secured by a pledge of  common shares owned by the chairman to the bank 
in the third quarter of  the loan was acquired by nationsbank of tennessee and its maturity was extended for an additional months 
the guaranty provides that the bank will sell the pledged shares and apply the proceeds thereof to the loan prior to calling on the registrant for its guaranty 
at march   the undiscounted fair market value of the pledged shares was approximately  the loan is scheduled to mature in the third quarter of the guaranty secures the loan until it is repaid or refinanced without a guaranty 
the registrant expects that the chairman will repay or refinance the loan before its presently scheduled maturity 
if the loan is not so repaid or refinanced  the registrant would fund any obligation it incurs under the terms of its guaranty from additional borrowings under its line of credit 
the registrant does not believe that it will be required to make any material payment under the guaranty in  however there can be no assurance that the loan will be repaid or refinanced on terms that will not result in continuing the guaranty or in a material payment 
the chairman paid a guaranty fee of of the principal amount of the loan guaranteed to the registrant at the time the loan was guaranteed and will also pay such fee on each anniversary of the guaranty as long as it is outstanding 
the loan was refinanced in part because the board of directors determined that the transfer of the indebtedness from the first union national bank of tennessee to nationsbank of tennessee would be in the best interests of the registrant  as guarantor of such indebtedness  in that it would reduce the conflict of interest between first union s role as a lender to the registrant and its role as a lender to one of the registrant s officers and reduce the possibility that first union might sacrifice the registrant s interests in an attempt to protect its position on the loan to the chairman 
because of the registrant s request that the loan be refinanced  it was determined by the board of directors that the costs incurred by the chairman are properly chargeable to the registrant and the registrant paid or reimbursed the chairman approximately  for the costs incurred in such refinancing 
sfas no 
in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for stock based employee compensation plans 
the statement defines a fair value based method of accounting for employee stock options or similar equity instruments and encourages all entities to adopt that method of accounting for all of their employee stock compensation plans 
however  sfas no 
also allows an entity to continue to measure compensation costs for those plans using the intrinsic value based method of accounting  which the registrant currently uses 
the registrant currently plans on adopting sfas no 
for fiscal and intends to retain the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based compensation
