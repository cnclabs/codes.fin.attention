the company s sales historically have been lowest during the first quarter january march and the third quarter july september and highest during the second quarter april june and the fourth quarter october december 
reduced sales volumes in the first and third quarters coincide with the transition of seasonal merchandise 
therefore  increased levels of markdowns occur during these transitional periods and operating expenses  when expressed as a percentage of net sales  are typically higher 
after the end of  the company elected to change its year from the saturday nearest december to the saturday nearest january  beginning in this change was made to conform the company s calendar to the seasonal patterns it experiences  as well as to enhance comparability of its quarterly and annual results with other retail companies

average store rent expense increased in compared to the same period last year  primarily due to the company s store expansion strategy of entering into larger  more costly urban and metropolitan markets with higher base rent and common area charge structures  and the closing of older  underperforming stores which had lower average rent costs 
management anticipates that this trend of increasing average store rents may continue 
the company has approximately existing leases that expire or have initial lease terms containing lessee renewal options which may be exercised during management believes that the company will not experience a material increase in aggregate store rents as a result of renewal options or negotiating new lease terms for such locations 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to of net sales in from of net sales in this increase resulted primarily from the completion of the distribution center expansion 
the effective income tax rate for was compared to in this increase was primarily due to the tax benefit arising in from the carryback of the federal targeted jobs tax credits and the recognition in of the deferred income tax asset associated with the remaining net operating loss carryforward generated by the company s puerto rico subsidiary in management expects the company s effective tax rate to decrease in because the items creating the increase tax benefit arising from carryback of the targeted jobs tax credits and recognition of the tax benefit relating to future benefit of prior year puerto rico net operating loss will not be repeated

intense promotional pricing in the fall season by competitors in the women s retail apparel industry  in response to the above factors  was also believed to have further negatively impacted the company s sales and margins 
in the latter part of the third quarter of  the company changed its method of processing merchandise within its distribution center which temporarily caused a disruption in its ability to sufficiently restock the company s stores  thus further negatively impacting sales 
net sales in were million  an increase of over net sales of million

comparable store sales decreased for the year 
gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to in compared to in the reduction in the gross margin percentage resulted primarily from increased markdowns on slow moving segments of the company s inventories 
the increase in the rate of markdowns in primarily resulted from stocking stores that opened late in the summer season with warm weather type merchandise that subsequently was found predominantly to have too short a remaining selling season  and the sluggish sell through of merchandise as a result of the industry wide decline in consumer spending on women s apparel during the latter part of the year 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of net sales to in compared to in generally  net sales were substantially below expectations for the second half of  which resulted in increased selling  general and administrative expenses when expressed as a percentage of net sales 
this increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased transportation costs and increased costs in the company s stores as well as a slight increase in expenses at the corporate offices 
transportation costs increased approximately percentage points when expressed as a percentage of net sales compared to due to a change in transportation from the use of a leased fleet to the use of common carriers for the delivery of merchandise to the majority of the company s stores 
during the second half of  the company converted the distribution center s production process from a hanging operation to a flatpack operation 
in conjunction with this change in the production process  the company began the expansion of the distribution center by approximately  square feet 
these changes were made to facilitate distribution to the increasing number of stores and to reduce processing and transportation costs 
the increased costs in the company s stores primarily resulted from additional store labor and increases in other store operating expenses 
the increase in store labor resulted in a percentage points increase in selling  general and administrative expenses compared to last year 
other store operating expenses increased percentage points when expressed as a percentage of net sales 
expenses at the company s corporate offices increased percentage points when expressed as a percentage of net sales partially due to investments made in personnel and management training during the latter part of the year

depreciation and amortization expense decreased to of net sales in from of net sales in the effective income tax rate for was compared to in this increase was primarily due to the start up net operating loss in puerto rico for which no tax benefit was recognized 
this increase and the effect of slightly higher state and local statutory income tax rates were minimized by the tax benefit from charitable contributions of inventory and utilization of state and federal tax credits 
inflation during its three most recent years  the company believes that the impact of inflation has not been material to its financial condition or results of operations 
occasionally  the company may experience increases in the average purchase price per unit of merchandise  however  such increases generally reflect the impact of an increase in the quality of goods purchased rather than inflationary factors 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company s primary needs for liquidity and capital have been to fund its new store expansion  the related growth in merchandise inventories and the expansion of the corporate offices and distribution center 
until  these needs were met principally through cash provided by operations and the company s available line of credit 
during  the company amended its credit agreement to include a term loan facility to provide a source of capital and in replaced this facility with a new agreement described below 
at december   inventory increased by compared to last year  while average store inventories increased compared to last year 
this includes inventory in the stores  in the distribution center and in transit at year end 
the average inventories in the company s stores decreased to approximately  per store compared to last year s  per store  reflecting management s efforts to control inventories and minimize the effect of markdowns 
inventories in transit from foreign suppliers increased by  to  per store compared to last year  primarily due to the timing of overseas buying trips and due to the opportunistic purchases of spring merchandise made available by foreign suppliers 
in  import purchases were of total purchases compared to in the level of merchandise inventories is subject to fluctuations because of the company s opportunistic buying strategy and prevailing business conditions 
in  the company intends to continue this strategy and to opportunistically purchase merchandise in advance of the selling seasons when it is to the company s advantage 
this strategy may impact the level of total merchandise inventories at the end of each quarter in and the company s liquidity and working capital needs 
the company previously had an agreement with its banks that provided for a  line of credit facility  a  letter of credit facility and a  term loan facility scheduled to expire may  borrowings against the line of credit accrued interest at the company s option of a base rate defined as the higher of the agent bank s prime interest rate or the federal funds rate plus or the adjusted libor rate plus 
the term loan accrued interest  payable quarterly  at the company s option of the base rate  as defined above  plus or the adjusted libor rate plus 
at december   the company had  outstanding under the term loan and  outstanding under the line of credit compared to no amounts outstanding at december  the maximum amounts outstanding under the credit facilities during and  respectively were  and  the average amounts outstanding under the credit facilities were  during and  during the change in average amounts outstanding principally resulted from the decrease in cash from the beginning of to the end of the weighted average interest rates were and during and  respectively 
letters of credit are used primarily to purchase merchandise from foreign suppliers 
all such purchases are paid in united states dollars  thus  the company is not subject to foreign currency risks 
approximately of the company s purchases in were paid by letters of credit compared to in this increase in purchases paid by letters of credit is due to the company s opportunistic buying strategy and taking advantage of the increase in the quota made available to the company by foreign suppliers  particularly for purchases made late in the year for spring merchandise 
the proportion of merchandise purchased with letters of credit may vary in on march   the company replaced its existing credit facilities with an agreement with a new lender which provides for a revolving loan facility of up to  including a letter of credit sub facility of up to  and a  term loan facility 
the new credit facilities expire in march and may be extended at the lender s option for an additional year 
borrowings under the credit agreement are collateralized by all assets owned by the company during the term of the agreement and bear interest  at the company s option subject to certain limitations in the agreement  at the prime rate plus or the adjusted eurodollar rate  as defined  plus 
maximum borrowings under the revolving credit facility and utilization of the letter of credit facility are based on a borrowing base formula determined with respect to eligible inventory as defined in the agreement 
at december   when the company s inventories were at the seasonally lowest levels and outstanding letters of credit were at the seasonally highest levels  the company would have had approximately million of excess availability under the borrowing base formula on a pro forma basis 
availability under the revolving facility will fluctuate in accordance with the company s seasonal variations in inventory levels 
the lending formula may be revised from time to time by the lender in response to changes in the composition of the company s inventory or other business conditions 
the term loan is payable in consecutive equal monthly installments plus interest commencing july if the new credit facility is not renewed in march  the outstanding balance under the term loan would be due and payable at that time 
current obligations totaling  outstanding at december  under the former credit agreement were classified as long term  as the company had the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long term basis 
certain fees may be payable by the company for early termination of the credit agreement 
the new credit agreement contains certain covenants which  among other things  restricts the ability of the company to incur indebtedness  or encumber or dispose of assets  and prohibits the company from repurchasing its common stock or paying dividends 
additionally  the company must maintain a minimum adjusted net worth as defined in the agreement of  and maintain minimum working capital  exclusive of amounts outstanding under the credit facilities  of  net cash provided by operating activities for   and were   and  respectively 
the slight increase in cash provided by operating activities in was primarily the result of an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities offset by an increase in the merchandise inventories associated with the growth in the number of stores  an increase in prepaid federal and state income taxes and the company s net loss 
net cash used in investing activities for   and was   and  respectively 
the company made capital expenditures of   and  respectively  in each of the years presented 
capital expenditures were primarily for leasehold improvements and equipment for new stores opened and for expansions to the distribution center in each year  as well as the expansion of the corporate offices during and net cash provided by financing activities was  for due  in large part  to the issuance of  of long term debt and  of net borrowings under the company s line of credit 
net cash provided by financing activities was  and  in and  respectively  and resulted primarily from the exercise of the company s common stock options 
in  the company plans to spend approximately million on capital expenditures in part to open approximately new stores and relocate approximately stores 
the company s liquidity requirements in will be met principally through cash provided by operations and its credit facilities 
if deemed by management to be in the best interest of the company  additional long term debt  capital leases or other permanent financing may be explored 
effect of new accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued statement no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
this statement essentially requires that when the company commits to closing specific stores and for other stores which may be impaired  the fixed assets for such stores must be written down to fair market value 
the company anticipates that the adoption of sfas  required for years beginning after december   will result in a decrease in net fixed assets of approximately  and a charge of approximately  net of income taxes which will be shown as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the statement of operations
