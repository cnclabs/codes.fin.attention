item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to be more consistent with industry practice  the company has changed its reporting format and now reports revenue from construction contracts and cost of construction contracts as well as earnings from construction contracts 
revenue from construction contracts includes not only costs incurred by the company  its related earnings  and its proportionate share of construction joint ventures  but also its proportionate share of previously unconsolidated construction affiliates 
results from unconsolidated affiliates had previously been reported on the equity method and included in other income 
results of operations vs 
the company reported net income of million compared to million in after taking into consideration the payment of dividends to preferred shareholders  the company reported a loss of per common share in compared to income of per common share in s results were impacted by the recognition of a significant loss on a major contract  and the write down of a long outstanding account receivable associated with an overseas project which had been completed in s results were largely due to a net tax benefit of million primarily resulting from losses incurred in puerto rico and the reversal of excess tax reserves resulting from the planned liquidation of one of the company s inactive foreign subsidiaries 
on a pretax basis  the company recognized income of million in compared to  in growth in construction revenue as well as improvement in construction margins on new work secured were the most significant factors contributing to this change 
operating and general and administrative expenses increased as a result of the increase in construction activity and heavier than usual legal costs  but continued to decline as a percentage of construction revenue reflecting increased staff productivity 
in addition  included a pretax restructuring credit of million representing excess restructuring reserves 
real estate operations produced a  loss in compared to income of million in most of the results were attributable to a one time gain from the sale of lease rights at the company s rickenbacker facility 
while interest expense increased compared to  reflecting changes in the company s borrowing rate  other income increased as well  due to the company s improved cash position 
s results are more fully described in the discussion that follows 
construction the value of construction completed  which includes  in addition to revenue  construction costs incurred by owners on construction management and similar projects increased from billion in to billion in revenue from and costs of construction contracts both increased by from to billion and billion  respectively 
the increase in construction activity is a reflection of the continued growth of the company s traditional non residential construction markets as noted in  as well as the emphasis the company placed on its marketing activities 
in addition  the average size of contracts secured in and has declined when compared with prior periods 
this in turn has led to a more rapid absorption of backlog as well as faster start up of projects sold in the current year 
the value of new contracts secured in was billion  up from the billion secured in on average  the margin on sales was up over the margin on sales secured in these factors reflect both the growth of the market  and therefore  the opportunities to improve fees 
the company s sureties limit the annual amount of new payment and performance bonds available to the company 
each year this limit has increased commensurate with the company s growth in revenues 
while the limitation did not restrict the company s ability to secure new work in  and the company had substantial unused capacity at the end of  there could be circumstances where the limitation might influence the selection of prospective projects 
earnings from construction contracts improved by over from million to million  reflecting both the growth in construction revenues as well as the improved margins in the backlog from prior years and the new work secured in as a percentage of revenue  earnings from construction contracts showed a slight decline from to and below the margin level of achieved in s margins were depressed by the recognition of a million loss on a contract in minneapolis  and the write down of a million account receivable with regard to a project in egypt that had been completed in this write down was the result of a ruling by a judge against the company in february in its effort to collect this receivable 
while the company has not yet decided whether to appeal the ruling  it has made provision to do so 
in  the margins were affected by million of losses in the company s caribbean operations 
work under construction management contracts as a percentage of value of construction completed continued to decline from in to in construction management contracts normally involve lower risk than other types of contracts  they also typically carry lower fees 
the trend away from less profitable construction management work has therefore also contributed to the improvement in construction margins 
at the end of  the anticipated earnings associated with backlog from work to be completed under contracts and awards believed to be firm was million  essentially unchanged from the backlog of the value of construction to be completed declined from to billion at the end of the decline in backlog volume is primarily attributable to the acceleration of when work under contract commenced  as well as a change in the reporting of certain construction management projects 
the stability of the earnings backlog against the reduction in the backlog of construction to be completed represents a continuation of the trend in the improvement in margins which had begun in this is also a reflection of the continued improvement in fees on new work secured in approximately of the earnings backlog and of the value of construction backlog relates to work to be performed in and beyond 
estimated earnings from construction backlog should not be used as a basis for predicting future net income 
operating and general and administrative expenses operating expenses directly in support of construction operations increased to million in from million in expenses included unusually heavy legal costs in connection with the successful defense of a major litigation 
because of the risk associated with the industry and the number of disputes that often occur  each year the company incurs significant legal expenses 
litigation backlog has  however  continued to decline steadily over the last several years 
construction operating expenses will vary with the level of construction revenue and a significant portion of the increase in construction operating expenses was related to the increase in construction revenue 
as a percentage of construction revenue  however  construction operating expenses declined steadily from in to in to in this improvement in efficiency was in large part a result of the restructuring steps taken in general and administrative expenses  which includes all of corporate overhead expenses  shows only a slight increase of over to million from million 
all of the outstanding balance of  of the accrued liabilities associated with the restructuring reserve set up in was absorbed by the end of  in accordance with the program previously established 
real estate in  the company changed its presentation of real estate operations in its statements of operations to a single item described as income from real estate operations 
the components of this item are described below the consolidated statements of operations 
this change has been made because of the less significant impact of real estate operations on the company s consolidated results of operations 
the company has been able to dispose of properties at essentially their carrying value over the past few years  and income generated from the operating properties are more than sufficient to offset operating costs exclusive of depreciation 
from a liquidity standpoint  real estate operations are slightly positive even after taking into consideration interest expense associated with real estate debt 
losses from real estate operations amounted to  in compared to million in income in the majority of s income from real estate operations came from the sale of lease rights at the company s rickenbacker facility 
during the company sold one developed property with an adjacent land parcel and a number of condominium units  all at their approximate carrying value 
rental and other income and the cost of operations declined by and  respectively  due to the sales of properties in and and the renegotiated lease of certain facilities at the rickenbacker air industrial park in in  the company had a net loss from real estate operations other than property sales of  compared with a net loss of  in however  because expenses included million of depreciation and amortization in and million in  there was positive cash flow from real estate operations in each of these years  even after payment of interest on real estate debt 
the company s real estate portfolio is carried at estimated net realizable value or at cost  as applicable 
until conditions in the real estate market improve to the point that will permit the company to readily conduct real estate transactions  the company will continue to review the asset values of the properties in relation to prospective net realizable value and make adjustments as necessary 
management believes the timing of future sales for developed properties may be accelerated as more stable market conditions begin to prevail 
for undeveloped land parcels  however  a prolonged period of time will be required to achieve reasonable values 
interest expense and other income in  the company changed its presentation of interest expense to a separate line item below income from construction operations and income from real estate operations in its consolidated statement of operations 
interest expense includes interest cost and related expense associated with all the company s borrowings including both corporate and real estate debt 
in total  interest expense increased to million in from million in the increase is almost entirely due to the coupon rate of the senior notes sold in the fourth quarter of although the amount of the company s average borrowings declined when compared to  the interest rates incurred averaged over in compared to approximately in interest expense associated with real estate debt declined by as a result of debt paydowns from the sale of properties 
interest expense is further discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
in  the company changed its presentation of other income 
other income now includes primarily interest and investment income and certain other miscellaneous items 
other income in amounted to million compared to a loss of  in in the company charged to other income the absorption on a pretax basis of the cumulative foreign translation adjustment relating to the planned liquidation of one of the company s inactive foreign subsidiaries 
cumulative translation adjustments  net of tax  had previously been charged directly to stockholders equity 
exclusive of the cumulative foreign translation adjustment other income would have amounted to million 
income taxes the provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of in the difference between this rate and the statutory rate is primarily attributable to state income and other taxes and the non deductibility of certain operating costs 
in  the company realized a net tax benefit of million due primarily to the benefits derived from losses incurred in puerto rico as well as the reversal of excess reserves resulting from the planned liquidation of one of the company s inactive foreign subsidiaries 
the company has recorded million of deferred tax assets which resulted principally from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
management believes that no valuation allowance is required for these assets due to the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences primarily related to the company s employee benefits plans 
fourth quarter compared to third quarter results for the fourth quarter of amounted to a net loss of million compared to net income of million for the third quarter 
after taking into account dividends on preferred shares  the net loss per common share amounted to in the fourth quarter  compared to net income of per common share in the third quarter 
construction revenue was million for the fourth quarter compared to million in the third quarter  and earnings from construction contracts were million and million for the same periods  respectively 
the slight decline in construction activity between the two periods is not unusual and does not represent any significant trend in construction activity 
the significant change in the fourth quarter results was due to the loss on the minneapolis project  most of which was recorded in the fourth quarter  and the write down of the account receivable from the egyptian project discussed above 
fourth quarter operating and general and administrative expenses amounted to million compared to million in the third quarter 
much of this increase was attributable to certain employee benefits which were incurred in the fourth quarter 
loss from real estate operations amounted to  in the fourth quarter compared to essentially a third quarter break even 
this change is the result of reduced rental income from the sale of properties earlier in the year 
interest expense and other income remained essentially unchanged between the third and fourth quarters 
results of operations vs 
the company reported net income of million in or per common share compared to a net loss of million or per common share in although revenue from construction contracts increased from to  earnings from construction contracts declined from million to million for the same period 
this reduction was largely the result of a significant loss incurred by the company s caribbean operations in the us virgin islands and puerto rico 
these losses stemmed from overruns on lump sum contracts begun in prior years and substantially completed in total operating and general and administrative expenses declined by from to this decline is primarily attributable to the restructuring steps taken in which included the downsizing of staff in shrinking geographic markets and the reorganization of certain support functions 
in the company recorded an million provision for restructuring 
during  the company charged million of expenditures against the reserve which included severance  benefits and other incentives associated with staff reductions 
an unused million remainder of the reserve was credited to income in income from real estate operations amounted to million in compared to a million loss in in  the company sold its lease rights at the company s rickenbacker facility which accounted for most of the income 
included in s loss from real estate operations was a million valuation provision set up as additional reserves against asset values in relation to their carrying value 
the decline in rental and other income and cost of operations was due primarily to sales of properties in both and interest expense increased from million in to million in primarily due to higher interest rates on the company s corporate credit facilities 
other income in amounted to a loss of  after taking into consideration a million charge for the pretax absorption of the cumulative foreign translation adjustment relating to the planned liquidation of one of the company s inactive foreign subsidiaries 
excluding the charge for the cumulative translation adjustment  other income  which primarily consists of interest and investment income  amounted to million 
this represented a decline of  from due in part to investment income of  recognized in financial condition in total  the company recorded an increase in cash and cash equivalents in of million 
cash provided by operating activities amounted to million  reflected in the company s peak cash position at december  improved cash collection procedures generated most of the significant year end cash  much of which will be disbursed in the first quarter of to fund outstanding trade accounts payable 
the increase in construction activity  and the continued shift away from construction management contracts were also factors contributing to the improved cash flows from operating activities 
the remaining balance of  set up in prior years for the company s restructuring program was also expended in cash provided by investing activities amounted to million primarily due to the sale of one developed real estate property  and a number of units in a boston condominium project and a puerto rican condominium project 
in addition  the company collected funds from the repayment of note receivables from the sale of real estate properties in prior periods 
cash used in financing activities amounted to million and is primarily attributable to the excess of debt paydowns over borrowings 
funds provided by the sale of real estate properties were used to pay down associated debt 
in addition  the company paid down the outstanding balances on certain loans and lines of credit used for general operating purposes 
management believes the company s cash flows from construction backlog  its million revolving credit facility and amounts available from overnight credit facilities  will be sufficient to support the company s operations 
debt maturing in will be paid from funds generated from operations or will be refinanced prior to its actual maturity date 
inflation inflation and changing prices during the current fiscal year have not significantly affected the major markets in which the company conducts its business 
in view of the moderate rate of inflation  its impact on the company s business has not been significant
