item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview management believes that the corporate structure resulting from the merger transaction  whereby steel city products inc scpi became a special  limited purpose  majority owned subsidiary of oakhurst company  inc oakhurst  will facilitate capital formation by oakhurst while permitting oakhurst and scpi to file consolidated tax returns so that both may utilize the tax benefits including approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards attributable to scpi 
through oakhurst s ownership of scpi  primarily in the form of preferred stock  oakhurst retains the value of scpi  and receives substantially all of the benefit of scpi s operations through dividends on such preferred stock 
oakhurst s ownership of scpi facilitates the preservation and utilization of scpi s net operating loss carryforwards 
until  oakhurst s principal business  which is conducted by scpi under the trade name steel city products  was the distribution of automotive parts and accessories to independent retailers from a facility in pittsburgh  pennsylvania 
in january  oakhurst acquired all the outstanding capital stock of h h distributors  d b a harry survis h h  a pittsburgh based company that distributes and installs automotive accessories  including stereos  alarms and cellular phones  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million that consisted of cash and the issuance of a short term note payable of  to the seller 
in august  oakhurst acquired all the outstanding capital stock of dowling s fleet service co  inc dowling s  a new york headquartered distributor of automotive radiators and related products  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million that consisted of million in cash  a note and earn out payable aggregating million issued to the seller  and convertible debt of  issued to certain executives of dowling s 
in fiscal  the purchase price of dowling s was reduced by approximately  through the reduction of the note and earn out payable to the former owner as the result of the settlement of an arbitration proceeding brought by oakhurst against the former owner 
in march  the terms of the convertible debt were modified see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
in october  oakhurst acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of puma products  inc puma  a texas based distributor of after market products to the light truck and van conversion industry  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million that consisted of cash of million  notes payable and an earn out payable issued to the seller aggregating approximately million  and the issuance of  shares of oakhurst s common stock 
in fiscal  certain terms of the acquisition notes were modified see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
significant events and trends scpi subsidiary scpi s customers are continually affected by changes in the retail environment  including the recent competitive pressures facing regional mass merchandisers and the growing influence of automotive specialty chains 
these have led to fluctuations in the level of business that scpi enjoys with individual customers 
in recent years  scpi has lost some significant customers and has suffered reductions in business as certain customers have closed stores in the face of competition  have been forced into bankruptcy  or have reduced their automotive merchandise selection 
furthermore  some customers have changed their buying practices to acquire certain merchandise direct from manufacturers rather than through distributors such as scpi  and one significant customer changed to an alternate distributor 
in fiscal  scpi s two then largest customers filed for bankruptcy protection 
one of these customers closed all its stores in december  the other  jamesway corporation jamesway reorganized and emerged from chapter in january jamesway continued to be one of scpi s largest customers until october  when it again filed for protection under the us bankruptcy code  and shortly thereafter closed all its stores 
in the first seven months of fiscal through september  when sales to jamesway ended  scpi s sales to this customer were approximately million 
in november  forest city auto parts  inc forest city informed scpi of its decision to change its source of supply  sales to forest city ceased in january in fiscal  sales to forest city were approximately million 
in its efforts to offset these trends  scpi strengthened its sales team to help identify new customers and better serve existing customers  expanded its product offerings to certain customers and enlarged the territory that it serves 
in fiscal  scpi began offering certain hard parts such as brake rotors  and in the first quarter of fiscal  scpi introduced a new merchandise category of non food pet supplies 
although such pet supplies are not typical of scpi s historical merchandise mix  management determined that the availability of existing customers which sell both pet supplies and automotive accessories  combined with scpi s distribution expertise and infrastructure  offered an opportunity for increased sales 
during fiscal  scpi added two new large customers nhd and ames and other new customers  and in the first quarter of fiscal added another large customer rich s  and expanded sales to certain other customers 
however  the level of sales to such customers is currently not sufficient to offset the loss of the jamesway and forest city business 
without further customer additions or significant increases in sales to existing customers  sales in fiscal are expected to be lower than in fiscal in anticipation of this reduction  management substantially reduced scpi s inventory levels and eliminated certain operating and overhead expenses 
h h subsidiary despite the opening of a new facility in september  sales at h h in fiscal were lower than in the prior year  due to reduced demand for car accessories and increased competition in the cellular phone business  combined with a decrease in the commission rate earned on each phone activation 
these factors placed pressure on gross margins  although margins improved somewhat in the second half of fiscal in response to these trends  management increased advertising and promotions for car accessories and introduced new accessories to help improve sales  and in the first quarter of fiscal  h h opened two new facilities at malls in the greater pittsburgh market area and restructured its sales force 
dowling s subsidiary during the first half of fiscal  dowling s was faced with intense competitive pressures in one of its markets due to the nearby opening of a competitor that hired five dowling s employees 
management s efforts to overcome this competition succeeded in returning sales to historical levels during the second half of fiscal dowling s other facilities were also adversely affected in the first half of fiscal by increased competition in a generally weak market 
this first half situation placed pressure on dowling s gross margins throughout fiscal  but margins began to improve during the second half of the year 
in the first quarter of fiscal  dowling s acquired an existing radiator distributor in philadelphia  pennsylvania for approximately  and in the same period dowling s experienced an improved competitive situation and a strengthening of demand in its existing markets  with a return to historical levels of sales and gross margins 
puma subsidiary beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  the strong retail demand for light trucks and sport utility vehicles had an adverse impact on sales by puma  because vehicle manufacturers sought to satisfy dealer demand at the expense of converters  which represented an important segment of puma s customers 
this situation led to an intensification of competition among suppliers to the converter market  and for the remainder of fiscal puma s sales continued at lower levels than in the prior year 
in response to this situation  and in furtherance of oakhurst s plans to develop the long term potential of puma  management opened a second facility in elkhart  indiana  center of the vehicle conversion industry during the second quarter of fiscal  continued to strengthen its management team  especially its sales department  and has enlarged its product offering  including the addition of van products to its wood line  and introduced an extensive catalog targeted at the restyler and accessories retailer market 
these efforts succeeded in increasing sales of non wood accessories  but until april  when puma s management intensified its efforts to recapture key converter accounts in anticipation of the model year change  sales of wood accessories continued at lower levels than in the past 
during the first quarter of fiscal  puma s gross margins reflected an improvement over historical levels  due to changes in product mix and in the source of certain products 
liquidity and capital resources financing and line of credit in addition to cash derived from the operations of its four subsidiaries  oakhurst s liquidity and financing requirements are determined principally by the working capital needed to support each subsidiary s level of business  together with the need for capital expenditures and the cash required to repay debt 
each subsidiary s level of working capital needs vary primarily with the amounts of inventory carried which can change seasonally  the size and timeliness of payment of receivables from customers  especially at the scpi subsidiary which from time to time grants extended payment terms for seasonal inventory build ups  and the amount of credit extended by suppliers 
at february   oakhurst s debt primarily consisted of i the scpi term loan of million  and the oakhurst credit agreement with a balance of million  which were refinanced in march by the fixed asset loan and the credit facility  respectively see below  ii debt in connection with the fiscal acquisitions of dowling s and puma  and iii the scpi creditor notes see below 
in recent years  scpi s operations were more profitable than in fiscal and its cash flow was sufficient to fund its own working capital needs  to repay the scheduled principal reductions required by the creditor notes and term loan  and to pay dividends to and make loans to oakhurst 
in fiscal  accumulated cash was used to acquire the h h subsidiary 
in fiscal  accumulated cash and borrowings under the term loan and the credit agreement were used to satisfy the cash portion of the purchase price of dowling s and of puma 
continuing operations provided cash flow of approximately million in fiscal however  in fiscal continuing operations provided cash flow of only  a reduction of approximately million in working capital levels which resulted from the lower levels of sales  particularly at the scpi subsidiary  was offset by a cash operating loss of million see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations 
at november   oakhurst and scpi did not meet certain covenants under the outstanding bank debt  and in march  oakhurst obtained replacement financing from an institutional lender that provides a total facility of million  comprising a new scpi term loan of million the fixed asset loan and a maximum revolving credit facility of million the revolver collectively  the credit facility  and the amounts outstanding under the term loan and existing credit agreement were repaid 
the credit facility provides a significant increase in financing available to oakhurst and its subsidiaries 
the credit facility is secured by the accounts receivable  inventories  and fixed assets of all of oakhurst s subsidiaries 
like the term loan that it replaced  the fixed asset loan is secured by scpi s building in pittsburgh  but provides a more beneficial amortization schedule of twenty four monthly principal and interest payments of approximately  with the remaining principal balance due on april  the fixed asset loan provides for prepayment without penalty  and contains a provision for the release of scpi s building as collateral in the event of a refinancing  subject to a right of first refusal by the current lender to refinance the loan on the same terms as offered by a new lender 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at the higher of the citibank na base rate plus  or  per month  and borrowings under the revolver are subject to a borrowing base that is calculated according to defined levels of oakhurst s subsidiaries accounts receivable and inventories 
the credit facility has an initial term of two years  with automatic renewal terms of one year each upon payment of a renewal fee of thereof  unless earlier terminated as provided for in the agreement  and contains certain customary restrictive financial and non financial covenants  including the maintenance of defined subsidiary and consolidated tangible net worth levels and consolidated current ratio  and limitations on cash dividends 
in february  oakhurst settled an arbitration proceeding that it had brought in connection with the acquisition of dowling s  with the result that debt  interest  and earn out payments due principally in fiscal and to the seller of that business  were decreased by approximately  in february  a  note issued to the seller in connection with the acquisition of puma that was due to be fully repaid in fiscal was rescheduled to provide for five annual payments of  beginning in fiscal in march  convertible debt of  issued in connection with the dowling s acquisition that was due to be paid in full in fiscal or  at the holders option  converted into oakhurst common stock at that time  was renegotiated into the form of cash payments made in march of approximately  and the issuance of two long term notes aggregating  payable through fiscal the new notes eliminated the stock conversion option 
the creditor notes that were issued by scpi in connection with the bankruptcy of retail acquisition corp  the creditor notes see note to the consolidated financial statements are payable in six equal annual installments through july  subject to a prepayment requirement whereby if defined cash flow exceeds   and  in each of fiscal  and  respectively  holders of the creditor notes may tender for prepayment a portion thereof in the amount of the excess defined cash flow  but not to exceed approximately  per annum 
scpi did not meet such prepayment criteria in either of fiscal and fiscal the creditor notes have been discounted using an imputed interest rate of and are included in the net obligation of the discontinued business segment 
in fiscal  management expects sales to be lower than in fiscal  principally due to the loss by scpi in fiscal of two major customers  which is expected to be only partly offset by new scpi customers and by increased sales by dowling s 
as part of a strategic evaluation of its business  scpi has reduced expenses so as to mitigate negative cash flow from operations while new customers and product lines are sought 
oakhurst undertook similar reviews in connection with its other subsidiaries to address the causes of the fiscal operating loss 
management expects that  subject to unforeseen circumstances  these efforts will result in a positive operating cash flow in fiscal  but there can be no assurance that the company can obtain a sufficient number of new customers or sufficient levels of new business to return it to profitability 
management has also limited capital expenditures and plans a small reduction in working capital levels during fiscal however  it is expected that these sources of cash flow will be somewhat less than debt service requirements in fiscal management believes that the greater availability of financing pursuant to the credit facility  together with steps taken in response to the recent loss of certain significant customers and to the reduced operating profits in fiscal  will provide adequate funding for the company s working capital  debt service and capital expenditure requirements  including seasonal fluctuations 
capital expenditures the company has no outstanding commitments for significant capital expenditures 
tax loss carryforwards at february   scpi and oakhurst had net operating tax loss carryforwards the tax benefits of approximately million  which principally expire in the years through  and which shelter most of scpi s income from federal income taxes 
a change in control of scpi or oakhurst in any three year period exceeding may lead to the loss of the majority of the tax benefits 
in order to reduce the likelihood of such a change of control occurring  scpi s and oakhurst s certificates of incorporation include restrictions on the registration of transfers of stock resulting in  or increasing  individual holdings exceeding of each company s common stock 
since the regulations governing the tax benefits are highly complex and may be changed from time to time  and since scpi s and oakhurst s attempts to reduce the likelihood of a change of control occurring may not be successful  management is unable to determine the likelihood of the continued availability of the tax benefits 
however  management believes that the tax benefits are currently available in full and intends to take all appropriate steps to help ensure that they remain available 
should the tax benefits become unavailable to scpi or oakhurst  most future income of any consolidated affiliate would not be shielded from federal taxation  thus reducing funds otherwise available for corporate purposes see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as of february   oakhurst is required to earn approximately million of consolidated taxable income before the expiration of the tax benefits to realize the net recorded tax benefit

the company s actual future results may differ significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include  but are not limited to the factors discussed above as well as the accuracy of the company s internal estimates of revenue and operating expense levels 
each of these factors and others are discussed from time to time in the company s securities and exchange commission filings 
results of operations operations in fiscal include steel city products and h h  together with dowling s and puma for the respective periods of ownership  and the administrative costs of scpi and oakhurst 
fiscal includes a full year of results for oakhurst and its consolidated subsidiaries  and there was one additional day than in fiscal  but the effect of this on results of operations was not material 
fiscal year ended february  compared with fiscal year ended february compared with the prior year  sales increased by approximately million  or 
increased sales of about million resulted from the full year of sales attributable to dowling s million and puma million 
sales by existing businesses decreased by approximately million 
compared with the prior year  sales attributable to scpi decreased by about million 
scpi sales increases aggregating million resulted primarily from the addition of several new customers  together with higher sales to several existing customers 
these sales increases were offset by decreases at scpi of million  with a reduction in sales to jamesway of approximately  following that customer s bankruptcy in october  a reduction of million in sales to forest city  following that customer s decision during the third quarter to change its source of supply  together with other sales decreases attributable to scpi s customers in the northeast market and certain other smaller scpi customers that resulted from intense competitive pressures on those customers and reduced sales of spring product lines due to a rainy spring season 
the remainder of the decrease resulted from lower sales to other customers that have downsized or eliminated their automotive departments  have filed bankruptcy  or that have changed their source of supply 
sales attributable to h h decreased by approximately  despite the opening of a second location in september approximately of the decrease is attributed to reduced equipment sales and commission revenues associated with h h s cellular phone business as a result of increased competition in the current year  combined with a reduced commission structure related to cellular activations 
the balance of the reduction is due to lower sales of car accessories and lower installation fees earned 
other income decreased by  compared with the prior year  principally due to the recovery by scpi of  in fiscal that was placed in escrow in prior years as part of scpi s predecessor s bankruptcy 
consolidated gross profits were million of sales  compared with million of sales last year 
the decrease in gross profits resulted from the lower sales levels discussed above  combined with decreases in gross margins 
in addition to the fact that gross margin levels earned by the newly acquired businesses are expected to be at somewhat lower levels than those earned by the company s traditional businesses  each of the four operating companies encountered a reduction in gross margins in fiscal compared with fiscal scpi s margin reduction resulted primarily from more competitive pricing to customers 
h h earned lower gross margins because of increased promotions and the impact of a lower commission structure on its cellular phone business 
dowling s was affected by increased competition  especially in one of its connecticut markets 
puma lowered pricing to many of its customers  while absorbing certain manufacturers price increases 
operating  selling and administrative expenses increased by million 
approximately million is attributable to the two businesses acquired in the prior year 
scpi s operating and selling expenses decreased by approximately  along with lower scpi executive salaries and profit sharing expenses of approximately  there were higher corporate overheads necessitated by the larger company  and expenses of approximately  which related to a registration statement filing in fiscal there was an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts of  when compared with the prior year  of which  is attributable to scpi where the provision was increased by  in connection with the balances due from jamesway one of scpi s largest customers at the end of the current year second quarter  and by  to provide for the bankruptcies of several of scpi s small customers that occurred during the current year  together with provisions for several other past due and disputed accounts 
dowling s also included a provision of approximately  primarily resulting from the bankruptcy of a customer in the fourth quarter 
amortization of the excess of costs over net assets acquired goodwill increased by  compared with the prior year  as a result of the acquisitions in fiscal interest expense increased by  principally as a result of the debt incurred in connection with the acquisitions and higher average levels of working capital borrowings 
although there was a loss from continuing operations in the current fiscal year  compared with income in the prior year  income tax expense increased by million because of a current year charge to deferred tax expense of million  that resulted from an increase in the valuation allowance of the deferred tax asset 
fiscal year ended february  compared with fiscal year ended february compared with the fiscal  sales in fiscal increased by  or by million 
increased sales of million resulted from the acquisitions  million  million and million for h h  dowling s and puma  respectively  for the periods of ownership 
these increases were offset by a decrease in sales of million by scpi 
in fiscal  scpi suffered a decline in sales compared with fiscal of approximately million  a decrease of  as it was unable to fully replace the sales to a large customer that was liquidated in fiscal  and as another of its large customers closed stores and bought more products on a factory direct basis 
sales decreases attributable to these two customers were approximately million  there was a net increase of approximately  in sales by scpi to all other customers following intensive efforts to replace the lost business 
other income increased by  of the increase   is attributable to the recovery by scpi of amounts placed in escrow in prior years as part of scpi s predecessor s bankruptcy 
gross profits increased by million  or by  and as a percentage of sales  increased from to 
the increase is entirely due to the acquisitions  with increased margins of approximately million earned by h h twelve months this year compared with one month last year and margins of approximately million and  earned by dowling s and puma  respectively 
gross margin earned by h h at approximately were at much higher rates than traditionally earned by the company  however  this is offset by higher operating  selling and administrative costs which approximate of h h s sales 
these increases in gross profits were partially offset by a decrease in gross profits attributable to scpi of approximately  compared with fiscal the decrease resulted from the reduction in scpi s sales  combined with an addition to the lifo reserve of  compared with a reduction in the reserve last year of  operating  selling and administrative costs reflected an increase of  or million  primarily as a result of the acquisitions  with million   and  attributable to h h  dowling s and puma  respectively 
scpi s results also included an increase of  primarily due to increased sales expenses that were necessary to maintain the changing customer base and identify new customers 
oakhurst s overhead expenses increased as a result of the business growth 
these factors  together with the higher percentage of h h s operating  selling and administrative costs to h h s sales  explain the increase in overhead expenses from of sales last year to this year 
amortization of the excess of costs over net assets acquired goodwill was  compared with  in fiscal as a result of the acquisitions 
the provision for doubtful accounts decreased by  in fiscal compared with fiscal  when scpi required a significant provision for doubtful accounts related to two of its largest customers that filed for chapter bankruptcy protection 
interest expense increased by  in fiscal compared with fiscal  reflecting interest on new debt that was issued in connection with acquisitions  and on higher average working capital borrowings to support the newly acquired businesses 
in fiscal  pre tax operating profits of approximately million were contributed by the newly acquired businesses  by h h   by dowling s and  by puma 
income from discontinued operations for fiscal of  reflected decreases in scpi s reserve for contingent liabilities relating to its former retail division  net of an income tax provision of  the company incurred a loss during the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of decreased sales levels and higher expense due to increased sales efforts
