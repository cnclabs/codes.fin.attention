item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains trend information and other forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
mei s actual results could differ materially from mei s historical results of operations and those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include  but are not limited to  those identified in certain factors 
overview micron electronics  inc mei develops  markets  manufactures  sells and supports a range of memory intensive  high performance desktop and notebook personal computer pc systems and network server products under the micron brand name 
mei s contract manufacturing operations specialize in the assembly of custom complex printed circuit boards  memory modules and system level products 
mei s component recovery operations recover  assemble  test  grade and market nonstandard ram products not meeting full industry standard specification 
all yearly references are to mei s fiscal years ended august   august  and september   unless otherwise indicated 
all tabular dollar amounts are stated in thousands 
mei s net income in was approximately million  or per share  on net sales of approximately  million 
net sales in increased primarily as a result of significantly higher sales of pc systems and higher contract manufacturing revenues  partially offset by lower component recovery sales 
mei s gross margin percentage declined from approximately on a pro forma basis in to approximately in  primarily as a result of a significantly lower gross margin percentage realized from the component recovery operations and  to a lesser extent  a lower gross margin percentage realized from its contract manufacturing operations 
these effects were partially offset by a higher gross margin percentage realized from sales of pc systems  as well as an increase in sales of pc systems as a percentage of total net sales 
the gross margin percentage realized on net sales of pc systems increased in primarily as a result of improved component costs  particularly for ram products  and generally improved pc inventory management 
mei s gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter of fiscal benefitted from an adjustment of approximately million relating to revisions of estimates for certain contingencies for product and process technology costs 
absent this adjustment  mei s gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter of fiscal would have been approximately 
mei believes that  as a result of continued pricing pressure on pc systems and a slower rate of decline of  or an increase in  component costs  particularly for ram products  it may be unable to maintain its gross margin percentage at this level in the foreseeable future 
mei s past operating results have been  and its future operating results may be  subject to seasonality and other fluctuations  on a quarterly and an annual basis  as a result of a wide variety of factors  including  but not limited to  critical component availability  the timing of new product introductions by mei and its competitors  fluctuating market pricing for computer and semiconductor memory products  industry competition  fluctuating component costs  inventory obsolescence  seasonal cycles common in the pc industry  seasonal government purchasing cycles  the effect of product reviews and industry awards  manufacturing and production constraints  changes in product mix and the timing of orders from and shipments to oem customers 
as a result  the operating results for any particular period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may occur in any future period 
on april   micron computer  inc mci and former micron custom manufacturing services  inc mcms  then subsidiaries of micron technology  inc mti  merged with and into zeos international  ltd 
zeos  and the surviving corporation s name was changed to micron electronics  inc the mei merger 
a new basis of accounting  based on fair values  was established for the assets and liabilities of zeos 
subsequent to the mei merger  mei s financial statements reflect the consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows of mei based on the new basis of accounting for the assets and liabilities of zeos and the historical cost bases for the assets and liabilities of mci and mcms 
prior to the mei merger  the financial statements of mei include only the combined results of operations  financial position and cash flows of mci and mcms 
mei believes that discussion and analysis of mei s results of operations on a pro forma basis  which includes the results of operations of zeos prior to the mei merger  provide a more meaningful comparison than discussion and analysis of mei s actual results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis present mei s results of operations for  compared to mei s pro forma results of operations for and  as if the mei merger had occurred at the beginning of  giving effect to pro forma adjustments  including amortization of goodwill  certain product and process technology costs and related income tax effects 
the pro forma information is provided for illustrative purposes and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred if mci and mcms had merged with zeos at the beginning of fiscal  nor does it represent a forecast of results of operations for any future period 
in february  mei adopted a plan to restructure its pc manufacturing operations by discontinuing sales of its zeos brand pc systems and closing the related manufacturing operations in minneapolis  minnesota 
as a result  mei recorded a restructuring charge of million in restructuring costs of approximately million incurred through august  include approximately million related to the disposition of inventory  approximately million for the write off of goodwill which resulted from the mei merger  approximately million related to other asset write downs  approximately million related to personnel costs and approximately million related to other exit costs 
certain reclassifications have been made in the following discussion and analysis to present results of operations on a consistent basis 
results of operations net sales the following table summarizes mei s net sales by product line pro forma pro forma amount of sales amount of sales amount of sales pc systems    contract manufacturing 
   component recovery    total net sales    net sales for were approximately higher than in  primarily due to a significant increase in sales of pc systems and higher revenues from mei s contract manufacturing operations  partially offset by lower sales from mei s component recovery operations 
net sales for were approximately higher than in  due to a significant increase in sales of pc systems and  to a lesser extent  higher revenues from mei s component recovery operations and contract manufacturing operations 
personal computer systems 
net sales of pc systems were significantly higher in compared to primarily due to significantly higher unit sales of pc systems and  to a lesser extent  higher average selling prices for such pc systems 
unit sales of pc systems in were approximately higher compared to principally due to an increase in sales through the direct channel resulting from increased name recognition and market acceptance of mei s micron brand desktop pc systems and continued growth in the direct sales channel 
increased sales to governmental entities and increased sales of notebook systems also contributed to higher overall unit sales 
increased name recognition and market acceptance of mei s micron brand pc systems partially resulted from the receipt by mei of a number of awards from trade publications recognizing the price and performance characteristics of micron brand pc systems and mei s service and support functions 
there can be no assurance that mei s name recognition and market acceptance of its pc products will not decline in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on mei s business and results of operations 
see certain factors personal computer systems reliance on the direct sales approach 
sales to federal  state and local governmental entities increased as a percentage of total net sales of pc systems in to approximately compared to in and in during  mei recorded sales of approximately million pursuant to two subcontract agreements with prime contractors of the federal government under the pc and desktop v contracts 
mei substantially discontinued shipments under the pc contract in the second quarter of fiscal and expects that it will make no future shipments pursuant to the pc contract 
the balance of governmental sales in and those in and were generally under the federal government s general services administration vendor program and through other direct sales 
the level of mei s governmental sales is partially dependent on the buying practices of governmental entities and mei s success in being selected to participate in government contracts in the future  of which there can be no assurance 
a significant decline in sales of pc systems pursuant to government contracts could have a material adverse effect on mei s business and results of operations 
sales of notebook systems represented approximately of total pc system sales during compared to approximately in and in mei experienced an increase in sales of its notebook products in as a result of the introduction in the third quarter of fiscal of the millennia transport  mei s modular design multimedia notebook product 
the decline of notebook sales as a percent of total pc system sales in compared to was primarily due to the significant increase in desktop pc systems sold in average selling prices for mei s pc systems increased in compared to primarily as a result of the completion of the transition in product mix toward relatively higher priced pentium and pentium pro microprocessor based systems and customer preferences for more richly configured pc systems with components featuring the latest developments in pc related technology 
in addition  during  mei experienced higher unit sales of notebook products  which generally have significantly higher average selling prices compared to mei s overall average selling price for pc systems 
mei s average selling price for pc systems declined approximately in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the third quarter of fiscal  primarily as a result of general price reductions for desktop systems and an increase in volume of lower priced pc systems sold under the desktop v contract 
in the second quarter of fiscal  mei decided to discontinue the manufacture and sale of zeos brand pc systems and to close the related manufacturing operations in minneapolis  minnesota 
as a percentage of total pc system sales  sales of zeos brand pc systems represented approximately in compared to in and in sales of pc systems in increased approximately compared to in and  sales of desktop systems constituted approximately and  respectively  of total pc system sales 
the increase in sales of desktop pc systems in was due to a significant increase in sales of micron brand pc systems resulting from an increase in name recognition and market acceptance 
slightly higher overall average selling prices of pc systems in compared to resulted principally from a shift  beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  within the desktop pc product lines from intel microprocessor based systems to relatively higher priced pentium microprocessor based systems 
the effect of this shift in product mix was offset in part by continued competitive pricing pressure 
contract manufacturing 
revenues from mei s contract manufacturing operations were approximately higher in than in  however  quarterly revenues declined sequentially in from the second quarter through the fourth quarter 
the increase in revenue compared to was primarily due to the utilization of increased manufacturing capacity and a higher percentage of turnkey  as opposed to consignment  memory module assembly services 
increased capacity was obtained through the acquisition and utilization of additional manufacturing equipment and the upgrade of existing manufacturing equipment at mei s boise  idaho and durham  north carolina facilities 
contract manufacturing revenues in the last three quarters of fiscal were adversely impacted by an industry wide decline in pricing for semiconductor memory products 
contract manufacturing revenues were higher in compared to  primarily due to increased manufacturing capacity obtained through the addition of a new surface mount technology smt line at mei s boise facility and the upgrade of mei s existing production lines 
additionally  two smt lines were installed at mei s durham  north carolina facility which became fully operational in june mei continues to rely on a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of its contract manufacturing business 
as a percent of total contract manufacturing revenue for  revenues from mei s top five contract manufacturing customers  including mti  were approximately  compared to approximately and in and  respectively 
revenues  directly or indirectly  from one customer represented approximately of the revenues of mei s contract manufacturing operations in contract manufacturing revenue from mti was approximately  and of total contract manufacturing revenue in  and  respectively 
the decrease in contract manufacturing revenues from mti as a percentage of total contract manufacturing revenues was principally due to a reduction in the volume of memory module assembly services provided for mti 
see certain factors contract manufacturing customer concentration 
component recovery 
component recovery net sales were approximately lower in compared to  primarily due to a significant decline in sales of peripheral add on memory modules  a significant decline in average selling prices for ram products and a generally lower grade of nonstandard ram components received from mti  mei s primary supplier 
these effects were partially offset by an increase in unit sales of nonstandard ram products 
sales of peripheral add on memory modules represented approximately of total sales from mei s component recovery operations for compared to approximately for and in  as mei changed the focus of its internal production and engineering resources in primarily to capacity expansion and product development of nonstandard ram products 
the increase in unit sales of nonstandard ram products in compared to was primarily due to the acquisition and utilization of additional test and burn in equipment and reduced component test times  both resulting in increased throughput for substantially all nonstandard ram products 
mei s component recovery results of operations are influenced by a number of factors including pricing for  and availability of  nonstandard ram components 
see certain factors component recovery 
component recovery net sales were higher in compared to as a result of increases in both unit sales and overall average selling prices 
unit sales increased approximately in  primarily due to increased availability of nonstandard ram components and increased production capacity resulting primarily from the addition of new test and burn in equipment 
overall average selling prices increased approximately in  primarily due to a shift in the product mix to higher priced  higher density nonstandard ram components 
unit sales of peripheral add on memory products declined slightly in compared to  but the average memory density per module increased approximately 
overall average selling prices of peripheral add on memory products increased approximately in compared to  due largely to the increase in the average memory density per module 
historically  a substantial majority of the nonstandard ram components used in mei s component recovery operations has been obtained from mti 
in  mei obtained approximately of its nonstandard ram components from mti  compared to approximately in and in in  a substantial majority of the remainder of its nonstandard ram components were purchased from a single third party alternative source 
purchases from this alternative source are generally negotiated on a purchase order basis 
there can be no assurance mei will be able to negotiate future purchases from this alternative source on terms acceptable to mei 
unless mei is able to continue obtaining significant quantities of nonstandard ram components from alternative sources  mei s component recovery operations could be limited by the volume of nonstandard ram components supplied by mti 
changes in mti s semiconductor manufacturing processes resulting in improvement of device yields and or changes in the nonstandard ram product mix and specifications  or other changes or events at mti adversely affecting its overall manufacturing output  could adversely affect the volume of nonstandard ram components supplied by mti 
any reduction in the availability or functionality of nonstandard ram components from mei s suppliers could have a material adverse effect on mei s business and results of operations 
see certain factors component recovery dependence on component recovery agreement with mti 
gross margin pro forma pro forma change change gross margin    as a of net sales mei s overall gross margin percentage declined to approximately in from in the decrease in gross margin percentage in compared to was primarily a result of a significantly lower gross margin percentage realized from mei s component recovery operations and  to a lesser extent  a lower gross margin percentage realized from mei s contract manufacturing operations 
these effects were partially offset by a higher gross margin percentage realized from mei s pc operations 
mei s overall gross margin percentage was higher in compared to principally due to the adjustment in of approximately million relating to the write down of certain zeos brand pc inventories 
absent the effect of this adjustment  mei s gross margin percentage increased slightly in compared to  reflecting the favorable effect of a higher gross margin percentage realized in mei s component recovery operations  offset in part by an increase in sales of pc systems as a percentage of total net sales 
personal computer systems 
the gross margin amount provided by mei s pc operations in increased approximately compared to principally due to the higher level of net sales of pc systems and a generally higher gross margin percentage realized on such sales 
the gross margin percentage for sales of mei s pc systems increased in compared to primarily as a result of improved component costs  particularly for ram products  and generally improved inventory management 
mei s cost of ram products  which represents a significant portion of total pc component costs  decreased significantly during the last three quarters of fiscal there can be no assurance that mei s future cost of components will decrease at rates comparable to those in recent periods  or at all  or that mei s selling prices for its pc systems will not decrease at a rate faster than the decline in its component costs 
in addition  increased sales of mei s notebook products favorably affected mei s gross margin percentage for sales of pc systems 
these systems generally have had higher selling prices and gross margins compared to the balance of mei s pc systems 
mei continues to experience significant pressure on its gross margins as a result of intense competition in the pc industry and consumer expectations of more powerful pc systems at lower prices 
in addition  mei s gross margin percentage will continue to depend in large part on its ability to effectively manage its inventories of pc system components 
see certain factors personal computer systems competition in the pc industry and certain factors personal computer systems inventory management 
mei s gross margin from sales of pc systems in the fourth quarter of fiscal was favorably affected by an adjustment relating to revisions of estimates for certain contingencies for product and process technology costs 
in september  mei entered into a license agreement and  through mti  became licensed under another agreement  each providing for the use of certain technology in its pc operations 
as a result  mei believes that its charges for product and process technology in future periods as a percent of net sales of pc systems will approximate the rate experienced in fiscal after giving effect to the fourth quarter adjustments 
future charges for product and process technology may fluctuate  however  as a result of resolution of asserted claims of infringement and claims that may be asserted in the future 
in addition  mei s rights under such license agreement may terminate in the event that mei is no longer a majority owned subsidiary of mti 
see certain factors general intellectual property matters 
the increase in government sales in  in particular those under federal government procurement contracts  adversely affected mei s overall pc gross margin percentage  as these sales generally have lower gross margin percentages than the balance of mei s pc sales 
the gross margin on sales of pc systems in remained relatively stable compared to mei s gross margin percentage realized on sales of pc systems in was adversely affected by continued intense pressure on pricing for pc products 
mei s gross margin percentage realized on sales of pc systems in was negatively affected by the write down of certain zeos brand pc systems and components 
contract manufacturing 
the gross margin percentage realized from mei s contract manufacturing operations decreased in compared to  due primarily to an increase in the percentage of total revenues derived from mei s turnkey memory module assembly services 
such assembly services generally have a lower gross margin percentage than the balance of mei s contract manufacturing services 
component recovery 
the gross margin percentage realized by mei from its component recovery operations declined significantly in compared to  primarily due to significantly lower average selling prices resulting from a sharp industry wide decline in market prices for semiconductor memory products 
gross margins were also adversely affected by the increased purchases by mei of nonstandard ram components from third party suppliers relative to the amount of components obtained from mti under the revenue sharing agreement 
under the revenue sharing agreement  mei s costs of components were generally determined at the time products were sold and were generally equal to one half the price realized from such sales 
mei entered into the component recovery agreement with mti  dated as of august  and effective the first day of fiscal year  which replaces the revenue sharing agreement 
under the component recovery agreement  mei s costs of components will be generally determined as one half of the net operating income generated from sales of nonstandard ram products obtained from mti 
see certain factors component recovery dependence on component recovery agreement with mti 
while overall gross margins on component recovery sales increased in over  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  mti s improved semiconductor testing processes resulted in the shipment of a reduced amount of higher functional nonstandard ram components to mei for recovery  thus reducing mei s average selling prices and gross margins for such products 
in the event that average selling prices for mei s nonstandard ram products continue to decline  the gross margin percentage for mei s component recovery operation would decline further and overall results of operations could be adversely affected 
see certain factors component recovery pricing of ram products 
selling  general and administrative pro forma pro forma change change selling  general and adminis trative    as a of net sales selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased in absolute dollars  and as a percent of net sales  in compared to primarily due to higher levels of personnel costs associated with the expanded pc operations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  mei charged operations with a million accrual relating to revisions of estimates for selling costs associated with sales of pc systems 
pro forma sg a expenses in and included approximately million for amortization of goodwill  as if the mei merger had occurred at the beginning of sg a expenses in included approximately million of goodwill amortization  reflecting charges prior to the write off of unamortized goodwill in connection with mei s restructuring charge in the second quarter of fiscal sg a expenses increased in compared to  due primarily to higher levels of personnel costs and  to a lesser extent  increased advertising costs and credit card processing fees associated with mei s increased level of net sales of pc systems 
as a percent of net sales  sg a expenses decreased in compared to due to the relatively higher rate of growth of sales over the same period 
income tax provision pro forma pro forma change change income tax provision    the effective income tax rate was in and in  reflecting the federal statutory rate  the net effect of state taxes  the effect of goodwill amortization and the write off during the second quarter of of approximately million of nondeductible goodwill 
without giving effect to nondeductible goodwill charges in totalling approximately million  mei s effective income tax rate would have been 
mei s effective income tax rate of for was lower than the effective income tax rate of in due primarily to the decrease in the effect on pretax income of nondeductible goodwill in both the and rates reflect the federal statutory rate  the net effect of state taxes and the effect of goodwill amortization 
as of june  mei was not consolidated with mti for federal income tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources as of august   mei had cash and equivalents of million  representing an increase of million compared to august  principal sources of liquidity in were cash flows from operations of million  borrowings under equipment financing arrangements of million and proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment of million 
principal uses of cash in were property  plant and equipment expenditures of million for expansion and capacity improvements of mei s manufacturing operations and repayment of mei s long term loan from mti of million 
mei has an unsecured revolving credit facility with mti which provides for borrowings of up to million  based on mei s tangible net worth 
as of august   mei was eligible to borrow approximately million under the facility  but had no borrowings outstanding 
in fiscal  mei established an unsecured revolving credit facility with financial institutions providing for borrowings of up to million  based on the amount of mei s eligible receivables 
as of august   mei was eligible to borrow million pursuant to this credit facility  but had no borrowings outstanding 
at august  mei had commitments of approximately million for capital expenditures for expansion and upgrade of facilities and equipment 
mei anticipates making capital expenditures in fiscal in excess of million 
mei has nearly completed construction of an approximately  square foot facility in nampa  idaho 
this new facility is expected to provide space for the transfer of mei s boise  idaho contract manufacturing operations and for certain sales and administrative functions of mei s other operations and will provide space for possible future expansion 
in the third quarter of fiscal  mei sold its boise  idaho contract manufacturing facility for approximately million 
mei expects that its future working capital requirements will continue to increase 
mei believes that currently available cash and equivalents  cash flows from operations  mei s current credit facilities and equipment financings will be sufficient to fund its operations through fiscal however  maintaining an adequate level of working capital through the end of fiscal and thereafter will depend in large part on the success of mei s products in the marketplace and mei s ability to control inventory levels  component costs and other operating expenses 
mei may require additional financing for growth opportunities  including any internal expansion that mei may undertake  expansion and capacity enhancements to additional sites  or strategic acquisitions or partnerships 
there can be no assurance that any financings will be available on terms acceptable to mei  if at all 
due to mti s ownership of approximately of the outstanding shares of common stock of mei as of august   only a limited percentage of mei s common stock is traded in the public market  which limits the trading liquidity of mei s common stock and may limit mei s ability to complete future equity financings 
in addition  the sales of substantial amounts of shares of common stock of mei currently held by mti on the open market could adversely affect the prevailing market prices of the common stock of mei  which could further limit mei s ability to complete future equity financings 
see certain factors general concentration of ownership of common stock of mei 
certain factors in addition to factors discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k  the following are important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement made by or on behalf of mei 
general fluctuations in operating results mei s past operating results have been  and its future operating results may be  subject to seasonality and other fluctuations  on a quarterly and an annual basis  as a result of a wide variety of factors  including  but not limited to  critical component availability  the timing of new product introductions by mei and its competitors  fluctuating market pricing for computer and semiconductor memory products  industry competition  fluctuating component costs  inventory obsolescence  seasonal cycles common in the pc industry  seasonal government purchasing cycles  the effect of product reviews and industry awards  manufacturing and production constraints  changes in product mix and the timing of orders from and shipments to oem customers 
as a result  the operating results for any particular period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may occur in any future period 
management of growth in recent periods  mei has experienced rapid revenue growth and an expansion in the number of its employees  in the breadth and complexity of its management  operating and financial information systems and in its geographic scope of operations 
this growth has resulted in new and increased responsibilities for mei s management and has placed  and continues to place  significant demands upon mei s management  operating and financial information systems  technical support systems and other resources 
mei continues to consider various expansion alternatives  including expansion of facilities  acquisition of facilities in alternative geographic regions and certain strategic relationships 
there can be no assurance that mei s management resources  operating and financial information systems  technical support systems and other resources will be adequate to support mei s existing or future operations 
any failure to effectively monitor  implement or improve mei s operational  financial  management and technical support systems could have a material adverse effect on mei s business and results of operations 
control by mti as of august   mti owned approximately of the outstanding common stock of mei 
in addition  four of the eight directors of mei are also directors of mti  including steven r 
appleton  chairman and chief executive officer of mti 
so long as mti continues to own a majority of the outstanding common stock of mei  mti has the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring shareholder approval  including the election of directors  and generally has the ability to control the management and certain financial and other affairs of mei 
termination of certain of mei s arrangements by mti or mti s control in negotiating arrangements resulting in terms less favorable to mei could adversely affect mei s business and results of operations 
in the event that mei were to cease to be a majority owned subsidiary of mti  certain of mei s arrangements with mti could terminate  which could have a material adverse effect on mei s business and results of operations 
intellectual property matters it is common in the electronics industry for patent and trademark  as well as other intellectual property right claims  to be asserted against companies  including component suppliers and pc manufacturers 
periodically  mei is made aware that technology used by mei may infringe on product and process technology rights held by others 
mei has accrued a liability and charged operations for the estimated costs of settlement or adjudication of asserted and unasserted claims for alleged infringement prior to the balance sheet date 
mei would be placed at a competitive disadvantage if it were unable to obtain licenses with royalty payments or other terms at least as favorable as those received by mei s competitors 
mei has entered into several patent and software license agreements  all of which require one time or periodic royalty payments 
mei is unable to predict whether any of these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on terms acceptable to mei 
if mei or its suppliers are unable to obtain or provide licenses necessary to use protected technology or software in their products or processes  mei may be forced to market products without certain technological features or software  discontinue sales of certain of its products or to defend legal actions taken against it relating to patent or copyright protected technology 
the inability of mei to obtain licenses necessary to use certain technology  or mei s inability to obtain such licenses on competitive terms  or any litigation determining that mei s manufacturing processes or products have infringed on the process or product rights held by others could have a material adverse effect on mei s business and results of operations 
mei  as a majority owned subsidiary of mti  enjoys the benefits of certain license agreements between mti and third parties 
mei makes payments to mti relating to certain of such agreements  and mei s rights under such agreements may terminate in the event that mei is no longer a majority owned subsidiary of mti 
in the event of any such termination  the inability of mei to obtain independently licenses necessary to use technology or its inability to obtain licenses on competitive terms  or a finding of infringement against mei could have a material adverse effect on mei s business and results of operations 
in addition  mti has allowed and is currently allowing mei to use certain of mti s trademarks and patents  including the micron brand name  although such use by mei has not been documented by a license agreement 
there can be no assurance that mei will continue to be able to use such trademarks and patents in the future  particularly if mei ceases to be a majority owned subsidiary of mti 
mei s inability to use such trademarks and patents in the future could have a material adverse effect on mei s business and results of operations 
international operations approximately of mei s sales for the fiscal year ended august  were attributable to sales outside the united states  and mei believes international sales as a percentage of total mei sales will increase in the future  particularly for pc systems and contract manufacturing services 
in marketing its pc systems in foreign countries  mei uses either direct selling or indirect selling through distributors  depending on consumer preferences  local infrastructure  language and marketing methods 
mei recently announced its plan to establish a pc sales and technical support call center in japan 
there can be no assurance that the establishment of this call center will not have an adverse effect on mei s current relationships with its japanese distributors 
mei is in the early stages of establishing a contract manufacturing operation in malaysia  and mei continues to evaluate the benefits and risks associated with overseas manufacturing for its pc and contract manufacturing operations 
there can be no assurance that the establishment of the japan and malaysia operations or any other international expansion will be successful  and any failure by mei to achieve success in international operations could materially and adversely affect mei s business and results of operations 
mei s international operations are subject to a number of other risks  including  without limitation  fluctuations in the value of currencies  export duties  import controls  trade barriers  restrictions on funds transfer  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collections  political and economic instability and compliance with foreign laws 
dependence on key personnel the future success of mei will depend  in part  on its ability to attract and retain key management and technical personnel 
mei has enhanced its respective management and technical expertise by recruiting qualified individuals who possess desired skill sets and experience in certain targeted areas 
there is competition for such personnel in the electronics industries  and mei s inability to attract and retain sufficient additional employees  particularly in the areas of engineering  information technology and technical support resources  could have a material adverse effect on mei s business and results of operations 
mei does not currently maintain key man life insurance with respect to any of its employees 
there can be no assurance that mei will not lose key personnel or that the loss of any key personnel will not have an adverse effect on mei s business and results of operations 
concentration of ownership of common stock of mei due to mti s ownership of approximately of the outstanding shares of common stock of mei  only a limited percentage of common stock of mei is traded in the public market  which limits the trading liquidity of the common stock of mei and may limit mei s ability to complete future equity financings 
the sale of substantial amounts of shares of common stock of mei currently held by mti on the open market could adversely affect the prevailing market prices of common stock of mei 
mti s ability to sell shares of common stock of mei is subject to volume and other restrictions pursuant to rule promulgated under the securities act 
volatility of stock price the trading prices of the common stock of mei and the stock of other companies primarily engaged in the pc industry have had a history of significant volatility 
the trading price of common stock of mei is subject to significant fluctuations due to general market conditions in the pc industry  announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by competitors  component availability and pricing  the significant number of shares of common stock of mei eligible for future sale into the public market or other factors 
the stock market generally has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations  and such fluctuations have impaired stock prices for many high technology companies 
these broad market fluctuations  as well as general economic conditions and the financial performance of mei  may adversely affect the market price of common stock of mei 
personal computer systems competition in the pc industry the pc industry is highly competitive and has been characterized by intense pricing pressure  rapid technological advances in hardware and software  frequent introduction of new products  low gross margin percentages and rapidly declining component costs 
competition in the pc industry is based primarily upon performance  price  reliability  service and support 
mei believes that the rate of growth in worldwide sales of pc systems  particularly in the united states  where mei sells a substantial majority of its pc systems  has declined and may remain below the growth rates experienced in recent years 
any general decline in demand  or a decline in the rate of increase of demand  for pc systems could increase price competition and could have a material adverse effect on mei s business and results of operations 
to remain competitive  mei must frequently introduce new products and price its products and offer customers lead times comparable to its competitors 
in addition  to remain competitive  mei generally reduces the selling prices of its pc systems in connection with declines in its costs of components 
mei competes with a number of pc manufacturers which sell their products primarily through direct channels  including dell computer  inc and gateway  inc 
mei also competes with pc manufacturers  such as apple computer  inc  compaq computer corporation  hewlett packard company  international business machines corporation and toshiba corporation among others  which have traditionally sold their products through national and regional distributors  dealers and value added resellers  retail stores and direct sales forces 
many of mei s pc competitors offer broader product lines  have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than mei and may benefit from component volume purchasing arrangements that are more favorable in terms of pricing and component availability than the arrangements enjoyed by mei 
in addition  as a result of pc industry standards  mei and its competitors generally use many of the same components  typically from the same set of suppliers  which limits mei s ability to technologically and functionally differentiate its products 
in the future  mei expects to face increased competition in the us direct sales market from foreign pc suppliers and from indirect domestic suppliers of pc products that decide to implement  or devote additional resources to  a direct sales strategy 
in order to gain an increased share of the us pc direct sales market  these competitors may effect a pricing strategy that is more aggressive than the current pricing in the direct sales market 
mei s ability to continue to produce competitively priced products and to maintain existing gross margin percentages will depend  in large part  on mei s ability to sustain high levels of sales  and control inventory levels  component cost and other operating expenses 
any failure by mei to transition to new products effectively or to accurately forecast demand for its products may adversely affect mei s business and results of operations 
inventory management mei s ability to compete successfully in the pc market in the future will depend in large part on its ability to effectively manage its inventories of pc components 
mei s pc operations focus on the direct sale of assemble to order pc systems that feature components incorporating the latest technological developments in the pc industry 
mei has experienced in the past  and could experience in the future  inventory obsolescence resulting from  among other things  the fast pace of technological developments in the pc industry and the short product life cycles of pc systems and components 
in addition  because high volumes of quality components are required for the manufacture of mei s pc systems  mei has experienced in the past  and expects to experience in the future  shortages and other supply constraints of key components 
such shortages or supply constraints have in the past and could in the future adversely affect mei s ability to ship products on schedule or at expected gross margins 
to be successful in the future  mei must accurately anticipate demand for its products and obtain adequate supplies of components to meet such demand 
the failure of mei to manage its inventories effectively could result in inventory obsolescence  excess inventories  component shortages and untimely shipment of products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on mei s business and results of operations 
short pc product life cycles to maintain a competitive position in the pc industry  mei must introduce new products and features that address the needs and preferences of customers in its target markets 
the pc industry is characterized by short product life cycles resulting from rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences and declining product prices 
in fiscal  mei introduced numerous new products and features 
there can be no assurance that these products or features will be successful  that the introduction of new products or features by mei or its competitors will not materially and adversely affect the sale of the existing products of mei or that mei will be able to adapt to future changes in the pc industry 
mei does not maintain traditional research and development groups 
instead  mei strives to work closely with pc component suppliers and other technology developers to evaluate the latest developments in pc related technology 
there can be no assurance that mei will continue to have access to new technology  will be successful in incorporating new technology in its products or will be able to deliver commercial quantities of new products or features in a timely and cost effective manner 
dependence on key sources of supply mei purchases substantially all of its pc components and subassemblies from suppliers on a purchase order basis and generally does not have long term supply arrangements with its suppliers 
certain components  subassemblies and software included in mei s pc systems are obtained from sole suppliers or a limited number of suppliers 
the microprocessors used in mei s pc systems are manufactured exclusively by intel 
from time to time  mei has been unable to obtain sufficient supply of the latest intel microprocessors 
in addition  mei currently purchases a significant majority of its motherboards from a single source 
a significant portion of the ram components used in mei s pc systems are supplied by mti  and mei expects to continue to rely on mti as its primary source of ram components 
mei focuses on providing pc systems that feature components incorporating the latest technological developments in the pc industry  which components are periodically in short supply and are available from sole or a limited number of suppliers 
as a result  mei has experienced in the past  and expects to experience in the future  shortages in the components and subassemblies used in its pc systems 
in recent weeks  mei has experienced  and continues to experience  difficulty in obtaining a sufficient supply of certain intel pentium pro microprocessors and certain disk drives 
mei relies  to a certain extent  upon its suppliers abilities to enhance existing products in a timely and cost effective manner  to develop new products to meet changing customer needs and to respond to emerging standards and other technological developments in the pc industry 
mei s reliance on a limited number of suppliers and on a strategy of incorporating the latest technological developments into its pc systems involves several risks  including the possibility of shortages and or increases in costs of components  subassemblies and software  and risk of reduced control over delivery schedules  which could have a material adverse effect on mei s business and results of operations 
mei s millennia transport notebook pc systems are currently assembled by a single third party manufacturer 
this outsourcing arrangement and any future outsourcing arrangements that mei may enter into may reduce the direct control mei has over certain components and the assembly of such products 
it is uncertain what effect such limited control will have over the quality of the products manufactured  mei s ability to ship such products on a timely basis or the flexibility of mei to respond to changing market conditions 
moreover  although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty obligations on the part of such manufacturers  mei remains primarily responsible to the consumer for warranty obligations 
any unanticipated product defect or warranty obligation  whether pursuant to arrangements with third party manufacturers or otherwise  could adversely affect mei s business and results of operations 
state taxation several states have enacted legislation which would require out of state direct marketers to collect and remit sales and use taxes based on certain limited contacts with the state 
taxation authorities in certain states have  from time to time  solicited information from mei to determine whether mei has sufficient contacts with such states to require payment of sales and use taxes on its pc systems sold to customers in those states 
mei could be required to pay sales and use taxes and income and franchise taxes related to mei s operations in prior periods  which could have a material adverse effect on mei s business and results of operations 
in addition  mei may be increasing its contacts and presence in various states as it pursues its business strategies 
as a result of its contacts  mei may be required to collect and remit sales and use taxes in the future  which could have a material adverse effect mei s business and results of operations 
reliance on the direct sales approach mei currently markets its pc systems directly to individuals  small and medium sized businesses and governmental and educational entities through advertisements in personal computer trade publications  direct mail campaigns and on the internet 
direct sales orders are received primarily by telephone by mei sales representatives who review configuration options and pricing with the customer 
the direct sales approach may make it difficult for mei to penetrate specific markets and may be less appealing to first time pc buyers than other sales channels 
in addition  mei s ability to increase future sales of pc systems is dependent in part on the growth of the direct sales channel 
mei believes that in order to retain customer interest in its pc systems and brand name recognition of its products  mei must continue to offer products  services and support which are recognized by trade publications for overall performance  price  reliability and quality 
there can be no assurance that mei s name recognition and market acceptance of its pc products will not decline in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on mei s business and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that direct sales of pc systems as a percentage of industry wide pc sales will increase or that mei will be able to increase its share of the direct sales market in the future 
there can also be no assurance that pc companies that currently distribute their pc products primarily through distributors and resellers will not implement or devote additional resources to a direct sales strategy  or that the direct sales strategy will be successful in international markets 
any decline in the rate of growth of the pc direct sales channel  or mei s failure to compete successfully in the direct sales channel  could have a material adverse effect on mei s business and result of operations 
investment in customer service and technical support systems in recent periods  mei s pc operations have experienced significant growth in orders for pc systems 
mei has from time to time experienced an increase in the volume of customer service and technical support calls  which has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a strain on mei s customer service and technical support systems 
to be competitive  mei must invest significant resources in the maintenance and improvement of its customer service and technical support systems 
any failure to maintain adequate customer service and technical support systems could cause customer dissatisfaction with mei 
customer dissatisfaction could result in reduced sales of pc systems  which could have a material adverse effect on mei s business and results of operations 
government regulation of the pc industry prior to marketing its pc systems  mei must receive certification that such systems meet standards established by the federal communications commission and certain foreign agencies for radio frequency emissions 
any delay or failure by mei to obtain such certifications may delay or prevent mei from introducing new products on a timely basis  which could have a material adverse effect on mei s business and results of operations 
in addition  the us federal trade commission and the department of commerce  along with similar foreign agencies in other jurisdictions  have promulgated certain regulations that affect mei s shipping  advertising and general operations 
any failure by mei to comply with such regulations could result in significant penalties  fines or marketing restrictions  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on mei s business and results of operations 
contract manufacturing competition in the contract manufacturing industry the contract manufacturing industry is highly competitive 
mei s contract manufacturing operations compete against numerous domestic and offshore contract manufacturers  including a significant number of local and regional companies 
in addition  mei competes against in house manufacturing capabilities of certain of its existing customers as well as with certain large computer manufacturers which offer third party contract manufacturing services 
mei s contract manufacturing competitors include  among others  avex electronics  inc  benchmark electronics  inc  celestica inc  dovatron international  inc  flextronics international  group technologies corporation  jabil circuits  inc  sanmina corporation  sci systems  inc 
and solectron corporation 
many of mei s competitors have substantially greater manufacturing  technical  financial  personnel  marketing and other resources than mei and have manufacturing operations at multiple domestic and overseas locations 
mei believes that the significant competitive factors in the contract manufacturing industry include service  quality  price  technology  location and the ability to offer flexible delivery schedules and deliver finished products on an expeditious and timely basis in accordance with customers expectations 
mei may be at a disadvantage as to certain competitive factors when compared to manufacturers with greater resources than mei  substantial offshore facilities or substantially larger domestic facilities 
there can be no assurance that mei s contract manufacturing operations will compete successfully in the future with regard to these factors 
in order to remain competitive  mei may be required to expand its contract manufacturing capacity and may be required to establish additional international operations 
there can be no assurance that mei will be successful in expanding its contract manufacturing operations on a timely and efficient basis 
the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on mei s business and results of operations 
fluctuations in oem orders mei s contract manufacturing customers generally require short delivery cycles and quick turnaround for contract manufacturing services 
as mei s oem customers react to variations in demand for their products and adjust their purchase orders to mei  mei may be subject to non cancelable purchase orders with its suppliers and may recognize losses on write downs of inventories due primarily to the specialized nature of certain custom components and declines in market pricing of components 
oem order fluctuations and deferrals have had an adverse effect on mei s contract manufacturing operations in the past and there can be no assurance that mei will not experience such adverse effects in the future 
customer concentration in  mei s five largest contract manufacturing customers accounted for approximately of the revenues from mei s contract manufacturing operations  compared to approximately in and in in addition  sales  directly or indirectly  to one customer represented approximately of the revenues of mei s contract manufacturing operations in revenues from mti in accounted for approximately of total revenues from mei s contract manufacturing operations  compared to approximately in and in mei has no long term agreements with any of its contract manufacturing customers which require such customers to purchase contract manufacturing services from mei 
in recent periods  direct and indirect sales to mei s largest contract manufacturing customer have declined materially  and mei believes that its key contract manufacturing customers will from time to time materially reduce their purchases of mei s contract manufacturing services in the future 
although mei has in the past been able to replace such business with increased business from new or existing customers  there can be no assurance that mei will obtain sufficient alternative business on a timely basis  and the failure to obtain such business could have a material adverse effect on mei s business and results of operations 
environmental regulation mei s contract manufacturing business is subject to a variety of environmental regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals and waste water used during its manufacturing processes 
any failure by mei to comply with present and future environmental regulations could subject it to liabilities or the suspension of production 
in addition  such regulations could restrict the ability of mei s contract manufacturing business to expand its facilities or could require mei to acquire costly equipment or incur other significant expenses any of which could have a material adverse effect on mei s business and results of operations 
component recovery dependence on component recovery agreement with mti historically  a substantial majority of the nonstandard random access memory ram components used in mei s component recovery operations has been obtained from mti 
mei and mti are parties to a component recovery agreement  effective as of august  the component recovery agreement 
under the component recovery agreement  mti is required to deliver to mei all of the nonstandard ram components produced at mti s semiconductor manufacturing operations  and mei s cost of components generally will be determined as one half of the operating income generated from sales of nonstandard ram products supplied by mti 
there can be no assurance that mti will continue to produce adequate volumes of nonstandard ram components to maintain mei s component recovery operation at its existing or historic levels 
termination or renegotiation of the key terms of the component recovery agreement could have a material adverse effect on mei s business and results of operations 
changes in mti s semiconductor manufacturing processes resulting in improvement of device yields and or changes in the nonstandard ram product mix and specifications  or other changes or events at mti adversely affecting its overall manufacturing output  could adversely affect the volume of nonstandard ram components supplied by mti 
many semiconductor memory manufacturers are reluctant to sell nonstandard ram components because such components could compete with their full specification ram components for similar applications 
in addition  some manufacturers are concerned that subsequent testing performed by a recovery operation could reveal proprietary data regarding manufacturing yields and processes 
as a result  there can be no assurance that mei will be able to obtain nonstandard ram components from semiconductor manufacturers in quantities sufficient to meet demand for mei s products 
any reduction in the availability or functionality of nonstandard ram components from mei s suppliers could have a material adverse effect on mei s business and results of operations 
pricing of ram products pricing for mei s nonstandard ram products fluctuates  to a large degree  based on industry wide pricing for semiconductor memory products 
during the last three quarters of fiscal  mei experienced significant declines in the average selling prices of its nonstandard ram products as industry wide average selling prices for full specification semiconductor memory products experienced a sharp decline 
mei believes that such decline in average selling prices of semiconductor memory products was due primarily to changes in the balance of supply and demand for these commodity products  and mei is unable to predict the impact of semiconductor memory product market dynamics in future periods 
in recent periods  mei has increased the amount of nonstandard ram components purchased from alternative third party sources relative to the amount of such components obtained from mti 
due to increased market risk associated with holding purchased nonstandard ram products  mei has experienced in the past and may experience in the future losses from write downs of nonstandard ram component inventories in periods of declining prices 
further declines in industry wide pricing for semiconductor memory products would likely result in declines in average selling prices of mei s nonstandard ram products  which could have a material adverse effect on mei s business and results of operations
