item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion should be read in connection with the information contained in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
during  hercules divested its aerospace segment and the electronics printing division of its food functional products segment 
in december  the company signed a letter of intent to sell its composite products division 
during  the company completed the divestiture of its packaging films and liquid molding resins business units 
as discussed below and in the notes to the financial statements  these transactions had significant effects on the company s cash flow  results of operations  and the balance sheet 
see notes   and to the financial statements and liquidity and financial resources below 
following the aerospace divestiture  composite products division information has been included in the corporate and other segment  previously it was reported in the aerospace segment 
prior year information has been restated to conform with the presentation 
results of operations all comparisons are with the previous year  unless otherwise stated 
net sales chemical business chemical specialties and food functional products segments sales increased  or million  in higher selling prices  along with stronger foreign currencies relative to the dollar  accounted for much of the improvement 
on a consolidated basis  however  net sales declined  or million  reflecting divestitures of aerospace in march and packaging films in april in  sales of chemical businesses increased on increased volumes and prices  reflecting improvement in western economies 
however  the divestiture of packaging films and reduced aerospace revenues resulted in relatively flat consolidated net sales 
profit from operations in the chemical businesses increased by  or million  in however  loss of profits from the divested aerospace segment of million and increased charges of million in the corporate and other segment  primarily increased environmental expenses  resulted in a million decrease in consolidated profits from operations 
chemical businesses gross profit increased by million and margins improved from to  driven by higher selling prices and manufacturing cost improvements 
consolidated gross profit  however  declined by million  primarily as a result of the aforementioned divestitures 
selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses declined million  primarily reflecting the elimination of costs relating to divested businesses and the continuation of cost management programs in continuing businesses and the corporate organization 
these decreases  however  were offset by a million increase in employee incentive compensation programs  primarily resulting from the early vesting of the and long term incentive compensation programs  as well as the grant of stock awards to all hercules employees 
commencing in  the long term incentive compensation program was revised 
awards of restricted stock and performance shares were substantially replaced by stock options  performance accelerated stock options  and cash value awards payable in shares of hercules stock 
see note research and development r d expenses declined as a result of business divestitures  for chemical businesses  r d spending rose to million in other operating expenses  net see note  increased million 
higher environmental costs  as a result of ongoing negotiations with regulatory agencies  particularly as they relate to the jacksonville  arkansas  site  coupled with estimated losses related to the pending divestiture of composite products  were partially offset by lower employee separation costs and write offs 
environmental costs are discussed further below and in note to the financial statements 
in  profit from operations rose  or million 
the strength of the chemical businesses led to higher gross profit approximately million  or improvement and an increase in gross profit margins from in to 
gross profit was helped by higher volumes and prices and by manufacturing cost improvements 
these gains were partially offset by the sale of packaging films and lower aerospace margins 
sg a expenses were flat  while r d expenses declined 
cost savings from previous restructurings and ongoing cost management programs were offset by higher expenses for employee incentive compensation programs related to achieving above target levels of performance and higher expenses for manufacturing support and marketing 
r d expenses reflect the impact of lower spending in the aerospace segment and other divested businesses 
other operating expenses declined million 
lower environmental expenses and severance costs  coupled with restructuring charges related to the disposition of liquid molding resins and a company wide reduction in personnel  account for the favorable change 
environmental expenses declined from million to million as no new sites were identified that required recognition of significant environmental expenditures 
chemical specialties net sales increased  or million  in from improved pricing  stronger foreign currencies  and increased sales of higher value wet strength resin products and polypropylene nonwoven fibers 
market softness in the united states and europe during the second half of the year due to paper mill shutdowns and lower demand in adhesives markets reduced overall paper technology and resins volumes 
profit from operations increased  or million  in margins were unchanged as gains from higher revenues and manufacturing cost improvements were offset by higher raw material costs  lower production volume  and increased sg a costs  in the fourth quarter  associated with higher incentive compensation 
in  net sales rose  or million  from higher prices for resins in adhesives  chewing gum  construction  and graphic arts markets along with overall resins volume growth 
other positive factors were strong volumes for polypropylene nonwoven fiber in the diaper coverstock market and increased volumes of rosin size and emulsion products from higher utilization rates in the paper industry 
profit from operations rose  or million  in  largely from higher revenues 
operating profit also benefitted from lower per unit manufacturing cost derived from higher production volume 
food functional products net sales increased  or million  in higher selling prices and stronger foreign currencies contributed to the growth in both aqualon and food gums 
aqualon volumes were marginally higher  however  lower demand in the food markets in the second half of the year reduced overall volume 
profit from operations increased  or million  and the operating profit margin increased from to 
higher revenues  coupled with manufacturing cost improvements  were partially offset by higher raw material costs and lower yields  particularly in food gums 
higher sg a costs in the fourth quarter  associated with higher incentive compensation  also reduced operating profit 
in  net sales increased  or million 
aqualon sales reflect higher volumes and prices from strong demand in the paint  construction  and regulated markets 
this improvement was partially offset by lower volumes in oil and gas markets  along with declines in coatings from continued pricing pressures by foreign manufacturers in furniture coating applications 
higher volumes in food gums and printing product applications also added to revenue improvement 
profit from operations grew  or million  in from price and volume improvements 
contributing to operating profit improvement were lower manufacturing costs  higher yields from process improvements  and better utilization of capacity 
despite the strong financial performance in  future results remain difficult to predict 
the softness in demand experienced by segments of the chemical industry during the second half of may continue into early this could have an unfavorable impact on first quarter financial performance 
however  we expect markets to strengthen throughout the year  yielding overall favorable results for we will continue to focus on delivering earnings growth and shareholder value 
corporate and other net sales declined million in  primarily from the divestiture of packaging films in april operating losses increased million  primarily reflecting higher environmental costs partially offset by improvement in composite products operating performance 
in  net sales declined million  reflecting the packaging films divestiture 
operating losses declined million because of restructuring charges taken in coupled with lower environmental expenses 
equity in income of affiliated companies increased by million 
the improvement reflects equity earnings from hercules stake in alliant techsystems  acquired in divesting the aerospace segment in march improved earnings from tastemaker  a owned flavors joint venture  also added to the improvement 
in  income increased by million  reflecting improved earnings in tastemaker  partially offset by the sale of several affiliates in interest and debt expense remained relatively flat as the effect of lower average debt over the period was offset by decreased capitalized interest related to lower capital spending 
in  interest and debt expense declined on reduced levels of average debt and increased capitalized interest related to higher capital spending 
other income expense  net see note  showed a favorable change of million in this increase relates primarily to the gains on the sale of aerospace and the electronics printing division 
in  the unfavorable change of million primarily reflects favorable litigation settlements of million 
the provision for income taxes reflects effective tax rates of in and in and the rate was favorably affected by increased utilization of foreign tax credits and a state income tax settlement related to a prior year sale of an investment 
both the and rates have been favorably affected by research and experimentation tax credits of million and million  respectively 
see note this paragraph contains forward looking statements and is included here to provide safe harbor under the private securities litigation reform act of financial condition liquidity and financial resources net cash flow from operations was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the increase in primarily relates to reduced working capital requirements and lower income tax payments 
cash flow included recoveries related to contract settlements in the divested aerospace segment of approximately million and cash proceeds from favorable litigation settlements 
income taxes on the contract settlements were paid in as a result of these factors and higher working capital requirements  cash flow was substantially lower than in total cash flow was favorably affected by proceeds from asset disposals of million in  million in  and million in in the three year period ended december   the company satisfied its cash requirements for capital expenditures  other investing activities  and dividends entirely from operating cash flows 
in addition to internally generated cash  various credit sources are available to the company 
these include short term lines of credit  of which million was available at december   and revolving credit agreements with several banks providing million million of which was available at december  
in addition  the company has a shelf registration in the amount of million available  subject to market conditions 
capital expenditures increased to million in and declined to million in this increase and subsequent decrease relates primarily to spending on a new methylcellulose facility in doel  belgium  which was completed in late during  the company increased the deductible for property insurance to million 
this change  which lowers premium costs  was prompted by the favorable loss experience in the chemical businesses and the divestiture of the aerospace segment 
commitments and capital structure total capitalization stockholders equity plus debt decreased to billion at december  stockholders equity declined million as share repurchases continued  while total debt increased million 
as a result  total debt as a percentage of capitalization increased to from 
the company does not intend to have this ratio exceed
