item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations trends 
labone competition labone believes that the insurance laboratory testing market is approximately a million industry 
labone currently controls over half the market  with three other main competitors  osborn laboratories  inc  clinical reference laboratory and gib laboratories  maintaining a majority of the remaining market 
the insurance laboratory testing industry continues to be increasingly competitive 
the primary focus of the competition has been on pricing 
this continued competition has resulted in a decrease in labone s average price per test 
it is anticipated that prices will continue to decline in although competition has dramatically increased in the past few years  labone has maintained its position as the market leader 
labone believes its leading position in the insurance laboratory testing market is due in part to its focused commitment of resources to the life and health insurance industry 
labone has continued to maintain its market leadership through the client relationships that it has developed over its year history  its reputation for providing quality products and services at competitive prices  and its battery of tests which are tailored specifically to insurance companies needs 
the clinical laboratory testing market is a billion industry which is highly fragmented and very competitive 
labone faces competition from numerous independent clinical laboratories and hospital or physician owned laboratories 
many of labone s competitors are significantly larger and have substantially greater financial resources than labone 
labone is currently working to establish a sound client base in this environment 
labone s business plan is to be the premier low cost provider of high quality laboratory services to self insured companies and insurance companies in the healthcare market 
labone feels that its superior quality and centralized  low cost operating structure enables it to compete effectively in this market 
labone competes in the substance abuse testing market nationwide 
labone s major competitors are the three major clinical chains  labcorp  corning clinical laboratories and smith kline beecham laboratories  who collectively constitute approximately two thirds of the substance abuse testing market 
labone foreign markets in  labone opened head office reference laboratory limited  a subsidiary  in toronto  canada 
during  labone consolidated all canadian laboratory testing into the kansas laboratory 
in  the name was changed to lab one canada  inc  and labone continues to market insurance testing services to canadian clients  with laboratory testing performed in the united states

healthcare services the following operating businesses are considered to be in the healthcare services segment response oncology  inc  labone  inc 
healthcare segment and pyramid diagnostic services  inc response oncology  inc 
the registrant owns approximately of response oncology  inc response 
on november   response changed its name from response technologies  inc response s common stock trades on the nasdaq national market system under the symbol roix 
response is a comprehensive cancer management company 
response provides advanced cancer treatment services under the direction of over independent oncologists  manages the practices of oncologists with whom response has affiliated  and conducts clinical cancer research on behalf of pharmaceutical manufacturers 
response cancer treatment services response provides advanced cancer treatments and related services  principally on an outpatient basis  through its impact registered trademark implementing advanced cancer treatments centers 
each impact center provides its medical directors cancer specialists with a fully integrated delivery system for implementation of advanced cancer protocols 
as of february   response owned or operated in joint ventures with hospitals  impact centers in states  providing advanced treatment capabilities and facilities to over medical oncologists 
commencing in  response shifted its emphasis from wholly owned impact centers typically located away from hospitals in close proximity to suburban oncology practices to joint ventures with hospitals which provide the physical facilities wherein the impact center is operated 
each impact center is staffed by experienced oncology nurses  pharmacists  laboratory technologists  and other support personnel to deliver outpatient services under the direction of private practicing oncologists 
impact center services include preparation and collection of stem cells  administration of high dose chemotherapy  reinfusion of stem cells and delivery of broadbased supportive care 
impact center personnel extend the support mechanism into the patient s home  further reducing the dependence on hospitalization 
the advantages of this system to the physician and patient include i convenience of the local treatment facility  ii specialized on site laboratory and pharmacy services  including home pharmacy support  iii access to response s clinical trials program to provide ongoing evaluation of current cancer treatment  iv specially trained medical and technical staff  v patient education and support materials through computer  video and staff consultation  and vi reimbursement assistance 
response oncology practice management services response announced during the year ended december   its plans to engage in physician practice management within the specialty of medical oncology and hematology 
on january   response acquired the assets of  and entered into a long term management services agreement with oncology hematology group of south florida  pa the group 
the group  consisting of nine physicians  is located on the campus of baptist hospital in miami  florida 
under the management services agreement  response receives a management fee to manage the non medical aspects of the practice and to coordinate practice enhancement opportunities with the physicians 
improvements are expected through a professional focus on management and managed care relationships  economies of scale  and the addition of new services 
the group is response s first physician group under such a practice management relationship 
as of february   response had announced the receipt of two additional non binding letters of intent for physician practice management relationships  and that it was in early negotiations with several additional groups 
in late  response contracted with an independent physician association of oncologists in palm beach  broward  dade and monroe counties in south florida for the purpose of marketing the services of such oncologists to managed care organizations 
response cancer research services response also utilizes its database to provide various types of data to pharmaceutical companies regarding the use of their products 
the impact center network and response s database make response ideally suited to this process 
response is currently participating in several projects with pharmaceutical manufacturers to furnish data in connection with fda applications for post fda approval marketing studies 
revenue from these contracts helps to underwrite response s clinical trials expenses 
such relationships with pharmaceutical companies may allow response earlier access to drugs and therapies 
response competition as a result of growing interest among oncologists and the more widely recognized efficacy of high dose chemotherapy treatments  the competitive environment in the field is starting to heighten 
most community hospitals with a commitment to cancer treatment are evaluating their need to provide high dose treatments  and other entities are competing with response in providing high dose services similar to those offered by response 
such competition has long been contemplated by response  and is indicative of the evolution of this field 
while response believes that the demand for high dose chemotherapy services is sufficiently large to support several significant providers of these services  it is subject to increasing competitive risks from these entities 
in addition  response is aware of at least two competitors specializing in the management of oncology practices  and several healthcare companies with established operating histories and significantly greater resources than response are also providing at least some management services to oncologists 
there are certain other companies  including hospitals  large group practices  and outpatient care centers  that are expanding their presence in the oncology market and may have access to greater resources than response 
furthermore  organizations specializing in home and ambulatory infusion care  radiation therapy  and group practice management compete in the oncology market 
response s revenue depends on the continued success of its affiliated physician groups 
these physician groups face competition from several sources  including sole practitioners  single and multi specialty groups  hospitals and managed care organizations 
response government regulation response s services are subject to federal and state licensing requirements in each of the states in which it operates 
in order to maintain such licensure  response must comply with applicable regulations and is subject to periodic compliance inspections by healthcare regulators 
response is  to the best of management s knowledge  in compliance with applicable state and federal licensing requirements 
the law regulating healthcare providers varies among states 
accordingly  response approaches its network expansion on a state by state basis in order to determine whether the institution and operation is feasible under the laws of the target state 
healthcare regulation is a rapidly evolving area of law 
there can be no assurance that response s ability to open or operate its treatment facilities will not be adversely affected by changes in applicable federal or state law such as certificate of need laws or by administrative interpretation of existing law 
some protocols which response may desire to implement may be subject to regulatory approval by the food and drug administration fda due to the drugs or combination of drugs used in the protocols 
in most instances  such approval will be sought by manufacturers of the drugs  however  response may occasionally participate in such an approval process 
the majority of patients referred to the centers are covered by a third party insurer 
response receives very little of its revenue from medicare since patients eligible for medicare generally are not medically eligible by virtue of their age for high dose treatment protocols 
response believes that its method of compensating its medical directors complies with the federal medicare anti kickback law and the stark self referral law and similar state regulations 
such regulations at the federal level prohibit any form of compensation to physicians intended to induce the referral of medicare or medicaid patients and the referral of such patients to an entity for designated health services in which the physician has a financial relationship 
certain states have enacted broader regulations precluding such referrals with respect to non medicare and medicaid payers 
response believes that it has structured its compensation arrangements with its medical directors pursuant to federal safe harbor regulations  and in compliance with applicable state regulations 
however  there can be no assurance that future government regulations will not impact response s compensation arrangements with its medical directors 
response would attempt to restructure its medical director payments in a manner which complies with any future regulation 
response business history and past operations response was incorporated in tennessee in in fiscal  after response had suffered losses since incorporation of over million  response adopted a plan of restructuring and reorganization of its business operations away from patient funded research activities to the development and operation of outpatient cancer centers specializing in technology advanced cancer treatment programs for oncologists 
response liability exposure like all companies operating in the healthcare industry  response faces an inherent risk of exposure to liability claims 
while response has taken what it believes to be appropriate precautions  there can be no assurance that it will avoid significant liability exposure 
response has obtained liability insurance  but there can be no assurance that it will be able to continue to obtain coverage at affordable rates or that such coverage will be adequate in the event of a successful liability claim 
since inception  response has not incurred any professional or general liability claims or losses  and as of december   response was not aware of any pending claims 
response employees as of february   response employed approximately persons  approximately of whom were full time employees 
the employees are not covered by any collective bargaining agreements 
response believes that its labor relations are good

additional proposed taxes for these years are  also  during the irs issued tentative proposed federal income tax adjustments for the year totaling approximately million 
in early  the irs reduced the million tentatively proposed tax adjustments for the year to approximately million 
the irs has used these proposed increases in federal income taxes to deny seafield a claim for refund of million

because the removal and replacement costs had been incurred prior to the sale of the insurance subsidiary  seafield negotiated with the buyer for an assignment of the cause of action from the insurance subsidiary 
thus  any recovery will be for the benefit of seafield and all costs incurred in connection with the litigation will be paid by seafield 
any ultimate recovery will be recognized as income when received and would be subject to income taxes 
in september  the missouri court of appeals reversed a million judgment granted in in favor of seafield  the court of appeals remanded the case to the trial court for a jury trial limited to the question of whether or not the applicable statute of limitations barred the claim

in february  the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit affirmed the jury s verdict in seafield s favor  reversed the trial judge s award for marketing expenses  and affirmed the trial judge s award of legal costs 
a bond posted by one of the plaintiffs counter defendants secures payment of the legal costs awarded by the trial judge and affirmed by the court of appeals 
because the quail run project was retained by seafield in connection with the sale of its former insurance subsidiary  seafield defended the lawsuit under an indemnification arrangement with the purchaser of the former insurance subsidiary  all costs incurred and any judgments rendered in favor of the plaintiff have been and will be for the account of seafield

the strategy of seafield was deployment of resources into developing businesses that provide services to the healthcare and insurance industries

labone s total revenues decreased approximately in to million from million in due to decreases in insurance laboratory and kit revenue  partially offset by increases in healthcare clinical and substance abuse testing laboratory revenues 
insurance laboratory revenues declined due to decreases in the volume and price of tests performed 
the total number of insurance applicants tested by labone during decreased as compared to this decline was due to market competition  a reduction in the total number of life insurance applications written in the industry  and regulations restricting the use of laboratory testing for underwriting of medical insurance 
average revenue per applicant declined primarily due to a decrease in prices as a result of continued competitive pressures 
during the fourth quarter  labone initiated a price stabilization plan 
the purpose of the plan was to increase prices by promoting service 
the initial result of this action was a slight increase in the average revenue per applicant 
however  prices subsequently declined during labone s total cost of sales increased  in as compared to the prior year 
this increase is due to increases in payroll and outside lab services related to clinical and substance abuse testing and labone service center lsc expenses 
lsc expenses increased due to the lsc expansion as well as a write off for closing non performing locations 
these were partially offset by decreases in lab one canada expenses due to closing the laboratory in lab one canada continues to market testing services with laboratory testing performed in the united states 
in september  labone reduced staff by resulting in additional expenses of  the work force reduction was considered necessary to improve the cost structure of insurance testing operations and meet clients requirements for lower cost laboratory services 
it is expected the annual savings from the reduction in staff and lsc locations will result in labor savings and reduced lsc operating expenses of million 
labone s selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  in as compared to the prior year primarily due to expenses related to the one time restructuring charge of million incurred in see compared to depreciation and maintenance expenses also declined in these declines were partially offset by increases in commission  bad debt and third party billing expenses

response is currently evaluating means of optimally financing the anticipated acquisitions  and it is contemplated that such acquisitions will be financed through combinations of debt and equity 
trends the following is labone s analysis of certain existing trends that have been identified as potentially affecting future financial results of labone 
due to the potential for a rapid rate of change in any number of factors associated with the insurance and healthcare laboratory testing industries  it is difficult to quantify with any degree of certainty labone s future volumes  sales or net earnings 
in the last several years there has been a decline in the number of life insurance applications written in the industry 
in addition  the insurance laboratory testing industry continues to be highly competitive 
the primary focus of the competition has been on pricing 
labone continues to maintain its market leadership by providing quality products and services at competitive prices 
management expects that prices and volume may continue to decline during due to competitive pressures and a reduction in the number of life insurance applications written 
these trends may have a continuing material impact on earnings from operations 
during december  the fda gave premarket approval to epitope  inc with respect to its specimen collection kit for oral fluid hiv antibody testing 
in december  epitope announced that the fda had issued a letter stating that the oral fluid western blot test was approvable as a confirmation for the oral fluid hiv antibody test 
if approved  this may allow for the initial screen and the western blot confirmation test to be performed on the same specimen 
due to the lower collection expense associated with oral fluid collection devices  the potential exists for an expansion of the testing market 
currently  there are approximately million individual life insurance policies sold in the united states annually 
however  laboratory services are provided on only approximately million of these policy applicants 
the non invasive nature of oral specimen collection allows for low cost agent collection  making testing much more affordable on smaller face value insurance policies 
conversely  the device also has the potential to cannibalize part of the existing blood and urine testing market 
the net impact of oral fluid testing cannot be determined at this time 
there are companies currently developing and seeking fda approval for home hiv test products 
if approved  these products would allow individuals to confidentially determine their hiv status prior to applying for insurance 
to avoid accepting these high risk policies  the insurance company may elect to lower the threshold at which laboratory tests are requested to prevent writing policies on hiv positive applicants 
most insurance laboratory testing is performed on policies of  or greater  representing about one third of all policy applicants 
the  to  range represents approximately one quarter of current insurance policy applicants 
if the fda does approve any home testing kit for hiv  the potential exists for a significant expansion of laboratory testing for lower policy amounts 
labone entered the clinical and samhsa certified substance abuse testing markets during labone continues to add new customers in both fields
