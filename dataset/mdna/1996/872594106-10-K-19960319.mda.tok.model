item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
competitive conditions historical condition historically  tnp has operated with little direct competition throughout most of its service territory 
tnp is the only electric utility issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity to serve customers in most of its texas service areas 
in new mexico  tnp holds exclusive franchise agreements with the municipalities and adjacent areas that it serves 
tnp expects competitive conditions in the electric utility industry to change significantly  as discussed below 
regulatory changes federal 
in march  ferc proposed comprehensive regulatory changes to facilitate development of a competitive wholesale electric power market 
ferc s notice of proposed rulemaking  commonly referred to as the mega nopr  will require all ferc regulated public utilities to offer nondiscriminatory  open access tariffs to all wholesale sellers and purchasers of electric energy in interstate commerce 
utilities that own transmission facilities will be required to provide all wholesale purchasers and sellers of electric energy full service transmission arrangements comparable in quality and cost to transmission services that the owner charges its own customers 
no such requirement currently exists 
these utilities will also be required to provide all actual and potential transmission users access to real time information on the transmission capabilities of its network 
currently  this information is treated as proprietary 
ferc is expected to adopt the mega nopr by mid ferc s proposal stems from the energy policy act of  in which  among other things  congress authorized ferc to relieve various discriminatory practices in the electric utility industry 
this legislation eliminated many anticompetitive restrictions on owning and operating nonutility power producers  or ewgs 
it also mandated increased transmission access for wholesale suppliers in interstate commerce 
state 
many states are also considering regulatory changes to increase competition in the electric utility industry and lower consumer prices 
the puct recently passed a wholesale transmission access rule to lower costs for a third party to transport electricity through a utility s transmission network 
during  the puct considered proposals to enable retail customers to choose among suppliers  a practice commonly referred to as retail wheeling  but took no action 
the new mexico legislature has currently rejected retail wheeling proposals 
however  the nmpuc is conducting a study to determine the feasibility of managed competition  which resembles retail wheeling 
the largest impediment to retail wheeling centers on how to account for the potential financial impairment of utility assets  or stranded costs  as the industry evolves from a regulated to a competitive environment 
generating facilities are most at risk of impairment because they will be most exposed to competition from an increasing number of power producers 
tnp believes that transmission and distribution facilities are less vulnerable to impairment considerations because they will continue to be regulated 
industry response the regulatory changes described above are resulting in competition in generating and supplying electricity and contributing to a buyers market for wholesale power 
electric utilities are responding by attempting to reduce operating costs and adopting strategies to protect current markets and identify opportunities for customer growth 
this has been achieved through a combination of mergers  internal restructuring  unbundling of services  and the creation of power marketers 
services are unbundled when a fully integrated utility reorganizes into separate companies or divisions  each specializing in a specific service such as generation  transmission and distribution  and marketing 
power marketers actively search for buyers of excess generated electricity 
although the electric utility industry is evolving into an increasingly competitive  market dominated environment  the transition toward federal and state deregulation is currently proceeding independently and tnp cannot predict when the transition will be completed 
however  the transition is expected to result in a growing number of competing power suppliers and declining customer prices 
impact on tnp the inability to recover stranded costs could adversely impact tnpe s and tnp s financial condition 
tnp is considering various alternatives to address its potential for stranded costs 
although final resolution and magnitude of the issue is uncertain  management anticipates that shareholders and customers will share the financial burden of stranded costs 
page assuming satisfactory resolution of the stranded costs issue  tnp believes that current competitive developments on the wholesale market ultimately will benefit tnp and its customers 
because tnp purchases much of its power  tnp can take advantage of the lower transmission prices  additional market flexibility  and new options in obtaining purchased power 
tnp s competitive position has been strengthened with the puct open access to transmission rule 
tnp currently has no significant wholesale power sales but expects to position itself to take advantage of opportunities to serve additional wholesale customers as they arise 
management believes tnp s revenue growth opportunities are in an increased customer base and new services 
tnp established a marketing division in december to pursue these opportunities 
tnp believes its market niche is in smaller to medium sized communities 
only two of the communities in tnp s service area have populations in excess of  while some larger  fully integrated utilities are closing offices in smaller towns and consolidating in major population centers  tnp opened two additional small town offices in results of operations overall results earnings applicable to common stock were million for  the second highest earnings in tnpe s history 
this was an increase of million as compared to a loss applicable to common stock of million for management believes the initiatives taken in adopting a strategic plan  rate settlements  reorganization set the framework for the earnings increase in excluding the one time items discussed below  earnings were million  an million improvement over earnings of million 
the million improvement resulted primarily from base revenue increases  but also from increased gwh sales  cost containment of operating expenses  and lower interest charges 
one time items  net of taxes  in consisted of the cumulative effect of the change in accounting for unbilled revenues of million  gain on sale of the texas panhandle properties of million  and recognition of deferred revenues related to a favorable irs private letter ruling of million 
one time items  net of taxes  in consisted of the recognition of regulatory disallowances of million and reorganization costs of million 
additional information concerning these one time items is set forth in notes     and  which are incorporated here by reference 
earnings applicable to common stock before one time items in were million less than in this decrease resulted from increases in interest charges and labor benefits expenses partially offset by increased base revenue and decreased income taxes

these items affect customer rates but do not affect operating income 
annual variances are discussed under results of operations operating expenses 
excluding the effects of one time items  base revenues exceeded base revenues by million 
the increase is primarily due to rate increases in both texas million annualized and new mexico million annualized resulting from settlement agreements in october and may of  respectively 
increased sales also contributed to the base revenue increase 
sales of  gwh in represented a improvement over prior year sales and contributed million to the increase in base revenues 
the increase in sales resulted from increased consumption by all customer classes  and is attributed to warmer weather and customer growth 
the increases for each customer class are residential  commercial  and industrial 
excluding the reduction in customers from the sale of the texas panhandle properties  total customers increased by 
base revenues in exceeded the amount by million 
this increase is also attributable to the settlement agreements  as well as to higher customer usage overall kwh sales increase from increases in the number of residential and commercial customers 
in  of tnp s revenues were generated in texas 
pursuant to a rate case settlement approved by the puct in october  tnp may not increase its base rates in texas prior to march except in certain extraordinary circumstances 
additional information about the settlement is set forth in note tnp currently has no plans to file for a rate increase in new mexico in the near term 
tnp is aggressively pursuing arrangements with industrial customers that benefit both the customer and tnp 
one industrial customer has switched from self generation and is expected to increase annual sales by gwh and provide million of additional base revenues beginning in mid tnp is actively negotiating with another major industrial customer providing annual revenues of million in million in base revenues 
this customer is constructing a mw cogeneration plant  the first phase of which is expected to commence operations in tnp is negotiating with the customer to continue providing electrical services to the customer 
if tnp is successful  revenues from this customer are expected to be at lower profit margins 
operating expenses operating expenses for were million lower than in  excluding the million reorganization costs in the decrease is primarily due to lower pass through expenses of million and labor benefits expenses of million offset by increased income tax expense of million 
operating expenses for  excluding reorganization costs  decreased by million as compared to this decrease is primarily due to lower pass through expenses of million and income tax expense of million partially offset by increases in labor benefits expenses of million 
page pass through expenses pass through expenses consist of purchased power  fuel  and standby power 
the overall decreases are primarily due to lower costs of purchased power offset by increased fuel expense 
purchased power 
purchased power in and decreased million and million  respectively  as compared to the corresponding prior years 
purchases for texas service areas were shifted to lower cost suppliers for supplemental summer peaking capacity 
this arrangement became effective may   and is expected to result in annualized cost savings of million 
during  tnp actively intervened in a texas rate case of a major supplier and is benefiting with annualized cost savings of million 
purchases for new mexico service areas were also shifted to lower cost suppliers beginning mid and continuing in tnp s customers directly benefit from these cost reductions as these expenses are recovered through adjustment clauses 
purchased power costs represent tnp s largest operating expense 
in  tu was tnp s largest supplier of purchased power in texas and is tnp s highest price supplier 
as described in note  tnp has notified tu of its intent to cease purchasing full requirements power and energy effective january  in july  tnp issued requests for proposals for purchased power resources during through to replace the power currently provided by tu 
fuel 
fuel expense in and increased million and million  excluding amounts of nonpass through fuel expenditures  respectively  as compared to the corresponding prior years 
fuel expense is directly related to an increased fixed fuel recovery factor approved by the puct in connection with the texas rate case settlement 
the majority of tnp s fuel expense is recovered in revenues and any difference from actual costs is deferred until a new factor is established under a fuel factor reconciliation hearing 
the current fixed fuel factor was established to recover current expense as well as any under recovered fuel 
the under recovered amount at december   was million 
also  contributing to the recovery of under recovered fuel is a reduction in the cost of lignite coal or million annually 
additional information about the cost of coal is set forth in note in management s opinion  the current fixed fuel factor along with the fuel cost reduction should enable the recovery of under recovered fuel costs by the second half of originally  the recovery of under recovered fuel costs was expected by the second half of  however  increased standby purchases in connection with outages at tnp one and increased economy sales  to which the fixed fuel factor does not apply  have delayed the recovery of under recovered fuel costs 
economy sales were higher because of the increasing number of renegotiated contracts with industrial customers 
labor benefits expenses other operating expense was million lower in than in payroll and payroll related items decreased million  primarily as a result of the reorganization 
offsetting these savings were the costs of employee incentive compensation plans adopted in  increases in customer collection costs  outsourcing  outside services  wage and salary increases  and other administrative expenses 
labor benefits expenses increased million from to labor increased million due to a general wage increase implemented in january  the first such adjustment since tnp also restored employer matching contributions to the k thrift plan in july matching contributions had been discontinued since january  interest charges the million decrease in interest charges resulted from reduced long term debt levels and decreased interest rates associated with the new credit facility 
contributing to reduced debt levels were the retirement of million of series t fmbs in october with proceeds from the sale of the texas panhandle properties and lower average borrowings under tnp s credit facilities 
increased profitability during as previously discussed at results of operations overall results enabled tnp to reduce its average borrowings under the its credit facilities 
interest charges are expected to decrease during for three reasons 
first  management expects to use available cash flow to reduce borrowings under the new credit facility in second  tnp will experience a full year effect of the million series t fmbs retirement million annually 
third  the reduced interest rate margin associated with the new credit facility will contribute to lower interest charges 
annual interest charges during increased by million as compared to the increase resulted from the issuance of million of debt during september which replaced debt with lower interest rates 
issuing these securities enabled tnp to extend maturities and utilize prepayment subsequent reborrowing provisions of the remaining debt outstanding under its previous credit facilities  which were used to finance tnp s acquisition of tnp one 
page liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity as discussed in note  tnp entered into the new credit facility on november   amending its previous credit facilities 
tnp s improved cash flow from operations resulted in significant reductions in outstanding principal balances associated with its credit facilities 
as of december   the unused commitment under the new credit facility was million 
tnp can borrow only million of the unused commitment unless it pledges fmbs equal in principal amount to total new credit facility borrowings over million 
capital resources both tnpe s and tnp s capital structure improved during as tnp was able to reduce debt levels due to the sale of the texas panhandle properties see note and the significant earnings improvement described at results of operations overall results 
the equity portion of tnpe s capital structure increased from at december   to at december  conversely  the long term debt ratio decreased from to for the same period 
tnp experienced similar results with its capital ratios 
tnp also retired million of preferred stock during tnp s capital requirements through are projected to be as follows amounts in millions fmb and secured debenture maturities see note capital expenditures total capital requirements at the end of the outstanding balance under the new credit facility was million  which will be due in the new credit facility provides greater financial flexibility to tnp 
in addition to lower interest rate margins  the new credit facility is available to retire other outstanding long term debt 
tnp believes that cash flow from operations and periodic borrowings under the new credit facility will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements and fund planned capital requirements through tnp expects to use the new credit facility to redeem maturing debt in borrowings under the new credit facility may be supplemented  however  by issuing other long term debt or a capital contribution from the proceeds of a tnpe common stock sale 
other matters in march  fasb issued sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas requires that long lived assets and certain intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in october  fasb issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas permits companies to retain the current approach set forth in apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  for recognizing stock based compensation 
however  companies are encouraged to adopt a new accounting method based on estimated fair values 
companies that do not follow the new fair value based method will be required to provide expanded disclosures in their financial statements 
management believes that adopting sfas and sfas in will not have a material effect on tnpe s and tnp s consolidated financial position or results of operations
