management of the company intends  in the long term  to continue to expand its fleet 
at june   negotiations for the purchase of new tractors and new trailers were in process 
fiscal year tractor purchases will be offset by the trade in of older models resulting in a net addition of tractors to the company s fleet 
expected acquisition costs for both tractors and trailers  net of tractor and trailer trade in allowances  will approximate million 
the company plans to finance these acquisitions through long term debt or lease agreements 
the decision to lease or buy depends on general economic factors  including interest rates and liquidity considerations 
although the terms for these acquisitions have not been finalized  management believes that long term financing  or lease agreements on favorable terms will be available 
management further believes that revenue generated from the operation of an expanded fleet will be sufficient to amortize obligations related to such expansion 
however  to the extent that such revenue is insufficient for this purpose  the company may be required to rely on additional borrowings or equity offerings to meet its working capital needs 
inflation inflation continues to have a minimal impact on operations 
seasonality in the trucking industry generally  results of operations show a seasonal pattern because customers reduce shipments during the winter 
the company s operating efficiency historically decreases during the winter months due to increased maintenance costs  reduced fuel efficiency  detours and delays for weather
