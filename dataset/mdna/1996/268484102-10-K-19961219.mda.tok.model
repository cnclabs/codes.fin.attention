item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
general during the past two fiscal years  the company s revenues increased at a compound annual rate of to million in the fiscal year ended september  from million in the fiscal year ended september   and its operating income increased at a compound annual rate of to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the company s recent growth has been generated almost exclusively by increasing the number of terminals operated by the company and growth in revenue produced by existing terminals 
since october   it has added terminals  increasing the total to at september  at that date  of these terminals had been open less than months 
the company plans to continue to expand its terminal network 
the company currently plans to open terminals in approximately additional cities in fiscal such plans  however  are subject to change based on a variety of factors 
the expansion of the company s terminals is expected to occur primarily in the united states  although the company plans to selectively pursue opportunities to expand outside of the united states  particularly in canada and mexico 
the company may complement its internal expansion with selective acquisitions 
the opening of a new terminal generally has an initial negative impact on profitability due to operating losses of the new terminal 
the opening of a new terminal generally does not require significant capital expenditures 
additionally  personnel costs are contained at the time of the opening of a new terminal because commissions are generally not paid until salesmen achieve minimum sales levels and until managers achieve terminal profitability 
although future new terminals may be opened in cities smaller than those in which the company s more mature terminals are located  the company believes the results of new terminals should benefit from a ready base of business provided by its existing customers 
although no acquisitions have been made through september   the company may consider acquisitions to complement new terminal openings 
the company has recently begun to expand its international freight forwarding business 
international shipments typically generate higher revenues per shipment than domestic shipments 
the company anticipates that the costs of transportation for international freight will be higher than for domestic freight as a percentage of such revenues  resulting in lower gross margins than domestic shipments  however  the company does not expect its operating expenses to increase in proportion to such revenues 
the company also intends to continue the growth of its local pick up and delivery operations 
by providing local pick up and delivery services with respect to shipments for which it is the freight forwarder  the company has been able to increase its gross margin with respect to such shipments because its costs to provide such services are less than the third party charges it previously paid 
however  the company s local pick up and delivery services provided to other non forwarding customers generate a lower gross margin than the company s domestic forwarding operations due to their higher transportation costs as a percentage of revenues 
effective october   eagle elected to be treated as an s corporation under subchapter s of the internal revenue code and comparable provisions of certain state tax laws 
from october  until the termination of its s corporation status  the company paid no federal income tax 
for financial reporting purposes  for periods prior to the company s initial public offering  eagle recorded a provision for state income taxes for all states in which it operated 
the company also has recorded for fiscal and the federal income tax liability for each of its subsidiaries  which had paid federal income taxes 
shortly prior to the initial public offering in december  eagle s status as an s corporation was terminated and for periods thereafter  eagle has been liable for federal income taxes and state income taxes in certain states 
prior to the closing of the initial public offering  eagle declared distributions payable both in cash and in the form of the special distribution notes in an amount equal to all of eagle s undistributed s corporation earnings up through such closing 
the company has no plans to pay any dividends or distributions in the foreseeable future 
on october   the company purchased a interest in eagle freight services  inc and c d freight services of california  inc 
from a third party and  during fiscal purchased a interest in freight services management  inc from the company s chairman of the board and initiated operation of eagle usa transportation services  inc and eagle usa import brokers  inc the eagle subsidiaries 
the remaining interests in the eagle subsidiaries were purchased from the company s chairman of the board immediately prior to the closing of the initial public offering in december because eagle controlled the eagle subsidiaries  results for fiscal and reflect the operations of all of the eagle subsidiaries as if they had been owned by the company as of the beginning of the period presented 
the company has experienced significant growth in the past through increases in sales at existing terminals and opening new terminals 
the company anticipates that its growth strategy in the future will include internal growth in its domestic and international freight forwarding  local pick up and delivery and truck brokerage business  and could also include acquisitions 
the company s ability to continue its growth will depend on a number of factors  including existing and emerging competition  the ability to open new terminals  the ability to maintain profit margins in the face of competitive pressures  the continued recruitment  training and retention of operating employees  the strength of demand for its services and the availability of capital to support such growth and the ability to identify  negotiate and fund acquisitions when appropriate 
international operations are likely to involve increased costs and risks including those related to foreign regulation  intensified competition  currency fluctuations and exchange controls 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in implementing any of its business strategy and plans for future growth
