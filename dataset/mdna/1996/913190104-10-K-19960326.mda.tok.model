new accounting standards in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for stock based employee compensation plans

however  sfas no 
also permits the measurement of compensation costs using the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
the accounting requirements of this new standard are effective for transactions entered into in fiscal years that begin after december  although the company has not made a decision as to which method it will utilize  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on the financial position or results of operations of the company 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
effects of inflation operating income from utility operations is normally not materially affected by inflation because cost increases generally lead to proportionate increases in revenues allowed through the regulatory process 
however  there is a lag in the recovery of higher expenses through the regulatory process  and therefore  high inflation could have a detrimental effect on the company until rate increases are received 
conversely  lower inflation and lower interest rates tend to result in reductions in the rates of return allowed by the utility commissions  as has occurred over the last several years
