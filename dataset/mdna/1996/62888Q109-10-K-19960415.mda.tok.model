products under development headsets nb pcu 
the company is working with a leading manufacturer and supplier of aircraft cabin products on the integration of nct s ear peace tm active noise control technology into in flight passenger entertainment systems 
as a component of the system  nct is also developing a low cost headset specifically for in flight use to be used in conjunction with the integrated electronics 
nct s technology electronically reduces aircraft engine noise while enhancing the audibility of desired sounds like speech  music and warning signals 
lowering the engine drone can help alleviate the anxiety and fatigue often associated with flying 
while the system is in use  passengers inside an aircraft cabin can carry on conversations at a comfortable level or hear in flight movies and music without over amplification and distortion 
production systems should be available in the latter part of advanced digital electronic headsets 
nct is working to develop advanced headset models using its proprietary digital technology 
management believes that there is a broad market for specialty industrial headsets that will permit factory and assembly workers to operate close to loud machinery in the marine  steel  textile  paper  construction  road building and metalworking industries  among others 
conventional ear muffs and protectors are not as effective as the company s active headsets  which can selectively block machinery noise while allowing the worker to listen to ordinary human communications and  where appropriate  to hear warning signals  tones or bells 
the company is working to develop headset models that will operate on a lightweight  rechargeable battery pack  thus allowing the worker to move freely about the factory 
communications active noise reduction for telephone handsets 
nct is currently working to integrate its proprietary active noise control technology  earpeace tm  into telephone handsets 
the earpeace tm is scheduled for production in the most appropriate application for handsets incorporating this technology is in environments where the loud ambient background noise impedes communications intelligibility and interferes with the comfort of the user 
examples of such environments include aircraft cabins  noisy factory floors  large telemarketing environments and phones located on street corners and highways 
silicon micromachined microphone smm 
in  nct purchased the exclusive rights to manufacture and commercialize a silicon micromachined microphone 
a small  compact  surface mountable silicon actuator  the smm provides customers with improved and adjustable sensitivity  a low noise floor and resistance to environmental extremes 
the ability to integrate additional circuitry on the smm chip has also proven attractive to potential users 
the smm s low noise floor and adjustable sensitivity improve voice recognition in high ambient noise environments 
nct is working with voice processing and computer hardware companies to utilize the smm to enhance the performance of their systems 
in  the company signed a memorandum of understanding with a major semiconductor manufacturer to build the smm 
in the first quarter of  the manufacturer released initial prototypes of the devices 
this manufacturer is currently refining the manufacturing process and identifying a facility for production 
production of two general purpose smms is expected to commence in the first quarter of nct audio top down surround sound tm  tdss tm is a novel automobile audio speaker system developed by the company 
initial demonstrations and listener tests have indicated a high degree of enthusiasm for the high impact sound tm which tdss tm generates 
the company is in the process of developing teaming agreements with major participants in the automobile audio speaker market and is also exploring applications for high impact sound tm technology in the home audio and home theater environments 
flat panel transducers tm  using a similar fpt tm technology to that employed in tdss tm  multi media fpt tm targets such applications as notebook computers and video telephones 
in these applications the slim profile of the fpt tm offers an audio transducer solution where room may be lacking to implement a conventional speaker 
small fans household appliances 
nct has developed fan quieting systems for multiple applications  including a quiet kitchen hood fan and a quiet vacuum cleaner 
nct s active fan systems are designed with higher efficiency than conventional fans and have demonstrated up to a reduction in energy usage 
the cost sensitivity of the consumer appliance marketplace has been a barrier to prior introduction of this technology 
as a result of relationships nct enjoys with its component supply joint venture partners  the company believes that the price sensitivity issues of consumer product markets can be addressed in the near term as miniaturization of the technology continues and the unit cost of nct s electronic components continues to decline 
management believes that nct s proprietary technology will be incorporated in a wide range of other products  including air conditioners  dishwashers  clothes washers and dryers  hair dryers and other types of fans 
the company expects to begin shipping kitchen hood systems in the last half of panels and enclosures electric utility transformers 
electric power distribution by utilities requires the use of large transformers  often placed in residential and commercial neighborhoods  which emit a low frequency hum that irritates people living and working nearby 
utilities try to mask this noise by passive means  although usually not very successfully 
the company has developed active enclosure and active panel systems which reduce the hum of transformer noise by use of flat actuators that cause the enclosure or panels to vibrate in a manner to reduce the noise 
the company can install its active panel system directly to the metal sides or skin of an installed transformer  thus making its systems available to retrofit markets as well as to oems 
as an alternative  an active enclosure can be built to house the transformer 
in march  the company entered into an agreement with quietpower systems  inc  qsi see item certain relationships and related transactions and note notes to the consolidated financial statements by which qsi received the exclusive rights to market  sell and distribute transformer quieting products and gas turbine quieting products in the utility industry 
under the agreement qsi funds development of the systems 
the agreement generally provides that the company manufactures the products and receives a royalty of from qsi on the sales of the products

the company has never declared nor paid cash dividends on its common stock 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general business environment the company is in transition from a firm focused principally on research and development of new technology to a firm focused on the commercialization of its technology through technology licensing fees  royalties and product sales 
in prior years  the company derived the majority of its revenues from engineering and development funding provided by established companies willing to assist the company in the development of its active noise and vibration control technology  and from technology licensing fees paid by such companies 
the company s strategy generally has been to obtain technology licensing fees when initiating joint ventures and alliances with new strategic partners 
revenues from product sales were limited to sales of specialty products and prototypes 
in  the company received approximately of its operating revenues from engineering and development funding  compared with in since  revenues from product sales have been increasing and management expects that technology licensing fees  royalties and product sales will become the principal source of the company s revenue as the commercialization of its technology proceeds 
as a result of the acquisition of certain anvt assets  the company is now the exclusive licensee of ten seminal patents  the chaplin patents  through its wholly owned subsidiary  cph 
the company s ability to license the chaplin patents directly to unaffiliated third parties provides the company with a greater ability to earn technology licensing fees and royalties from such patents 
further  the company believes that its intellectual property portfolio prevents other competitors and potential competitors in the field of active wave management tm from participating in certain commercial areas without licenses from the company 
notes and to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the liquidity and capital resources section which follows describe the current status of the company s available cash balances and the uncertainties which exist that raise substantial doubt as to the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
at a board of directors meeting on july   the following executive changes were implemented the company s former executive vice president was appointed president and the then co chairman of the board  chief executive officer and president retained the positions of co chairman of the board and chief executive officer 
as previously disclosed  the company has implemented changes in its organization and focus  beginning in late additionally  in late the company redefined its corporate mission to be the worldwide leader in the advancement and commercialization of active wave management tm technology 
active wave management tm is the electronic and or mechanical manipulation of sound or signal waves to reduce noise  improve signal to noise ratio and or enhance sound quality 
this redefinition is the result of the development of new technologies  as previously noted  such as asf tm  tdss tm  fpt tm  and the smm  which create products that the company believes will be utilized in areas beyond noise and vibration reduction and control 
these technologies and products are consistent with shifting the company s focus to technology licensing fees  royalties and products that represent near term revenue generation 
the redefinition of corporate mission is reflected in the revised business plan which the company began to implement in the first quarter of as distribution channels are established and as product sales and market acceptance and awareness of the commercial applications of active wave management tm build  revenues from technology licensing fees  royalties and product sales are forecasted to fund an increasing share of the company s requirements 
the funding from these sources  if realized  will reduce the company s dependence on engineering and development funding 
the beginning of this process is shown in the shifting percentages of operating revenue  discussed below 
in december  the company adopted a plan that management believed would generate sufficient funds for the company to continue its operations into during  the company generated million in license fees and million in product sales 
while the company has exceeded its expectations through december regarding technology licensing fees  production delays and market acceptance have slowed new product sales 
operating expenses have been reduced throughout and were less than projected in the plan adopted in december success in generating technology licensing fees  royalties and product sales are significant and critical to the company s ability to overcome its present financial difficulties 
the company cannot predict whether it will be successful in obtaining market acceptance of its new products or in completing its current negotiations with respect to licenses and royalty revenues 
from the company s inception through december   its operating revenues  including technology licensing fees and royalties  product sales and engineering and development services  have consisted of approximately product sales  engineering and development services and technology licensing fees 
the company has entered into a number of alliances and strategic relationships with established firms for the integration of its technology into products 
the speed with which the company can achieve the commercialization of its technology depends in large part upon the time taken by these firms and their customers for product testing  and their assessment of how best to integrate the technology into their products and into their manufacturing operations 
while the company works with these firms on product testing and integration  it is not always able to influence how quickly this process can be completed 
the company began shipping proactive tm headsets in the company is now selling products through three of its alliances walker is manufacturing and selling industrial silencers  siemens is buying and contracting with the company to install quieting headsets for patient use in siemens mri machines  and in the fourth quarter of ultra began installing production model aircraft cabin quieting systems in the saab turboprop aircraft 
management believes these developments and those previously disclosed help demonstrate the range of commercial potential for the company s technology and will contribute to the company s transition from engineering and development to technology licensing fees  royalties and product sales 
the availability of high quality  low cost electronic components for integration into the company s products also is critical to the commercialization of the company s technology 
the company is working with its strategic partners and other suppliers to reduce the size and cost of the company s systems  so that the company will be able to offer low cost electronics and other components suitable for high volume production 
the company has continued to make substantial investments in its technology and intellectual property and has incurred development costs for engineering prototypes  pre production models and field testing of several products 
during  the company acquired a license to two patents in the field of micro machined microphones and concluded the acquisition of all of the patents  know how and intellectual property of a former competitor  anvt 
management believes that the company s investment in its technology has resulted in the expansion of its intellectual property portfolio and improvement in the functionality  speed and cost of components and products 
the company has become certified under the international standards organization product quality program known as iso  and has successfully undergone two quality audits 
since the third quarter of  the company has reduced its worldwide work force by from to current employees as of march  because the company will not meet its revenue targets for the first quarter of  it has entered into two recent transactions  which provide additional funding as follows on march   the company sold  shares of its common stock in a private placement that provided net proceeds to the company of million

the conversion of the notes and the exercise of the options are both subject to stockholder approval of an appropriate amendment to the company s certificate of incorporation increasing its authorized capital to provide for the requisite shares 
in conjunction with the foregoing sale of common stock and convertible term notes  the company also agreed to file a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec covering the applicable shares and to use its best efforts to have such registration statement declared effective by the sec as soon as practicable 
the relevant agreements provide for significant monetary penalties in the event such registration statement is not declared effective within days of the filing date and in the event its effectiveness is suspended for other than brief permissible periods

the total cash received to date by the company from the above two transactions amounts to million 
refer to notes and notes to the consolidated financial statements 
management believes that the funding provided by increased product sales  technology licensing fees  royalties  and cost savings  if realized  coupled with the additional capital referred to above  some of which is dependent upon shareholder approval of an amendment to the company s certificate of incorporation  should enable the company to continue operations into if the company is not able to increase technology licensing fees  royalties and product sales  or generate additional capital  it will have to further cut its level of operations substantially in order to conserve cash
