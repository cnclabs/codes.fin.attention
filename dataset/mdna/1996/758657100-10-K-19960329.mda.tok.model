item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further discussion of changes in the company s backlog 
us government contracts are subject to termination at the election of the government and contain specific procedures for equitable settlement in the event of termination 
it is not possible to predict whether  or to what extent  the present backlog may be reduced or postponed in the event of reductions or changes in us government programs 
some us government contracts contain fixed price options for future performance and are subject to exercise by the government within specified time periods 
these options are not included in the company s contractual backlog 
british aerospace relationship as a result of transactions occurring between and  british aerospace holds an aggregate of  shares at december   or approximately  of the company s common stock  and  shares of preferred stock which are convertible into an additional  shares of common stock 
during  british aerospace was granted warrants to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at any time prior to august  if british aerospace were to convert its preferred shares to common shares and to exercise its warrants  british aerospace would beneficially own of the company s then outstanding shares of common stock  assuming no shares were otherwise acquired or disposed of by british aerospace  and no additional shares were issued or reacquired by the company 
as the holder of approximately of the outstanding shares of the company s common stock  british aerospace effectively has the power to determine the membership of the company s board of directors  however  british aerospace is subject to restrictions contained in a special security agreement ssa between the company  british aerospace and the united states department of defense 
under the terms of the ssa  only two of a total of seven directors may have a past or present affiliation with british aerospace 
in addition as a result of their significant ownership in the company  british aerospace effectively has the power to decide other matters submitted for shareholder approval 
on march   the company s bylaws were amended by the board of directors subject to united states defense investigative service approval as provided for under the ssa  to increase the board of directors from seven to a maximum of eight directors  of which three directors may be affiliated with british aerospace 
management believes that the company s relationship with british aerospace has expanded its access to international markets  as well as provided the company with the opportunity to assist a major airframe manufacturer with its internal simulation requirements 
this  in turn  has strengthened reflectone s capacity to serve its existing military and commercial markets  and provided collaborative access to an expanding european market for simulation and training systems

competition training devices 
competitive conditions remain keen in the flight simulator and training device field  which is led by cae industries  ltd 
of canada  thomson csf of france and hughes 
many of the company s competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than the company 
the focus of competition in the simulation training devices industry is not only price  but also the capacity to apply a broad range of technologies  including avionics  electronics  hydraulics  audio and visual effects  and computer programming and control 
in addition  competition on larger programs often focus on the capacity to provide a total training system approach  emphasizing curriculum development and simulator currency in parallel with the development of the primary weapons platform or aircraft system 
competition in the entertainment market for large capacity three and six degrees of freedom motion based simulation products such as those which have been produced to date by the company includes traditional flight simulator companies 
the company s products in this market are also subject to competition from lower cost  less complex  moving seat technology based rides that are offered by various competitors with backgrounds from a variety of industries 
performance history and product quality  particularly with respect to cost and schedule performance  have become significant competitive discriminators for both government and commercial business 
in recognition of its commitment to total quality management  the company has been certified to be in compliance with international standards organization quality system standard iso 
in addition to its individual marketing initiatives  the company continues to seek to exploit opportunities for the sale of its technology and capability as a team member with other contractors for major united states and international military contracts 
reflectone s ability to be competitive in its training devices segment is based upon its expertise in the fields of fixed wing and helicopter simulation  its three and six degrees of freedom motion systems  its ability to manage major subcontractors in engineering disciplines outside its own capabilities  and its experience in contractor logistics support 
training services 
competition for contracts requiring the contractor to provide maintenance and or flight simulator and ground support instruction at both customer and company owned training centers is intense and involves a broad range of companies with varying levels of capabilities 
primarily as a result of this intense competition  the company which provides the lowest price solution to the customer s requirements is generally successful in receiving the award 
as evidenced by awards in the past several years  management believes that the company is well positioned to pursue opportunities to provide training services in this cost competitive market 
systems management 
competition for large total training system programs has traditionally been concentrated in the large aerospace companies such as loral corporation  mcdonnell douglas  and hughes 
these large aerospace companies often team with niche suppliers to provide comprehensive solutions in response to highly complex proposal requests  and the company continues to pursue opportunities to selectively participate in such teaming arrangements

item legal proceedings in january  the company filed a notice of appeal with the armed services board of contract appeals asbca in response to a final decision by a us government contracting officer denying the company s claim in excess of million on a contract with the united states air force for c c aerial refueling parts task trainers 
the primary basis of the company s claim was that performance under the contract was commercially impracticable in that it required technology beyond the state of the art  and that the government had superior knowledge in this regard prior to contract award which it failed to divulge to the company 
the case is complex and factually intensive and thereby reliant on extensive factual and expert testimony 
a formal claim hearing was completed in march before the asbca judge assigned  and a decision on entitlement continues to be delayed by the asbca judge  but is expected during a portion of the claim value has been recorded in the company s consolidated financial statements and is classified as unrecovered costs subject to future negotiation

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
the company has various relationships  contracts and agreements with british aerospace  plc 
bae and its direct and indirect subsidiaries herein collectively referred to as british aerospace 
approximately of the common stock of the company is owned by british aerospace holdings  inc baehi  a wholly owned subsidiary of bae 
on june   the company purchased from british aerospace  all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of british aerospace simulation ltd 
the acquired business was renamed reflectone uk limited rukl 
rukl s products utilize technology which is complementary to the products produced by the company s training devices segment and are marketed worldwide  primarily to government customers 
liquidity and capital resources management considers liquidity to be the company s ability to generate adequate cash to meet its short and long term business needs 
the principal internal source of such cash is the company s operations  while external sources include borrowings under the company s credit facilities and the issuance of equity securities 
net cash generated from operating activities during was million  compared to net cash used by operating activities of million in during  cash was generated primarily by net income plus or minus noncash expending depreciation and amortization  and deferred income taxes  increases in advance billings  accounts payable  and accrued employee compensation and benefits  and reductions in inventory and affiliate receivables 
increases in non affiliate receivables partially offset the cash generated 
operating cash flow was negatively impacted in by net losses less noncash expending depreciation and amortization  increases in non affiliate receivables  prepaid expenses and other current assets and reductions in due to affiliate and advance billings 
increases in customer receivables during include the effects of a contract to construct a jetstream simulator for an affiliate 
during  the increase in customer receivables also reflected the funding of million for long term financing associated with the sale of a boeing full flight simulator to an unaffiliated customer 
the significant capital expenditures during primarily related to the construction during and of two simulators used in the company s tampa training center and the british aerospace owned training center managed by the company 
based on current plans for capital expenditures  management does not anticipate constructing full flight simulators for its training centers during in december  the company sold to british aerospace  the company owned jetstream simulator used in the british aerospace owned dulles training center for million 
in december  the company completed a sale and leaseback of the company owned c h full flight simulator utilized in the tampa training center 
under the terms of the lease agreement  the company was required to escrow million of the million proceeds from the transaction to be held as collateral in the event of a default under the lease agreement 
a portion of the escrowed funds are subject to future release to the company based on the company s attainment of certain income and net worth levels  and a portion of the funds are scheduled for periodic release over the initial ten years of the lease 
rental payments under the lease approximate million annually 
during the year ended december   the company reduced its short term borrowings and reduced its cash by million and million  respectively 
during the same period  gross borrowings of million  reductions in cash balances and cash provided by the sale of the company owned jetstream simulator and funding from operating activities were used to fund million in scheduled maturities of borrowings under the company s credit facilities 
during the year ended december   the company increased its short term borrowings and increased its cash by million and million  respectively 
gross borrowings of million during were used primarily to fund million in scheduled maturities of borrowings under the company s credit facilities  to complete construction of the company owned and operated jetstream full flight simulator  and to fund operating activities 
to date the company has been unable to obtain adequate financing on acceptable terms without recourse to british aerospace 
however  subject to the terms and conditions contained in the agreement for credit availability dated as of august   british aerospace has agreed to continue to provide or guarantee the company s current credit facilities at their current levels through july  renewal of the company s credit facilities beyond july  is  in large part  dependent upon british aerospace s willingness to continue to provide or guarantee these facilities 
by means of a letter dated february   british aerospace has represented to the company that it intends to continue to provide or guarantee the company s credit facilities  as long as financing is not available to the company without recourse to british aerospace and british aerospace continues to hold  or has the ability to hold through the exercise of preferred stock conversion rights and warrants to purchase common stock  a majority ownership position in the company 
based on the foregoing representations of british aerospace  management anticipates that the company s current credit facilities will be renewed annually 
specific discussion of the company s credit facilities is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  the company will not receive payments from lockheed martin corporation lmc under the terms of the c j contract until the achievement of certain contractual milestones  currently scheduled for the fourth quarter of accordingly  during the third quarter of  the company negotiated a second credit facility the c j facility with british aerospace to finance the company s working capital needs with respect to the c j contract with lmc 
the c j facility currently provides for borrowings aggregating up to million and matures on july  at december   the company had million drawn under the c j facility 
draws under this facility are limited to actual costs incurred by the company and rukl on the lmc c j program 
by means of a letter dated february   british aerospace has further represented that as long as british aerospace continues to hold  or has the ability to hold through the exercise of preferred stock conversion rights and warrants to purchase common stock  a majority ownership position in the company  it intends to continue to provide annual financing for the c j program until payment is received from lmc 
based on current schedules  the contract is estimated to require incremental funding of million in and million in while the cost of financing this program is being recovered through the contract with lmc  an increase in interest rates or an extension of the scheduled delivery dates could result in financing costs in excess of that priced into the contract 
the company s cash flows are impacted  in the normal course of business  by the company s ability to book new profitable business and achieve scheduled program milestones on a timely basis 
the achievement of program milestones  in turn  provides for and enables contractually defined amounts to be billed to the customer 
often these amounts are significant and  as a result  failure to achieve payment milestones can dramatically impact the company s credit requirements 
as described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  management has anticipated recovery of certain costs incurred arising out of customer occasioned contract delays and amounts for work performed but not specified in express contract provisions 
the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements represent only a portion of the total compensation sought by the company from the customers 
therefore  while any and all recoveries are subject to future negotiations  actual recoveries could be less or more than those currently anticipated 
any amounts awarded in excess of that anticipated in the company s consolidated financial statements represent an additional capital resource to the company 
it is anticipated that any actual recoveries of the projected amounts may not be collected within the next twelve months 
based upon the availability under its current credit facilities and anticipated renewals thereof  anticipated increases in the c j facility  projected cash flows from current and future programs with achievement of projected program milestones  anticipated reductions in restricted investments  expected resolution and recovery of costs subject to future negotiation as described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  and income tax benefits available for future use  management believes that the company s capital resources are adequate to meet its foreseeable business needs  on both a short and long term basis 
results of operations consolidated revenues increased by million  or during as compared to  which reflected a increase from the year 
the increase was the result of increases in revenues from all of the company s three business segments 
revenues of the training devices segment inclusive of intersegment transactions  increased by million  or during as compared to  which represented a reduction from the increase in revenues included approximately million from the recent award of the lmc c j program 
affiliate revenues of the training devices segment were million higher in compared to and million lower in compared to the increase in affiliate revenues reflects revenues from three programs in varying stages of completion for the construction of commercial aircraft simulators 
revenues of the training services segment inclusive of intersegment transactions  increased by million  or during as compared to  which represented a increase from the training services segment provides training services on customer and company owned or leased devices to the us government and commercial aircraft operators 
the increase in revenues of the training services segment in and was primarily the result of increased revenues on existing contracts with the us government and revenues earned on the jetstream simulator installed during at the british aerospace owned  company managed training center near dulles international airport 
revenues of the systems management segment increased by million  or during as compared to  which reflected a million  or decrease from the systems management segment manages complex programs requiring the services of both the training devices and training services segments 
the increase in revenues related to the third quarter award of a contract from an affiliate for a c h simulator for ultimate delivery to an international customer 
the company s income loss from operations was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in income from operations reflects increased revenues and profitability in each of the company s three business segments 
the income loss before income taxes of the training devices segment was million   and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the operating results of the training devices segment reflect the favorable results associated with the achievement of critical program milestones  primarily on a large affiliate program and an international military program 
these favorable results were  in part  offset by a charge of million to operations reflecting a reduction in management s estimate of amounts recoverable from customers for customer occasioned contract delays and work performed but not specified in express contract provisions 
operating profits of the training devices segment often reflect large profit margin swings as a result of profit recognition occurring late in the lives of programs with developmental risk reflecting revisions to management s risk assessments based on evaluations of each program s status at critical program milestones 
operating results of the training devices segment for the years ended december   and  include income losses from operations of rukl of  million and  respectively 
the losses of rukl in and primarily resulted from the recording of loss provisions due to escalations of costs on three large prototype programs to develop tactical air defense trainers 
these programs were completed during the operating results of rukl also reflect losses resulting from insufficient business base to fully absorb indirect costs 
in addition to the losses of rukl  the operations of the training devices segment reflected underabsorption of indirect costs of the company s tampa operation as a result of a lower than anticipated level of operations due to delays in the receipt of new program awards 
the operating results of the training devices segment  excluding rukl  reflected the favorable results associated with the achievement of critical program milestones  primarily on two large affiliate programs 
the income before income taxes of the training services segment was million  million and million for the years ended december   and the increased profits in each period resulted from the increased volume in the training service segment 
the income loss before income taxes of the systems management segment was million   and  for the years ended december   and the operating profit reflects profit recognition upon the award of a contract from an affiliate for the sale of the company s partially completed c h simulator from inventory 
the operating losses reflect the recognition of program losses on a large international program 
the income loss before income taxes in was also impacted by recording a provision of million to general and administrative costs for future costs associated with the company s assertion of its rights to recovery of certain amounts claimed from customers for customer occasioned contract delays and work performed but not specified in express contract provisions 
interest income approximated   and  during   and  respectively 
interest income is primarily interest earned on long term notes receivable  restricted investments and temporary cash investments 
interest expense in increased by million over s amount primarily as a result of higher borrowings outstanding during the year and higher interest rates on those borrowings 
during interest costs of  associated with the company s financing of the c j program were charged to the c j program and reflected in cost of sales rather than as interest expense 
interest expense in increased by  over s amount primarily as a result of higher borrowings outstanding during the year 
during and  interest capitalized in conjunction with the construction of simulators for use in the company s training services segment was  and  respectively 
the increase in the provision for income taxes in as compared to results from a higher estimate of taxable income for federal and state income tax purposes 
the provision for income taxes differs from the amounts computed by applying the federal statutory tax rate to income before taxes primarily as a result of the availability of net operating loss carry forwards to reduce taxable income and investment tax credits to reduce the tax provision 
in and  alternative minimum tax liability arising from timing differentials associated with the depreciation of fixed assets and specific limitations on the usage of net operating loss carryforwards also contributed to the difference in the provision for income taxes from the federal statutory tax rate 
during  the company recorded a deferred tax asset of million  for which recovery in future periods is not dependent upon future taxable income 
at december   the company had available investment tax credits of  alternative minimum tax credits of  and net operating loss carryforwards in the united kingdom of million 
the investment tax credits expire in varying amounts beginning in and extending through the alternative minimum tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards in the united kingdom can generally be carried forward indefinitely 
specific discussion of the company s income tax provision and net deferred tax assets is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
backlog contractual backlog increased to million at december   from million at december  of the contractual backlog at december   consisted of orders of the training devices segment  consisted of orders of the training services segment and consisted of orders of the systems management segment 
this compares to  and  respectively at december  contractual backlog for rukl  included in the training devices segment backlog  was million at december  compared to million at december  the increase in contractual backlog of rukl primarily relates to the award of the c j program for million during contractual backlog of the systems management segment includes the september award of a contract from an affiliate to manufacture a c h simulator for ultimate delivery to an international customer and to provide related maintenance support and training services 
contract awards within the training services segment to provide training to us military personnel are generally awarded annually and recorded during the fourth calendar quarter 
this results in a declining backlog for the training services segment during the first three calendar quarters 
during the third quarter  the company lost in competition  reprocurements relating to four training services contracts in which it was the incumbent contractor 
these contracts represented approximately million of annual revenues 
primarily as a result of intense competition for training services contracts  the company providing the lowest price solution to the customer s requirements is generally successful in receiving the award 
as evidenced by awards in the past several years  management believes that the company is well positioned to continue to pursue opportunities to provide training services in this cost competitive market 
not included in contractual backlog are announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed and unobligated contract options under us government contracts 
factors that may affect future results the company s future operating results may be affected by a number of factors  many of which are beyond the company s control  including uncertainties relative to global economic conditions  political instability  the economic strength of governments  levels of us government and international defense spending  military and commercial aircraft industry trends  and the company s ability to successfully increase market share in its training devices segment while expanding its product base into other markets 
in recent years  the markets into which the company sells its training device products have been depressed  and the number of units sold into these markets has decreased from prior periods 
as a result  competition for available training device opportunities has increased  resulting in lower margins on devices constructed 
in addition  the simulation and training industry has been characterized by continuing industry consolidation  rapid technological advances resulting in frequent introduction of new products and product enhancements  and very competitive pricing practices 
the company has responded to these market conditions by diversifying into new markets and by seeking the formation of strategic teaming arrangements with airframe manufacturers and prime contractors for weapon systems 
as in prior years  the company continues its diversification strategy of pursuing a greater number of opportunities in the training services market 
in addition  with the acquisition of rukl in june and the purchase of certain assets of the microflite product line in early  the company expanded the product lines of the training devices segment and increased the number of opportunities available to it in the european and commercial airline simulation markets 
in november  rukl was selected by lmc as its training systems teammate for the c j program 
this teaming arrangement with lmc resulted in an award worth million during in the pursuit of new business  the company sometimes designs and manufactures prototype training devices which by their nature involve unforeseen design and development risks and exposures 
the company attempts to price these risks in the contract value but nonetheless  the frequency of losses historically experienced on prototype training devices exceed those experienced on follow on devices 
the company attempts to recover its investment in the design and development of prototype devices by winning subsequent programs for follow on devices 
while the lmc program involves the development of prototype c j training devices  management believes that this program has been appropriately priced for unforeseen risks and exposures and anticipates profits in future periods on the program 
the company is also pursuing several other programs which  if awarded  would result in non recurring investment by the company in design and development and could involve risks associated with prototype devices 
the company may experience transaction gains and losses from currency fluctuations related to its international operations 
in order to minimize foreign exchange risk  the company selectively hedges certain of its foreign exchange exposures principally relating to foreign currency accounts payable and accounts receivable 
the company s hedging strategy is facilitated by its ability to borrow foreign currencies under its revolving credit facility and the c j facility provided by british aerospace 
this strategy has reduced the company s vulnerability to certain of its foreign currency exposures  and the company expects to continue this practice in the future to the extent appropriate 
the company does not engage in speculative hedging activities  nor does the company hedge nontransaction related balance sheet exposure 
during and  the company recorded losses of approximately  and  respectively  related to its hedging activities 
the company has entered into contracts to buy forward british pounds with an equivalent value of million to reduce the company s exposure to foreign currency exchange risk associated with the cost of subcontractors and other requirements of the c j program denominated in british pounds 
these contracts mature quarterly in varying amounts from march to june british aerospace is the counterparty to these instruments 
the forward contracts should not subject the company to risk from exchange movement because gains and losses on these contracts offset losses and gains on the transactions being hedged 
however  the amount and timing of the program costs were estimated and changes in these estimates could result in future gains or losses from exchange rate movements
