item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general equipment financing 
for accounting purposes  the company classifies equipment loans it originates as notes secured by equipment  direct financing leases or operating leases 
notes secured by equipment and direct financing leases are generally those transactions in which the obligor has substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership of the equipment 
operating leases are generally those which only provide for the rental of the asset 
the different classifications can result in accounting treatments that provide substantially different income and costs during the transaction term 
direct financing leases and notes secured by equipment are reflected on the company s balance sheet as investment in direct financing leases and notes secured by equipment 
for statement of operations purposes  those transactions result in amortization of finance income over the transaction term in the amounts computed using the interest method 
the company enters into two types of direct financing lease transactions  which are referred to as conditional sales agreements and fair market value transactions 
conditional sales agreements and notes secured by equipment represent those transactions in which no residual interest in the underlying equipment is retained by the company 
fair market value transactions are those transactions in which the company retains a residual interest in the equipment 
this residual interest is recorded on the company s books as an estimate of the projected value of the financed equipment at the end of the transaction term 
at the inception of notes secured by equipment and direct financing lease transactions  unearned income represents the amount by which the gross transaction receivables  initial direct costs and the normal estimated residual value on fair market value transactions exceed equipment cost 
beginning in  the company significantly reduced its emphasis on entering into fair market value transactions and adopted a strategy to reduce the dollar amount of residual interests on its balance sheet 
pursuant to this policy  the percentage of the company s equipment financing transactions structured as loans and conditional sales agreements have increased significantly 
as of june   residual valuation decreased to million from million at june   and from of net financed receivables as of june  to at june  the company believes that loans and conditional sales agreements will constitute a high percentage of its equipment financing transactions in the future 
leases and contracts for the rental of equipment which do not meet the criteria of direct financing leases are accounted for as operating leases 
equipment under an operating lease or a rental contract is recorded on the balance sheet at the company s cost under the caption of equipment on operating leases and depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the equipment 
the company has classified income under the categories of amortization of finance income  other income and gain on sale of financing transactions 
amortization of finance income consists of the interest component of payments received on notes secured by equipment or medical receivables and direct financing leases  and is calculated using the interest method whereby the income is reported over the term of the transactions 
other income consists primarily of late charges  dividends on investment in investee s preferred stock  income from operating leases  income from receivable purchases and income from billing collecting activities which the company has curtailed 
gain on sales of financing transactions consists of gains recognized when the company permanently funds transactions through whole loan sales 
notes secured by equipment and direct financing lease transactions are all net transactions under which the obligor must make all scheduled payments  maintain the equipment  insure the equipment again casualty loss and pay all equipment related taxes 
in fair market value transactions  at the end of the initial financing term  the obligor has the option either to purchase the equipment for its fair market value  extend the financing term under renegotiated payments or return the equipment to the company 
if the equipment is returned to the company  the company must sell or lease the equipment to another user 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  in transactions classified as notes secured by equipment and direct financing leases that the company permanently funds through securitization or other structured finance transactions which the company treats as debt  income is deferred and recognized using the interest method over the respective term of the transactions 
if an obligor under a transaction defaults  the company may not receive all or a portion of the unamortized income associated with the transaction 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued general  continued medical receivable financing 
in addition to its core equipment finance business  the company provides lines of credit under which the company makes full recourse loans to healthcare providers that are secured by medical receivables and other collateral 
the interest and fee income generated from these loans are recognized over the terms of the lines of credit  which are typically one to three years  and are recorded as amortization of finance income 
results of operations impact of financing strategies on results of operations the company s financing strategy is to obtain permanent funding for most of its equipment loans through securitization and to sell the remainder to reduce borrower concentration and to manage the company s leverage 
when funding loans through securitization  the issuer generally can structure the securitization so that the funding is treated for accounting purposes either as long term debt secured by equipment loans owned by the company  or as a sale 
the accounting method to report finance income differs significantly depending on which of the two structures the issuer uses 
when the company sponsors a securitization it treats the proceeds as long term debt on its financial statements and reports the finance income on the subordinated interest it retains in the securitization over the term of the equipment loans that are funded  whereas when the company sells loans  it recognizes the unamortized finance income at the time the funding takes place  however  even in a funding treated as a sale  the company may recognize servicing and or interest income on its subordinated interest over the remaining term of the equipment loans sold 
over the past two years the company has focused its strategy on increasing its market share 
there can be no assurance that the company s historical growth rate or current profitability can be sustained in the future 
additionally  the company s expense levels are based in part on its expectations as to future financing volumes and the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for a decrease in demand for financing of medical equipment and receivables 
accordingly  operating results may be adversely impacted by future fluctuations in such demand 
the company believes that general economic conditions have not had a material adverse effect on the company s recent operating results 
there can be no assurances  however  that general economic conditions will not have a material adverse effect on the company in the future

liquidity and capital resources general the company s equipment financing business requires substantial amounts of capital and borrowings 
the company obtains warehouse funding from commercial and investment banks 
the company s warehouse borrowings are full recourse obligations  while the company s permanent funding is obtained principally on a limited recourse basis 
in the case of limited recourse funding  the company retains some risk of loss because it shares in any losses incurred and or it may forfeit the residual interest if any the company has in the underlying financed assets should defaults occur 
a substantial portion of the company s debt represents permanent funding of equipment loans obtained on a limited recourse basis and is structured so that the cash flow from the underlying loans services the debt 
most of the company s warehouse borrowings are used to temporarily fund the equipment loans and are repaid with the proceeds obtained from the permanent funding and cash flow from the underlying transactions 
as a result of the rapid growth of the company s equipment financing business  the amount of warehouse and permanent funding it requires has significantly increased 
to meet its requirements for increased warehouse funding  the company has expanded its warehouse facilities with banks  and has obtained warehouse facilities with investment banking firms the company uses for its securitizations 
to meet its requirement for increased permanent funding  the company has enhanced its ability to fund equipment loans by both securitization and whole loan sales 
if suitable sources of both warehouse and permanent funding are not available in the future  the company s growth will be constrained and it may be forced to use less attractive funding sources in order to ensure its liquidity 
working capital financing for equipment financing customers is occasionally provided by the company where the loan is adequately secured by acceptable collateral typically accounts receivable and the company s other credit criteria are satisfied 
in june  the company completed a million private placement of convertible subordinated notes 
the agreement with respect to the convertible subordinated notes contains  among other things  limitations on the company s ability to pay dividends and to make certain other kinds of payments 
that agreement also prohibits the company from incurring additional indebtedness unless certain financial ratio tests are met 
in august  the company completed a public offering of  shares of its common stock for which it received net proceeds of million 
in january  holders of  of the company s warrants and units  issued in february  redeemed their warrants and units for shares of the company s common stock at or per share by the final exercise date of january  as a result of the redemption  the company received cash proceeds of million 
the company believes that its present warehouse and permanent funding sources are sufficient to fund the company s current needs for its equipment financing business 
however  the company will have to expand both its warehouse and permanent funding capacity and obtain additional equity or long term unsecured debt financing in order to meet the company s projected growth of its equipment financing business 
similarly  the future growth of the company s medical receivable financing business will be dependent on the company s ability to continue to obtain suitable funding for that business 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued liquidity and capital resources  continued warehouse facilities at august   the company had available an aggregate of million under various warehouse facilities 
the company s primary credit facility  pursuant to a revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks the agreement  provides for the borrowing of up to million 
borrowings under this facility bear interest based on the company s leverage ratio as defined in the agreement at the company s option of from prime to prime plus 
or from up to over the  or day libor rate 
included in the agreement is an million sub limit for borrowings secured by medical receivables loans originated by the company 
the agreement is renewable annually at the bank syndicate s discretion 
the agreement also provides that if the banks elect not to renew the facility at the end of its stated term  loans then outstanding automatically convert to four year amortizing term loans at slightly higher interest rates 
the agreement prohibits the company from paying dividends other than dividends payable solely in shares of the company s stock and limits borrowings to specified levels determined by ratios based on the company s tangible net worth 
as of june   the company was in compliance with the financial covenants of the agreement 
the company has a million interim funding facility with union bank of switzerland 
this facility is available to fund certain equipment loans which are to be securitized 
loans made under this facility bear interest at a rate of 
over the day libor rate 
borrowings under the facility are secured by certain equipment loans and the equipment financed thereunder 
the facility was closed to further financings on august  in preparation for a securitization 
the company has two credit facilities for its medical receivables financing business 
the first facility is for million with an interest rate of prime plus and matures in march  the second facility is for million with an interest rate  at the company s option  of either prime plus or day libor plus and matures in december in addition  in september the company obtained a million warehouse facility with an investment banking firm 
the company s use of securitization significantly affects its needs for warehouse facilities 
when using securitization  the company is required to hold loans in warehouse facilities until a sufficient quantity is accumulated to meet the various requirements of the credit rating agencies and others involved  and to make a securitization cost effective 
generally  loans totaling to million will be placed in each securitization pool 
when the company borrows funds through warehouse facilities  it is exposed to a certain degree of risk caused by interest rate fluctuations 
although the company s equipment loans are structured and permanently funded on a fixed interest rate basis  it uses warehouse facilities until permanent funding is obtained 
because funds borrowed through warehouse facilities are obtained on a floating interest rate basis  the company uses hedging techniques to protect its interest rate margins during the period that warehouse facilities are used and securitization and sales are anticipated 
the company uses derivative financial instruments  such as forward rate agreements  treasury locks  and interest rate swaps and caps  to manage its interest rate risk 
the derivatives are used to manage three components of this risk interest sensitivity adjustments  hedging anticipated loan securitizations and sales  and interest rate spread protection 
the company s hedging techniques may not necessarily protect it from interest rate related risks in all interest rate environments 
permanent funding methods the company has completed eleven securitizations or other structured finance transactions for medical equipment financings totaling million  including two public debt issues of million and million and nine private placements of debt and whole loan sales totaling million 
in january  the company filed a registration statement registration no 
with the commission to provide for the future issuance of securitized debt in a series of transactions pursuant to the commission s shelf registration rule up to an aggregate of million 
the registration statement was declared effective by the commission on june  the and million public debt issues were the two initial fundings under the million shelf registration 
the company expects to continue to use securitization  on both a public and private basis  as its principal means to permanently fund its loans for the foreseeable future 
if for any item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued liquidity and capital resources  continued reason the company were to become unable to access the securitization market to permanently fund its equipment loans  the consequences for the company would be materially adverse 
in january  the company completed a million private placement securitization of medical receivable loans with a domestic insurance company to fund its medical receivables financing business 
the company s use of securitization significantly affects its liquidity and capital requirements due to the amount of time required to assemble a portfolio of loans to be securitized 
when using securitization  the company is required to hold loans until a sufficient quantity is accumulated so as to attract investor interest and allow for a cost effective placement 
this increases the company s exposure to changes in interest rates and temporarily reduces its warehouse facility liquidity 
generally  the company does not have binding commitments for permanent funding  either through securitization or whole loan sales 
the company has non binding agreements with investment banking entities to fund future equipment loans through securitization 
while the company expects to be able to continue to obtain the permanent funding it requires for its equipment financing business  there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so 
if  for any reason  any of these types of funding were unavailable in the amounts and on terms deemed reasonable by the company  the company s equipment financing activities would be adversely affected 
the company believes cash flows generated from operations and its warehouse facilities are sufficient to meet its near term obligations 
income tax issues historically  the company has deferred a substantial portion of its federal and state income tax liability because of its ability to obtain depreciation deductions from transactions structured as fair market value leases 
over the past months  the proportion of transactions originated by the company structured as fair market value leases has declined significantly  and the company expects that trend will continue 
in addition  the company disposed of a portion of its equipment residual portfolio in fiscal and may continue to do so in future periods 
as a result  the company expects that in future periods its ability to defer its income tax liability will correspondingly decline 
additionally  the company believes its effective tax rate will increase in future periods as a result of higher state tax rates in certain regions in which the company conducts it business 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its operating results during the past three years 
there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future
