this was million more than the million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at september  the principal sources of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were the net proceeds from the company s public stock offerings as well as provided by operating activities 
the principal uses of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities during the year were expenditures to fund software development and purchases and leasing of property and equipment

factors affecting future performance the company s quarterly revenue and operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary substantially from quarter to quarter in the future 
such fluctuations may result in volatility in the price of the company s common stock 
quarterly revenue and operating results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors  including the company s lengthy sales cycle  the proportion of revenue attributable to license fees versus service revenue  changes in the level of operating expenses  demand for the company s products  the introduction of new products and product enhancements by the company or its competitors  changes in customer budgets  competitive conditions in the industry and general economic conditions 
further  the purchase of the company s products often involves a significant commitment of capital by its customers with the attendant delays frequently associated with large capital expenditures and authorization procedures within an organization 
for these and other reasons  the sales cycles for the company s products are typically lengthy and subject to a number of significant risks over which the company has little or no control 
the company historically has operated with little software license backlog because its software products are generally shipped as orders are received 
the company has often recognized a substantial portion of its revenue in the last month of the quarter and often in the last week of that month 
as a result  license fees in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in the last month or last week of that quarter 
accordingly  a small variation in the timing of recognition of revenue for specific transactions is likely to adversely and disproportionately affect the company s operating results for a quarter because the company establishes its expenditure levels on the basis of its expected future revenue and only a small portion of the company s expenses vary with its revenue 
accordingly  the company believes that period to period comparisons of results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance 
although the company has been profitable in recent quarterly periods  there can be no assurance that the company will remain profitable on a quarterly basis  if at all 
the company s business has experienced and is expected to continue to experience significant seasonality 
in recent years  the company has had greater demand for its products in its fourth fiscal quarter and has experienced lower revenue in its succeeding first and second fiscal quarters 
the fluctuations are caused primarily by customer purchasing patterns and the company s sales recognition programs which reward and recognize sales personnel on the basis of achievement of annual performance quotas 
due to the foregoing factors and the factors set forth under overview and results of operations above  it is likely that in some future quarter the company s operating results will be below the expectations of the company and public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
the business applications software market is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  evolving industry standards and changes in customer demands 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
the company s future success will depend in part on its ability to enhance products and services and to develop and introduce new products and services to meet changing client requirements 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing product enhancements or new products that respond to technological change or evolving industry standards  that the company will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of these products and enhancements  or that any new products and product enhancements it may introduce will achieve market acceptance 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will not encounter product development delays in the future or that  despite testing by the company  errors will not be found in new products or product enhancements after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of market share  delay in market acceptance  or warranty claims which could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company s products  maintenance and other services related thereto  are presently designed for users of ibm as mid range computers 
future revenue from licenses of present products and sales of services and recurring maintenance revenue are therefore dependent on continued widespread use of the as and the continued support of such computers by ibm 
because the company s primary current source of revenue comes from customers using ibm mid range computers  a significant shift in the way the company s customers use computers may have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
in addition  because the company s current product line requires the use of ibm s os operating system  the company may be required to adapt its products to any changes made in such operating system in the future 
the company s inability to adapt to future changes in the os operating system  or delays in doing so  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
although the company is developing software applications to operate on additional hardware platforms and operating systems  such as the microsoft windows nt operating system  as well as to operate over the internet and within corporate intranets  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and implementing such capabilities 
the company s development and implementation of versions of its business software applications to run on microsoft windows nt servers involve significant research and development expenditures and more intense competition from a larger number of competitors 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing these products or will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors 
the business applications software market is highly competitive and rapidly changing 
a number of companies offer products similar to the company s products and target the same customers as the company 
the company believes its ability to compete depends upon many factors within and outside its control  including the timely development and introduction of new products and product enhancements  product functionality  performance  price reliability  customer service and support  sales and marketing efforts and product distribution 
the company believes that competition in its industry is undergoing rapid change and that the barriers to competition between market segments that have previously existed are decreasing 
due to the relatively low barriers to entry in the software market  the company expects additional competition from other established and emerging companies as the client server business applications software market continues to develop and expand 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
revenue from customers outside north america represented and of the company s total revenue in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the company believes that its revenue and future operating results will depend  in part  on its ability to increase sales in international markets 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain or increase its current level of international revenue 
an important part of the company s strategy is to expand its indirect marketing channels in international markets 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain international distributors and resellers that will be able to market the company s products effectively and will be qualified to provide timely and cost effective customer support and service 
the inability to attract and retain important resellers could materially and adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
other risks inherent in the company s international business activities generally include unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  costs and difficulties of localizing products for foreign countries  lack of acceptance of localized products in foreign countries  longer accounts receivable payments cycles  difficulties in managing international operations  potentially adverse tax consequences including restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and economic instability 
there can be no assurance that such factors would not have a material adverse effect on the company s future international revenue and  consequently  on the company s business  operating results and financial condition
