item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations industry overview and company strategy the property and casualty insurance business has a history of fluctuat ing results and underwriting profitability and has tended to vary in cycles 
insurer profitability is influenced by many factors  including price competi tion  claim frequency and severity  crime rates  natural disasters  economic conditions  interest rates  state regulations and laws  changes in the legal system and court decisions 
insurance industry price levels tend to change with underwriting results 
as companies experience underwriting losses  and therefore reduced surplus levels  prices tend to increase and competition decreases 
as underwriting results improve  and surplus levels increase  prices tend to decrease and competition increases 
one of the challenging and unique features of the property and casualty insurance business is that its products must be priced before costs are fully known because premiums are charged before claims are incurred 
the company markets its products to individual insureds to meet their personal insurance needs 
the company has no commercial risks 
prior to  the company actively marketed private passenger automobile  homeowners  condominium  earthquake and personal excess liability insurance in california 
the company s primary focus has been private passenger automobile insurance since its inception 
private passenger automobile insurance has always accounted for over of premiums written by the company 
the northridge  california earthquake which occurred on january  northridge earthquake resulted in unprecedented losses for the company 
in order to reduce future earthquake exposure  the company ceased writing new homeowner and condominium insurance and renewing earthquake insurance in accordance with an order received from the california department of insurance doi in june the last earthquake coverages were terminated in july in accordance with the order  the company will continue to renew existing homeowner and condominium policies without earthquake coverage until june the last homeowners and condominium coverages will be term inated in july financial condition the northridge earthquake significantly affected the financial condition of the company and its operating results for the entire year of and  to a lesser extent  the company experienced a reduction in its historical pattern of growth  ceased all advertising and marketing in for new policies  and suspended its quarterly dividend on common shares for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal and all of as of december   total estimated gross losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses from the northridge earthquake were billion 
during  when the magnitude of the company s losses became evident  the doi imposed certain requirements on the company and its insurance sub sidiaries designed to reduce further exposure to earthquake losses and to strengthen the financial position of the company 
the company s insurance subsidiaries were ordered to stop writing new homeowners and condominium policies and to non renew all existing earthquake coverages 
the doi also granted the company a increase in homeowners premium rates and a increase in automobile premium rates 
in june  the company obtained a bank loan of million and in december entered into an investment and strategic alliance agreement investment agreement with american international group  inc aig 
under the terms of the investment agreement  aig provided the company with a total of million of equity capital in exchange for  shares of convertible preferred stock and certain preferential stock warrants 
as a part of the agreement  each of the company s insurance subsidiaries and an aig affiliate have entered into a five year quota share reinsurance agree ment for of each subsidiaries policies incepting on and after january  after the initial term  the aig affiliate may renew the agreement annually for four years at declining rates of coverage 
in addition  the company and aig have formed a joint venture to market personal automobile in surance in arizona which is expected to become operational in the second quar ter of in january  the company reached a settlement of rebate liabilities associated with proposition with the doi in the amount of million 
the company was to refund million to customers specified in the agreement as soon as practicable with the remaining million set aside for additional customer refunds conditioned on the ultimate level of claim costs associated with the northridge earthquake 
the settlement required the company to withdraw its request for a hearing before the united states supreme court to appeal the california supreme court decision on proposition in addition  the settlement required the company to obtain new capital of million and contribute the funds to the surplus of the insurance sub sidiaries  consisting of million by march  and million by december  the million capital contribution was made on march  the company has been informed that the million capital requirement has been waived by the doi due to the significant recovery in statutory surplus in as of december   the company s insurance subsidiaries had a com bined statutory surplus of  a ratio of of net written premium to surplus and was in compliance with doi requirements and its loan covenants 
the underwriting results for auto business were favorable and demonstrated a return to profitability and stability 
with the statutory surplus of the company restored to levels within regulatory norms as a result of the capital infusion by aig in december and operating profits in  the company filed for an auto rate decrease of in december these new rates have been approved and are effective march  the company expects the new rates combined with an aggressive marketing and advertising campaign to restore unit growth in the automobile line 
because the company is still subject to the order issued by the doi in june  the homeowners and condominium policies will have to be non renewed starting july and the company will be fully withdrawn from this line in july results of operations units in force units in force for the company s insurance programs as of december were as follows units in force private passenger automobile number of vehicles    homeowner and condominium number of policies    personal excess liability number of policies    total    the company had total unit growth of over on average for the ten years prior to the northridge earthquake significantly reduced statutory surplus and thus required the company to reduce its insured exposures 
as a result  the company ceased all advertising and marketing for new policies in the first quarter of in june  the doi ordered the company to stop writing all new homeowners and condominium policies and to non renew all existing earthquake coverages 
the doi also granted the company a increase in homeowners premium rates effective august  and a increase in automobile premium rates effective october  while improv ing profitability  the effect of these actions was to cause a decline in units in force which carried into a further automobile rate increase of was effective june   causing the decline in units to continue in total units declined from december  to december  for automobile and for homeowners and condominium 
underwriting results premium revenue and underwriting results for the company s insurance programs were as follows years ended december  amounts in thousands gross premiums written automobile    homeowner and condominium    personal excess liability    total    net premiums earned automobile    homeowner and condominium    personal excess liability total    underwriting profit loss automobile    homeowner and condominium    personal excess liability total    automobile automobile insurance is the primary line of business written by the com pany and has been consistently profitable 
excluding earthquake related claims and expenses  the earthquake reinsurance reinstatement premium and the proposition rollback  the company would have realized an automobile underwriting profit of million in and million in because of the cessation of advertising in and some loss of auto business from not offering new homeowner business or earthquake coverage  total automobile units in force for decreased from by compared to a slight increase of 
in gross written premiums in remained level despite the decrease in units in force  primarily as a result of the rate increases effective during the year 
net earned premiums decreased in compared to an increase of in  reflecting the impact of the quota share treaty with an aig affiliate effective january  which ceded of premiums and losses on a net written basis 
the voluntary automobile insurance business written by the company is comprised of good drivers  as defined by california statute 
while the majority of this business would have been acceptable to the company before proposition  those who had no prior insurance would have been written at a higher rate level than those who had been insured prior to being written by the company 
the underwriting losses produced by this segment of the market suggests that the former differential was appropriate 
these drivers have produced automobile underwriting losses of  in  compared to  in and  in overall automobile underwriting results are also affected by assigned risk units in force 
such units have increased steadily since underwriting losses for assigned risk business were  in  com pared to  in and  in a rate increase for assigned risk business was implemented by the doi in june homeowner and condominium as ordered by the doi  the company no longer writes new homeowners or condominium policies or earthquake coverage endorsements 
additionally  the company will continue to renew existing homeowner and condominium policies without earthquake coverage through july due to the requirement to exit the homeowners market  units in force for the homeowner and condominium programs decreased in and in this decline in units resulted in lower gross premiums written and  therefore  net earned premiums in and this program will continue to decline until the final policy expires in july underwriting results for these programs are subject to variability caused by weather related claims and by infrequent disasters 
results in include storm losses of million in the first quarter  million of earthquake related catastrophe reinsurance premiums  and northridge earthquake related losses of million 
results in include million of catastrophe reinsurance premiums related to the additional reinsurance coverage and million of net losses as related to the northridge earthquake 
results in were influenced by million in storm losses in the first quarter and by million in claims due to the southern california fires in the fourth quarter plus a million california fair plan assessment 
the company maintains a catastrophe reinsurance program to provide coverage through the run off period of its remaining homeowners policies 
the program currently in place provides coverage for the period from july  through june  for a total annual premium of approximately million 
coverage under these treaties is provided by a number of domestic  foreign and london market companies in two layers as follows catastrophe company reinsurance loss layer retention amount first    next    the company will maintain a catastrophe reinsurance program in place until the homeowner and condominium program expires 
it is expected that the cost will decline as the exposures decline 
personal excess liability the personal excess liability program has remained stable over the three year period ended december  producing approximately million in gross written premiums each year 
underwriting profits can vary sig nificantly with the number of claims which occur infrequently 
policy acquisition and general operating expenses the company s policy acquisition and general operating expense ratio continues to be one of the lowest in the industry 
the ratio of underwriting expenses excluding loan interest and fees to earned premiums was in  in and in the decline in the ratio from to reflects the impact of the ceding commission earned on the quota share agreement with an affiliate of aig and a reduction in general operating expenses due to the decline in business as well as cost efficiencies 
such efficiency  as reflected in its expense advantage over its competitors  enables the company to maintain its price leadership and provide for future growth and profitability 
investment income net pre tax investment income was  in   in and  in average invested assets decreased and in from and from  respectively 
average annual pre tax yield on invested assets declined from in to in and increased slightly to in the overall decline in investment income and yields from levels is the result of lower rates available on fixed maturity investments purchased since  the sale of relatively higher yielding bonds in to generate cash for paying earthquake claims in and the decline in business in realized capital gains on the sales of investments increased from  in to  in and then decreased to  in as of december   the company had a net unrealized gain on fixed maturity investments of  compared to a net unrealized gain loss of  and  in and  respectively 
the primary reasons for the shifts in unrealized gains and losses are twofold

at december   the portfolio contained taxable instruments compared to a year earlier 
statutory regulations require the majority of the company s investments to be made in high grade securities to provide ample protection for policyholders 
the company primarily invests in long term fixed maturity investments such as bonds 
the company s investment guidelines currently emphasize buying high quality  fixed income  taxable securities because of the company s substantial net operating loss carryforward 
while the company s policy is generally to hold these investments until maturity  its ongoing monitoring and evaluation of investment holdings and market conditions may  from time to time  result in selected sales of investments prior to maturity

as of december   the company had total cash of  and total investments at fair value of  loss and loss expense payments are the most significant cash flow requirements of the company 
the company continually monitors loss payments to provide projections of future cash requirements 
prior to  the company s most significant capital requirement resulted from its need to maintain an acceptable ratio of net premiums written to policyholders surplus 
in  the losses from the northridge earthquake were so severe that the company obtained a bank loan for its subsidiaries and equity financing from aig to meet its obligation to pay earthquake claims and strengthen surplus

first quarter interest payments are estimated to be approximately  funds required by th century industries to pay dividends and meet its debt obligations are provided by the insurance subsidiaries 
the ability of the insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to the holding company is regu lated by state law 
because of statutory regulations which require dividends to be paid from earned surplus  no dividends were paid by the subsidiaries in the company expects to generate positive earned surplus early in and resume normal dividends from the insurance subsidiaries to service the debt and preferred dividend requirements 
the company expects to have very small cash outlays for income taxes  specifically alternative minimum tax for the next two to three years 
until the net operating losses caused by the northridge earthquake are fully util ized  the company expects that cash outlays for income taxes will be less than income tax expense recorded in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
