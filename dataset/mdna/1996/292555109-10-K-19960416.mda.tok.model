item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview encore computer corporation encore or the company was founded in may and was in the development stage until october during this period  the company was primarily involved in the research  development and marketing of unix based computers and terminal servers 
in  encore significantly increased its size and worldwide marketing presence when it acquired substantially all of the assets of the computer systems division of gould electronics inc the computer systems business 
this was a significantly larger business than the company and one which for over twenty five years provided real time computer systems solutions to the simulation  transportation  and energy marketplaces 
during the late s  product demand in the computer marketplace began to migrate from more traditional proprietary computing technologies towards an open systems technology 
the company targeted its research and development efforts towards programs to develop a new generation of open system computers 
since the beginning of  the company has spent approximately  in research and development activities 
this has resulted in the current availability of a family of storage systems and open system computers including  i the infinity sptm storage processor with datashare facilitiestm  and ii the infinity r ttm 
in light of this new technology the company has targeted the multibillion dollar storage market as a strategic growth market 
this will be a new market for the company and is intended to replace the declining revenues from the real time market 
the company s real time market revenues have decreased from  in to  in and as a result the company has incurred significant net losses during this period 
the company expects the infinity sptm to penetrate the storage market and establish market presence 
the acceptance of encore s infinity sp universal storage processor with datasharetm facilities in the market place  and the timely and successful introduction of additional functions and features for these products will determine the company s future results 
to market the new storage product  the company has developed a direct distribution and oem sales and marketing strategy 
the company has recruited industry knowledgeable sales people from leading storage vendors and expanded its sales offices around the world 
additionally  encore continues to seek out strategic distribution partners whose industry presence  expertise and sales channels will allow it to more efficiently bring the company s leading edge open system and storage product offerings to market 
the company expects future sales volumes to increase as the sales campaign ramps up 
there can be no assurance that the company s products which are in the early stage of market introduction will achieve or sustain market acceptance or successfully compete against the products of other larger and more financially resourceful companies 
management has taken aggressive actions throughout this period to restructure the organization to levels more consistent with the declining size of the company 
these actions have included reducing the workforce  eliminating organizational redundancies and consolidating certain facilities to eliminate excess capacity 
in connection with the restructuring activities  the company also recognized the impairment in value of certain long lived assets including capitalized software products 
as a result of these actions  the company recorded restructuring charges of  over the three year period ended december  the company s future success will be dependent on research and development activities 
accordingly  the company plans to continue to invest heavily in this area 
with the net losses incurred in the three years ended december   the company has not generated sufficient levels of cash flow to fund its operations 
during this period of time the principal source of financing has been provided by the japan energy group 
during the three years ended december   the company and the japan energy group have also entered into a series of financing transactions involving the cancellation of  of indebtedness in exchange for the issuance of various classes of the company s preferred stock 
comparison of calendar  and net sales for were  compared to net sales for and of  and  respectively 
the revenue decline is due to both lower equipment and service sales 
in  equipment sales decreased to  from  and  in and  respectively 
service revenues for   and were   and  respectively 
equipment sales as a percentage of total net sales in  and were   and  respectively 
the decrease is primarily due to  i the delay in the acceptance of the company s new technology products in the storage information systems marketplace  ii the decline in real time and open system computer sales  and iii the adverse effects from the termination of the amdahl reseller agreement 
reflecting the company s declining system sales as well as continued price competitiveness in the marketplace  service revenues have declined from the prior years by and in and  respectively 
since approximately of each year s existing service contracts have not been renewed with the company 
however  as a percentage of total net sales  service revenues have remained fairly constant 
the decline in net sales has occurred in both the domestic and international markets  although international sales declined at a slower rate 
international sales in  and were   and  or   and  respectively of total net sales 
during the three years ended december   no single customer accounted for more than of the company s annual sales 
however  sales to various us government agencies have represented approximately  and of net sales in  and  respectively 
the company recognizes that reductions in current levels of us government agency spending on computers and computer related services could adversely affect its traditional sources of revenue 
the company believes the expansion into non traditional  high growth storage markets with the infinity sptm  and the infinity r ttm family of products will mitigate potential risk 
total cost of sales decreased in to  from  in and  in the decrease in all years reported was due generally to lower sales volumes and lower spending resulting from the restructuring of manufacturing and customer service operations during the three year period 
since the beginning of  combined manufacturing and customer service headcount has been reduced by approximately  certain customer service field operations have been closed or scaled down  and manufacturing operations have been consolidated in melbourne  florida 
in  gross margins on equipment sales were a loss  or of net sales compared to gross profit of  and  in and  respectively 
the decreases in and were due principally to the charges associated with the termination of the amdahl reseller agreement and the negative effect of the under utilization of manufacturing capacity 
as discussed in note b of notes to consolidated financial statements  in and  the company recorded charges of  and  respectively  in connection with the termination of the amdahl reseller agreement 
in  gross margins on service sales were  or  compared to  and  in and  respectively 
for and  service margins were reduced for costs incurred in preparing the customer service organization for storage product maintenance 
customer service margins are expected to continue to deteriorate due to a declining service base and costs required to support the storage product maintenance 
the rate of decline is expected to be slower in the international market because of limited competition 
while management has taken cost reduction actions  the rate of decline in service expenses lagged service revenues 
among the most significant of these actions occurred during the fourth quarter of when the company entered into an agreement with a third party service provider to supply a large portion of the manpower necessary to service equipment under domestic maintenance contracts with the company 
accordingly  service operations was able to significantly reduce its workforce during both the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of as a result  during  labor  benefits and employee related expenses and supplies decreased by  from the prior year 
among the principal cost reductions achieved in were lower employee costs of approximately  due to reduced headcount  and the closing of field offices 
research and development expenses in were  compared to  and  in and  respectively 
research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales in increased to from and in and  respectively 
the percentage increase is a result of both lower net sales and higher expense levels 
over the three year period  management increased expenditures on those strategic product offerings necessary for the future growth of the business while significantly reducing the level of investment in areas outside the company s principal focus 
to effectively compete in its market niches  the company must continue to invest aggressively in research and development activities 
while the aggregate amount invested by the company in research and development may not decrease significantly during the next several quarters  it is expected that if sales increase  research and development spending as a percentage of net sales will return to lower levels 
sales  general and administrative sg a expenses in were  compared to  and  in and  respectively 
in  sg a expenses decreased in part due to lower commissions on the year s lower sales as well as management s actions taken to minimize headcount  close or consolidate marginally profitable field offices and to more effectively focus its advertising programs 
these reductions were partially offset by a non cash compensation charge of  in connection with the extension of the expiration date of certain individual stock option grants 
in  sg a expenses decreased as compared to in part due to lower sales commissions and an approximate reduction in headcount 
these reductions were partially offset by increased consulting expenses related  in part  to the introduction of the infinity sptm 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
this reflects the fact that reductions in sg a spending have been more than offset by declines in net sales 
in and  the company took actions to restructure its operations to levels more consistent with the then expected levels of future revenues 
as discussed in note f of notes to consolidated financial statements  and operating expenses include restructuring charges of  and  respectively 
in the second quarter of management evaluated the company s latest financial projections  and concluded  i the termination of the amdahl reseller agreement resulted in a significant delay in the realization of product revenues  ii the rate of decline in real time equipment and service revenues had exceeded its previous estimates  and iii the rate of worldwide sales growth anticipated in newer product lines remained significantly below projected levels 
in light of these conclusions  management restructured operations and recorded a charge to operations of  the most significant of these restructuring actions were  i a person reduction in workforce primarily in manufacturing and development  resulting in a severance charge of  ii a write down of  in the carrying value of the equipment used in the support of the amdahl reseller agreement  and iii the write off of  of capitalized software assets relating to the company s unix based product lines 
management will continue to assess its cost structure and the carrying value of its assets in light of expected future business 
while there are no existing plans to take any additional actions  should future conditions require  management could approve additional plans to further reduce its cost base or recognize the impairment in value of long lived assets 
during  the company recorded a restructuring charge of  the company reduced its workforce by approximately  and wrote down the carrying values of long lived assets by interest expense decreased to  in from  in and  in since february   encore has completed a series of refinancing agreements with the japan energy group resulting in conversions of  of debt to preferred stock 
these conversions served to reduce the company s annual interest expense by approximately  in and  in other expense  net was higher in than in and due principally to higher foreign exchange losses in income taxes provided in   and relate to taxes payable by foreign subsidiaries see note h of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources because of the continuing operating losses incurred for the five years ended december   the company has been unable to generate cash from operating activities 
in   and  the company used cash in operating activities of   and  respectively 
cash used in operating activities decreased by  from reflecting working capital changes which resulted principally from the amdahl reseller agreement and its termination 
during the company significantly increased its investment in accounts receivable and inventories as a result of the acceleration of activities under the amdahl reseller agreement 
with the termination of this agreement in  the company s related working capital investment was significantly reduced 
accordingly  net changes in accounts receivable and inventories amounted to  in  an improvement of  as compared to these improvements were partially offset by the increase in the net loss of  as adjusted by noncash items 
from to  cash used in operating activities increased by  reflecting the working capital investment required as a result of the acceleration of activities under the amdahl reseller agreement and a higher net cash loss 
for  the net cash used to increase accounts receivable and inventories was  a change of  from additionally  for  the net loss  as adjusted for non cash items  exceeded the net loss by  expenditures for property and equipment during  and were   and  respectively 
expenditures for capitalized software during   and were   and  respectively 
as of december   there were no material commitments for capital expenditures 
cash was provided through financing activities of   and  in   and  respectively 
the principal source of financing has been through various agreements provided by the japan energy group 
the majority of the year end cash on hand of  was at various international subsidiaries 
with minor exceptions  all cash is freely remittable to the united states 
on april  the company issued gould  shares of series h preferred stock series h with a liquidation preference of  in exchange for gould canceling  of debt owed by the company 
in addition  gould increased encore s borrowing capacity to  and extended the maturity date to april  as of april  the company had  of committed borrowing facility remaining 
until such time in the future as the company returns to a state of continued profitability  it will have to fund its operating activities through further financing activities 
the company believes the amounts currently available under the gould credit agreement should be sufficient to meet such needs through december  until and beyond that time  should the japan energy group withdraw its financial support before the company returns to profitability by either failing to renew existing debt agreements as they expire or failing to provide additional credit to the company as needed  the company anticipates it will not be able to secure financing from other sources 
in such a case  the company will suffer a severe liquidity crisis and it will have difficulties settling its liabilities in the normal course of business
