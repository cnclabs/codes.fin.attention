item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations all dollar amounts referenced in this item have been rounded to the nearest thousand 
overview the company has grown through the acquisitions of oil and gas properties 
therefore  the company s results of operations and financial position are significantly affected by such acquisitions and related financings 
in june  the company increased its ownership of hco  a canadian oil and gas company  to over and from june through december  the accounts of hco were consolidated with those of the company 
in december  the company s interest in hco was decreased to and hco was deconsolidated 
in january  the shares of hco common stock held by the company were sold 
the company s results of operations for do not reflect any of the results of operations of hco 
in october  the company formed south texas limited partnership stlp with washington energy and an unrelated third party for the purpose of acquiring the south texas properties 
at such time  the company owned a interest in stlp 
the acquisition of the south texas properties was financed by stlp through a production note 
in may  the company purchased an additional interest in stlp with the proceeds of the sale of  shares of its series c convertible preferred stock and the assumption of an additional of the production note relating to the south texas properties 
effective march   the stlp partners agreed to dissolve stlp and distribute all of the assets and liabilities of stlp to the partners in proportion to their respective interests 
in march  the company exchanged  shares of its series b convertible preferred stock for certain gross overriding royalty and net profit interests in certain oil and gas properties located in oklahoma  texas  louisiana and new mexico the royalty interests 
in june  the company acquired of bakersfield energy s interests in the lost hills and north antelope hills oil and gas fields and a mmcf per day gas processing plant in the san joaquin basin of california 
in july  the company consummated the sale of  units consisting of million aggregate principal amount of its senior notes due in the year and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
each unit consisted of a  principal amount note and warrants to purchase an equal number of shares of common stock 
the company used the net proceeds of approximately million to repay an aggregate of million outstanding under its credit agreement and bridge loan with ing capital  redeem million in outstanding shares of series d preferred stock which were issued in connection with the acquisition of the bakersfield properties  acquire interests in additional producing wells in the bakersfield properties for million  and finance a portion of the development of the bakersfield properties over the remainder of this refinancing of the company s debt and capital structure resulted in an extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt of million and accretion on redeemable preferred stock of million in the current year 
in order to protect against the effects of declines in oil and gas prices  the company generally enters into either fixed price sales or hedging contracts covering significant portions of the company s estimated future production 
the company believes that its hedging strategy has allowed it to grow more rapidly by providing more predictable cash flows with which to finance its acquisitions and development drilling activities 
in september   the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas requires the company to review its oil and gas properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable  and recognize a loss if such recoverable amounts are less 
the adoption of sfas resulted in an impairment loss of  which was included in depletion  depreciation  amortization and impairment in the company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas properties 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item herein for summary of significant accounting policies 
results of operations comparison of to acquisition of bakersfield properties included in results of operations for the current year are twelve months of operations from the bakersfield properties  as compared to six months of operations in the comparable period of the bakersfield properties were acquired on june  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item herein 
revenues the company s total revenues increased  from  in to  in the company s total oil and gas revenues increased  from  in to  in oil revenues increased  due primarily to an increase in oil production volumes of  barrels  from  barrels in to  barrels in the increased production was a result of the acquisition of the bakersfield properties  which produced  barrels of oil in as compared to  barrels in six months

the company incurred incidental abandonment costs of  in the current year as compared to  during engineering and geological expenses increased  from  in to  in due to an increase in the number of oil and gas properties owned by the company and activities related to their evaluation and management 
the company adopted in the current year sfas which resulted in a non cash impairment charge of  which is included in depletion  depreciation  amortization and impairment expense dd a 
excluding the impairment charge  the company s dd a increased  from  in to  in this was a result of the substantial increase in acquisition and development costs related to the bakersfield property acquisition 
the dd a rate  excluding the effects of sfas  was per boe in as compared to during as a result of an increase in oil and gas reserves attributable to the bakersfield properties during the current year 
further affecting the increase in overall dd a expense was  in depreciation expense in the current period relating to the natural gas processing plant acquired with the bakersfield properties as compared to  in six months 
the company s general and administrative expenses increased  from  in to  in increases in g a were a result of the company s increased development and financing activities and general expansion 
the company s interest expense increased  from  in to  in this was due to the increased bank debt resulting from the original financing of the bakersfield properties in june and subsequent refinancing of that bank debt and redeemable preferred stock with  in senior secured notes in july also increasing interest expense in the current period was increased amortization of deferred financing costs resulting from these financings 
other expense of  in the current year resulted from the write down of a long term investment of  bad debt expense of  and a  loss on the disposition of miscellaneous oil and gas properties

the company s oil production increased approximately  barrels from  barrels in to  barrels in the increased production was primarily a result of the acquisition of the bakersfield properties  which contributed  barrels during the last six months of the company s permian basin properties experienced an increase of  barrels in due to the company s acquisition of additional oil and gas interests in that area in late additionally  oil production from the south texas properties increased by  barrels due to the additional interest in those properties acquired by the company in may and the drilling of four development wells in late and early oil production from the company s gulf coast and other properties declined approximately  barrels in the aggregate due to normal production declines 
the average price received for oil was per barrel during compared to per barrel in the company s gas revenues increased  from  in to  in also due to increased production 
gas production increased  mcf from  mcf in to  mcf in the acquisition of the bakersfield properties contributed  mcf of the increase while production from the south texas properties increased  mcf due to the additional interest acquired by the company and the drilling of four development wells 
gas production from the royalty interests decreased  mcf in as compared to as a result of mechanical problems with a gas purchaser s compression facilities which serve a significant gas lease 
these facility problems were corrected in the fourth quarter of gas production from the company s other properties decreased  mcf in the aggregate in due to normal production declines 
average prices received for gas were per mcf in as compared to per mcf in excluding natural gas liquids attributable to the bakersfield gas plant  the company also realized  in natural gas liquids sales in as compared to  in during  the company realized revenues of  from its share of the operations of the natural gas processing plant acquired as part of the bakersfield properties

during  the company had other income of  resulting primarily from the sale of its interests in several minor oil and gas properties 
costs and expenses total costs and expenses increased  from  in to  in the company s production costs increased  from  in to  in this was primarily due to the acquisition of the bakersfield properties  which accounted for  in production costs during the last six months of production costs on the south texas properties increased  in the current year due to developmental drilling activities while production costs from the company s other oil and gas properties decreased  in the aggregate as a result of lower workover costs 
during  the company incurred operating costs of  associated with the natural gas processing plant acquired as part of the bakersfield properties 
these costs included  from the purchase of natural gas for processing and resale and  of directing operating expenses 
the company incurred incidental abandonment costs on older non productive leases of  in as compared to  in engineering and geological expenses increased  from  in to  in due to the company s increased activities 
the company s depletion  depreciation and amortization expense increased  from  in to  in as a result of increases in depreciable oil and gas assets due to acquisitions and development costs 
the dd a rate per boe for oil and gas reserves decreased from per boe in to per boe in due to lower acquisition costs per boe for oil and gas reserves acquired during and positive reserve revisions during further affecting the increase in overall dd a expense was depreciation expense relating to the natural gas processing plant acquired as part of the bakersfield properties in the company s general and administrative expenses decreased slightly from  in to  in 
the company experienced  in nonrecurring costs resulting from its relocation from california to texas during the company s interest expense increased  from  in to  in primarily as a result of the bank debt used to finance the acquisition of the bakersfield properties in june the company s bank debt increased from  at december  to  at december   resulting in a significantly higher average debt balance during the current year

liquidity and capital resources summary the company s sources of working capital have primarily been cash flows from operations and debt and equity financings 
during the year ended december   the company had cash flows from operations of  as compared to  during the company realized net proceeds of  from financing activities during which were primarily the result of the company refinancing its debt and capital structure through the note offering 
in  the company realized  from financing activities  primarily from the issuance of debt and sale of preferred and common stock 
the company utilized a net of  for investing activities in the current year as compared to  during working capital the company had net working capital of  with a current ratio of at december  as compared to a net working capital deficiency of  and a current ratio of at december  at december   current liabilities included a million bridge loan and  of current maturities under the company s credit agreement 
all borrowings outstanding under the bridge loan and the credit agreement were refinanced on a long term basis in july with proceeds from the note offering 
operating activities discretionary cash flow is a measure of performance which is useful for evaluating exploration and production companies 
it is derived by adjusting net loss to eliminate the non cash effects of exploration expenses  including dry hole and abandonment costs  depletion  depreciation  amortization and impairment and gain loss on sale of assets 
the effects of non cash working capital changes are not taken into account 
this measure reflects an amount that is available for capital expenditures  debt service and repayment and dividend payments 
during the current year  the company generated discretionary cash flow of  before non cash changes in working capital of 
this compares to  before non cash changes in working capital of  during the improvement in the current year  in spite of significantly increased debt service  was primarily a result of increased oil and gas revenues resulting from a full year s results of operations from the bakersfield properties and the further development of the properties which resumed in late july the company had drilled wells from july through december  of which were producing with awaiting completion at that date 
as a consequence of these drilling activities and the acquisition of certain additional interests in the properties  harcor s share of sales production from the bakersfield properties was  bpd and  mcfd during the fourth quarter of  showing increases of and  respectively  over fourth quarter in addition  the company realized a net profit margin of  on its gas plant operations in as compared to  in this was again a result of a full year of operations during and  additionally  increased lease production volumes processed through the plant resulting in increased ngl sales 
the company expects further improvement in operating cash flows in future periods as a result of this drilling and development program 
as of january  all of the wells drilled on the bakersfield properties were completed and producing  and the company expects increased average rates of production for both oil and gas in the first quarter of as compared to fourth quarter financing activities on july   the company consummated the sale of  units consisting of million aggregate principal amount of its senior notes due in the year and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
each unit consisted of a  principal amount note and warrants to purchase an equal number of shares of common stock 
the notes and warrants became separately transferrable immediately after july  the net proceeds to the company from the offering of units was approximately million after deducting discounts and offering expenses 
the company immediately used a portion of the net proceeds to i repay million outstanding under its credit agreement with ing capital and repay million outstanding under a bridge loan with ing capital  ii redeem the total million in outstanding shares of series d preferred stock and iii acquire interests in additional producing wells in the bakersfield properties for million 
the company used the balance of the proceeds from the note offering to finance a portion of the development of the bakersfield properties over the remainder of concurrent with the repayment of its outstanding bank debt  the company entered into a new credit agreement with ing capital 
see new credit agreement  which follows 
the notes bear interest at the rate of per annum 
interest accrues from the date of issue and will be payable semi annually on january and july of each year  commencing on january  the notes are redeemable  in whole or in part  at the option of the company at any time on or after july   at the following redemption prices expressed as percentages of the principal amount if redeemed during the month period commencing on july of the year set forth below plus  in each case  accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption year percentage and thereafter 














in the event that the company has excess cash flow as defined in excess of million in any fiscal year  beginning with the fiscal year ending december   the company will be required to make an offer to purchase notes from all holders thereof in an amount equal to of all such excess cash flow for such fiscal year not just the amount in excess of million at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount thereof  plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item herein for a complete description of the notes 
all of the obligations of the company under the notes and related indenture are secured by a second priority lien on substantially all of the assets of the company and its subsidiaries  which are also collateralization under a secured credit agreement see below 
concurrent with the closing of the note offering in july  the company repaid all borrowings under its then existing credit agreement and entered into a new credit agreement with ing capital the new credit agreement 
the new credit agreement provides that the company initially may borrow up to million on a revolving credit basis 
availability under the new credit agreement is limited to a borrowing base amount 
the borrowing base will be determined semi annually by ing capital  at its sole discretion  and may be established at an amount up to million 
the initial borrowing base was set at and is currently million and ing capital will have no obligation to increase the borrowing base above this amount 
availability under the new credit agreement  as amended in march  will terminate on june   at which time amounts outstanding under the new credit agreement will convert to a term loan on september   with a set amortization schedule of a percentage of the outstanding principal balance continuing through december  there was million outstanding under the new credit agreement at december  the effective interest rate on the balance outstanding was approximately at that date 
amounts advanced under the new credit agreement will bear interest at an adjusted eurodollar rate plus the new credit agreement contains restrictive covenants which impose limitations on the company and its subsidiaries with respect to  among other things  certain financial ratios or limitations  incurrence of indebtedness  the sale of the company s oil and gas properties and other assets  hedging transactions  payment of dividends  mergers or consolidations and investments outside the ordinary course of business 
the new credit agreement also contains customary default provisions 
all indebtedness of the company under the new credit agreement is secured by a first lien upon substantially all of the company s oil and gas properties as well as by a pledge of all of the capital stock of the company s subsidiaries and the accounts receivable  inventory  general intangibles  machinery and equipment and other assets of the company 
all assets not subject to a lien in favor of the lender are subject to a negative pledge  with certain exceptions 
additionally  the company paid  in cash dividends on preferred stock during the current year  which is reflected in financing activities 
results of hedging activities the company s hedging activities during the three years ended december  have not had any material effect on the company s liquidity or results of operations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included herein 
capital expenditures and future outlook subsequent to the refinancing of its debt  the company spent million on the acquisition of interests in additional producing wells on the bakersfield properties  and spent approximately million on developmental and drilling activities on these properties through december  the company also spent an aggregate of  on the development of its permian and south texas properties during see operating activities for current production rates 
the company intends to spend an additional estimated million for capital expenditures to develop the proved reserves of the bakersfield properties  of which million is planned to be spent during  million in and million thereafter 
an additional million will be spent over the next several years for the development of the company s other properties 
the company plans to fund and future capital expenditures from operating cash flows and borrowings under the new credit agreement 
the company currently anticipates that total additional drilling necessary to develop the bakersfield properties after will result in approximately new wells 
the projected total development costs for the existing proved reserves assigned to the bakersfield properties after are estimated at approximately million net to the company based on current drilling costs 
the company also plans to spend approximately million to drill two horizontal wells on these properties during the first of these wells will be drilled on the ellis lease in the diatomite formation to test a possible extension of the current proved area of the field and to evaluate the use of horizontal wells to replace certain infill vertical wells on the ellis lease 
a second horizontal well is planned to evaluate its applicability to producing the deeper reef ridge shale zones on the ellis lease 
if successful  additional horizontal locations may be identified for future drilling on the ellis lease as well as the company s truman and tisdale leases in areas currently outside the proven areas of these fields 
the company currently estimates that there is potentially mmboe in reserves outside the current proven areas of these fields that may be recovered with future drilling 
no assurances can be given  however  that any of such wells will be drilled  or that if such wells are drilled  they will be either successful or completed in accordance with the company s development schedule 
the company is also involved in two small waterflood projects on its permian basin properties and has approximately million in capital expenditures planned in this area during the next two years 
based on current engineering estimates  the company anticipates producing from its existing proved producing properties approximately  barrels of oil and plant products and bcf of gas during and  barrels of oil and plant products and bcf of gas during if the company adheres to its planned drilling and development program and capital expenditure schedule as described herein and is successful in these efforts  the company anticipates producing from its existing proved undeveloped properties an additional  barrels of oil and plant products and bcf of gas in and  barrels of oil and plant products and bcf of gas in these production estimates are based on reports prepared by independent petroleum engineers as of january   and do not take into account risk factors such as deviations in the projected rates of declines on currently producing wells or less than anticipated production from development drilling activities and potential decreases in future oil and gas prices 
the company intends to continue participating in development drilling on its south texas properties as these opportunities arise 
in the second half of  the company participated in a leasing program which was undertaken in south texas around the company s existing hostetter field for a planned d seismic program 
processing of data from this seismic program should commence in may  and drilling could begin in the third quarter of in furtherance of this effort and as part of the company s strategy of aligning itself with partners that have technological expertise  in february  the company entered into an agreement with a d seismic company to jointly explore the hostetter field 
this partner in turn will provide the company with a similar opportunity in one of its current exploration projects 
the company and its d seismic partner have also jointly formed a geologic team to assist them in the evaluation of the hostetter d program 
management anticipates its relationship with d seismic partner will lead to other d caex opportunities for the company during the company expects that its available cash  expected cash flows from operating activities and availability under its new credit agreement will be sufficient to meet its financial obligations and fund its planned developmental drilling and exploration activities for the foreseeable future  provided  that i there are no significant decreases in oil and gas prices beyond current levels or anticipated seasonal lows  ii there are no significant declines in oil and gas production from existing properties other than declines in production currently anticipated based on engineering estimates of the decline curves associated with such properties  iii drilling costs for development wells with respect to the bakersfield properties do not increase significantly from the drilling costs recently experienced by the operator in such area with respect to similar wells and iv the operator continues its development program with respect to the bakersfield properties on the schedule currently contemplated 
in the event incremental cash flows from the bakersfield properties are not sufficient to fund both increased debt and development costs  or results from developmental drilling are not as successful as anticipated  then the company will either i curtail its developmental drilling and or exploration activities or ii seek alternative financing to assist in its developmental drilling activities 
the company intends to continue efforts to acquire additional interests in selected producing oil and gas properties if and when these opportunities become available 
any such acquisitions would require borrowings under the new credit agreement and possibly additional debt or equity financing if needed 
uncertainties involving forward looking disclosure certain of the statements set forth above under liquidity and capital resources capital expenditures  such as the statements regarding estimated production amounts for and  number of anticipated wells to be drilled in and thereafter and the planned d seismic program  are forward looking and are based upon the company s current belief as to the outcome and timing of such future events 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond the control of the company 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact way  and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
as a result  estimates made by different engineers often vary from one another 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revisions of such estimate and such revisions  if significant  would change the schedule of any further production and development drilling 
accordingly  reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered 
furthermore  the estimated production amounts and numbers of wells to be drilled in and are based upon product prices and costs as of december  except for gas sold under contract  in which case the contract prices were used  which will probably be different from the actual prices recognized and costs incurred in and additional factors which could materially affect the company s oil and gas production and development drilling program in the future are general economic conditions  the impact of the activities of opec and other competitors  the impact of possible geopolitical occurrences world wide  the results of financing efforts  risks under contract and swap agreements  changes in laws and regulations  capacity  deliverability and supply constraints or difficulties  unforeseen engineering and mechanical or technological difficulties in drilling or working over wells  and other risks described in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
because of the foregoing matters  the company s actual results for and beyond could differ materially from those expressed in the above described forward looking statements 
effects of inflation and changes in price the company s results of operations and cash flows are affected by changing oil and gas prices 
if the price of oil and gas increases  there could be a corresponding increase in the cost to the company for drilling and related services  as well as an increase in revenues 
inflation has had a minimal effect on the company
