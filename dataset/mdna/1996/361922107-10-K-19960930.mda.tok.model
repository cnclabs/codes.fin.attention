fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues fiscal year revenues of million were million  or  lower than fiscal year revenues of million 
the decline is attributable to a million decline in revenues from pso  an increase in revenues of million from telecom division  and an increase of thousand in revenues from apd 
for and  one pso contract accounted for and  respectively  of the company s revenues 
for  pso revenues were million  consisting of million from pso services revenues  million from pso product sales  and million in revenues from the minority interest portion of a majority owned joint venture  which was accounted for on a consolidated basis through the first quarter of for  pso revenues were million  consisting of million from pso service revenues  million from pso product sales  and million from the minority interest portion of the majority owned joint venture 
thus  the million  or  decline in pso revenues from to arose from a decline of million  or  in pso service revenues  an increase of million  or  in pso product sales  and a decline of million  or  in revenues from the minority interest portion of the majority owned joint venture 
the decline in pso service revenues of million was the net effect attributable primarily to the shift in focus of a significant dod contract requiring less effort by the company  offset by revenues earned from other dod contracts 
for  pso service revenues of million were derived from approximately million in revenues from direct labor fees  approximately million from subcontract revenues  and approximately million from revenues from other direct costs 
thus  approximately of pso service revenues were derived from direct labor related fees and from subcontract revenues 
for  pso service revenues of million were derived from approximately million in revenues from direct labor fees  approximately million from subcontract revenues  and approximately million from other direct costs 
thus  approximately of pso service revenues were derived from direct labor related fees and from subcontract revenues 
the trend in pso service revenues between and  thus  shows a decline in direct labor content and an increase in subcontract revenues 
the trend over the year period from to shows a more marked decline in direct labor revenues  from in to in  and an increase in subcontracting revenues from in to in this trend is due  in part  to the growing teaming of companies on government contracts  giving rise to more pass through of subcontract work by each prime contractor on any particular contract 
as discussed in the next section  cost of revenues and gross profit  the decline in the comparative percentages of pso service revenue derived from direct labor fees and the increase in subcontract revenues is a mix shift from a relatively higher gross profit direct labor business to a lower gross profit subcontract revenue business 
for  telecom division s revenues were million 
these revenues arose primarily from the osu r network interface business unit  which sold million of commercial units in for the networkvue business unit  service revenues were thousand 
the application software group unit within telecom has not yet recognized revenues  although  it expects to do so in the first quarter of fiscal year as a forward looking statement where actual results may differ materially from those planned or expected  the rate at which the telecom division s revenues will grow in the future is a function of a variety of factors  some of which are beyond the company s control  including the following 
with respect to the osu business unit  the growth of fiber optic telecommunications transmission services  the growth in the use of the sonet synchronous optical network transport protocol  the growth in the use of atm asynchronous transfer mode switching technology  the lead times and procedures used by telecommunications service providers and large  private corporate users in accepting equipment based on these new technologies  whether the company s osu product offering matches the industry demand as it develops in the future  the propensity of large potential buyers to buy network critical equipment from a new vendor in that market segment  and other factors 

with respect to the networkvue business unit  the successful completion of the product  and the matching of that product s features and functions with the demand as it develops for such a product 

with respect to asg business unit  the ability to attract software engineers and programmers having the talent and skill required  and the ability of the unit to expand its customer base beyond lucent  its primary customer at present 
see risk factors  below  for a discussion of these and other risk factors which may cause actual results to materially differ from those planned or expected 
for  apd revenues of million were thousand  or  greater than revenues of million 
the increase in apd revenues was adversely impacted by the continuing updating and development of the software modules which constitute the product offering for the environmental  health  and safety management software business unit of apd which began in cost of revenues and gross profit cost of revenues for amounted to million  or of revenues  compared to million  or of revenues for gross profit for amounted to million  or of revenues  compared to million  or of revenues for the million decline in gross profit for the company is due primarily to a million decline in gross profit from the pso service business 
excluding the revenue and cost impact of the minority portion of the majority owned joint venture  for pso had a cost of services of million  or of service revenues  compared to million  or of service revenues in consequently  the gross profit from pso services declined from million in to million in  and gross margin declined from of service revenues in to of service revenues in the decline in pso service gross margins is  in part  attributable to the reduced percentage of direct labor in cost of service revenues from to  with an offsetting increase in subcontract costs 
for  direct labor costs were of cost of service  and subcontract costs were 
for  direct labor costs were of cost of service  and subcontract costs were 
in addition  the decline in pso service gross margins is attributable to a decline in the gross margins achieved on the direct labor portion of its service business  due to increasing competitive pressure in pricing government contracts 
thus  the decline in gross margins for the company from to is in large part due to the decline in pso service gross margins  which  in turn is  in large part  due to the mix shift from direct labor revenues to subcontract revenues  accompanied also by a decline in the gross margins derived from direct labor 
for  given the start up nature of its business  the osu r network interface business unit had gross margins of on sales of million and a gross profit of thousand 
given the start up nature of its business for  the networkvue business units had a negative gross margin of thousand on revenues of thousand 
the application software group has not yet generated a gross profit  since it has not yet recognized revenues 
as a forward looking statement where actual results may differ materially from those planned or expected  the company does not consider these gross margins as indicative of the long term range of gross margins from these business units 
operating expenses and operating income fiscal year total operating expenses of million  or of revenues  were million greater than the million  or of revenues  in operating expenses for operating results for were a loss of million  compared to an operating profit for of million 
excluding a write off of deferred software and related costs for  operating expenses would have been million 
operating income for included a gain of approximately thousand from the sale of the company s california facility  and a write down of deferred software costs of thousand 
excluding these impacts  operating expenses for would have been million 
sales and marketing expenses increased by million from million  or of revenues  in  to million  or of revenues  in general and administrative expenses declined by million from million  or of revenues  for to million  or of revenues 
the increase in sales and marketing expense is attributable to telecom division 
in addition to the r d efforts carried on by the company on behalf of the us government under various government contracts and reported in cost of revenues  the company also carried on r d efforts on its own behalf 
for  research and development expense of thousand when added to the million of capitalized software development costs for the year before the year end write off discussed below amounted to a total effort of million 
for  research and development expense of million together with capitalized software development costs for the year of million amounted to a total effort of million 
thus  the total r d and capitalized software effort increased by million from million  or of revenues  in to million  or of revenues  in total operating expenses plus capitalized software costs for the year  before the year end write offs  increased by million  from million in to million in for  allocating the million write off to the appropriate divisions  pso services business generated an operating profit of million  pso products business generated a loss of million  yielding a net profit for pso of million 
telecom division had an operating loss of million  million for the osu business unit and million for the networkvue business unit 
apd had an operating loss of million 
and  unallocated corporate expenses excluding net interest expense amounted to thousand 
a portion of the write down of deferred software and related costs related to the pso products business 
as a forward looking statement where actual results may differ materially from those planned or expected  the company does not expect losses in the pso products business unit to continue in the future 
for  the million operating profit was comprised of a pso services operating profit of million  a pso products loss of thousand  a telecom division loss of thousand  and an apd loss of million 
write down of deferred software and related costs in  the company recorded a write down of million for software development and related costs  compared to a write down of thousand for the million write down was comprised of million in deferred software costs including million related to osu and million in other related costs 
in the fourth quarter of  the company completed and made available to the marketplace its gold osu r product 
the gold product contains more flexibility and functionality than earlier osu products 
in the fourth quarter  the company reviewed the expected completion costs and recoverability of earlier osu products and determined that the gold product would be the only current osu product to be marketed actively 
accordingly  the company wrote off the costs incurred to develop the earlier osu products 
net interest income or expense net interest expense of thousand for  compared to net interest income of thousand for  reflects the significant increase in debt incurred during in order to fund the development of the osu r network interface and networkvue tm product offerings 
net income or loss net income for amounted to a loss of million  compared to a profit of million for fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues fiscal year revenues of million were million  or  higher than fiscal year revenues of million 
the increase is primarily attributable to a million increase in revenues from pso and a decrease of million in revenues from apd 
for and  one pso contract accounted for and  respectively  of the company s revenues 
for  pso revenues were million  consisting of million from pso service revenues  million from pso product sales  and million from the minority interest portion of the majority owned joint venture 
for  pso revenues were million  consisting of million from pso service revenues  thousand from pso product sales  and million from the minority interest portion of the majority owned joint venture 
thus  the million  or  increase in pso revenues from to arose from an increase of million  or  in pso service revenues  an increase of thousand  or  in pso product sales  and an increase of million  or  in revenues from the minority interest portion of the majority owned joint venture 
for  pso service revenues of million were derived from approximately million in revenues from direct labor fees  approximately million from subcontract revenues  and approximately million from other direct costs 
thus of pso service revenues were derived from direct labor related fees and from subcontract revenues 
for  pso service revenues of million were derived from approximately million in revenues from direct labor fees  approximately million from subcontract revenues  and approximately million from revenues from other direct costs 
thus  of pso service revenues were derived from direct labor related fees and from subcontract revenues 
the trend in pso service revenues between and  thus  shows a decline in direct labor content and an increase in subcontract revenues 
as discussed in the next section  cost of revenues and gross profit  the decline in the comparative percentages of pso service revenue derived from direct labor fees and the increase in subcontract revenues is a mix shift from a relatively higher gross profit direct labor business to a lower gross profit subcontract revenue business 
telecom division s revenues were negligible for and nil for this reflects the fact that the telecom products were not developed and available for commercial sale during fiscal year  and were still substantially under development during fiscal year for  apd revenues of million were million lower than the million in revenues recognized for the decline in revenues from to was attributable primarily to the need to rewrite the software modules which constitute the product offering for the environmental  health  and safety management software business unit of apd beginning during cost of revenues and gross profit cost of revenues for amounted to million  or of revenues  compared to million  or of revenues  for gross profit for amounted to million  or of revenues  compared to million  or of revenues for excluding the revenue and cost impact of the minority portion of the majority owned joint venture  for  pso had a cost of services of million  or of revenues  compared to million  or of revenues in consequently  the gross profit from pso services was essentially unchanged at million in and million in  although gross margin declined slightly from of revenues in to of revenues in the slight decline in pso service gross margins was  in part  attributable to the increased percentage of subcontract costs in cost of service revenues from to for  direct labor costs were of cost of service and subcontract costs were 
for  direct labor costs were of cost of service  and subcontract costs were 
the shift in the mix of revenues and costs components for the pso service business from direct labor related costs and fees to subcontract related costs is a mix shift which tends to reduce the gross profit derived from the pso service business 
operating expenses and operating income fiscal year total operating expenses of million  or of revenues  were million greater than the million  or of revenues  in operating expenses for operating profit of million for was lower by million for the million operating profit for operating income for included a gain of approximately thousand from the sale of the company s california facility  and a write down of deferred software costs of thousand 
excluding these impacts  operating expenses for would have been million 
sales and marketing expenses increased by thousand from million for to million in general and administrative expenses increased by thousand from million  or of revenues  for to million  or of revenues  for in addition to the r d efforts carried on by the company on behalf of the us government under various government contracts and reported in cost of revenues  the company also carried on r d efforts on its own behalf 
for  research and development expense of million when added to the million of capitalized software development costs amounted to a total effort of million 
for  research and development expense of thousand together with capitalized software development costs for the year of million amounted to a total effort of million 
thus  the total r d and capitalized software effort increased by million from million  or of revenues  in to million  or of revenues  in total operating expenses plus capitalized software costs for the year increased from million in to million in for  pso services had an operating profit of million  pso products lost thousand  telecom division lost thousand  and apd lost million 
for  pso services had an operating profit of million  pso products had a loss of thousand  telecom division had a loss of thousand  and apd had a loss of thousand 
net interest income or expense net interest income of thousand for  compared to net interest income of thousand for net income or loss net income for of million  compared to net income of million for net income for included a net benefit of million attributable to recording a net deferred tax asset in accordance with sfas liquidity and capital resources the company had million in cash and cash equivalents at june   compared to million at june  net cash provided from operations amounted to million for  compared to million for net cash used in investing activities for amounted to million  compared to million for net cash provided by financing activities amounted to million for  compared to million used in the increased use of cash in investing activities for of million over was due primarily to the increased level of software development costs between the two years 
for  investments in software development costs amounted to million  compared to million for this was financed in by the million in new debt  primarily the increase of million in bank and equipment financing described below 
cash flows from operations  adjusted for cash used in developing software  was a negative million and a positive million in and  respectively 
as a summary of consolidated sources and uses of cash for  positive operating cash flows from the pso service business funded losses from the pso product business and corporate expenses 
the increase in debt during the year funded operating losses in telecom division and apd 
as a result of the large increase in debt during  the company s ratio of debt to total capitalization amounted to  compared to zero for during fiscal years  and  the company invested approximately million in operating losses  capital equipment  and deferred software production costs for telecom division 
this was funded primarily by a combination of internally generated cash flows from pso and from increased bank debt 
as a forward looking statement where actual results may differ materially from those planned or expected  the company does not anticipate investing similar amounts in new technologies in the future  unless operating cash flows become significantly positive or additional sources of external capital are established 
at june   the company had million of debt  million of which was classified as short term  and million of which was classified as long term 
of these amounts  million was bank debt and million was a note payable related to the acquisition of assets from quintessential solutions  inc the company had no bank debt at june  the credit facilities with the company s bank consist of a fully used million term loan  a million revolving line of credit  of which million was used at june   and a million debt arising from the equipment financing arranged with the bank s equipment leasing subsidiary 
the term loan is due on september   and bears interest at the bank s floating prime rate  currently per annum 
the revolving line of credit is due on january   and  if the company is not in default  is automatically renewable for one year renewal terms unless the bank  at its option  delivers written notice of non renewal to the company at least months prior to the end of the initial term or any renewal term 
the revolving line of credit bears interest at the bank s floating prime rate  currently per annum 
the equipment financing is for a term of months 
the amended and restated revolving credit and term loan agreement containing the term loan and the revolving line of credit was amended as of march   and again as of june   to reduce various financial ratio covenant levels so as to bring the company into compliance with those covenants as of those dates 
given the relatively high levels of debt already incurred by the company  maintaining the company s future liquidity and the availability of needed capital resources requires that either the telecom business units begin generating positive operating cash flows  or the company raise additional equity  or the company enter into strategic financial and marketing relationships with appropriate participants in the telecommunications industry segment  or a combination of these corporate finance strategies 
there can be no assurances  however  that any or all of these strategies will be feasible  effective  or sufficient to satisfy the company s liquidity requirements 
nonetheless  as a forward looking statement where actual results may differ materially from those planned or expected  the company believes that a combination of pso positive cash flow from operations  reduced negative operating cash flows from telecom division and apd  continued reliance on available credit facilities  and availing itself of various opportunities for additional capital will provide sufficient liquidity and capital resources to fund the company s requirements for the next fiscal year 
see risk factors  below  for factors which may have a material adverse impact on the company s plans and expectations 
outlook as forward looking statements where actual results may differ materially from those planned or expected  the company believes that the following are the current outlooks for its various divisions for pso  given the increase in its various measures of us government contract backlog  its high win rates on new bids  and its enhanced focus on marketing its information technology services both within the government and in commercial areas  the company believes that pso should be able to sustain average long term growth rates greater than it has been able to achieve in recent years 
pso  for the next fiscal year  should continue to achieve positive operating results and positive cash flows 
for telecom division s osu and networkvue business units  the company is optimistic regarding the future long term trends and prospects for both its optical network equipment business  beginning with the osu r network interface and derivative products now being marketed  and its networkvue suite of network design and optimization modules now nearing completion and related services 
however  given the early stage of these business units commercial sales efforts  these units are expected to continue to sustain losses from operations and negative cash flows for the next fiscal year 
the company  however  expects both the osu and the networkvue business units to increase their unit sales and revenues during the next fiscal year 
for telecom division s application software group  the company is optimistic regarding the group s current and future prospects to engage in highly sophisticated and leading edge software development for the telecommunications industry 
however  given the early stage of this business unit s operating history  asg is expected to have essentially a small loss to break even cash flows for the next fiscal year 
the company  however  expects a growth in revenues recognized by the group and an operating profit for the next fiscal year 
for apd  the company is optimistic regarding the division s ability to bring focused management leadership to its four business units 
given the maturity of the materials testing business unit  the recent redevelopment of the environmental  safety  and health management software business unit  and growth prospects for the security and systems integration business units  the company expects a growth in revenues and gross margins for the division  but  essentially  a break even result of operations and a slightly negative cash flow for the next fiscal year 
given the level of debt being carried by the company  and its expected increase during the next fiscal year  and the expected negative cash flows for the next fiscal year  the company expects net interest expense to increase for the next fiscal year

risk factors the private securities litigation reform act of the reform act provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information about their companies  so long as those statements are identified as forward looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the statement 
except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in this form k annual report which relate to present or future events or trends are intended to be forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions  it can give no assurance that its expectations will be achieved 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company s expectations are disclosed in conjunction with the forward looking statements and again below 
pso derives substantially all of its business from service contracts with the department of defense of the united states government 
this business is subject to the uncertainties of the us budget  funding for the dod  terminations of contracts for cause or government convenience  the type of contracts which may be awarded to the company  and the ability of the company to fill the required staff positions to service those contracts 
these open positions require operations research and software engineers  computer programmers  and other skilled scientists and engineers  employees for whom there is a general shortage and a high degree of competitive pressure 
during fiscal year  the company had a net gain of full time and part time employees  and at june   had openings for approximately employees of which related to positions for pso 
the number of openings was significantly lower at june  an inability to fill a substantial portion of these current openings could have a materially adverse impact on pso s revenue growth and profitability 
although pso contracts at year end  and have numbered  and  respectively  the loss of one or more may have a substantial adverse impact on pso s revenues and profitability  if the particular contract is large in relation to the rest 
telecom division is a new business division for the company  competing in a new industry segment  not related to government contracting 
the osu r network interface business unit sells hardware having a critical software component to the telecommunications industry and large private corporate users 
the networkvue business unit sells software and provides related services to the telecommunications industry  large corporate users  and to intermediary software and service providers to these end users 
the application software group provides software engineering and computer programming to the telecommunications industry 
actual results may differ materially from those planned or expected for these business units within telecom division  depending on the adverse impact of the following risk factors 
in all cases  the company must attract  hire  and retain employees with the requisite training and experience in these industry segments  and the company s business units must compete successfully with large well established companies already having product and service offerings which are familiar to the end users in the relevant segments 

the company s osu product offering is dependent upon the growth and development of fiber optic transmission services  the sonet synchronous optical network transmission protocol  and atm switching technology asynchronous transfer mode  and the matching of the features and functions of the company s product offerings with the industry s requirements  as well as the buying procedures and lead times of established telecommunications service and equipment providers  which are not yet accustomed to buying this product offering from the company 

the company s networkvue product and service offering is dependent upon the successful completion of the product  the matching of the features and functions of this product and service offering with the needs of the telecommunications industry  large corporate end users  and intermediate service and product providers 

the company s application software group is  at present  a new business unit having one primary customer  lucent  and is dependent upon attracting new clients 

the company in general and telecom division business units in particular have not yet established sustained and continuing successes with its sales and marketing strategies and  thus  do not yet have the operating history which can serve as the basis for forecasting the future results of plans and budgets with small variability in expected results 
thus  the risk inherent in these businesses at this time is high 
given the company s increased reliance upon debt financing  the financial risk arising from increased leverage is higher than it has been in recent years and will probably grow higher during the next fiscal year 
new accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board has released statement of financial accounting sfas nos 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and accounting for stock based compensation 
the company plans to adopt the provisions of these statements in fiscal year  when required 
the company has not completed the process of evaluating the impact that might result from the adoption of these statements 
the company does not plan to adopt the recognition provision of sfas no 
 but rather continue to follow its current accounting practice
