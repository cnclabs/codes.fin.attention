item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources working capital at december   was million 
cash and cash equivalents amounted to million 
cash and cash equivalents decreased during by million primarily as a result of investment in property and equipment of approximately million  including deferred exploration costs of million and development costs of million million at illinois creek  alaska  million at thunder mountain  idaho  and at cala abajo  puerto rico  and cash used in operations of million 
these were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of  principally proceeds from the sale of the company s interest in the kinsley mountain project in nevada 
the company completed its feasibility study of the illinois creek project in february it is the company s goal to commence mining in the summer of the company estimates that the costs necessary to develop the illinois creek mine and place it into production will be approximately million including approximately million in working capital and milllion in property acquisition costs which may be paid by the issuance of usmx common stock 
the company intends to use its internal cash resources and the proceeds of a million facility to finance the development and construction costs 
the commitment for this facility is subject to several conditions  including a satisfactory due diligence report from an independent engineering firm  receipt of necessary permit approvals and completion of documentation satisfactory to the lender 
in order for the company to commence mining at the illinois creek mine in the summer of  the facility must be obtained in the spring of and the company must continue to make substantial development expenditures 
the company s working capital is expected to decrease substantially as the company expends funds on the illinois creek project 
the company is considering the use of internal sources of capital other than its cash resources  including its montana tunnels net profits interest and its holdings in alta gold co 
common stock 
the company has also retained a canadian investment banking firm as its financial advisor for the purpose of formulating and implementing a plan to assist the company in raising additional funds to partially fund the illinois creek and thunder mountain projects and for strategic acquisitions 
the company has no firm commitment for additional financing 
the company has filed a notice of intent to operate with the idaho department of lands describing the company s proposed gold and silver mining activities in the thunder mountain project 
management estimates that the project would require substantial capital to place it into production  including working capital 
if the project is sufficiently attractive to warrant continued development and the necessary permits are obtained  construction could begin in with the earliest completion date in management believes that the company will probably need to obtain additional capital to place thunder mountain into production 
the company s balance sheet at december   reflects a total of million in accrued reclamation liabilities associated with its acquisition and operation of the goldstrike mine 
reclamation activities in will focus primarily on recontouring  topsoiling and planting heap number one and the completion of rinsing and commencement of recontouring and topsoiling of heap number two as well as the dismantling of the process plant and reclamation of the plant site 
the goal is to gain acceptance of the company s final closure plan by midyear and to achieve final closure by mid this reclamation is expected to be financed with internally available cash balances  cash generated from the sale of gold produced as a by product of heap rinsing and cash previously provided to the state of utah as reclamation surety 
results of operations the company realized a net loss for the year ended december   of  compared with net income of  for and  for the loss for includes mineral property abandonments and impairments of  the results include a  income tax credit 
this credit is primarily the result of the difference between the estimated federal income tax provision and the actual liability reflected on the income tax returns which were prepared and filed after the financial statements had been issued 
the results include a gain of approximately  from the sale of the company s alligator ridge assets in two separate transactions during the year  additional federal income taxes of  and property abandonments totaling fluctuations in the company s results of operations from year to year arise primarily from four factors changes in the volume of gold sold and the selling price of gold  changes in the cost of gold sold  the cost of mineral properties abandoned during any given period  and asset dispositions 
change in the volume of gold sold and selling price of gold the following table analyzes the variance in gold sales revenue for the years ended december    and revenue variance analysis year ended december  ounces of gold sold    average price realized per ounce change in revenue attributable to more less ounces sold    higher lower price    increase decrease in gold sales revenue compared to the preceding year    change in costs applicable to sales cost of gold sold cost of gold sold was  or approximately per ounce in compared to  or approximately per ounce in and  or approximately per ounce in the fluctuation in the cost of gold sold is a result of the change from period to period in the mix of production from the company s mines and the change in the cost of production throughout the life of each mine as illustrated in the table below 
year ended december  alligator gold goldstrike goldstrike ridge strike total ounces of gold produced      ounces of gold sold      per ounce statistics cash production costs incurred depreciation  depletion  amortiza tion and reclamation accruals production cost per ounce produced gold sales revenue production cost per ounce sold change in inventories and deferred production costs cost of gold sold mining taxes production royalties costs applicable to sales gross profit loss sold august  the goldstrike mine was acquired effective november  cash production costs per ounce of gold produced at the company s goldstrike mine increased to for from for despite the fact that no mining  crushing or pad loading costs were incurred after october because a significant portion of processing costs are fixed and  therefore  do not decrease as production decreases 
as the result of a reduction of the estimated remaining recoverable ounces of gold at the goldstrike mine  change in inventories and deferred production costs increased to per ounce sold for from in mining taxes and royalties during  the company incurred  in mining taxes compared to  in and  in the decrease in mining taxes in and is attributable to the decrease in ounces sold compared to the previous year as a result of declining production at the goldstrike mine 
also  the company incurred  in royalty expense for compared to  in and  in the increase in production royalties per ounce of gold sold is attributable to the monthly minimum royalty paid at goldstrike through january of cost of mineral properties abandoned and provisions for impairments of investments in mineral properties the company periodically reviews the carrying values of its properties 
in  management determined that properties with an aggregate historical cost of  no longer held sufficient promise to justify the cost of maintenance 
the properties abandoned in were tule canyon  divide  and three other properties  in the united states and la cienega  jalisco copper  and four other properties  in mexico 
property abandonments were  and  in and  respectively 
the properties abandoned in were the ancho canyon  new mexico  and the south pass  wyoming  placer properties  both of which were acquired during the year 
the properties abandoned in were the tombstone  arizona project  green springs  cedar mountain  emigrant springs  and three other properties 
in  the commonwealth of puerto rico adopted legislation which amended the mining law to prohibit future mining of metallic deposits by open pit methods 
although the company is considering various strategies and responses  the effect of the mining law  as currently amended  is to render the company s plan for development of the cala abajo deposit uneconomic 
as a result  in the company reduced the carrying value of this property to zero and recorded an impairment loss of million 
gold production at the company s goldstrike mine in utah declined sharply in august and september of this decline in gold recovery triggered a reevaluation of the estimated remaining recoverable gold ounces in the heaps 
as a result  the carrying value of deferred mining and processing costs was reduced to the fair market value of the remaining gold bullion and dore at the refinery and the company recorded an impairment loss of million 
because exploration efforts to date have not yet yielded an economic deposit at the amargosa polymetallic prospect in chihuahua  mexico  management determined in the fourth quarter of to reduce the carrying value of this property by million 
asset dispositions in april  the company sold its interest in the kinsley mountain project in elko county  nevada to alta gold co 
alta 
in addition to the  previously received  the company received  in cash and alta restricted common stock with a then market value of  in april  the company received a final cash payment of  and additional alta restricted common stock with a then market value of  the company received  and retained at december   a total of  shares of alta restricted common stock 
the cash proceeds and discounted value of the stock received were recorded as a reduction to the carrying value of the property on the company s books 
in  the company recorded a loss on this transaction of  during  the company sold its mining assets located at alligator ridge in white pine county  nevada in two separate transactions for a total of million cash  plus the assumption by the buyer of all related obligations  including reclamation liabilities 
after deducting the net book value of the assets sold of approximately million  the company recorded gains from these sales totaling approximately million during the net book value of the assets sold comprised million in deferred mining  crushing  pad loading and processing costs associated with ounces of gold in various stages of production  plus million remaining investment in property  plant and equipment  less recorded reclamation liabilities of million 
other factors general and administrative expenses were higher in than principally due to legal and other professional fees paid relative to the cala abajo project and to salaries and related expenses of additional corporate staff 
general and administrative expenses in were comparable to those incurred in prospecting costs in were lower than as a result of the concentrated effort by the company s exploration staff to complete development drilling at the illinois creek  alaska property 
prospecting costs in were slightly higher than in due to expanded investigation of various latin american properties in higher interest rates in compensated for decreasing cash balances during the year 
as a result  interest income for was comparable to interest income was higher in than due to higher interest rates in income tax expense primarily represents current and deferred federal regular and alternative minimum taxes 
the entire income tax benefit of  for is the result of an adjustment to federal income taxes receivable related to net operating losses carried back to prior years 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of the provision for income taxes for  and to the statutory federal income tax rate 
trends which may affect future results of operations as previously stated  fluctuations in the company s results of operations arise primarily from four factors changes in the volume and selling price of gold  changes in the cost of gold sold  the cost of mineral properties abandoned during any given period and asset dispositions 
the following is management s view of trends in these factors 
change in the volume of gold sold and selling price of gold volume the company expects minimal production from its goldstrike mine in the company s principal focus is on the development of its illinois creek and thunder mountain projects 
the company is also actively involved in exploration activities and periodically considers acquisition opportunities 
it is the company s goal to commence mining at the illinois creek mine in the summer of if this can be achieved by the target date of september  the company forecasts production at the illinois creek mine of approximately  ounces of gold in based on the company s feasibility study which is currently being reviewed by an independent engineering firm  and subject to revision the company projects that approximately  ounces of gold could be produced in the company projects that the drill defined mineralization consists of million tons grading ounces per ton gold equivalent or approximately  contained equivalent ounces of gold 
metallurgical recovery from the run of mine ore is projected to be approximately of contained gold and of the contained silver 
the company s ability to achieve the forecasted gold production will be dependent upon many factors  some of which  such as the price of gold and climate conditions  are beyond the control of the company 
no assurance can be given that the indicated amount of gold will be recovered 
as with any development project  there is no operating history upon which to base estimates of future cash operating costs and capital requirements 
estimates of mineralization  metallurgical recovery  and cash operating costs are to a large extent based on the interpretation of geologic data obtained from drill holes and other sampling techniques and feasibility reviews which derive estimates of cash operating costs based on anticipated tonnage and grades of ore to be mined and processed  the configuration of the ore body  expected recovery rates of metals from the ore  comparable facility and equipment costs  anticipated climate conditions and other factors 
accordingly  actual cash operating costs and economic returns of the illinois creek project and other projects that may be undertaken by the company may materially differ from the costs and returns initially estimated 
the company has obtained a commitment for a million facility to finance development and construction costs on the illinois creek project 
the company will need to promptly finalize  and commence use of funds  from this facility  in order for the company to commence mining in the summer of closing is subject to several conditions  including completion of a satisfactory due diligence report from an independent engineering firm  the company s receipt of necessary permit approvals  and completion of documentation satisfactory to the lender 
the illinois creek project has required extensive planning by the company  due in particular to the special logistical aspects of gaining access to the site 
transportation of equipment  construction materials  supplies and personnel to the site will involve various modes of transportation 
most goods are to be staged in seattle  washington  loaded into containers  and shipped by barge to anchorage  alaska 
materials will then be transported from anchorage to galena using trucks  barges and railroads 
from galena  the goods will be flown to the site using various aircraft 
major components of some of the larger mining equipment will be flown to the site using c aircraft 
there is only one such airworthy aircraft currently available for use by the company 
in addition  there is one additional c available to supply spare parts if needed 
the company is in the process of finalizing arrangements for use of these aircraft  which requires special permission 
if the company is unable to transport all of the components it currently plans to transport using the c aircraft  substantial delays and additional costs could be incurred as the components would have to be cut into smaller pieces  transported to the site using smaller aircraft and reassembled at the site 
if substantial delays occur  the company would not be able to commence mining in the summer of due to weather conditions  mining operations cannot be conducted year round 
therefore  if mining operations are not started in the earliest operations could commerce would be late spring of it is the company s goal to initiate construction of the dewey mine facilities in the thunder mountain mining district  idaho  in the summer of in january the company submitted a notice of intent to operate with the idaho department of lands  which is currently being reviewed by that agency and other state and federal agencies  including the us forest service 
the company is presently conducting a data sufficiency review of prior studies pertaining to the project area and previous operations conducted near the project area 
the company intends to thereafter retain an independent environmental consulting firm to coordinate the submission of an environmental impact statement 
the views of several governmental agencies  as well as any public comments received  are expected to be considered in connection with the review of the environmental impact statement 
although the company forecasts that it has a realistic prospect of obtaining the necessary permits in  there can be no assurance that this will be achieved 
a feasibility study by the company will be ongoing throughout to refine the project design and economics 
it is presently anticipated that conventional open pit heap leaching techniques will be used 
the company will also be conducting additional metallurgical work  finalizing the acquisition of adjacent land  and making preliminary arrangements for facility construction and mining operations 
the company s operations will be subject to all of the operating hazards and risks normally incident to operation of mineral properties  such as unusual or unexpected geological formations  environmental hazards  industrial accidents  labor disputes  equipment incapability or failures  and inclement weather conditions 
such occurrences could result in damage to  or destruction of  mineral properties or production facilities  personal injury or death  environmental damage  delays in mining  monetary losses and possible legal liability 
moreover  the company s mining operations will be subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations governing production  taxes  labor standards  occupational health  waste disposal  protection and remediation of the environment  reclamation  mine safety  toxic substances and other matters 
compliance with such laws and regulations has increased the cost of planning  designing  drilling  developing  constructing  operating and closing other mines and facilities previously operated by the company 
in addition  the company has expended significant resources  both financial and managerial  to comply with environmental protection regulations and permitting requirements and anticipates that it will continue to do so in the future 
although the company believes that it has made adequate provision to comply with such regulations  there can be no assurance that additional significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred to comply with current and future environmental protection regulations 
moreover  it is possible that future developments  such as increasingly strict environmental protection laws  regulations and enforcement policies  and claims for damages to property and persons resulting from the company s operations  could result in substantial costs and liabilities in the future 
price of gold another significant uncertainty facing the company which could potentially impact its financial position  profitability and liquidity in the short term is the price of gold 
the gold price is a function of a number of factors including investors expectations with respect to inflation  the strength of world currencies  decisions by central banks regarding their gold reserves  and supply and demand factors  none of which is under the control of company management 
after trending downward over the past several years  making a six year low during the fourth quarter of  the price of gold rebounded in reaching a high of on august  the average market price of gold was an ounce during and compared to an ounce during change in the cost of gold sold the cost of gold sold which is planned to be produced at the company s illinois creek mine is estimated on the basis of the projected life of mine average cost of approximately per ounce of gold including per ounce of gold representing amortization of the company s planned total capital investment in the mine and per ounce of gold cash cost 
cost of mineral properties abandoned the cost of mineral properties abandoned in any period is a function of the results of the company s exploration efforts and economic considerations 
the company currently expects to invest approximately million during for property acquisition and exploration 
the company makes every effort to maximize the results of its exploration efforts 
however  exploration for economically recoverable metals involves significant risk 
accordingly  while it is probable there will be abandonment losses in the future  it is not possible to predict either the timing or amount
