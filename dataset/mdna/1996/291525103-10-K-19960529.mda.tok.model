item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
general the performance of a radio group  such as emmis  is customarily measured by the ability of its stations to generate broadcast cash flow 
although broadcast cash flow is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and should be viewed as a supplement to and not as a substitute for the company s results of operations presented on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles  the company believes that broadcast cash flow is useful because it is generally recognized by the radio broadcasting industry as a measure of performance and is used by analysts who report on the performance of broadcasting companies 
the main components of broadcast cash flow are advertising revenues net of agency commissions and operating expenses 
the primary source of advertising revenues is the sale of advertising time to local and national advertisers 
the most significant operating expenses are employee salaries and commissions  costs associated with programming  advertising and promotion  and station general and administrative costs 
the company s revenues are affected primarily by the advertising rates its radio stations charge 
these rates are in large part based on the stations ability to attract audiences in demographic groups targeted by their advertisers  as measured principally on a quarterly basis by arbitron radio market reports 
because audience ratings in a station s local market are critical to the station s financial success  the company s strategy is to use market research and advertising and promotion to attract and retain listeners in each station s chosen demographic target group 
in addition to the sale of advertising time for cash  radio stations typically exchange advertising time for goods or services which can be used by the station in its business operations 
the company generally confines the use of such trade transactions to promotional items or services for which the company would otherwise have paid cash 
in addition  it is the company s general policy not to pre empt advertising spots paid for in cash with advertising spots paid for in trade
