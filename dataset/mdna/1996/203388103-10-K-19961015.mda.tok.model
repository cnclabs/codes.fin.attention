item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations the company derives substantially all of its revenue from calls placed from its payphone and inmate phone network 
coin revenue is derived from calls made by depositing coins in the telephone 
non coin revenue is derived from calls that are placed using either a calling card or credit card or as a collect call where the called party will be charged for the call 
the call may also be billed to a third party 
the company currently realizes revenue from long distance carriers pursuant to federal and state regulation as compensation for dial around calls made from its payphones 
the fcc has recently released a decision increasing the amount of dial around compensation payable to the company 
see regulation 
the company s operating expenses include line access charges  commissions  field service and collection expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses 
line access charges include interconnection and local measured usage charges paid to lecs  long distance transmission charges  billing  collection and validation costs and operator services charges 
commissions are fees paid regularly to business operators based on a percentage of revenue generated by the company s payphones and have generally increased over prior years as competition among payphone operators for attractive payphone locations has increased 
field service and collection expenses include the costs of collecting and processing coins  maintaining and repairing the telephones and technical support for polling  software maintenance and diagnostics performed on the company s payphones 
service and collection functions for the company s payphone operations have been outsourced to perot pursuant to the services agreement 
since completing its initial public offering in december  the company embarked on an acquisition program  acquiring the businesses and operations of companies that added over  payphones and more than  inmate phones to cci s operations 
in fiscal  the company temporarily discontinued its acquisition program  focusing instead on consolidating its operations and enhancing the profitability of its existing payphone and inmate phone bases 
subject to the availability of capital to make acquisitions  the regulatory environment in which cci operates and other constraints  management hopes that the company will be able to resume its acquisition activity in fiscal  although no assurance to that effect can be given 
the reduction in acquisition activity in fiscal is expected to reduce the company s year to year growth in terms of its weighted average number of installed payphones and inmate phones  which is  in turn  expected to reduce revenue growth in fiscal this reduction in revenue growth  however  may be partially offset by changes in the company s regulatory environment  including those that will produce increases in the company s dial around compensation 
see regulation 
the company entered into the services agreement with perot in july the services agreement provides that perot will operate the company s management information systems and manage the field services and sales fulfillment functions of the company s payphone operations for a period of years in exchange for a monthly fee equal to the greater of a specified percentage of cci s revenues attributable to the company s payphone operations or a flat per phone charge  as well as certain cash incentives for increasing operating performance measurements or overall revenues on a per phone basis 
the services agreement assumes  for purposes of calculating the monthly fee  that the company will maintain a minimum number of payphones 
the services agreement does not include the company s inmate phone operations  which remain the responsibility of cci 
changes in regulation are ongoing for the company with the recent passage of the telecom act 
on september   the fcc issued a report and order implementing the payphone specific provisions of the telecom act 
among its directives  the fcc has prescribed dial around compensation for all access code and subscriber calls from payphones at a flat rate of per payphone per month for the first year  with a per call compensation system to be implemented by october  under which compensation will be paid at a rate of 
per call 
the fcc also ordered the deregulation of local coin rates within one year  subject to certain guidelines 
these and other regulatory changes will significantly impact the company s operations for the foreseeable future 
see regulation 
fiscal compared to fiscal total revenues for fiscal increased to million from million for fiscal  an increase of 
the increase in total revenues resulted primarily from the increased number of weighted average phones added to the company s phone network during fiscal from acquisitions completed prior to fiscal the increase in total revenues reflects increases of in revenues derived from coin calls and in revenues from non coin calls 
non coin revenue was proportionately higher in fiscal due to the increase in the weighted average number of the company s inmate phones  which generate non coin revenue only 
however  management believes that non coin revenue from the company s payphones continued to be adversely affected in fiscal by increases in dial around calls influenced by national advertising promotions of long distance operator service providers 
in fiscal  the company installed  new payphones unrelated to acquisitions down from  in fiscal net of removals  incremental net growth from internal sales declined by  payphones in fiscal compared to an increase of payphones in fiscal additionally  net new inmate lines were installed that were attributable to the company s sales and marketing efforts during fiscal compared to in fiscal an aggressive program of removing unprofitable payphones and inmate lines decreased the weighted average number of installed payphones to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  a decrease of 
management does not anticipate that the company s weighted average number of installed payphones and inmate phones will substantially increase in fiscal line access charges increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to the increased number of average phones in the company s inmate division 
these charges increased to of total revenues in fiscal as compared to in fiscal commissions paid to customers increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal these amounts represented of total revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal the dollar increase was primarily due to the increased number of average phones in the company s inmate division 
the percentage increase as well as a portion of the dollar increase was attributable to higher commission rates paid on revenues derived primarily from the company s inmate phones  which comprised a larger portion of the company s total phone base in fiscal as compared to fiscal service and collection expenses increased to million or of total revenues from million or of total revenues in fiscal the dollar increase was due to the increased number of average phones in the company s inmate division 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a decrease as a percentage of total revenues to from 
the percentage decrease primarily reflects a decrease in the internal marketing efforts in first half of fiscal bad debt expense in fiscal increased to million or of total revenues from million or of total revenues in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the increase in the revenues attributable to inmate phones verses payphones 
the bad debt associated with the company s payphones has historically averaged between and of the affected revenue 
the company s inmate phones  whose entire revenue is generated by non coin calls  is subject to bad debt which has historically averaged between and depreciation and amortization expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to an additional depreciation expense of million associated with the addition of phones and related property and equipment pursuant to acquisitions made in prior fiscal years 
also contributing to the increase was additional amortization expenses of million related to the amortization of goodwill and other intangible costs associated with these acquisitions 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company recognized an impairment loss of million in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
cash flows generation by payphones and inmate lines on an acquisition by acquisition basis was determined based on the company s best estimates of future income and expenses including the impact of a continued reduction in operator service provider revenue as a result of dial around 
where the sum of future undiscounted cash flows of these long lived assets were less than their recorded book values  an impairment was recognized 
approximately million of the impairment recognized was for related operating equipment and approximately million was for related intangible assets 
the preceding factors combined to produce an operating loss of million or of total revenues in fiscal  compared to operating income of million or in fiscal earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda declined to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal ebitda is not determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap nor  as a result  is it included as a line item in the company s consolidated financial statements 
ebitda is not presented as an alternative to gaap operating income or cash flows from operations as shown on the company s statements of cash flows 
however  it is a commonly accepted measure of performance in the telecommunications industry 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal primarily due to increases in the level of debt associated with the acquisitions discussed above  as well as increases in the interest rate on floating rate debt 
as a result of the foregoing  the company reported a net loss of million or per share on million shares outstanding in fiscal  compared to net income of million or 
per share on million shares outstanding in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal total revenues for fiscal increased to million from million for fiscal  an increase of the increase in total revenues resulted primarily from the increased number of payphones added to the company s payphone network during fiscal from completed acquisitions 
the increase in total revenues reflect increases of in revenues derived from coin calls and in revenues from non coin calls 
in addition  non coin revenue was higher in fiscal due to the increase in the number of the company s inmate phones  which generate non coin revenue only 
management believes that non coin revenue from the company s payphones was adversely affected in fiscal by increases in dial around calls influenced by national advertising promotions of long distance operator service providers

the percentage decrease reflects the operating efficiencies associated with economies of scale attributable to a larger revenue base 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was due primarily to additional depreciation expense of million associated with the acquisition of the phones and related property and equipment previously discussed 
also contributing to the increase was additional amortization expense of million related to the amortization of goodwill and other intangible costs associated with these acquisitions

interest expense increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal primarily due to increases in the level of debt associated with the acquisitions discussed above  as well as increases in the interest rate on floating rate debt 
income tax expense increased to million or an effective rate of in fiscal compared to  or an effective rate of in fiscal  largely due to the higher level of income  not all of which could be offset by net operating loss carryforwards 
as a result of the foregoing  the company reported net income of million or 
per share on million shares outstanding in fiscal  compared to million or 
per share on million shares outstanding in fiscal liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  the company financed its operations from operating cash flow and proceeds from its principal credit agreement the credit agreement 
amounts outstanding under the aforementioned facility were million at june   compared to million at june  net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was approximately million compared to million for fiscal the company s working capital was approximately million with a current ratio of to at june  this compares to a working capital balance of million and a current ratio of at june  the change in the company s working capital is primarily a result of a current maturity of million on the credit agreement 
the company s principal commitments as of june  consisted of a commitment under the services agreement to purchase  of software enhancements from perot  and a commitment to repay million in bank debt prior to june  the company believes that its current cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for fiscal the company further believes that it will be able to raise the capital necessary to meet the terms of its credit agreement  including a million dollar payment due on july  however  should the company be unable to access the capital markets by july   it would not be in compliance with the terms of the credit agreement 
the company would then seek a waiver from the lender to allow it additional time to raise the additional equity that is needed 
in august  the company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement the credit agreement 
on october   an amendment was entered into amending the terms of the credit agreement 
the credit agreement  as amended  now requires the company to repay million of its indebtedness thereunder on or before july   and to repay the remaining million of its indebtedness in increments of  per month beginning on january  through the end of the term  which is june  borrowings under the credit agreement  as amended  bear interest at either a libor based or prime rate at the company s option 
in conjunction with the credit agreement  as amended  the company granted the lender warrants to purchase up to  common shares at a nominal price  of which  warrants to purchase  common shares shall be canceled if the company is successful in reducing its outstanding balance on the credit agreement  as amended  to million by november  in order to meet its obligations under the credit agreement  the company is actively seeking to raise an additional million in equity capital 
management believes that the company s ability to raise such additional equity capital will significantly depend upon the implementation by the fcc of the rules pursuant to the telecom act  which could significantly impact the company s prospective results of operations and financial condition 
the fcc s report and order was released on september  see regulation 
if the implementation of the fcc s new payphone rules are delayed or if the net impact of the rules on the prospective results of operations and financial condition of the company is adverse  the ability of the company to raise additional equity capital and meet its payment obligations under the credit agreement may be hampered 
tax matters in the third quarter of fiscal  the company established a reserve of approximately  and charged that amount against coin revenue  to provide for potential amounts due to certain states and the federal government for sales and use taxes and federal excise taxes assessed for prior periods 
prior to that time  the company had paid such sales and use taxes on coin revenue to its vendors of local telephone service and believed that it was not required to pay such taxes directly because such vendors had already assessed the company for and paid taxes on the service 
the company became aware of the requirement to pay such sales and use taxes directly when the department of revenue of the state of texas notified the company of taxes due in november thereafter  the company conducted an investigation of its tax accrual policies in each state in which it conducts business to determine that it was properly reserving for all applicable taxes under the applicable law of each state 
the company has changed its state sales and use tax accrual and payment practices such that  in the opinion of management  it will not be necessary for the company to establish similar sales and use tax reserves in future periods 
the portion of the  reserve relating to federal excise taxes was accrued in connection with the federal excise tax on all toll calls  which the company previously paid to its long distance telephone service vendors 
since establishing the reserve  the company has determined that it overpaid such federal excise taxes through payments to its long distance telephone service vendors by approximately  the company reached a settlement agreement with the internal revenue service irs that netted overpayments against all amounts assessed for prior periods 
the company is currently accruing and paying excise taxes on a quarterly basis and management does not believe that additional reserves for federal excise taxes will be necessary in future periods 
inflation although the company cannot determine the precise effects of inflation  it does not believe inflation has had a material effect on its revenues or results from operations during any of the periods reported

liquidity in order to meet its obligations under the credit agreement  as amended  the company is actively seeking to raise an additional million in equity capital 
management believes that the company s ability to raise such additional equity capital will significantly depend upon the implementation by the fcc of the rules pursuant to the telecom act  which could significantly impact the company s prospective results of operations and financial condition 
the fcc s report and order was released on september  see regulation 
any reconsideration of the order must be completed no later than november  if the implementation of the fcc s new payphone rules are delayed or if the net impact of the rules on the prospective results of operations and financial condition of the company is adverse  the ability of the company to raise additional equity capital and meet its payment obligations under the credit agreement  as amended  may be hampered 
bad debt currently  the company utilizes the services of the lecs in the billing and collection process  as essentially all of the calls made from the company s inmate phones are billed through large clearinghouses that in turn send the information to the lecs for billing and collection 
due to the company s dependence on the lecs for billing and collection  it currently can take the company up to months to determine whether an account is collectible 
this long collection process makes it particularly difficult for the company to estimate the amount of bad debt attributable to the company s inmate phone revenue 
the company has witnessed an increase in the amount of bad debt for its inmate phone revenue over the past year to approximately 
to address the issue of bad debt  the company has begun implementing a program for direct billing that will enable it to bill the called number directly and set parameters for blocking calls based on collection results 
this direct billing program is a new program for the company and in certain states  regulatory approval may be required 
although the company believes that the direct billing program will reduce the amount of bad debt attributable to its inmate phones  no assurance can be given as to the success of the direct billing program 
dial around compensation the fcc s implementation of the payphone specific provisions of the telecom act began with the issuance of a report and order on september   with one of the most important elements being the assurance of fair compensation for virtually all calls from payphones 
in this regard  the fcc decision initially mandates dial around compensation for both access code calls and subscriber calls at a flat rate of per payphone per month  with a transition to a per call system at the rate of 
per call beginning october  the order states that on october   this rate will either be adjusted to equal the local coin rate being charged at the particular payphone  or to a higher or lower dial around compensation rate negotiated between the company and the carriers who are required to pay 
the initial flat rate payment level significantly increases dial around compensation revenues  and the company believes that a per call system at a 
level will further increase these revenues 
however  market forces and factors outside the company s control could substantially affect the resulting revenue impact 
these factors include a change upon reconsideration by the fcc  as well as the fcc s recognition that existing regulations do not prohibit an ixc from blocking subscriber numbers from payphones if the ixc wants to avoid paying per call compensation on these calls 
local coin rate in ensuring fair compensation for all calls  the fcc further determined that local coin rates from payphones should be generally deregulated within one year  but provided for possible modifications or exemptions from deregulation upon a detailed showing by an individual state 
the states may move to deregulation earlier than one year  but a state may also obtain an exemption from deregulation by demonstrat 
ing 
to the commission that there are market failures within the state that would not allow market based rates 
where deregulation is implemented  management believes the company is likely to experience increases in its coin revenue per phone 
however  given the fcc s failure to specify particular requirements for obtaining an exemption  the company is unable to adequately predict the responses of individual states or the market and thus  the ultimate revenue impact of local coin rate deregulation 
other telecom act provisions there are a significant number of telecom act provisions  as implemented by the fcc  that may have substantial impacts upon the company 
see regulation 
among the most important are cessation of subsidies upon the removal of lec payphones from the regulated rate base by april   the rbocs development of specific plans detailing their compliance with nondiscrimination and accounting requirements and other safeguards against subsidies and discrimination  and the rbocs authority to select interlata carriers serving their payphones in conjunction with location owners 
as a whole  the telecom act provisions should significantly change the competitive framework of the public communications industry 
the company believes that the fcc s order will address certain of the fundamental inequities in the payphone and inmate phone markets and lead to a more equitable competitive environment for all providers 
however  since implementation has not yet been finalized and will be ongoing for a number of years  there can be no assurance the fcc s actions will actually result in long term positive results for the company 
billed party preference proceeding the fcc has issued a second notice of proposed rulemaking regarding billed party preference bpp and associated call rating issues  including potential rate benchmarks and caller notification requirements for and interstate long distance calls 
if bpp is implemented  the billed party would bypass cci s selected long distance carrier and the company would fail to receive any commissions from the carrier 
see regulation 
the company believes that the implementation of bpp is not likely to be achieved  since it would involve significant expense and technological changes as evidenced by the record in the fcc proceeding 
however  should the rate benchmark or caller notification requirements be implemented by the fcc for such operator assisted calling  the company could be negatively impacted  depending upon the specific level of the benchmark or the particular notification requirements 
without further fcc action  for which a timetable is not mandated  the company is unable to reasonably assess any potential impact that bpp  rate benchmarks or notifications  if implemented  might have on its payphone and inmate phone operations
