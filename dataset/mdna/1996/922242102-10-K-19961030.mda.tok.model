the effect of the decreases in these three product categories was partially offset by a significant increase in sales of skateboards 
with respect to in line skates  gross sales for fiscal totaled  a decrease of approximately  or  compared to fiscal  as unit volume in fiscal totaled  units  a decrease of approximately  or 
the average price per unit gross revenues divided by units sold of the company s in line skates was approximately during fiscal  compared to for fiscal as discussed above  the decrease in in line skate sales was primarily due to a soft retail market  as well as to a decline in consumer demand for in line skates in general as compared to the significant annual growth in this market experienced over the past few years

increased competition in the mass market  particularly with respect to in line skates and safety helmets  also has had and continues to have an impact upon the company s gross margin

liquidity and capital resources from inception to completion of its initial public offering  the company funded its activities principally from cash flow generated from operations  credit facilities with institutional lenders and  to a lesser degree  loans from its stockholders 
in june  the company completed an initial public stock offering  issuing a total of  new common shares which raised approximately  in proceeds to the company  net of fees and expenses 
a portion of these proceeds were used by the company to pay off borrowings on its line of credit and for other working capital purposes 
the remainder was invested in marketable securities with maturities generally raging from one to three years 
the company has a credit agreement with a major bank providing a million revolving line of credit  with separate sublimits of million each for the issuance of commercial letters of credit and actual borrowings 
the agreement  which expires february   is unsecured and carries an interest rate equal to prime minus  and also offers certain libor based interest options 
the amount the company may borrow is limited by the level of its eligible accounts receivable and inventory  and the company must satisfy certain financial covenants 
over the past several years  borrowings have varied  typically reaching highest levels in the pre christmas periods 
balances on the line of credit are classified as current liabilities on the company s balance sheet 
there was no balance outstanding under the revolving line of credit as of july  in may  the company  through its wholly owned subsidiary  static snowboards  inc  acquired the assets of plunkett snowboards  inc  an existing snowboard manufacturer  in exchange for  in cash and  shares of variflex  inc common stock with a market value on that date of approximately  the company recorded the acquisition using the purchase method of accounting  and substantially all of the purchase price was recorded as goodwill  to be amortized over years

future liquidity and financial position the company intends to continue to focus upon building and maintaining its existing product lines  including its new line of snowboards 
the company also intends to continue to devote effort and resources to continuing development and placement of the new static brand of in line skates  skateboards and snowboards 
in addition  management continues to explore the possibility of making selected acquisitions of other companies or products which would offer a strategic fit with the company s existing products and its sourcing and distribution channels in the mass market 
the company also is considering expanding international distribution and developing additional distribution arrangements in order to take further advantage of growth opportunities which management believes exist for its products outside the united states 
management believes that its current cash position  funds available under existing banking arrangements  and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the company s presently projected cash and working capital requirements for the next fiscal year assuming continued financial performance at present levels 
foreign exchange management does not believe that the fluctuation in the value of the dollar in relation to the currency of its suppliers the new taiwan dollar has in the last three fiscal years had any significant adverse impact on the company s ability to purchase products at agreed upon prices 
typically  the company and its suppliers negotiate prices in new taiwan dollars 
at the same time  they will agree upon a fixed exchange rate for a specified period  generally three to six months 
the company s payments to suppliers are then made in us dollars based upon the agreed upon exchange rate 
although exchange rate fluctuations have generally been to the benefit of the company over the past three fiscal years  there can be no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will be favorable to the company in the future
