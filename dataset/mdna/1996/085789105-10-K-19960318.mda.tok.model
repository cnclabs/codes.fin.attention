item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides information on the results of operations for the three years ended december  and the financial condition  liquidity and capital resources as of december  the financial statements and the notes thereto contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with this discussion 
the profitability of the company s operations in any particular accounting period will be directly related to the average realized prices of oil and gas sold  the type and volume of oil and gas produced and the results of acquisition  development and exploration activities 
the average realized prices of oil and gas will fluctuate from one period to another due to world market conditions and other factors 
the california crude oil prices are especially sensitive since a significant portion of california s crude oil needs are met by imports from alaska 
the aggregate amount of oil and gas produced may fluctuate based on development and exploitation of oil and gas reserves pursuant to current reservoir management plans 
production rates  steam costs  labor and maintenance expenses are expected to be the principal influences on operating costs 
accordingly  the results of operations of the company may fluctuate from period to period based on the foregoing principal factors  among others 
results of operations the company returned to profitability in  earning net income of million  up significantly from a net loss of million in and net income of  in this significant improvement was due primarily to higher oil prices  lower steam costs due to the acquisition of the remaining interest in the cogeneration facility  a gain on the sale of the rincon properties  the reduction of exploratory dry hole costs in  and the impairment of properties and oil spill costs recorded in and with no comparable charge in production boe per day    average sales price per boe operating cost per boe dd a per boe operating income from producing operations was million in  up and from million and million in and  respectively 
this improvement was due primarily to higher oil prices and reduced operating costs 
the average sales price received per boe during of was and higher than the prices received in and  respectively 
oil and gas production in was comparable to  but down from on november   the company sold its rincon properties which accounted for approximately boe day of production 
in addition  the company shut in a number of marginal wells in and reduced steaming operations from levels on certain marginally economic properties 
to protect the company s revenues from potential price declines  effective august   the company entered into a bracketed zero cost collar hedge contract with a california refiner for a term of months related to approximately of its crude oil production 
the posted price of the company s degree api gravity crude oil was used as the basis for the hedge 
there is no initial cost to the company and there will be no material financial impact unless crude oil prices increase or decrease significantly from current levels 
a similar contract for an additional of the company s crude production with a month term was entered into in early operating costs per boe in declined from to due largely to a reduction in steam costs which have historically represented the largest component of operating costs to the company 
as part of the company s continuing effort to reduce operating costs  the company purchased the remaining interest in the cogeneration plant which provides steam to the company s homebase properties located in the midway sunset field 
in addition  the company increased production from the montalvo field during and sold its rincon properties on november   both of which incurred higher operating costs relative to the other properties operated by the company 
due to these events and the company s ongoing cost reduction program  operating costs per boe continued to decline to in the fourth quarter of from and in the third and second quarters of  respectively 
dd a per boe declined to in from and in and  respectively 
this decline was due primarily to the lower depletable basis of the company s assets resulting from the impairment  dry hole and abandonment charges recorded in on november   the company sold its rincon properties located in ventura county  california for approximately million plus certain reimbursements  which resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately million 
net daily production from the six leases represented approximately of the company s production levels 
this property was considered non core  was expensive to operate and would have required significant capital outlays to maximize the property s value 
general interest income in was million  up from million and million in and  respectively  due primarily to higher average interest rates on invested cash balances in general and administrative expenses were million in  down and from million and million incurred in and  respectively 
the company is focused on cost reduction and incurred lower payroll related costs due to attrition  the consolidation of certain administrative functions and lower medical costs 
the company s effective income tax rate in was 
the pre tax losses incurred in and resulted in effective tax benefits of and  respectively 
the most important factor affecting and was the impact of certain tax benefits  primarily enhanced oil recovery credits and percentage depletion  as applied to the pre tax losses in those years 
in the fourth quarter of  the company adopted financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
this adoption resulted in no charges to the company s financial statements for  and is not significantly different than the company s impairment policy in effect prior to the adoption 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources working capital at december  was million  down from million and million at december  and  respectively 
cash flow provided by operating activities of million was up and from million and million in and  respectively 
cash flow was higher in due to higher oil prices and lower operating costs due primarily to the purchase of the cogeneration facility in the company sold its rincon properties in for an additional million in cash plus certain reimbursements 
however  working capital declined due to capital expenditures of million incurred during the year  which included approximately million on the purchase of the remaining interest in the company s cogeneration facility  million on the further development of the homebase properties  including the drilling of additional development wells  and million on the further development of the montalvo field  including the conversion of two wells to a long stroke rod pump system and the return to production of four wells on the prc lease 
in  the company paid million in dividends to its shareholders 
in addition  million was paid in federal and state income taxes resulting from an adverse judgment by the us tax court against the company see note to the company s financial statements 
the company had a million revolving credit and term loan agreement with a major california bank until early there were no outstanding borrowings under this line 
the company is working on obtaining a new revolving credit term loan facility which  when completed  may be used for future acquisitions or other corporate purposes 
the total proved reserves at december  were million boe  up from million boe at december  and million boe at december  although the company produced million boe during the year and sold its rincon properties  the company saw an increase in reserves due primarily to the further development of the company s prc lease  the development of the alpine lease purchased in the fourth quarter of  the acquisition of the usl lease in the midway sunset field  higher oil prices and lower estimated future operating costs 
the development program excluding the purchase of the remaining interest in the cogeneration facility and usl lease acquisition were successful in adding proved reserves  replacing of production at an average cost of per boe 
the company s estimated future pre tax discounted cash flow  using a discount rate  increased and to million at december  from million at december  and million at december   respectively 
future developments in  the company plans to adopt the disclosure option of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
senate bill s 
allowing the export of ans crude oil has been passed by congress and signed by the president  and is currently undergoing limited public hearings 
because of this legislation  the company expects that a larger portion of this crude oil will be sold in markets other than california beginning in the second quarter of the long term impact may be to reduce the differential between crude oil prices on the west coast and other parts of the country 
the company currently sells the electricity produced by its cogeneration facility to a large california based utility under a contract standard offer which determines the electricity payment based upon electrical capacity and by energy provided 
this contract will expire on january  under current law  the company has the right to enter into a similar contract standard offer upon expiration with the same utility at the same energy payment but a lower capacity payment 
the company is analyzing its options with respect to future electricity sales 
management believes that the deregulation in the electrical utility industry currently targeted for in california may provide opportunities for the company to maximize the benefits of its cogeneration facility 
however  failure to achieve a similar or better contract than the existing contract will likely result in higher operating costs related to steam generation than exist currently 
a portion of the natural gas purchases made by the company for use primarily in its steaming operations is subject to an existing long term transportion agreement with a california utility 
the resulting transportation charges related to the gas obtained are significantly above current prevailing market rates 
the agreement will expire in april and the company expects to realize a reduction in operating costs related to this event in and beyond 
on february   the president signed into law a bill which authorizes the sale  within two years  of the elk hills naval petroleum reserve located in kern county  california 
the company believes the sale may result in a significant concentration of the ownership of the light crude oil used as blending stock for the heavy crude oil produced in the san joaquin valley 
if such concentration were to occur  it is possible that the lack of light oil availability could have an adverse impact on the marketability and prices received for this heavy crude oil 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation on the company has not been significant in recent years because of the relatively low rates of inflation experienced in the united states
