item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company develops  markets and supports networked systems management software for distributed  heterogeneous computing environments 
the company s revenues are derived from license fees for software products and fees for a range of services complementing such products  including software maintenance and support  training and system implementation consulting 
software licenses typically are granted on a perpetual  per cpu basis  although the company may grant site or enterprise wide licenses for larger installations 
license fee revenues are recognized upon product shipment if no significant vendor obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is deemed probable 
allowances are established for potential product returns and credit losses  which have not been substantial to date 
fees for services are charged separately from fees for software licenses 
service revenues from customer maintenance services  which include on going product support and periodic product updates  are recognized ratably over the term of each contract  which is typically twelve months 
payments for customer maintenance fees are generally made in advance and are non refundable 
service revenues from training and consulting services are recognized when the services are performed 
license fee revenues have been derived principally from direct sales of software products to end users through the company s direct field sales and telesales force and a national account sales group 
although the company believes that such direct sales will continue to account for a significant portion of license fee revenues  the company expects that revenues from sales through oems  vars  isvs and other indirect channels will increase as a percentage of license fee revenues 
the company s expansion of its field sales force has caused  and is expected to continue to cause  sales and marketing expenses to increase 
the company is also increasingly attempting to direct customers to larger  enterprise wide implementations of the company s products  which may increase the complexity and length of the sales cycle 
in connection with such larger sales  the company may choose to grant greater pricing and other concessions than for single department or local network sales 
the company s operating results have fluctuated  and may continue to fluctuate  on an annual and quarterly basis as a result of a number of factors  many of which are outside of the company s control 
these factors include the timing of significant orders  the length of sales cycles  customer budget changes  the timing of new product introductions  changes in pricing policies by the company or its competitors  product mix  the market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of the company s products  and conditions and events in the computer industry and the general economy 
the company does not maintain a significant backlog  and therefore revenues for each quarter depend to a large extent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
additionally  the company typically realizes a significant portion of license fee revenues in the last month of a quarter  frequently in the last weeks or even days of a quarter 
as a result  license fee revenues for any quarter can be subject to significant variation 
the company establishes its expenditure levels for sales  marketing  product development and other operating expenses based  in large part  on its expected future revenues 
if revenues fall below expectations in a particular quarter  operating results and net income are likely to be materially adversely affected 
a significant portion of the company s operating expenses is fixed  and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts 
any inability of the company to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for any failure to meet sales forecasts or to receive anticipated revenues  or any unexpected increase in product returns or other costs  could magnify the adverse impact of such events on the company s operating results 
further  the purchase of the company s products may involve a significant commitment of capital by the customer  with the attendant delays frequently associated with large capital expenditures and acceptance procedures within an organization 
for these and other reasons  the sales cycle associated with the purchase of client server networked systems management software is typically lengthy and subject to a number of significant risks over which the company has little or no control  including customers budgetary constraints and internal acceptance reviews 
furthermore  the company s business has experienced and is expected to continue to experience significant seasonality  due  among other things  to customer capital spending patterns  the general summer slowdown in the computer industry and the fact that the company s first fiscal quarter coincides with such summer slowdown 
based upon the foregoing and other factors  the company believes that its quarterly revenues  expenses and operating results could vary significantly in the future  that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful  and that  in any event  such comparisons should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance
