some of these proposals are specifically directed at the small group health care market  which could affect the company s principal business 
at the state level  a number of states have passed or are considering legislation that would limit the differentials in rates that carriers could charge between new business and renewal business and with respect to similar demographic groups 
legislation also has been adopted or is being considered that would make health insurance available to all small groups by requiring coverage of all employees and their dependents  by limiting the applicability of pre existing conditions exclusions  by requiring carriers to offer a basic plan exempt from certain mandated benefits as well as a standard plan and by establishing a mechanism to spread the risk of high risk employees to all small group carriers 
at the federal level  several competing proposals have been introduced in congress 
one bill receiving serious current consideration is the health insurance reform act of s 
 which was introduced by senators nancy kassebaum and edward kennedy the kassebaum kennedy bill 
the bill is scheduled to be debated in the senate in mid april 
among other provisions  the kassebaum kennedy bill  if enacted  would build upon state initiatives by guaranteeing group to individual portability 
under the bill  any person governed by a group insurance plan for at least eighteen months would  on leaving the group plan  have the right to buy an individual policy from any insurance company selling individual health insurance policies in that person s state regardless of whether that person has a pre existing condition 
this provision  if enacted  could result in the company insuring individuals who under the company s current underwriting standards would not be insured by the company  which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company is unable to predict when or whether any federal or state proposals  or some combination thereof  will be enacted or  if enacted  the likely impact on the company 
it is possible  however  that the enactment of such health care reform legislation could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company has ceased issuing or coinsuring insurance in the self employed market in two states as a result of legislative developments 
accounting deferred acquisition costs 
under generally accepted accounting principles  certain policy acquisition costs may be deferred and amortized over the expected life of the policy 
for all of the business in the health insurance segment  only the commissions and premium taxes related to the unearned premiums are deferred 
this amount increased to million at december  from million at december   due to an increase in health insurance policies issued or coinsured 
as a result of an increase in life insurance and annuity policies issued in the life insurance and annuity segment  deferred acquisition costs increased to million at december  from million at december  the remaining deferred acquisition costs of million at december  and million at december  relates primarily to the cost of various blocks of insurance acquired 
amortization of the cost of insurance acquired accounts for the decrease on this portion 
deferred acquisition costs are reviewed periodically to determine that the unamortized portion does not exceed expected recoverable amounts 
claims liabilities 
the company records a claims liability for its estimate of the ultimate cost of all reported and unreported claims which are unpaid as of the end of the applicable financial reporting period 
liabilities for medical claims represent the significant majority of claims liability 
the company uses the incurred date method to estimate its liability rather than the service date method 
the service date method estimates the liability for all medical services received by the insured prior to the end of the applicable financial reporting period 
the incurred date method estimates the liability for all medical services related to an accident or illness incurred prior to the end of the period  even though the medical services may not be received by the insured until a later financial reporting period 
the incurred date method is a more conservative method 
the company s claims liabilities are computed using the company s own experience to estimate outstanding claims 
the company periodically tests its estimation process to monitor the degree to which the company s method continues to properly estimate future obligations 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate was for compared to for and in which varied from the federal tax rate of primarily due to the small life insurance company deduction allowed for certain insurance subsidiaries of the company 
liquidity and capital resources the primary sources of cash for the company are premium revenues from policies issued or coinsured  investment income and fees and other income 
the primary uses of cash are payments for benefits  claims and commissions under those policies and operating expenses 
net cash provided from operations totaled approximately million in  million in  and million in the company s insurance subsidiaries invest a substantial portion of these funds  pending payment of their pro rata share of future benefits and claims 
the company s invested assets increased to million at december  from million at december   an increase of million 
the primary sources for asset growth were increases in the funds retained for future payments of health insurance policy liabilities  cash provided by current year earnings  and the increase in market values of the fixed maturity securities held as available for sale 
the increase in market values were the direct result of decreases in long term interest rates 
these sources were offset by withdrawals from investment products primarily annuities and the acquisition of companies relating to the healthcare solutions division in on june   the company issued its senior notes payable due june senior notes in the aggregate amount of million 
the proceeds from the sale of the senior notes were used to repay million of bank debt and to repay the then million of existing debt on a revolving credit note with aegon 
the balance of the proceeds were used for other general corporate purposes 
interest on the senior notes is paid semi annually 
the notes do not require principal repayments until june  and on each june thereafter in the amount of million each until repaid 
the company had no outstanding balance on its revolving credit note with aegon at december  the note bears interest at prime plus 
subsequent to year end  the company amended the note to increase the amount available on the revolving credit note to million 
any amount outstanding will be due august  during october  the company acquired two companies related to the healthcare solutions division 
the acquisitions were funded with cash and the issuance of promissory notes to the former stockholders in the amount of million due in january the promissory notes were non interest bearing loans and were repaid in january during  the company borrowed million from mr 
jensen which was principally used to pay off the then existing indebtedness on the aegon revolving credit note 
the note is due on demand and bears interest at the prime rate 
at march   the outstanding principal amount of the note was million 
during december  the company sold million of credit card loans in two separate transactions 
the sales involved an asset backed securitization in which the company purchased participating interests totaling million 
a portion of the proceeds received by the company was used to repay million of promissory notes due january and for general corporate purposes including the purchase of investments 
there was no gain or loss recorded as a result of these transactions 
at december   the company had approximately million in student loan commitments outstanding of which the company expects to fund approximately million 
these commitments will continue to come due in years through the company estimates that approximately million in student loans will be funded in the company has commitments to fund the unused line of credit on certain credit cards and to purchase the credit card receivables related to the credit cards issued by the credit services division 
at december   the outstanding commitment for the unused line of credit was million 
the company has the right and may be required by the minority stockholders to purchase certain of the shares of the minority stockholders of the insurance subsidiaries of the company at a predetermined formula price 
the formula price based on information available at december  was million 
beginning in december  and in december of each year thereafter  the company may be required by the minority stockholders to purchase the remaining shares of the minority stockholders of one of the companies acquired by the company in  for the healthcare solutions division  at a predetermined formula price 
the formula price based on information available at december  was million 
the aegon transaction is to be effective april  there is no cost to the company other than the purchase of the building and equipment 
the purchase price is estimated to be approximately million which will be funded by one of the insurance subsidiaries of the company from existing funds 
the increase in premiums resulting from the aegon transaction will require additional capital in the insurance subsidiaries to maintain the ratings of the company s insurance subsidiaries 
see item business recent developments 
reinsurance receivables decreased to million at december  from million at december  in  the company assumed a block of life and annuity policies which were ceded to an unrelated reinsurer 
these policies were subject to a moratorium on withdrawals and surrenders at the time of purchase 
a significant portion of the decrease in the reinsurance receivables relates to the surrenders and withdrawals on these policies  which were made in after the expiration of the moratorium period 
there was a corresponding decrease in future policy and contract benefits 
goodwill increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase was the result of two companies acquired in october related to the healthcare solutions division 
the goodwill associated with these acquisitions is being amortized straight line over years 
the state of domicile of each of the company s domestic insurance subsidiaries imposes minimum risk based capital requirements which were developed by the national association of insurance commissioners 
the formulas for determining the amount of risk based capital specify various weighting factors that are applied to financial balances and premium levels based on the perceived degree of risk 
regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of a company s regulatory total adjusted capital  as defined  to its authorized control level risk based capital  as defined 
companies specific trigger points or ratios are classified within certain levels  each of which requires specified corrective action 
the risk based capital ratio of each of the company s domestic insurance subsidiaries significantly exceeds the ratios in which regulatory corrective action would be required 
dividends paid by domestic insurance companies out of earned surplus in any year are limited by the law of the state of domicile

investments general 
the company has an investment committee which monitors the investment portfolio of the company and its subsidiaries 
the investment committee receives investment management services from external professionals 
the largest portion of the company s portfolio is managed by aegon 
investments are selected based upon the parameters established in the company s investment policies 
emphasis is given to the selection of high quality  liquid securities that provide current investment returns 
maturities or liquidity characteristics of the securities are managed by continually structuring the duration of the investment portfolio to be consistent with the duration of the policy liabilities 
consistent with regulatory requirements and internal guidelines  the company invests in a range of assets  but limits its investments in certain classes of assets  and limits its exposure to certain industries and to single issuers 
shown below are the company s investments by category december  december  of total of total carrying carrying carrying carrying amount value amount value dollars in thousands securities available for sale fixed maturities  at fair value cost     equity securities  at fair value cost     guaranteed student loans   mortgage and collateral loans   policy loans   credit card loans   short term investments   total investments   investment accounting policies 
the company has classified its entire fixed maturity portfolio as available for sale which requires the portfolio to be carried at fair value with the resulting unrealized gains or losses  net of applicable income taxes and minority interests  reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
as a result  fluctuations in interest rates will result in increases or decreases to the company s stockholders equity 
at december   the estimated fair value of the company s fixed maturity securities available for sale was million or million more than the amortized cost of million 
the ending balance of stockholders equity at december  was increased by million net of applicable deferred income taxes and minority interests to reflect the net unrealized gain on fixed maturity securities 
fixed maturity securities 
fixed maturity securities accounted for of the company s total investments at december  fixed maturity securities consisted of the following december  of total carrying carrying value value dollars in thousands us treasury and us government agency us  corporate bonds  mortgage backed securities issued by us government agencies and authorities  other mortgage and asset backed securities  included in the fixed maturity portfolio is a concentration of mortgage backed securities such as collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage backed pass throughs 
to limit its credit risk  the company invests in mortgage backed securities which are rated investment grade by the public rating agencies 
also  of the mortgage backed securities are backed by us government agencies 
the company s mortgage backed securities portfolio is a conservatively structured portfolio that is concentrated in the less volatile tranches  in the form of planned amortization classes  sequential payment and commercial mortgage backed securities 
the objectives are to minimize prepayment risk during periods of declining interest rates and minimize duration extension risk during periods of rising interest rates 
the company has less than invested in the more volatile tranches  such as inverse floaters  interest only and principal only type mortgage backed securities 
as of december   million or of the fixed maturity securities portfolio was rated bbb or better investment grade and only million or of the fixed maturity securities portfolio were invested in below investment grade securities less than bbb 
a quality distribution for fixed maturity securities is as follows december  of total carrying carrying rating value value dollars in thousands us governments and us  aa  a  bbb  less than bbb  inflation inflation historically has had a significant impact on the health insurance business 
in recent years  inflation in the costs of medical care covered by such insurance has exceeded the general rate of inflation 
under the major hospital insurance coverage  established ceilings for covered expenses limit the impact of inflation on the amount of claims paid 
under the catastrophic hospital expense plans  covered expenses are generally limited only by a maximum lifetime benefit and a maximum lifetime benefit per accident or sickness 
thus  inflation may have a significantly greater impact on the amount of claims paid under catastrophic hospital expense plans as compared to claims under major hospital coverage 
as a result  trends in health care costs must be monitored and rates adjusted accordingly 
under the health insurance policies issued in the self employed market  the primary insurer generally has the right to increase rates upon days written notice 
the annuity and universal life type policies issued directly and assumed by the company are significantly impacted by inflation 
interest rates affect the amount of interest that existing policyholders expect to have credited to their policies 
however  the company believes that the annuity and universal life type policies are generally competitive with those offered by other insurance companies of similar size  and the investment portfolio is managed to minimize the effects of inflation 
recently issued accounting standards in march  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
since goodwill and fixed assets represent less than of total assets  this new standard will not have a material effect on the company 
in october  the fasb  issued statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the company accounts for its stock compensation arrangements under the provision of apb  accounting for stock issued to employees and intends to continue doing so  therefore this new standard will not have a material impact on the company
