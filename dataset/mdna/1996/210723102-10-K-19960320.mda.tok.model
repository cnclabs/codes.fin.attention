the company expects capital expenditures for through to be million  net of contributions and advances 
the capital construction budget is down from the million for the planning period 
the company s capital spending is beginning to decrease as the company has made many of the improvements required by the safe drinking water act sdwa  the clean water act cwa  and other regulations

water utilities now require higher equity ratios to maintain favorable debt ratings due to the recognition by standard poor s rating system of additional risk of the sdwa requirements and the uncertainty of future regulatory treatment of the cost of these requirements 
this coupled with the size of the through capital expenditure program makes it likely that the company will return to the equity market again in the next few years
