in fiscal  the company began shipping a point to point integrated multiplexer designed for use over digital leased lines 
in fiscal  the company introduced its integrated frame relay access product 
in november the company acquired all the outstanding shares of presticom  a developer of multiprotocol frame relay access devices

as a result of the acquisition  the company expensed approximately million in the quarter ended december  as acquired in process research and development and is amortizing approximately million of goodwill over seven years 
the company s future operating results will be dependent upon the development and growth of the public and private wide area network communications market for its frame relay access products 
this market and product applications within this market are currently emerging and may not continue to develop  whether as a result of competition  technological change  market forces or otherwise 
the company anticipates that  in general  the average sales price for its products will decrease over time due to competition and other factors 
in addition  the company has from time to time introduced new products which are less expensive alternatives to the company s older products 
in such instances  the company must sell more units to maintain the same level of aggregate net sales

a significant number of the company s products are sold or installed in countries  including several in south america  where political or economic issues could adversely affect the purchasing decision of the customer
