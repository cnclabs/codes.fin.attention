item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general since its inception in  the company has been engaged primarily in the research and development of immunostimulants for use in preventing and treating human diseases 
to date  the company has received limited revenues from commercial sales and sales of clinical supplies 
the company has incurred net losses in each year since its inception and expects to incur additional losses for at least the next few years 
at december   the company s accumulated deficit was approximately  the company s results of operations can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and depend  among other factors  on costs related to the progress of clinical trials conducted by the company and  to a lesser extent  on revenues and costs associated with manufacturing 
to date  research and development expenses  together with manufacturing costs  have exceeded product and other revenues in all periods 
the company is not able to estimate with certainty the amount of cash and working capital which may be needed for operations 
such requirements typically vary depending upon the results of basic research and clinical trials  the time and expense required for governmental approval of products  and competitive and technical developments  most of which are beyond management s control 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to obtain the necessary funding in sufficient amounts or at the appropriate time for its planned activities 
in the event the company may require additional funding and is not successful in obtaining additional funding  it might not be able to proceed as rapidly as it would like  if at all  with the development and commercialization of its products  which would have a material adverse effect on its future financial condition and results of operations 
pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  several forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties are included within this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
those statements are identified as looking forward 
in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed with each forward looking statement  there are a number of other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projected results  including but not limited to the following results of the company s research  results of other companies research who are using the company s products  competition from other companies  changes in government regulation  including price controls for newly developed drugs  and risk factors listed from time to time in the company s sec reports  including but not limited to this report on form k for the year ended december  results of operations revenues to date  the company has received only limited revenues from commercial sales and sales of clinical supplies 
the balance of the company s revenues has been from contracts and licenses and investment income earned on cash balances and investments 
the company anticipates that its revenues from operations  which increased from approximately  in to approximately  in and decreased to approximately  in  will continue to be limited for at least the next few years 
fees from licenses and contracts increased from  in to  in and decreased to  in in the company received a payment from lederle praxis biologicals lpb  a division of american cyanamid company now a business unit of wyeth ayerst laboratories  which is a division of american home products corporation  upon signing a binding letter of intent to negotiate for a product license agreement 
the non refundable portion of the lpb payment was recognized as revenue in and the remainder was deferred until the license agreement was signed in  retroactive to the lpb agreement provides for annual license fees and  when products are marketed commercially  revenues based on transfer prices and royalties 
late in  the company signed a third license and supply agreement with smithkline beecham sb 
this agreement is for the nonexclusive use of the company s adjuvants in cancer vaccines under development by sb 
the company will receive an annual license fee and certain milestone payments  as well as transfer payments for supplies of adjuvant and royalties on commercial sales of approved cancer vaccines incorporating its adjuvants 
additionally  late in cantab pharmaceuticals research  ltd 
signed a one year option agreement for a co exclusive worldwide license to use mpl immunostimulant commercially upon regulatory approval of cantab s vaccine being developed for treating and preventing genital warts 
increased revenues from these recent agreements will more than offset revenue from a research contract with sb  which expired at the end of investment income increased from  in to  in and decreased to  in the changes in investment income have been due primarily to the amount of funds invested during the periods 
the average interest rate in the investment portfolio increased from approximately at december  to at december  and at december  additionally  in the company sold investments in certain debt mutual funds for proceeds of  on which it realized an investment loss of  approximately  of the proceeds were reinvested in held to maturity securities with the intention of increasing future yield and reducing interest rate risk 
purchases and production purchases and production costs increased from  in to  in and to  in such costs were proportionately higher in and than in compared to sales 
the increase in was caused by two main factors 
the company determined in to manufacture only health care products for humans in its manufacturing facility  which resulted in a write off of certain animal health care inventory components with a cost of nearly  the company completed a manufacturing plant expansion in and has been involved in the scale up and refinement of some of its manufacturing processes  which resulted in additional costs in and looking forward  the company expects manufacturing costs to remain relatively high until throughput in its expanded plant  which started producing materials in the third quarter of  increases to nearer plant capacity 
decreases in per unit manufacturing cost will be dependent upon the company s ability to acquire labor and raw materials at current or near current prices and its ability to achieve the anticipated yield of product from the manufacturing process at higher levels of production 
research and development the company incurred research and development expenses of approximately   and  in  and  respectively 
the year to year increase principally reflects the increasing costs of expanding preclinical and clinical programs for the company s products under development 
these expenses consisted primarily of salaries  contract consulting costs largely related to clinical and preclinical studies  and laboratory supplies 
labor costs decreased from approximately of total research and development costs in to in and in supply costs increased from approximately of total research and development expenses in to in and decreased to approximately in contract consulting costs increased from approximately of total research and development expenses in to in and in in addition to preclinical and toxicology studies  the company completed a phase i ii trial in early using mpl s immunostimulant to prevent or block the effects of septic shock and began a phase ii trial testing mpl c immunomodulator in preventing cardiac reperfusion injury in late  which ran through patient accrual was completed during and in the results were announced from an interim analysis of the data from a phase iii human clinical trial being conducted to compare melacine melanoma theraccine with a four drug regimen of chemotherapy in treating late stage melanoma 
while the quality of life of patients  based on the interim analysis  was superior during treatment  there was no significant statistical advantage in survival benefit of one form of therapy over the other 
the company has continued to evaluate melacine in patients with early stage melanoma and  in addition  opened a phase iii clinical trial in late testing melacine administered in conjunction with interferon alfa b to treat patients with late stage melanoma 
selling  general and administrative this category of expense remained relatively flat at approximately  and  in and  respectively  and increased to  in during this three year period  labor costs increased from  in to  in to  in additionally  in depreciation and amortization increased by  when compared to the previous year and expenses related to the bitterroot valley sanitary landfill landfill increased by  net of insurance reimbursements 
offsetting these increases were decreases in advertising of research products and an increase in administrative and depreciation costs allocated to manufacturing  reflecting the operation of the new plant in in compared to  increased labor costs were offset by a reduction in costs related to the landfill and a greater allocation of costs to manufacturing 
during the company offset landfill expenses with  in insurance proceeds received from one insurance company  which was in rehabilitation  in a one time settlement of any claims associated with the landfill issues 
see note of notes to financial statements 
the company allocates part of its administrative and depreciation costs to the cost of manufacturing products for sale and for use in clinical trials 
such costs allocated in each year  and were   and  respectively 
net loss net loss increased only slightly from approximately  in to  in and increased to  in net loss per share over the same period was 
per share in  
per share in and 
per share in late in and early   shares were issued in a public offering and from warrant exercises  resulting in a decrease in loss per share in inflation has not had a material impact on the results of operations of the company 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations primarily from the issuance and sale of equity securities  limited sales of products  interest earned on investments and payments under contract research and license agreements 
the financing sources have  to date  enabled the company to maintain adequate liquidity 
cash  cash equivalents and investments totaled approximately  at december   as compared to approximately  at december  the principal uses of cash during were approximately  for operations and approximately  for plant and equipment 
the company used approximately more cash in operations in than in  reflecting on a cash basis reduced revenues and higher research and product development expenses 
cash was collected in january under license and option agreements signed in december which  if collected in december  would have reduced the increase in cash used in operations to approximately 
looking forward  cash requirements for operating activities in are expected to increase significantly over levels 
while revenues are expected to increase in  expenses are expected to continue to outpace revenue as the company expands its work in clinical and regulatory areas 
projected cash requirements are dependent upon the company receiving the revenues that are anticipated and conducting the research  particularly the clinical trials  that is projected 
it is possible that sales could be lower  because customers may not order as much material as expected 
it is also possible that patient accrual within planned clinical trials will be slower than anticipated or that the results of the trials or other research will not be as expected 
the company did not raise a significant amount of cash outside of operations during in the company s primary sources of cash were approximately  from the exercise of outstanding warrants and stock options and  from collections on notes receivable accepted in a private placement of common stock and warrants 
during  the company raised  from the sale of common stock and the exercise of options and approximately  from collections on the investor notes receivable 
at december   the company had warrants and options outstanding to acquire shares and warrants which were issued in private placements in and at exercise prices ranging from to per share 
all such warrants expire in if not exercised 
in january the company decided to extend the expiration date of the warrants which expired in april to april and reduce the exercise price from per share to per share 
the change was made to preserve for the company the opportunity to raise additional capital at a very economical cost if the warrants are exercised 
if exercised  the warrants and options in total could provide up to an additional  to the company 
see note of notes to financial statements 
during the company constructed and equipped an expanded manufacturing plant with a total cost of approximately  of which approximately  was paid in the company has been testing and validating the plant and it began producing materials in the third quarter of the company believes that this expansion will enable it to meet its anticipated manufacturing and other facility requirements for the foreseeable future 
the company will require substantial additional funds to continue its research and development programs and to commercialize its products under development 
future capital requirements will depend upon a number of factors  including the rate of expenditure on and the progress of the company s research and development programs  the time and cost to obtain regulatory approvals  and demand for products based on the company s technology 
looking forward  the company believes that its available cash  cash equivalents and investments together with funds from licensing agreements and product sales should be sufficient to meet its capital requirements through the company  the national institutes of health and the bitterroot valley sanitary landfill landfill were notified by the montana department of health and environmental sciences now the department of environmental quality deq  in march that they had been identified as potentially responsible parties prps for groundwater contamination located at and near the site of the landfill in ravalli county  montana 
the deq has filed an action against the landfill  the operator of the landfill and the company seeking reimbursement of costs associated with its oversight activities 
additionally  two landowners in the vicinity of the landfill have filed civil suits seeking unspecified damages for alleged diminished value of land  possible health hazards and loss of domestic water source 
as of december   the company has a reserve of  primarily to cover billed and potential legal  consulting and deq reimbursement costs associated with the company as a prp and the civil suits 
at least some costs related to the civil suits have been and are expected to continue to be covered by insurance 
however  the company is unable to determine its potential liability with respect to the landfill at this time
