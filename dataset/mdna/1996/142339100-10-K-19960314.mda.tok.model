construction materials transportation products general industry total net earnings increased to a record million  or a share  in this compares to total net earnings of million  or a share  in and million  or a share in strong performances by each of the company s major operations produced the record earnings in earnings by operating segment  before income tax  interest  and corporate expense  are summarized below 
construction materials transportation products general industry total construction materials segment sales increased in to million compared to million in domestic non residential roofing sales accounted for the increase  as more square feet of roofing membrane was shipped in versus international operations were restructured in late after continued disappointing performance in most non domestic markets 
in addition  poor results from the company s metal roofing business led to the decision to sell its west coast operations and re focus its efforts on eastern and midwestern markets 
segment earnings in increased over s excellent results  to million 
margins were unfavorably impacted by increased sales of lower margin items and raw material cost increases which were unable to be passed along to customers 
however  the operations were able to maintain comparable profitability  despite continued pricing pressure  through effective cost control and productivity improvements 
selling and administrative expenses in  as a ratio to sales  decreased nearly compared to transportation products segment sales reached million in  a increase over although sales from operations acquired in generated the majority of the growth  every operation in the segment recorded sales gains 
segment earnings improved an outstanding in over  while absorbing the first year financial results experienced at the company s container manufacturing operation 
despite a weaker domestic automotive market in versus  new products and additional capacity combined for an increase of over in sales from the company s custom molded and extruded plastics and rubber parts operations 
custom plastics and rubber operations achieved a earnings improvement while absorbing nearly million of non recurring plant realignment and equipment movement costs in heavy duty friction sales to truck and trailer manufacturers declined slightly in compared to a very strong  as build levels began to slow in the second half of the year 
aftermarket sales were consistent with the prior year as very competitive pricing persisted 
industrial friction and brake products operations both experienced solid sales growth in  from continued penetration in international markets and new product offerings 
overall  earnings from friction and brake products operations improved over from efficiency gains and increased absorption accounted for most of the improvement

replacement sales also increased in  an area where improvements are again expected in specialty tires and wheels operations posted a earnings improvement over s results 
capacity gains and production improvements at the operations manufacturing site in china helped offset higher raw material costs  resulting in margins consistent with foodservice operations benefitted from increased market penetration and expanded product offerings through its strong distribution network  to achieve record sales and earnings results for domestic and international growth combined to increase sales by over improvements in operating expense ratios offset a small decline in gross margins  contributing to overall earnings improvement of over the company s december  acquisition of sparta brush contributed positively to both sales and earnings gains in foodservice operations

gross margins as a percent of sales were in compared to in and in globally depressed selling prices and higher than anticipated material costs in the first year of production at the company s container manufacturing operation  as well as acquisitions of lower gross margin businesses  resulted in the decline in margins in across most operations  and particularly those in the construction materials segment  raw material costs rose in  but only limited success was achieved in passing these increased costs through to customers 
however  higher production volumes allowed manufacturing expenses to be more effectively absorbed  resulting in consistent gross margins at most operations in selling and administrative expenses declined as a percent of sales to in  from in and in the strong performance in controlling expenses was evidenced by the fact that selling and administrative expenses rose only million to support the sales increase of million 
all major operations reported lower expense ratios reflecting the continuation of aggressive cost containment programs 
acquisitions of operations in with comparably lower cost selling and administrative expense structures also contributed to the improved ratios 
research and development expenses increased to million in compared to million in and million in friction and braking systems operations incurred the largest increase in expenses  as a number of new product introductions and test programs were ongoing during the year 
custom plastics and rubber operations also incurred additional product development expenses through equipment acquisition and plant realignment initiatives in the divestiture and closure of certain operations  which were part of the general industry segment in  partially offset the increase in research and development expenses 
interest expense was million in  compared to million in and million in in june of  the company assumed million of long term debt related to the acquisition of trail king 
also  in the second half of  the company secured million of low rate industrial development bonds to finance equipment purchases for its container manufacturing operation 
these actions along with higher interest rates in  contributed to the higher interest expense for the year

continuation of the attention to fundamental practices of cost control  quality improvement  product development  and customer service  combined with the acquisition of businesses that strive to adhere to these operating principles  should result in a year of solid performance 
non residential roofing markets  long dominated by repair and replacement demand  should see an improving new construction roofing market with favorable interest rates 
in the transportation markets  lower interest rates should provide for stable automobile demand  while success in broadening the company s base of customers for custom molded plastics and rubber products should result in another year of improved performance 
while a decline in demand by original equipment customers of friction products is expected  an increase in demand for aftermarket products should result 
a fair domestic market outlook combined with improving international markets should provide the opportunity for strong performance 
solid full year results are expected from the company s specialty trailer operations 
acquired facilities in the northeast and southeast are expected to result in additional penetration of eastern us markets for steel deck trailers 
a steady improvement in the high performance wire and cable business is expected as gains in market share continue  derived from superior product advantages 
continuing productivity gains and strong demand should result in strong growth in the company s refrigerated container business 
continuation of an aggressive market penetration approach should result in another year of improvement in performance at the company s refrigerated container leasing joint venture 
the company s leading position in specialty tires and wheels is expected to result in another record year supported by increased production capacity at its manufacturing site in china
