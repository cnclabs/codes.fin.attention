item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information given below is intended to assist in understanding the company s financial condition and results of operations as reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
the company is the world s leading manufacturer  distributor and international marketer of mobile elevating work platforms used primarily in industrial  commercial  institutional and construction applications 
sales are made principally to independent equipment distributors that rent the company s products and provide service support to equipment users 
the company also sells its products to large independent rental companies 
equipment purchases by end users  either directly from the company or through distributors  comprise a significant  but smaller portion of sales 
the company also generates a small  but growing amount of revenue from sales of used equipment and from equipment rentals and services provided by jlg s equipment services operations 
demand for the company s products tends to be cyclical  responding historically to varying levels of construction and industrial activity  principally in the united states and  to a lesser extent  in other industrialized nations 
during recessionary conditions  demand for rental equipment typically declines more sharply than demand for equipment purchased by end users 
other factors affecting demand include the availability and cost of financing for equipment purchases and the market availability of used equipment 
due to the cyclical demand  the company s financial performance and cash flows tend to fluctuate 
however  the company continually strives to reduce operating costs and increase manufacturing efficiencies 
the company also considers the development and introduction of new and improved products and expansion into underserved geographic markets to be important factors in maintaining and strengthening its market position and reducing cyclical fluctuations in its financial performance and cash flows 
results of operations net sales reached a new high in  rising by over and by from to the growth in revenues for both years included increased demand across virtually all product classes

sales outside the us  as a percent of total sales  were  and in  and  respectively 
new and redesigned products introduced over a two year period contributed  and to sales in  and  respectively 
though the company has a broad base of customers  each of whose purchases may vary significantly from year to year  the company has recently experienced some consolidation among its largest customers  and sales to these customers are increasing in significance 
gross profit  as a percent of sales  increased to in from in  primarily due to the effects of spreading fixed overhead expenses over a higher production base  lower product liability costs and higher selling prices 
this improvement was partially offset by changes in product mix 
gross profit  as a percent of sales  was for both and lower manufacturing costs due to continued improvements in manufacturing processes  lower warranty and product liability costs  and higher selling prices offset increased material costs  a less profitable product mix and costs associated with outsourcing additional production as a result of the substantial increase in demand and capacity limitations 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million and million for and  respectively  but as a percent of sales decreased to in from in and in the dollar increase for both years included higher personnel and related costs  increased consulting and advertising expenses and increased expenses from foreign operations  all of which primarily related to increased business levels 
the increase in expenditures between and were partially offset by a reduction in bad debt expenses 
the increase between and also included higher research and development spending 
the effective income tax rate was in compared to and in and  respectively 
the effective income tax rate for was lower than the rate in  primarily due to a larger tax benefit associated with export sales in  while the rate for was higher than the rate for due to the tax benefit from closing an overseas facility in financial condition the company strengthened its financial position during through increased cash from operations and the sale of its material handling division 
cash generated from operating activities improved by million in and million in  principally due to the increased profitability of the company 
working capital increased by million in and million in primarily due to higher business levels 
the company also invested an additional million in and million in to expand its jlg equipment services operation 
capital expenditures were and million in and  respectively 
at july   the company had unused credit lines totaling million and cash balances of million 
the company considers these resources  coupled with cash expected to be generated by operations  adequate to meet its foreseeable funding needs  including about million budgeted for capital related projects in the major items budgeted are approximately million to further expand the jlg equipment services fleet of rental machines  million to complete the scissor lift plant expansion and million to increase boom lift manufacturing capacity 
the company intends to finance about million of these projects with borrowed capital 
the company s exposure to product liability claims is discussed in the commitments and contingencies note to the consolidated financial statements 
future results of operations  financial condition and liquidity may be affected to the extent that the company s ultimate liability with respect to product liability varies from current estimates 
outlook this outlook section and other parts of this management s discussion and analysis contain forward looking information and involve risks and uncertainties 
certain factors that could significantly impact expected results are described in cautionary statements pursuant to the securities litigation reform act which is an exhibit to this form k 
demand for the company s products continues strong and the level of unfilled orders remains high 
demand for the company s new products and from increased distribution globally should contribute to additional sales growth 
rental fleet utilization also remains strong throughout the united states and used equipment available for resale is scarce 
additional manufacturing throughput  capacity and efficiency gains in both the mcconnellsburg plant and the new bedford facility should improve the company s ability to satisfy customer demand and should improve product profit margins 
product mix also affects gross margins and is difficult to forecast 
all of these factors bode well for another strong year in fiscal  provided there is no unanticipated softening in customer demand
