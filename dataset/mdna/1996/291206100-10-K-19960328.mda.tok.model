item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources on december   the company adopted a formal plan to sell its publishing segment  its navigational products segment  and its printing segment 
the company s environmental assembly segment was also discontinued 
prior to december   the sale of the company s publishing segment was consummated 
substantially all of the publishing assets including accounts receivable and inventory were sold to a third party for approximately  during  the company continued to liquidate the navigational products assets  including inventory  and the printing company assets 
as stated in prior years reports  this transaction will have a significant effect on the company s financial condition and the form that its operations take over the next several years 
these effects in operations and into the future will be discussed below 
during the company enjoyed its most liquid position in over years 
the publishing segment of the company s business had had declining sales for several years 
the company was able to sell its publishing business on terms which the company believes were extremely beneficial 
selling the assets for approximately  made a substantial improvement in the company s ability to invest in its growth oriented environmental subsidiary 
during the company had the ability to hire additional staff and invest in additional equipment for its environmental subsidiary 
as shown on the consolidated statement of cash flows  the company invested in  of equipment in  most of which was to expand our capabilities to serve our environmental clients 
the result of these efforts was an increase of nearly in total revenues in the environmental business 
it is anticipated that revenues will continue to grow in and the company s navigational supply business was also discontinued in late after discontinuing its aviation publishing  the company believed it to be unproductive to continue a full fledged marketing effort to sustain the navigational supplies company 
during  the company realized  from the sale of navigational supply assets and from furniture and fixtures 
in addition  the company was able to sell finished goods inventory which remained in stock for approximately  during the year 
these revenues are shown in discontinued operations 
it is anticipated that the company will continue to sell finished goods inventory during and possibly into the estimated realizable value of that inventory should be in the range of  to  similarly  it was also deemed in the best interest of the company to sell the printing assets that the company had acquired in in mid  the company was able to consummate a sale of the printing assets along with the building that the assets were housed in 
those printing company assets were sold for  in addition  the company took a note for  which will be paid over a ten year period from the purchaser of the printing business 
with the sale of these entities  the company has focused on building its environmental engineering and consulting business and on acquiring producing oil and gas properties  primarily producing overriding royalties 
as stated above  the environmental engineering business had substantial growth in the company was also successful in purchasing several producing oil and gas royalties 
the full effect of these royalty purchases will not be seen in the financial statements until when division orders can be processed and when an entire years worth of production will be realized 
also  the company purchased the facilities on wn road in casper  wyoming in this was shortly after the local economy had gone through a serious recession and the price of real estate was abnormally low 
although the buildings were not sold in and are presently listed with a local realtor  we believe the buildings at the wn road location in casper can be sold at a profit and provide significant additional cash assets for the company 
various local realtors have estimated that the company may realize between  and  cash above the  carry amounts of the debt that is against the buildings presently 
there is no way to determine if the buildings will be sold at prices sufficient to yield that equity or when any such sale may occur 
the statements of operations included in the financial statements in this report show only the continued operations on a line item basis 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the results of operations and the effects of the sale of the discontinued operations are shown in a single category called discontinued operations 
similarly  any information regarding the discontinued operations which has previously been reported in segment information has also been summarized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in summary  the hoped for results as of december   ie  increased growth in the environmental and oil and gas businesses  has come to pass 
with its additional cash assets and the ability to focus management s attention on its predominant industry  the company has experienced growth in revenues in the environmental business and has added to its oil and gas producing properties 
working capital   working capital ratio long term debt to equity cash provided utilized by operations   cash and short term investments available   management believes that the carrying value of producing oil and gas properties is not in excess of the future revenues which will be recovered 
carrying value of producing properties  net of depletion is  oil and gas revenues  net of expenses were  for the year which includes  of workover costs in the company s brundage canyon field 
as most of the company s producing properties are natural gas properties with lives in excess of twenty five years  we believe the carrying value of the assets is fully recoverable 
in addition  the company has carrying value of  on non producing properties which is net of an allowance for impairment of  management believes the allowance is adequate and the remaining cost on the assets will be recovered 
management knows of no environmental assessment problems nor of the potential of any such environmental assessment 
all purchased real estate has had environmental studies done prior to purchase and both our printing operation and our environmental lab have been instructed on the appropriate procedures for disposals of various kinds of waste 
such wastes although relatively insignificant in amount are tested prior to disposal as part of an environmental assurance program 
results of operations this summarization of the results of operations will not include the activities of the discontinued operations 
the reader is referred to the section above entitled liquidity and capital resources and to footnote no 
of the consolidated financial statement 
our environmental testing revenues grew between and reflecting the expansion of the company s business into texas and by obtaining several new customers in the wyoming market place 
in revenues remained virtually the same as sales efforts declined while operating activities took most of the time of the key employees 
however  in the company was able to successfully acquire three large clients 
it appears that these clients which provided substantial revenues in will continue to do so in the foreseeable future 
it is also anticipated that revenues will continue to grow as the company has hired several well trained and competent employees to help manage the growth in revenues and to use that as a spring board for additional sales in and in addition  the small changes between and revenues are reflective of the company s ongoing effort to increase the profitability per job 
because of the volume of requests the company was receiving in comparison to its size  the company has turned down some jobs which would have been insignificant to our profit margin in this was done in anticipation of increasing the size and billing rates on certain jobs in correspondingly environmental costs went from  in to  in and increased significantly to  with the addition of new staff and out of pocket costs for increased number of jobs in oil and gas sales increased from  in to  in this followed a  increase between and these increases are due almost exclusively to the acquisition of certain producing but nonoperated producing properties in the last two years 
oil and gas producing costs were  in  down to  in and slightly up in to  the declines in production costs reflect the nature of the oil and gas investments which the company has made 
properties acquired have generally low operating costs 
a notable exception in were some workover costs in the brundage canyon field of utah 
depreciation  depletion and amortization were  in which declined to  in and increased in to  this increase in depreciation between and reflects the acquisition of additional environmental equipment and the beginning of production in the company s yellow creek field in southwest wyoming and hence the beginning of the amortization of that cost base 
general and administrative costs were  in  down to  in  reflecting the streamlining of corporate management and corporate overhead costs 
in general and administrative costs increased  reflecting increased number of staff and slightly higher consulting costs 
interest expense was  in  increasing to  in and  in the increases between and reflect the increased short term borrowing base used to finance some of the up front costs of the environmental company s growth 
the additional  increase between and reflects a full year of interest expense on the purchase of a new office building in late provisions for income tax expense reflect the amount of current income taxes payable in and no provision has been made for deferred taxes in  and management believes that although disclosures mandated by sfas no 
are generally informative  that in the company s case the application of sfas no 
leads to disclosures which are confusing 
to comply with sfas no 
is to record deferred income tax expense on the books of the company  when in fact  the company has over  of net operating loss carryforwards  over  of depletion carryforwards and over  of various income tax credits 
this issue is derived from the application of the provisions of sfas no 
to companies who have had quasi reorganizations in the past 
hawks industries applied the quasi reorganization provisions arb  effective in specifically  paragraphs and of sfas no 
require that in cases where there has been a quasi reorganization  that the tax benefits of loss carryforwards and credits  earned prior to the date of the quasi reorganization  be ignored when calculating deferred income tax benefits 
although management believes that such obscure provisions may give rise to great fodder in the world of academia  we believe that to apply the principles of sfas no 
 paragraphs and  is at variance with the economic realities of the present case 
accordingly  we have not applied the provisions of sfas no 
 paragraphs and it is management s intent to attempt to reflect the economic reality of our present tax situation 
given all of the future tax benefits which will be available to the company to offset future net income  management believes that the financial statements presented have accomplished our goal
