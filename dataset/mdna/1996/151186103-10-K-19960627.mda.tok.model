item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview celtrix pharmaceuticals  inc is a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics for the treatment of seriously debilitating  degenerative conditions primarily associated with severe trauma  chronic diseases or aging 
the company s development focus is on somatokine r  the recombinant equivalent of the naturally occurring complex formed by the anabolic hormone insulin like growth factor i igf i and its major binding protein  bp  which shows potential as a hormone replacement therapy for patients suffering from severe physical trauma or serious illness 
celtrix s goal is to initially develop somatokine for acute conditions  such as major surgery  organ damage or failure  and traumatic injury 
these conditions often involve abnormally low blood levels of igf bp which are associated with a catabolic state in which the body poorly utilizes nutrients and breaks down muscle for energy 
in fiscal  the company completed its preclinical safety and efficacy studies on somatokine  which support the belief that somatokine offers a promising method for providing safe  therapeutically effective doses of igf i  which is critical in nutrient utilization and in muscle and bone formation 
celtrix initiated phase i human clinical testing in may the company has a license agreement with the green cross corporation green cross  a japanese pharmaceutical company  covering the development and commercialization of somatokine for the treatment of osteoporosis in japan 
the company also has a product development  license and marketing agreement with genzyme corporation genzyme for tgf beta  a potential pharmaceutical based on a naturally occurring compound which appears to play an important role in regulating healthy cell functions 
genzyme is currently developing tgf beta for tissue repair and the treatment of systemic indications 
celtrix has not earned substantial revenues from product sales and at march  has an accumulated deficit of million  which includes non recurring  non cash charges of million for acquired in process research and development and licensing fees 
the company expects to incur additional operating losses  which may fluctuate quarter to quarter  for at least the next several years as the company expands its development activities  including clinical trials and manufacturing 
the company s product revenues to date consist primarily of revenues from sales of vitrogen r collagen  a sterile solution of collagen purchased from collagen corporation collagen under a long term supply agreement 
in may  pursuant to a distribution rights and option to purchase agreement  collagen exercised its option to purchase the vitrogen business 
as a result  no further vitrogen sales have been recorded 
the company also sells other products for use in research and assay applications 
to date  sales of these products  along with vitrogen  have not been material 
there can be no assurance that celtrix will ever achieve either significant revenues from product sales or profitable operations 
to achieve profitable operations  the company  alone or with others  must successfully develop  obtain regulatory approval for and market its potential products 
no assurance can be given that the company s product development efforts will be successfully completed  that required regulatory approvals will be obtained  or that any products  if developed and introduced  will be successfully marketed or achieve market acceptance

during  the company sold its equity investment in metra biosystems  inc metra  a biomedical company  resulting in a reported gain of million 
at march   the company had net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  expiring in the years through due to ownership changes as defined by the internal revenue code  the company s utilization of its net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits is subject to substantial annual limitations

liquidity and capital resources celtrix has funded its activities with proceeds from public and private offerings  advances from collagen  research and development revenues and licensing fees from collaborative arrangements  lease and debt financing arrangements  proceeds from liquidating its equity investment in metra  and  to a lesser extent  other revenues and product sales 
at march   celtrix s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million compared to million at march  this net decrease of million was due primarily to cash outlays totaling million related to its operations and payments under long term obligations  offset by million from the sale of an equity investment in metra and million of net equity proceeds received from genzyme

the company believes that its existing capital resources will be adequate to satisfy its anticipated requirements through the middle of calendar the company continues to pursue the possibility of securing additional corporate partner arrangements that are consistent with the company s product development and commercialization strategies  raising additional capital by means of selling equity or debt securities  and evaluating other options including mergers and acquisitions 
the company s future success may depend  in part  on its relationships with third parties  including their willingness to collaborate in the development of any potential products under development  their strategic interest in such products and  eventually  their success in marketing 
the company anticipates that it will expend significant capital resources in product research and development  which is typical in the biopharmaceutical industry 
capital resources may also be used for the acquisition of complementary businesses  products or technologies 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including scientific progress in its research and development programs  the magnitude of these programs  progress with preclinical and clinical trials  the cost of scaling up manufacturing and establishing facilities  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the time and costs involved in filing  prosecuting  enforcing and defending patent claims  competition in technological and market developments  the establishment of and changes in collaborative relationships and the cost of commercialization activities and arrangements 
the company anticipates that it will be required to raise substantial additional capital over a period of several years in order to continue its research and development programs  including clinical trials  and to prepare for commercialization by expanding manufacturing and marketing capabilities 
no assurance can be given that such additional capital will be available on reasonable terms or at all 
the unavailability of such financing could delay or prevent the development and marketing of the company s potential products
