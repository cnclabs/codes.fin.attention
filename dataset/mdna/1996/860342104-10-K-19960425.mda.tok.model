the tactical vehicle systems segment sales increased million during fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in tvs sales reflects the increase in truck production under the family of medium tactical vehicles fmtv contract to  trucks in fiscal as compared to  trucks in fiscal although sales increased for the current fiscal year  the increase was less than anticipated 
sales for the year were adversely affected by the deployment of certain us army personnel to haiti in fiscal which delayed the completion of testing and certification of the fmtv program for high volume production until the fourth quarter of fiscal the engineered power systems segment of the company experienced a decreased in sales in fiscal this decline in eps sales was primarily within the gas turbine equipment product lines which experienced sharply reduced domestic activity  reflecting the us utility market s response to deregulation proposals  and delays in contract awards in the international markets 
gas turbine product support sales  consisting of the servicing of customers equipment and the long term contracting for operation and maintenance of power plants  continued to grow with fiscal sales increasing more that above fiscal operating profit decreased by approximately during fiscal to million as compared to million in fiscal both the distribution and the tactical vehicle systems segments operating profits increased at a rate comparable to the growth in sales volumes 
the engineered power systems segment s operating profit of in fiscal declined from in fiscal this decline is primarily related to lower profits realized on the sale of certain compression equipment during fiscal  and to increased market competitiveness 
fiscal vs 
fiscal sales increased to  million for fiscal from million for fiscal in total  sales increased by with each of the company s segments recording new sales records 
the company s international sales increased to over million 
the tactical vehicle systems segment showed the largest sales growth during fiscal  increasing sales by 
this sales growth  although significant  was less than was anticipated 
sales growth was restrained by the government s decision to delay both the testing of trucks and the approval for purchasing of key components  which effectively precluded the company from achieving its planned production quantities 
the company s distribution segment s sales increased by in fiscal this increase reflects the continuation of both the growth of the economies of the territories serviced by the company and the market s reception of the products which the company sells 
the company continued to expand the territories in which it operates and the products it represents through the acquisition  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  of substantially all of the assets of pamco 
the engineered power systems segment of the company experienced continued growth with fiscal sales increasing 
the gas turbine product lines provided the majority of the sales growth 
gas turbine product support sales growth continued to exceed expectations and contributed significantly to this increase 
gas turbine equipment sales increased  but at a slower rate than the prior year  reflecting the us utility market s uncertain response to deregulation trends 
excluding the discontinued bus product line  the diesel products group showed a slight increase in sales  primarily in products sold to the airline market 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of creole international  inc  a provider of operating and maintenance services for turbine and reciprocating engine driven equipment 
operating profit grew by approximately during fiscal to million 
each of the company s segment s operating profits increased both in absolute amounts and as a percentage of sales 
the tactical vehicle systems segment s growth reflects both an increase in production levels and an improvement in the anticipated profitability of the fmtv program 
the engineered power systems segment had an improved revenue mix resulting primarily from the rapid growth rate of its gas turbine product support sales which generally realize a higher operating profit 
the distribution segment benefitted from improved operating efficiencies and a revenue blend of higher value added products

fiscal sales and administrative expense includes a full year of expenses related to certain acquisitions made during the second half of fiscal  which were not completely integrated into the company for a significant portion of fiscal sales and administrative expense also grew rapidly within the engineered power system s operations and maintenance group  as the company continued to expand these services into international markets 
interest expense grew significantly in both fiscal and reflecting the increased borrowings required to fund the company s operations  primarily gas turbine inventories relating to international contracts that do not contain substantial progress payments and inventories of vehicles under the fmtv contract that accumulated during delays in testing 
the growth in other income during fiscal is primarily attributable to both increased interest income and gains on the disposal of real estate 
income tax expense  relative to operational profits  was comparable for fiscal  and net earnings dollars in thousands percentage change fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal amount    percentage of sales fiscal net earnings decline from fiscal is primarily reflective of the decrease in operational profits and the increase in interest expense

accounting developments the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  employer s accounting for postemployment benefits  in november sfas requires that the liability for certain postemployment benefits be recognized over the employees service lives when certain conditions are met 
the company adopted sfas in fiscal the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  in march sfas requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company anticipates adopting sfas in the first quarter of fiscal  and that such implementation will not have a material effect on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation in october sfas establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for stock based compensation plans and to transactions in which an entity issues its equity instruments to acquire goods and services from non employees 
the new accounting standard prescribed by sfas is optional  and the company may continue to account for its plans under previous accounting standards 
the company does not expect to adopt the new accounting standards  consequently  sfas will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
pro forma disclosures of net earnings and earnings per share must be made as if the sfas had been adopted by the company 
such disclosure will be required in fiscal financial condition company s capital dollars in thousands fiscal fiscal amount percentage amount percentage long term debt   other long term liabilities   shareholders equity   table shareholders equity increased  during fiscal and  during fiscal primarily as a result of earnings retained after dividends 
during fiscal  the company increased its revolving credit facility with its banks from million to million 
the company had million and million in short term borrowings at the end of fiscal and  respectively 
total debt increased during fiscal and principally due to the timing of customer progress payments for contracts in process in fiscal and and delays in testing and acceptance of vehicles under the fmtv program during fiscal liquidity cash provided from operations dollars in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal net earnings    depreciation and amortization    deferred income taxes   funds from operations    change in net operating assets and liabilities    net cash used in operating activities    funds from operations decreased during fiscal versus a increase during fiscal  reflecting primarily the relative change in earnings each year 
the company s investment in net operating assets and liabilities increased by an amount greater than that provided from operations during fiscal and fiscal the significant components of net operating assets and liabilities grew at rates comparable with sales growth  excluding recoverable costs and accrued profits not yet billed 
significant growth in recoverable costs and accrued profits not yet billed occurred in both the tactical vehicle systems segment and the engineered power systems segment 
the tactical vehicle systems segment is primarily funded by progress payments under government regulations which require that contractors retain a significant amount of the contract costs until government acceptance of the product 
the company has experienced cost increases and delivery delays under the fmtv contract  all of which have resulted in a build up in the unliquidated contract costs 
the government began taking delivery of the fmtv in january  with full liquidation of existing progress payments expected to occur in the engineered power systems segment s gas turbine product line experienced a significant increase in the percentage of international contracts  which generally provide for lower customer contract funding requirements  and resulted in the increased recoverable costs and accrued profits not yet billed 
working capital to support the operations of the company fluctuates significantly depending on the progress payment streams of the contracts in process 
the company regularly bids on commercial and government contracts  which if awarded to the company  could significantly affect both working capital and capital expenditures needs 
the company s liquidity can be measured using several measures 
the company s current ratio current assets divided by current liabilities remained somewhat constant at and at the end of fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the small increase is the result of replacing short term debt incurred under uncommitted lines with long term debt under the company s revolving credit facility and increases in receivables and inventories 
the long term debt to equity ratio long term debt including the current portion divided by total shareholders equity was at the end of fiscal and at the end of fiscal  reflecting the increase in long term debt under the company s revolving credit facility during fiscal the company s interest coverage earnings before income taxes and interest expense divided by interest expense decreased to times interest for fiscal versus times interest for fiscal  primarily as a result of the increased debt outstanding and lower earnings 
the company engaged an agent to assist the company in the private placement of at least million in long term indebtedness 
the proceeds of such proposed private placement  if consummated  will be used primarily to retire other debt and for general corporate purposes 
in the event that any acquisition of additional operations  growth in existing operations  changes in inventory levels  accounts receivable or other working capital items create a need for working capital or capital expenditures in excess of existing committed lines of credit  the company may seek to convert uncommitted borrowing arrangements to committed credit facilities  to borrow under other long term financing sources or to issue additional equity securities 
management believes that the company s current credit facilities are adequate to meet its foreseeable cash requirements 
capital expenditures and commitments capital expenditures by industry segment dollars in thousands percentage change fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal engineered power systems    distribution    tactical vehicle systems    corporate services  capital expenditures decreased significantly in fiscal as compared to fiscal and the distribution segment s increase during fiscal includes the capital assets acquired from pamco 
the capital expenditures program at the tactical vehicle systems segment and the program to upgrade the engineered power systems segment s facilities were both substantially completed during fiscal cash dividends dollars in thousands  except per share data growth rate fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal amount of cash dividends    annual rate of cash dividends per share the amount of cash dividends increased and during fiscal and  respectively 
cash dividends represented  and of net earnings before accounting change for fiscal  and  respectively 
the board of directors of the company intends to consider the payment of dividends on a quarterly basis  commensurate with the company s earnings and financial needs 
government contracting initial operational test and evaluation under the fmtv contract was completed in the third quarter of fiscal and the company received approval for full rate production and type classification of the fmtv on august  actual shipment of the vehicles to combat troops began in january at ft 
bragg  north carolina 
under the terms of the fmtv contract  all vehicles produced before the full rate production decision must be retrofitted with any changes required by test results or specification changes ordered by the government 
the retrofit began during the fourth quarter of fiscal and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of full rate production is expected to commence after completion of the retrofit program 
major contracts for military systems are performed over extended periods of time and are subject to changes in scope of work and delivery schedules 
pricing negotiations on changes and settlement of claims often extend over prolonged periods of time 
the company s ultimate profitability on such contracts will depend not only upon the accuracy of the company s cost projections  but also the eventual outcome of an equitable settlement of contractual issues with the us government 
the fmtv contract is a firm fixed price multi year contract whereby the price paid to the company is not subject to adjustment to reflect the company s actual costs  except costs incurred as a result of actions or inactions of the government 
the company has completed approximately  of approximately  trucks trucks at low rate initial production as of january  full rate production has been approved and is expected to commence after completion of retrofit of the trucks produced to date to current specifications 
stewart stevenson has incurred significant cost overruns and delivery schedule delays on the fmtv contract which the company believes are primarily due to the government s decision to delay the testing of trucks and other government directed changes to the contract 
the company has and will continue to submit a series of requests for equitable adjustments reas  under the fmtv contract  seeking increases in the fmtv contract price for those additional costs that relate to government caused delays and changes 
additionally  the company has entered into negotiations with the us army to modify the existing contract to provide for steady production at rates lower than originally anticipated through december however  the company is not able to predict whether such modification will be forthcoming on terms acceptable to the company and production of vehicles may be interrupted after february revenues and profits realized on the fmtv contract are based on the company s estimates of total contract sales value and costs at completion 
amounts in excess of agreed upon contract price for government caused delays  disruptions  unpriced change orders and government caused additional contract costs are recognized in contract value when the company believes it is probable that the claim for such amounts will result in additional contract revenue and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
at january   the company s fmtv contract accounting position reflects the expected recovery of substantial amounts in excess of the contract price for government caused delays  disruptions  unpriced change orders and other government caused additional contract costs 
these claims are in varying stages of negotiations 
although management believes that the contract provides a legal basis for the claims and its estimates are based on reasonable assumptions and on a reasonable analysis of contract costs  due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation and claims negotiations process  no assurances can be given that its estimates will be accurate  and variances between such estimates and actual results could be material 
in the event that the company is unable to recover a substantial portion of the additional costs  the company may suffer a material adverse effect on its operations during the accounting period in which such contract issues are resolved 
the funding of the contract is subject to the inherent uncertainties of congressional appropriations 
as is typical of multi year defense contracts  the fmtv contracts must be funded annually by the department of the army and may be terminated at any time for the convenience of the government 
the company has received full funding for the production of approximately  vehicles through february approximately  vehicles  scheduled for production after that date have not been funded due to reductions in the us army s budget for acquisitions 
in the event that the fmtv contracts are terminated other than for default  the fmtv contracts provide for termination charges that will reimburse the company for allowable costs  but not necessarily all costs 
effect of certain litigation on may   the company and four employees  including the company s president  were indicted by a federal grand jury on six counts arising out of a subcontract to supply diesel generator sets for installation in saudi arabia 
see note commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements 
on may   the us air force suspended the company from contracting with any agency of the us government and from receiving the benefit of federal assistance programs 
this suspension was temporarily terminated on november   pending the resolution of the charges covered by the indictment  pursuant to an interim administrative agreement between the company and the us air force 
the interim administrative agreement does not have any effect on the indictment 
the interim administrative agreement requires the company to maintain various internal procedures and policies intended to assure the us government that the company is a responsible contractor 
in the event that the company or any of the indicted employees are convicted of the charges contained in the indictment  the us air force may re evaluate whether the company should be suspended or debarred based on all of the facts and circumstances then known 
an acquittal of all parties of the charges does not terminate the interim administrative agreement and any failure by the company to perform its obligations thereunder may also be grounds for suspension or debarment 
if the company is suspended or debarred  either because of a conviction pursuant to the indictment or as a result of a breach of the interim administrative agreement  it would be ineligible to enter into new contracts or subcontracts with agencies of the us government or receive the benefit of federal assistance payments for the duration of such suspension or debarment 
any such suspension could prevent the company from receiving a modification to the fmtv to fund additional vehicles or extend the delivery schedule of funded vehicles unless the secretary of the army finds a compelling need to enter into such modification 
the company would also be unable to sell equipment and services to customers that depend on loans or financial commitments from the export import bank exim bank  overseas private investment corporation opic and similar government agencies during a suspension or debarment 
the engineered power systems segment frequently sells equipment to customers that rely on financial commitments from exim and or opic 
any such suspension or debarment could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations
