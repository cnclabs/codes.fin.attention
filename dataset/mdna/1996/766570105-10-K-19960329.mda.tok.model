noninterest expense totals for included nonrecurring expenses of million related to occupancy initiatives and million for reorganization and severance related costs 
noninterest expense totals for included a million restructuring expense reversal 
adjusting for these items  noninterest expense actually decreased by million between the years 
the reorganization and severance related expenses recorded in were related to several efficiency initiatives implemented in the third quarter 
the corporation had identified certain areas within its organizational structure to consolidate functions and or reduce staff positions 
the reorganization initiatives were completed in the fourth quarter of and are expected to generate approximately million in compensation based savings in the occupancy expenses were the result of several initiatives currently undertaken  including the new technology center to be completed in mid year  as well as the marketing of office space to third parties that is currently vacant or that may become available from the previously discussed reorganization initiatives 
management expects the occupancy initiatives to generate approximately million in savings in  with greater improvements expected in and thereafter 
the decline in noninterest income was partially attributed to the lost noninterest income from certain foreign subsidiaries sold in and a million gain recorded in from the settlement of mortgage insurance claims in the united kingdom 
on september   the corporation was notified by the federal reserve bank of richmond that the memorandum of understanding dated may   was terminated effective immediately

this termination ended all operating agreements between the corporation and its banking regulators 
earning assets money market assets short term instruments  such as time deposits with other banks  federal funds sold and resale agreements  represent alternatives for the corporation for the deployment of excess funds

interest rate risk management the corporation s asset liability management function is controlled by the asset liability committee alco  which is comprised of representatives who lead the major divisions within the corporation 
the objective of the group is to prudently manage the assets and liabilities of the corporation to provide both an optimum and stable net interest margin while maintaining adequate levels of liquidity and capital 
this approach entails the management of overall risk of the organization  in conjunction with the acquisition and deployment of funds 
alco monitors and modifies exposure to changes in interest rates based upon its view of current and prospective market and economic conditions 
the traditional measurement of an organization s exposure to interest rate fluctuations  such as interest sensitivity  entails a static gap measurement  which portrays a snapshot of the statement of condition at one point in time 
however  this methodology does not adequately measure the corporation s exposure to interest rate risk 
the statement of condition must be viewed within a dynamic framework in which relationships may vary over time in virtually every segment of the financial statement 
the corporation manages interest rate risk through the use of a simulation model  allowing for various interest rate scenarios to be portrayed 
the model forecasts the impact on earnings of these rate scenarios over a month time horizon  assuming selected changes in the mix of assets and liabilities  spread relationships  and management actions 
a most likely scenario is forecasted based upon a consensus view of the marketplace 
alternatives  which reflect interest rates moving significantly higher or lower than this view  are also evaluated  with the results compared against risk tolerance limits established by corporate policy 
the corporation s current policy establishes limits for possible fluctuations in net interest income for an ensuing month period under the most likely scenario described above 
while the corporation maintained a relatively balanced interest rate risk position at year end  the position became more liability sensitive as of december  in both instances the corporation was well insulated against interest rates moving significantly in either direction 
at december   the forecasted impact of interest rates either steadily rising or falling basis points versus a most likely scenario would reflect a change in net interest income of less than over an initial month period  and only over the entire month horizon well below the established tolerance levels set by the corporation 
in managing the corporation s interest rate risk  alco also utilizes financial derivatives in the normal course of business 
these products might include interest rate swaps  caps  collars  floors  futures  and options 
financial derivatives are employed to assist in the management and or reduction of interest rate risk for the corporation and can effectively alter the interest sensitivity of segments of the statement of condition for specified periods of time 
all of these vehicles are considered off balance sheet as they do not impact the actual level of assets or liabilities of the corporation 
management finds that all of the methodologies discussed above provide a meaningful representation of the corporation s interest rate sensitivity  though factors other than changes in the interest rate environment  such as levels of nonearning assets and changes in the composition of earning assets  may impact net interest income 
management believes its current rate sensitivity level is appropriate  considering the corporation s economic outlook and conservative approach taken in the review and monitoring of the corporation s sensitivity position 
capital resources a fundamental objective of management is to maintain a level of capitalization that is sufficient to take advantage of favorable investment opportunities and to promote depositor and investor confidence 
in addition  the current economic and regulatory climate places an increased emphasis on capital strength and the ability of the corporation to withstand unfavorable economic and or business losses 
the corporation s management monitors its capital levels monthly in relation to financial forecasts for the year  as well as  internal and external policies 
the corporation continues to maintain a strong capital position with one of the highest capital levels relative to other banks in the country 
total stockholders equity at december  was million  or of total assets  up million from year end the increase from year end was the result of earnings totaling million combined with a change in net unrealized gains losses in the securities available for sale portfolio from a million loss at december   to a gain of million at year end these increases were offset by dividends on preferred stock of million 
the federal reserve board has issued risk based capital guidelines for bank holding companies 
the guidelines define a two tier capital framework 
tier i capital consists of common and qualifying preferred shareholders equity less goodwill and other adjustments 
tier ii capital consists of mandatory convertible  subordinated and other qualifying term debt  preferred stock not qualifying as tier i capital and the reserve for loan losses up to percent of risk weighted assets 
under these guidelines  one of four risk weights is applied to the different on balance sheet assets 
off balance sheet items such as loan commitments and derivatives  are also applied a risk weight after conversion to balance sheet equivalent amounts 
bank holding companies are required to meet a minimum ratio of qualifying total combined tier i and tier ii capital to risk weighted assets of  at least half of which must be composed of core tier i capital elements 
the corporation s total and core capital ratios were and  respectively  at december   compared with and  respectively  at december  the federal reserve board has established an additional capital adequacy guideline  the leverage ratio  as amended by the prompt corrective action regulations promulgated under fdicia  which measures the ratio of tier i capital to quarterly average assets 
the minimum leverage ratio guideline is three percent for the most highly rated bank holding companies 
those that are not in the most highly rated category  including the corporation  must maintain at least a minimum ratio of or higher  if determined necessary by the federal reserve board through its assessment of the corporation s asset quality  earnings performance  interest rate risk and liquidity 
the corporation s leverage ratio was at december   compared with a leverage ratio of at the prior year end 
the corporation s policy is to ensure that its bank subsidiaries are capitalized in accordance with regulatory guidelines 
the three national bank subsidiaries of the corporation are subject to minimum capital ratios prescribed by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ  which are the same as those for the federal reserve board

the federal reserve has not indicated a requirement higher than at december  net interest income net interest income is derived by subtracting the cost of funds from the income received on earning assets 
earning assets are mainly comprised of loans and securities  while interest bearing liabilities are deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest income is impacted by variations in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities  as well as fluctuations in interest rates

average loans remained level during the period as the majority of the increase in average balances occurred in the securities portfolio  which increased over million in the corporation also had a million increase in average interest bearing liabilities that was mostly due to the increase in average borrowed funds 
thus  the corporation had a favorable net increase in average interest earning assets over interest bearing liabilities of million 
this positive movement  however  was overshadowed by a basis point increase in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities between and the prior year 
generally  the corporation s assets will reprice faster than its liabilities

as the interest rate increases abated in  combined with the upward repricing of the liabilities portfolio  the net interest margin leveled in the first half of and then declined in the second half of the net interest margin net interest income on a tax equivalent basis divided by average earning assets was for  a decrease of basis points from the net interest margin for because of the aforementioned changes in earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest spread the difference between the average tax equivalent rate earned and the average rate incurred on interest bearing liabilities for was  a basis point decline from s spread of 
interest lost on nonaccrual and renegotiated loans totaled million for  which had the effect of reducing the net interest margin by approximately five basis points for the year
