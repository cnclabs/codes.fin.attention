plan of operations the company believes that it is currently a leading provider of telecommunications and information technology staffing services 
the company established its telecommunications staffing business with the acquisition of comforce global in october  and further strengthened its base with the acquisition of williams in march comforce global provides telecommunications and computer specialists and expertise on a project outsourcing basis  primarily to fortune companies worldwide 
it offers manpower on a contract basis to the telecommunications and computer industries  on both a short term and long term basis  to meet its customers needs for virtually every staffing level within these industries  including wireless infrastructure services  network management  engineering  design and technical support 
the company intends to establish its technical services platform with the acquisition of rra  and is actively seeking an acquisition of a platform company servicing the information technology market sector 
upon completion of the acquisition of rra  comforce technical services will provide specialists for supplemental staffing assignments as well as outsourcing and vendor on premises programs  primarily in the electronics  aviation  telecommunications and information technology business sectors 
as described below  the proposed acquisition of rra is subject to various conditions and no assurance can be given that it will be completed 
the company has identified the area of skilled technical contract labor and consulting for the telecommunications and information technology sectors as a potentially high growth  profitable market niche that could benefit from new opportunities in the wireless telephone industry and growth in networked information systems and the information superhighway 
the company believes that it is well positioned to capitalize on the anticipated continued growth in the telecommunications and information technology and technical sectors due to its size  geographic breadth and industry expertise in providing a wide range of staffing services 
the company will seek to grow significantly through strategic acquisitions  the opening of offices in new and existing markets and aggressive recruiting  training  and marketing of industry specialists with a wide range of technical expertise 
the company s growth strategy includes the acquisition of established  profitable regional staffing companies in markets with attractive growth opportunities 
these platform companies are intended to serve as a basis for future growth and  therefore  must have the management infrastructure and other operating characteristics necessary to significantly expand the company s presence within a specific market sector or geographic area 
in addition  the company has as an objective tuck under acquisitions of smaller companies which can be integrated into the established platform companies to increase market share and profits with minimal incremental expense 
the company believes it can also increase revenues though internal growth due to its well developed presence in the information technology and telecommunications sectors 
further  the company believes that it can achieve significant economies of scale by opening and clustering branch offices in new and existing markets through the allocation of management  advertising  recruiting and training costs over a larger revenue base 
in addition  the company has targeted selected areas of the technical services markets which it believes have high growth and profit potential 
the statements above and elsewhere in this report that suggest that the company will increase revenues and become profitable  achieve significant growth through strategic acquisitions or other means  realize operating efficiencies  and like statements as to the company s objectives and management s beliefs are forward looking statements 
various factors could prevent the company from realizing these objectives  including the following unfavorable economic conditions generally or in the telecommunications or computing industries could cause potential users of technical and computing services to decide to cancel or postpone capital expansion  research and development or other projects which require the engagement of temporary technical staff workers or the use of consulting and other technical expertise offered by the company 
in particular  the cable  telephone  wireless and other segments of the telecommunications industry are competing for increasingly overlapping shares of new and emerging markets  including through intense lobbying in congress 
the failure of congress to enact legislation  or of regulatory agencies to adopt regulations  which open markets or ease restrictions and burdens in the telecommunications industry  or other unfavorable attitudes or uncertainties in the legislative  regulatory or bureaucratic environments  could stem expected growth in this industry 
the company s ability to expand through acquisitions is dependent on its ability to identify attractive acquisition opportunities and to finance such acquisitions  and no assurance can be given that will be successful in doing so 
heightened competition in the staffing industry by existing or new competitors could make such acquisitions uneconomic or otherwise more difficult or costly 
unless the company s operations are considered to be successful by bank or other institutional lenders or investors  it is unlikely that the company will be able to finance its expansion through acquisitions 
the company is seeking to expand rapidly in what its management perceives as a window of opportunity in the market 
expansion undertaken at an accelerated pace  principally through acquisitions  creates added risk that the analysis of businesses acquired will fail to uncover business risks or adequately reveal weaknesses in the markets  management or operations being considered 
furthermore  the company expects in many cases to retain existing management of acquired companies to manage the businesses acquired 
compensation incentives designed to enroll the existing management  which the company expects to offer  are difficult to structure in a manner so as to provide lasting benefits to the acquiring company 
heightened competition for customers as well as for technical personnel could adversely impact the company s margins 
heightened competition for customers could result in the company being unable to maintain its current fee scales without being able to reduce its personnel costs 
shortages of qualified technical personnel  which currently exist in some technical specialties and could occur in others in the future  could result in the company being unable to fulfill its customers needs or in the customers electing to employ technical staff directly rather than using the company s services to ensure the availability of such personnel 
many of the company s competitors have more extensive financial and personnel resources than does the company 
the company s proposed acquisition of the assets of rra is subject to the company s completion  and satisfaction with the results  of its due diligence review of rra  the company s receipt of consents to the assignment of contracts and  in the case of certain government contracts  governmental clearances from certain significant customers of rra  the satisfaction of rra and its principals of the short term financing required to complete the acquisition as well as the company s long term financing plans  and other customary contingencies  and no assurance can be given that such conditions and contingencies will be satisfied 
results of operations on october   the company completed the acquisition of all of the capital stock of comforce global  a provider of technical staffing and consulting services in the information technology and telecommunications sectors 
due to a pattern of reduced sales volume resulting in continuing operating losses  in september  the company adopted a plan to discontinue its jewelry business 
the company s consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to report separately results of operations of the discontinued jewelry business 
therefore  a comparison of the company s consolidated results of operations for the years ended december  and december  or of december  and december  is not meaningful 
see discontinued jewelry business in this item for a discussion of the discontinued operations 
pro forma compared to pro forma set forth below is a discussion of the company s pro forma results of continuing operations for the years ended december  and december  the company s pro forma results of continuing operations for the years ended december  and december  are presented in item of this report as if the acquisition of comforce global had been consummated as of january  pro forma revenues of  for the year ended december  were  or  higher than pro forma revenues for the year ended december  the increase in pro forma revenues is attributable to the overall growth and expansion of comforce global s telecommunications and computer technical staffing services business 
pro forma cost of revenues of  for the year ended december  increased  as compared to pro forma cost of revenues for the year ended december  pro forma cost of revenues in the year ended december  was of pro forma revenues compared to a pro forma cost of revenues percentage of for the year ended december  the pro forma cost of revenues increase is principally attributable to the increase in sales volume as noted above 
the pro forma cost of revenues percentage decrease of is primarily attributable to certain consulting fees incurred in pro forma operating expenses for the year ended december  increased  as compared to pro forma operating expenses for the year ended december  the increase in pro forma operating expenses is principally attributable to a compensation charge of  related to the issuance of a interest in the company as additional compensation for certain individuals to enter into employment or consulting services agreements to manage the company s entry into and development of the telecommunications and computer technical staffing services business 
pro forma operating loss in the year ended december  was  as compared to pro forma operating loss of  in the year ended december  the increased pro forma operating loss is principally attributable to a compensation charge of  related to the issuance of a interest in the company as additional compensation for certain individuals to enter into employment or consulting services agreements to manage the company s entry into and development of the telecommunications and computer technical staffing services business  partially offset by an increased pro forma gross margin attributable to the overall growth and expansion of comforce global s telecommunications and computer technical staffing services business 
corporate management fees from comforce global s former parent  spectrum information technologies  inc  reflect an allocation of corporate overhead  however  such charges will no longer continue as a result of comforce global s acquisition by the company in october in the opinion of management  the amount of these fees are not representative of costs incurred by comforce global on a stand alone basis 
pro forma other expense  principally interest  net for the year ended december  decreased  as compared to the year ended december  the decrease is principally due to the and discharges of indebtedness under terms of the bank loan agreements of lori and its fashion costume jewelry subsidiaries 
due to the company s tax loss carryforwards and the uncertainty of future taxable income  no income tax benefit was recognized in connection with the company s and pre tax losses from continuing operations 
liquidity and capital resources management believes that the company will generate cash flow from operations which  together with proceeds from the exercise of certain warrants of  in april  will be sufficient to fund its telecommunications and computer technical staffing services business for the remainder of  however  the company does not expect to have sufficient liquidity or capital resources to fund its planned expansion through acquisitions and other means 
the company intends to seek debt and or equity financing to fund such planned expansion 
see change in business and plan of operations in this item cash and cash equivalents provided by the company  comforce global  from october  through december  are as follows the net increase in cash and cash equivalents of  is comprised of net cash provided by operating activities of  and cash used in investing activities of  cash flows used in investing activities is attributable to purchase of equipment for the new comforce global offices 
cash and cash equivalents for the company on a consolidated basis for the years and are as follows cash and cash equivalents decreased  during the year ended december  cash flows used by operating activities of  and cash flows used by investing activities of  exceeded cash flows from financing activities of  cash flows used by operating activities were principally attributable to the company s loss from operations  exclusive of the effect of a charge to operations of  representing an impairment of goodwill at the company s discontinued jewelry business  a compensation charge to continuing operations of  representing the issuance in aggregate of a interest in the company as additional consideration under employment or consulting services agreements with certain individuals to manage the company s entry into and development of the telecommunications and computer technical staffing services business  and the effects of other non cash charges 
cash flows from investing activities consisted of a down payment and certain other acquisition related costs aggregating  in connection with the comforce global acquisition completed in october  expenditures for retail fixtures for the discontinued jewelry business of  and expenditures for equipment of  less  deposited in trust in december used to fund an installment payment in january for court ordered payments arising from the may reorganization of the former new dimensions subsidiary 
cash flows from financing activities were attributable to proceeds from a private placement of the company s common stock used principally to fund the comforce global acquisition and a net increase in short term borrowings used principally to fund working capital requirements 
during the year ended december   the company s working capital deficiency increased by  the increase in working capital deficiency is principally attributable to net liabilities of the discontinued jewelry business and a short term loan used to fund the down payment for the comforce global acquisition 
discontinued jewelry business in conjunction with the comforce global acquisition  the company and artra entered into an assumption agreement dated as of october  the assumption agreement  under which artra agreed to pay and discharge substantially all of the then existing liabilities and obligations of the company  including indebtedness  corporate guarantees  accounts payable and environmental liabilities 
artra also agreed to assume responsibility for all liabilities of the jewelry business from and after october   and is entitled to receive the net proceeds  if any  from the sale thereof 
on april   artra sold the business and certain assets of the company s lawrence jewelry corporation subsidiary  and  accordingly  will be entitled to the net proceeds  if any  from this disposition after the satisfaction of its creditors 
no assurance can be given that artra will be financially capable of satisfying its obligations under the assumption agreement 
at march  and at december   lori s business plan had anticipated that the restructuring of its debt  along with a consolidation and restructuring of its jewelry business  would permit it to obtain a sufficient level of borrowings to fund its capital requirements in and beyond 
however  due to the continued losses from operations and its inability to obtain conventional bank financing  management of lori determined in september to discontinue the jewelry business 
the company recorded a provision of million for the estimated costs to complete the disposal of this business  having earlier recorded a charge against operations of million to write off the goodwill of the jewelry business at june  in the fourth quarter of  the company revised its estimate and provided an additional  to complete the disposition of the jewelry business 
environmental matters the company has been notified by the federal environmental protection agency that it is a potentially responsible party for the disposal of hazardous substances by its predecessor company at a site on ninth avenue in gary  indiana  but it has no records indicating that it deposited hazardous substances at the site and intends to vigorously defend itself in this matter 
management is unable to assess whether the company will be found liable in this matter or to predict the amount of liability  if any 
under the terms of the assumption agreement  artra has agreed to pay and discharge substantially all of the company s pre existing liabilities and obligations  including environmental liabilities 
consequently  the company is entitled to indemnification from artra for any such environmental liabilities  although no assurance can be given that artra will be financially capable of satisfying its obligations under the assumption agreement 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
net operating loss carryforwards at december   the company and its subsidiaries had federal income tax loss carryforwards of approximately  available to be applied against future taxable income  if any  expiring principally in section of the internal revenue code of limits a corporation s utilization of its federal income tax loss carryforwards when certain changes in the ownership of a corporation s common stock occurs 
the company has recently issued a significant number of shares of its common stock in conjunction with the comforce global acquisition and certain related transactions 
accordingly  the company is currently subject to significant limitations regarding the utilization of its federal income tax loss carryforwards 
seasonality the company s recently acquired technical staffing and consulting services business is not subject to significant seasonal fluctuations 
recently issued accounting pronouncements impairment of long lived assets sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment is evaluated by comparing future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges expected to result from the use or sale of the asset and its eventual disposition  to the carrying amount of the asset 
this new accounting principle is effective for the company s fiscal year ending december  the company believes that adoption will not have a material impact on its financial statements 
stock based compensation sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  encourages  but does not require  companies to recognize compensation expense for grants of stock  stock options  and other equity instruments to employees based on new fair value accounting rules 
although expense recognition for employee stock based compensation is not mandatory  the pronouncement requires companies that choose not to adopt the new fair value accounting to disclose the pro forma net income and earnings per share under the new method 
this new accounting principle is effective for the company s fiscal year ending december  the company believes that adoption will not have a material impact on its financial statements as the company will not adopt the new fair value accounting  but instead comply with the disclosure requirements 
impact of inflation and changing prices inflation has become a less significant factor in the economy  however  to the extent permitted by competition  the company generally passes increased costs to its customers
