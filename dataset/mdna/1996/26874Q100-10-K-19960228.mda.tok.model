item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business environment 
ensco international incorporated the company provides contract drilling and marine transportation services to the oil and gas industry with operations in the us gulf of mexico  the north sea and venezuela 
demand for the company s services is significantly affected by worldwide expenditures for oil and gas drilling 
expenditures for oil and gas drilling activity fluctuate based upon many factors including world economic conditions  the legislative environment in the us and other major countries  production levels and other activities of opec and other oil and gas producers and the impact that these and other events have on the current and expected future pricing of oil and natural gas 
domestic drilling activity peaked in late after which the number of working rigs began a general downward trend through mid an improvement in natural gas prices in and resulted in the working rig count increasing  especially in the us gulf of mexico  and such increased activity levels generally continued through however  the company s day rates for its us gulf of mexico rigs declined throughout  although remaining higher on average than in  and such declining day rate trend continued through the first half of the declining day rate levels were due primarily to the mobilization of a number of competitors rigs to the us gulf of mexico in and the weakening of domestic natural gas prices 
activity levels for us gulf of mexico rigs increased in the second half of due  in part  to increased domestic natural gas prices during early to mid with the company s us gulf of mexico rigs experiencing a corresponding increase in day rates during the second half of unless there is a significant deterioration in domestic natural gas prices  management believes current us gulf of mexico rig activity levels are sustainable during management also believes that the demand for cantilever jackup rigs  in particular  is expected to remain strong due to the increased level of development activity which requires cantilevered drilling over existing production platforms 
activity levels for the company s marine transportation vessels generally correspond with activity levels experienced for the company s us gulf of mexico rigs 
in the north sea  a reduction in the number of available rigs has been the primary contributing factor to increased industry utilization levels during the increased utilization has led to increased north sea day rates in for the industry  including the company s north sea rigs 
management believes  based upon current market conditions  that north sea day rate and utilization levels should remain fairly stable in  although lower spot prices for natural gas in the united kingdom present some uncertainty 
the company s barge drilling rigs in venezuela generally operate under long term contracts for the national oil company 
as a result  their day rate and utilization levels are not as dependent on oil and natural gas prices

revenues and operating margin for the company s international jackup rigs increased by and  respectively  in as compared to due primarily to an increase of approximately  in average day rates 
revenues in also benefitted from the company assuming operation  effective january   of two jackup rigs that previously operated under bareboat charters 
the revenue increase was offset  in part  by reduced operating days primarily due to the mobilization of two jackup rigs to the us gulf of mexico  one in the third quarter of from brazil and one which began mobilizing in the fourth quarter of from dubai 
these rigs were included in the international jackup rig results for substantially all of the year ended december  the cost to mobilize the two jackup rigs totalled million and was charged against earnings 
two of the company s jackup rigs located in the north sea were off contract undergoing modifications and enhancements during the majority of a north sea jackup rig acquired by the company in march completed its bareboat charter contract in february and is currently undergoing modifications and enhancements 
the rig is under contract to commence operations immediately upon completion of the modifications and enhancements  which is expected in april for the year ended december   revenues for the company s international jackup rigs decreased by and operating margin increased by as compared to the revenue decrease is primarily attributable to reduced operating days related to the mobilization of five international jackup rigs to the us gulf of mexico  three in the second  third and fourth quarters of from the north sea  one in the third quarter of from brazil and one in the fourth quarter of from dubai

revenues and operating margin from the company s barge drilling rigs in venezuela increased by and  respectively  for the year ended december  as compared to due primarily to a full year of operation of four barge drilling rigs that began operating in the third quarter of offset  in part  by two of the company s barge drilling rigs completing their contracts in the second quarter of and remaining idle through the end of the company s revenues and operating margin from its barge drilling rigs in venezuela increased by and  respectively  for the year ended december  as compared to primarily due to the addition of four barge drilling rigs in the third quarter of and a full year s contribution from four barge drilling rigs that began operating in march through june of the venezuelan currency experienced significant devaluation during the first half of in june  the venezuelan government established exchange control policies and severely restricted the conversion of venezuelan currency to us dollars 
in late  the venezuelan government further devalued the venezuelan currency against the us dollar 
to date  the company has not experienced problems associated with receiving us dollar payments with respect to the us dollar portion of its contracts with lagoven 
changes in these conditions  other policy enactments  or political developments in venezuela could have an adverse effect upon the company 
however  the company believes such adverse effects are not probable due to the volume of us dollars paid to the parent company of lagoven for its oil exports 
the company sold substantially all of its land rig operations in revenues and operating margin for the company s land rigs for the year ended december  decreased by million and million  respectively  compared to primarily as a result of the sales
