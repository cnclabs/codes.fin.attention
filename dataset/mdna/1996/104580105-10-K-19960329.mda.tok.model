the acquisition was completed through the issuance of  shares of common stock to the owners of the former advisor 
in april  the company acquired st 
francis plaza  a  square foot community shopping center in santa fe  new mexico for approximately  the purchase was financed by the assumption of  in debt and the cash proceeds from the issuance of  shares of common stock 
the company has used its secured bank line of credit to fund expenditures for property acquisitions and capital improvements 
interest under the line was at the lower of the lead bank s base rate or over libor 
during  the weighted average rate was 
approximately  was available under the aggregate  line of credit at december  effective march   the company s line of credit was renegotiated in conjunction with the merger of the company and tucker  discussed below  to an aggregate  in december  the company filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission to register  of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  warrants  rights  or units of the foregoing securities that the company may issue through underwriters or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time 
in july  the company completed an offering under the shelf registration of  common shares at a price of per share 
net proceeds from the offering were approximately  of which  was used to pay down the line of credit   was used to pay off the non recourse mortgages assumed in upon the purchase of westwind plaza  and the balance used for general business purposes

the acquisition was completed through the issuance of  common shares of the company valued at per share in exchange for of the outstanding shares of tucker  the payment of certain transaction costs and the assumption of all of tuckers liabilities 
the acquisition was structured as a tax free transaction  and is being treated as a purchase for financial reporting purposes 
the company has succeeded to tucker s interest in two partnerships which hold title to all of the former tucker properties  and as a result now owns some of its properties directly and the others through the two partnerships now renamed bradley operating limited partnership and bradley financing partnership 
the company has in excess of a general partner interest in each partnership 
in conjunction with the merger  on march   the company entered into a new  unsecured revolving credit facility with the first national bank of boston 
the line bears interest at the lower of the bank s base rate or over libor 
the rates available under the line become more favorable in the event the company meets certain loan to value tests or receives an investment grade unsecured debt rating 
in addition to replacing outstanding borrowings under the company s and tucker s previously outstanding secured lines of credit  the facility is available for the acquisition  development  renovation and expansion of new and existing properties including  but not limited to  capital improvements  tenant improvements and leasing commissions  and for other working capital purposes 
the company s new line of credit contains certain financial and operational covenants that  among other provisions  limit the amount of secured and unsecured indebtedness the company may have outstanding at any time to a percentage of the company s consolidated market value as defined  and provide for the maintenance of certain financial tests including minimum net worth and debt service coverage requirements 
the company believes that such covenants will not adversely affect the company s business or the operation of its properties 
the company has entered into an agreement with brookfield development  inc  the current ground lessee  regarding the proposed sale by the company of its interest in nicollet avenue  minneapolis  minnesota 
the sale price  subject to standard closing adjustments  is  if consummated  the sale would result in a gain for financial reporting purposes of approximately  and approximately  for federal income tax purposes 
for federal income tax purposes  however  the company intends to structure the transaction as a like kind exchange 
in that regard  the company intends to identify brookdale square shopping center  a  square foot community shopping center located in brooklyn  minnesota brookdale as the replacement property in the exchange 
the purchase price for brookdale  subject to standard closing adjustments  is  to the extent that sales proceeds from nicollet avenue exceed the purchase price of brookdale  the company intends to apply such excess to the line of credit 
the company expects to close these transactions by march  while the acquisition of tucker results in the company s assumption of substantial additional indebtedness  the company anticipates that the additional revenues from the former tucker properties will be sufficient to service such debt as well as to cover the operating expenses of such properties and to make distributions with respect to the additional shares of the company issued to the former tucker stockholders 
 of tucker mortgage debt assumed is represented by a remic note that matures september  the company believes that the properties securing the remic note and other mortgage debt have sufficient current value to permit the refinancing of such debt upon maturity  although there can be no assurance that property values or refinancing terms at the time of maturity will be favorable 
in general  a goal of management is to receive an investment grade rating from one or more national rating agencies that will increase the company s financial flexibility by permitting the company to issue fixed rate unsecured debt on favorable terms 
the company funds operating expenses and distributions primarily from operating cash flows  although the line of credit may also be used for these purposes 
net cash flows provided by operating activities increased to  during  from  in and  in distributions treated as a charge to cash flows from financing activities in the company s financial statements were  in   in and  in funds from operations ffo increased  or during from  in to  in ffo increased by  or during  from  in the company generally considers ffo to be a relevant and meaningful supplemental measure of the performance of an equity reit because it is predicated on a cash flow basis  as opposed to a measure predicated on generally accepted accounting principles which gives effect to non cash items such as depreciation and amortization 
ffo  as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts and as followed by the company  represents net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
since the definition of ffo is a guideline  computation of ffo may vary from one reit to another 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
in addition  ffo is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
the company believes that improving its financial flexibility will position the company for future growth  allowing it to take advantage of acquisition  renovation and expansion opportunities 
the company continues to evaluate prospective acquisitions of individual properties and entire portfolios 
to fund potential acquisitions  the company may issue securities under the multi security shelf registration referred to above either to the public or in privately negotiated transactions 
the company may also acquire properties through the direct issuance of securities of the company or  via its operating partnership  through the issuance of limited partnership units in the operating partnership 
the company also expects that it will make further tax deferred like kind exchanges of existing mature properties for properties with more growth potential 
in addition  the company may acquire partial interests in real estate assets through participation in joint venture transactions 
finally  the company may borrow under its line of credit to provide the initial funds for acquisitions and  potentially  renovations and expansions  with such borrowings being subsequently repaid from the proceeds of further equity or debt offerings  depending upon market conditions at the time
