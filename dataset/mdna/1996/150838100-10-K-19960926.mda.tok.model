additional growth in the tractor and trailer fleet beyond the company s existing orders will require additional sources of financing 
seasonality to date  the company s revenues have not shown any significant seasonal pattern 
however  because the company s trucking subsidiary s primary traffic lane is between the midwest united states and mexico  a severe winter generally may have an unfavorable impact upon the company s results of operations 
inflation many of the company s operating expenses  including fuel costs and fuel taxes  are sensitive to the effects of inflation  which could result in higher operating costs 
the effects of inflation on the company s businesses during fiscal  and generally were not significant
