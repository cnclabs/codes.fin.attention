the addition of chicago laser systems  inc chicago laser in august contributed million to the increased sales of laser trimming systems 
palomar sales increased million or as a result of increased volume of miniature capacitor test and production systems 
laser service and vision system revenues did not change significantly from the prior year 
the company s gross margin percentage improved to for fiscal from for fiscal year the primary factors contributing to this improvement were increased unit sales of higher gross margin laser systems and higher sales volume of miniature capacitor test and production systems 
in addition  higher production volumes resulted in reduced per unit manufacturing costs 
total operating expenses increased million or over the prior year 
however  as a percentage of sales  operating expenses declined from for fiscal to for fiscal selling  service and administrative expenses increased million or as a result of million of increased selling commissions associated with the higher level of sales  million in discretionary compensation awards and salary increases  and million of salaries and rents associated with the chicago laser business

page of factors that may affect future results the company s business depends in large part upon the capital expenditures of manufacturers of electronic devices  including miniature capacitors and semiconductor memory devices  and circuits used in wireless telecommunications equipment  including pagers and cellular phones  automotive electronics and computers 
the markets for products manufactured by the company s customers are cyclical and have historically experienced periodic downturns  which often have had a negative effect on the demand for capital equipment such as that sold by the company 
several large  multinational electronics companies constituted of the company s fiscal sales  the loss of any of these customers would be significant 
the market for the company s products is characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards 
the company believes that its future success will depend on its ability to develop and manufacture new products and product enhancements and to introduce them successfully into the market 
failure to do so in a timely fashion could harm the company s competitive position 
the announcements or introductions of new products by the company or its competitors may adversely affect the company s operating results  since these announcements or introductions may cause customers to defer or forego ordering products from the company s existing product lines 
international sales accounted for of the company s net sales for fiscal the company expects that international sales will continue to represent a significant percentage of net sales in the future 
as a result  a significant portion of the company s net sales will be subject to certain risks  including changes in demand resulting from fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates  as well as factors such as government financed competition  changes in trade policies  tariff regulations  difficulties in obtaining us export licenses and the difficulties of staffing and managing foreign operations 
most of the company s sales transactions are based in dollars and the company s products are made in the united states 
many japanese customers pay in yen  therefore  esi hedges these sales transactions to mitigate currency risks 
the european and asian sales subsidiaries operating expenses are denominated in their respective local currencies 
these transactions represent approximately of total consolidated operating expenses  equally split between europe and asia 
changes in the value of the local currency  as measured in us dollars  will commensurably increase or decrease operating expenses 
esi believes that it has the product offerings and resources needed for continuing success  however  future revenue and margin trends cannot be reliably predicted and may cause the company to adjust its operations 
factors external to the company can result in volatility of the company s common stock price 
because of the foregoing factors  recent trends should not be considered reliable indicators of future stock prices or financial results
