the decline in gross margin from sales of saucony products resulted from a greater proportion of sales of lower priced  lower margin footwear to sales of higher priced  higher margin footwear in fiscal the decline in gross margin from sales of brookfield products resulted from a greater ratio of lower margin international product sales to higher margin domestic product sales compared with fiscal increased international sales in fiscal by brookfield as an oem manufacturer for certain of its licensors also caused gross margins to contract on some specialty brookfield product items 
selling  general and administrative expense increased as a percentage of net sales to in fiscal compared with of net sales in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to the decrease in net sales in fiscal in comparison to fiscal the absolute decrease in the amount of selling  general and administrative expenses resulted from a reduction in saucony product advertising and promotional spending of  this decrease was partially offset by increases in selling payroll  tradeshows and administrative expenses to support the company s new foreign subsidiary in germany and increased costs associated with the lease of a warehouse in australia 
other income increased in fiscal to  from  in fiscal as a result of the gain on the sale of the company s investment in a limited partnership and increased royalty income 
royalty income increased in fiscal due to a final payment received under a litigation settlement which amounted to  interest expense decreased in fiscal by  as a result of the paydown of corporate debt during fiscal and debt reduction realized as a result of the sale by the company of its limited partnership investment 
the provision for income tax declined by  in fiscal as compared with fiscal as a result of the decrease in the company s pretax earnings 
the effective tax rate in fiscal was compared with in fiscal this rate reduction was due primarily to the relative effect of fixed tax credits from the company s tax related investment on lower income before tax for fiscal  as compared with fiscal and an adjustment to the company s tax reserves

the improvement in the gross margin from sales of saucony products resulted from greater operating efficiencies at the company s bangor  maine manufacturing facility and a change in the company s saucony product mix to higher gross margin products 
the improvement in the gross margin from sales of brookfield products was due to increased sales of higher margin barbie and other licensed products as well as a decrease in product returns

this increase resulted from increased borrowings by the company s foreign subsidiaries to support their increased selling and promotional expenses and a full year of interest expense on borrowings incurred in connection with the company s investment in a limited partnership 
the provision for income tax declined by approximately  in fiscal this decline is attributable to the decrease in the company s pretax earnings 
the effective tax rate in fiscal was compared to in this rate reduction was due primarily to the company s tax credit investment which was made in the fourth quarter of liquidity and capital resources as of january   the company s cash and cash equivalents totalled  an increase of  from december  the increase was primarily the result of a decrease in accounts receivable of  and a decrease in inventory of  during fiscal the decrease in receivables was due to reduced corporate net sales in the fiscal fourth quarter of the company s days sales outstanding at the year end fiscal of remained consistent with fiscal s level of days

the primary factor responsible for the increase in inventory was the company s creation of two new selling seasons for its saucony brand in the united states 
these new selling seasons changed customers buying patterns and resulted in an increase in the company s inventory of saucony core running styles 
in fiscal  the company used  in net cash from operating activities  expended  for capital expenditures  including information technology  expended  to reduce long term debt and other long term commitments  expended  to repurchase shares of the company s common stock and borrowed  on a short term basis

at january   the company had various commitments for capital expenditures  including information technology systems  improvements to and expansion of distribution facilities  both domestic and foreign 
the company believes that these commitments are not significant 
the liquidity of the company is contingent upon a number of factors  principally the company s future operating results 
management believes that the company s current cash and cash equivalents  credit facilities and internally generated funds are adequate to meet its working capital requirements and to fund its capital investment needs and debt service payments 
inflation and currency risk the company has experienced minimal impact of inflation over the past three years 
the company has also experienced minimal impact due to currency fluctuations because substantially all purchases from foreign suppliers and sales to customers to date have been denominated in united states dollars

as of january   the company has not adopted sfas and has not determined the impact of such adoption on its consolidated results of operations 
certain factors that may affect future results the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
competition 
competition is intense in the markets in which the company sells its products 
the company competes with a large number of other companies  both domestic and foreign  several of which have diversified products lines  well known brands and financial  distribution and marketing resources substantially greater than those of the company 
the principal competitors for the company s saucony products are nike  reebok international  new balance and asics 
the principal competitors for the company s brookfield products are variflex  roller derby  blade runner and fisher price 
dependence on foreign suppliers 
a number of manufacturers located in the far east  primarily in china  taiwan and thailand  supply products and product components to the company 
during fiscal  one of such suppliers  located in china  accounted for approximately of the company s total purchases by dollar volume 
the company is subject to the usual risks of a business involving foreign suppliers  such as currency fluctuations  government regulation of fund transfers  export and import duties  trade limitations imposed by the united states or foreign governments and political and labor instability 
in particular  there are a number of trade related and other issues creating significant friction between the governments of the united states and china  and the imposition of punitive import duties on certain categories of chinese products has been threatened in the past and may be implemented in the future 
in addition  the company has no long term manufacturing agreements with its foreign suppliers and competes with other athletic shoe and recreational product companies including companies that are much larger than the company for access to production facilities 
potential fluctuations in quarterly results 
the company s quarterly operating results may vary significantly depending on a number of factors  including the timing and shipment of individual orders  market acceptance of new athletic footwear or outdoor recreational products for children  changes in the company s operating expenses  personnel changes  mix of products sold  changes in product pricing and general economic conditions 
in addition  a substantial portion of the company s revenue is realized during the last few weeks of each quarter  therefore  any delays in orders or shipments are more likely to result in revenue not being recognized until the following quarter  which could adversely impact the results of operations for that quarter 
the company s current expense levels are based in part on its expectations of future revenue and  as a result  net income for a given period could be disproportionately affected by any reduction in revenue 
it is possible that in some future quarter the company s revenue or operating results will be below the expectations of stock market securities analysts and investors  if that were to occur  the market price of the common stock could be materially adversely affected 
management of growth 
one element of the company s business strategy is to seek acquisitions of businesses and products that are complementary to those of the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effect any acquisitions  operate any such acquired businesses profitably or otherwise implement its growth strategy successfully 
in addition  identifying and effecting acquisitions and integrating the acquired businesses with the operations of the company may place significant demands upon the current management team and operational systems of the company 
in order to effect acquisitions of a certain size  the company may require additional capital  which the company may obtain through additional borrowings under its credit facility 
dependence upon licensing arrangements 
the company sells brookfield products under trade names licensed from other parties 
most of the company s licenses are non exclusive  have a fixed term and limit the types of products that may be sold under the license 
dependence on consumer preferences 
the company is susceptible to fluctuations in its business based upon fashion trends and frequently changing consumer style preferences and product demands  including levels of enthusiasm for athletic activities 
the company believes that its success depends in substantial part on its ability to anticipate  gauge and respond to changing consumer demands and fashion trends in a timely manner 
moreover  the company could be materially adversely affected by conditions in the retail industry in general  including consolidation and the resulting decline in the number of retailers and other cyclical economic factors 
advertising and marketing programs 
the company s success in the markets in which it competes depends in part upon the effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs of the company 
in particular  it is imperative that the company periodically design and successfully execute new and effective advertising and marketing programs 
dependence on major customers 
although the company had no customer that accounted for ten percent or more of the company s consolidated revenue during  the company s business is susceptible to the loss of certain key customers of the company s product lines  such as foot locker for the company s saucony products and toys r us for the company s brookfield products
