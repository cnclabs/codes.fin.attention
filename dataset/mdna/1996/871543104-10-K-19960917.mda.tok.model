item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
business outlook and risk factors certain trend analysis and other information contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations consist of forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and are subject to the safe harbor provisions of those sections 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements due to a number of factors including the factors listed below 
potential fluctuations in operating results 
the company s quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past  and may continue to fluctuate in the future  due to a number of factors including the timing  cancellation or delay of customer orders  changes in the product or customer mix of sales  the timing of new product introductions by the company or its competitors  customer delays in qualification of key new products  delays in new product development and production startup  increasing competition  market acceptance of the company s and its competitors products  the long sales cycles associated with the company s products and other competitive factors 
company operations entail a high level of fixed costs and require an adequate volume of production and sales to maintain reasonable gross margins 
accordingly  any significant decline in demand or any material delay of customer orders would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
order timing 
a substantial portion of each quarter s shipments is based on orders received during that quarter  and from time to time  a significant portion of each quarter s shipments is based on orders received in the last month of that quarter 
furthermore  most orders in backlog can be rescheduled or cancelled without significant penalty 
therefore  operating results may fluctuate significantly from the company s expectations quarter to quarter due to uncertainty in the timing and the receipt of orders  delays in product shipment and rescheduling or cancellation of orders 
although linfinity s bookings rate increased during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company continues to remain cautious for the first quarter of fiscal due to the overall weakness in the semiconductor industry 
new product development 
the company is affected by changing technologies and frequent new product introductions 
the company s success will depend on its ability to respond to changing technologies and customer requirements 
delays in new product development or delays in production startup could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully develop and introduce new or enhanced products  or that such new or enhanced products will achieve market acceptance 
product performance and reliability 
the company s customers establish demanding specifications for performance and reliability 
the company s products are complex and use many state of the art components  processes and techniques 
there can be no assurance that new products or enhancements of existing products will not contain undetected errors or failures due to the complexities of such products 
any such unforeseen problem could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
market change 
future results depend in large part on growth in the markets for the company s products 
the growth in each of these markets depends on  among other things  changes in general economic conditions  or conditions which relate specifically to the markets in which the company competes 
some factors which affect the markets for the company s products include changes in regulatory conditions  legislation  export rules or conditions  interest rates and fluctuations in the business cycle for any particular market segment 
competition 
markets for the company s products are highly competitive  and some of the company s competitors  or potential competitors are much larger than the company  with substantially greater financial  manufacturing  technical and marketing resources 
operating results are subject to fluctuation based on unforeseen actions taken by competitors  the entry of new competitors and the introduction of new or enhanced competing products 
competition for some of the company s products is increasing 
results will depend on the company s ability to maintain competitive performance  quality  price and service 
the company s stock price has been and may continue to be subject to significant volatility 
many factors  including any shortfall in sales or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts and investors could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock 
results of operations the company conducts its business through two separate operations 
telecom solutions designs  manufactures and markets telecommunications equipment including advanced network synchronization systems and intelligent access systems 
linfinity microelectronics inc linfinity designs  manufactures and markets linear and mixed signal integrated circuits as well as modules for use in power supply  data communications and signal conditioning applications 
net sales net sales increased by million to million in fiscal and by million to million in fiscal the increase in fiscal sales was due to higher sales at telecom solutions offset by lower linfinity sales 
the increase in fiscal sales was due to higher sales at both operations 
telecom solutions net sales increased by million to million in fiscal and by million to million in fiscal the increase in fiscal sales primarily resulted from new synchronization products sales which offset declines in mature synchronization products sales  and higher integrated digital services terminal idst  and secure sales 
the increase in fiscal sales principally resulted from new synchronization products sales which more than offset substantial declines in sales of analog and mature synchronization products 
linfinity s net sales decreased by million to million in fiscal and increased by million to million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was essentially due to lower unit volume of product sold primarily resulting from the general slowdown in the demand for integrated circuits used in personal computers in the last half of fiscal also  the company shifted its product sales to lower priced commercial and industrial products 
the increase in fiscal sales was primarily due to higher unit volume which more than offset a shift in sales to lower priced products 
gross margin the company s gross margins were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  the lower gross margin was essentially due to decreased manufacturing efficiencies and a shift to lower margin products at telecom solutions  and a significant decline in unit volume and other manufacturing efficiencies at linfinity 
in fiscal  the higher gross margin resulted primarily from increased manufacturing efficiencies at both operations and to a shift to higher margin products at telecom solutions 
future gross margins will largely depend on product mix  manufacturing efficiencies  selling prices and the development and market acceptance of new products with higher gross margins 
operating expenses research and development expense increased to million or of net sales in fiscal from million or of net sales and million or of net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal was principally due to a higher investment in new product development by both operations 
telecom solutions focused on developing wireless synchronization products and network management software  as well as enhancing the core synchronization and transmission products 
linfinity s development efforts were focused on low dropout regulators  backlight inverters and the small computer systems interface scsi product line 
additionally  the increased spending in fiscal more than offset a decrease attributable to substantially lower earnings based incentive compensation due to both operations performance in fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  the increase was primarily due to the company s continued emphasis on new product development  with a proportionately higher increase at linfinity 
selling  general and administrative expense decreased by to million or of net sales in fiscal from million or of net sales in fiscal and increased by in fiscal from million or of net sales in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was substantially due to lower earnings based incentive compensation due to both operations performance partially offset by increased marketing expenditures to support telecom solutions new wireless synchronization products and continued expansion in international markets 
the increase in fiscal was principally due to higher earnings based incentive compensation 
operating income operating income decreased by to million in fiscal and increased by to million in fiscal in the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to a decline in linfinity s operating income and  to a lesser extent  a decline in telecom solutions operating income 
the increase in fiscal was entirely due to higher telecom solutions operating income as linfinity s operating income declined slightly
