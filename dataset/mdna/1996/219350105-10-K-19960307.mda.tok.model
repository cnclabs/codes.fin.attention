item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  appearing on pages through  and note information by industry segment of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing on pages and competition corning competes across all of its product lines with many large and varied manufacturers and health care service providers  both domestic and foreign 
within the specialty materials segment  corning s principal products face competition from a variety of material manufacturers  some of which manufacture similar products made from materials other than glass and ceramics 
among other things  innovation  product quality  performance  and service are key competitive elements 
competition within the communications segment s primary products is intense among several significant companies 
corning represents an important market presence in the segment s principal product lines 
price and new product innovations are significant competitive factors 
the health care services segment s clinical laboratory business has several major national competitors and numerous regional and local competitors  including hospital laboratories 
pharmaceutical services has several substantial international competitors in certain of its businesses  as well as numerous smaller competitors around the world 
price and quality of service are significant competitive factors 
in addition  government regulatory policy affects competition in both the clinical laboratory and pharmaceutical services businesses 
competition is also intense in the consumer products business 
corning competes in a broad range of products and markets with equally diverse competitors 
primary competitive influences include price  function  design  customer service  and the overall retail economies in which corning s products compete 
in certain consumer product lines  corning has a sizeable market presence 
given corning s position as a leader in many of its markets  the competition requires that corning maintain its market position through technology and product innovation 
for the future  corning s competitive advantage lies in its commitment to research and development  its financial resources  and its commitment to quality 
raw materials corning s production of specialty glasses and related materials requires significant quantities of energy and batch materials 
although energy shortages have not been a problem recently  corning has achieved flexibility through important engineering changes to take advantage of the lowest cost energy source in most significant processes 
specifically  the company s principal manufacturing processes can now be operated with natural gas  propane  oil or electricity  or a combination of these energy sources 
as to resources ores  minerals  and processed chemicals required in manufacturing operations  availability appears to be adequate 
corning s suppliers from time to time may experience capacity limitations in their own operations  or may eliminate certain product lines  nevertheless  the company believes it has adequate programs to ensure a reliable supply of batch chemicals and raw materials 
for many products  corning has alternative glass compositions that would allow operations to continue without interruption in the event of specific materials shortages 
patents and trademarks inventions by members of corning s research and engineering staff have been  and continue to be  important to the company s growth 
patents have been granted on many of these inventions in the united states and other countries 
some of these patents have been licensed to other manufacturers  including corning s associated companies 
many of the earlier patents have now expired 
most of corning s products are marketed under the following trademarks corning  corning ware  celcor  corelle  corguide  pyrex  visions and vycor 
subsidiaries of corning frequently use their own trademarks  such as revere ware  metpath  and costar 
protection of the environment corning has a program to ensure that its facilities are in compliance with state  federal and foreign pollution control regulations 
this program resulted in capital and operating expenditures during the past several years 
in order to maintain compliance with such regulations  capital expenditures for pollution control were approximately million in and are estimated to be million in corning s operating results were charged with approximately million for depreciation  maintenance  waste disposal  and other operating expenses associated with pollution control 
the level of these costs is not expected to change substantially in corning believes that its compliance program will not place it at a competitive disadvantage

corning has accrued approximately million for its estimated liability for environmental cleanup and litigation at december  breast implant litigation 
on may   dow corning corporation sought protection under the reorganization provisions of chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
the effect of the bankruptcy  which is pending in the united states bankruptcy court for the eastern district of michigan  northern division bay city  michigan  is to stay the prosecution against dow corning of the purported breast implant product liability class action lawsuits and its approximately  breast implant product liability lawsuits 
in june  dow corning and its shareholders corning and the dow chemical company attempted to remove various state court implant lawsuits against itself and its shareholders to federal court  and to transfer these cases to the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan  southern district the michigan federal court 
the transfer motion also contemplated a trial of the consolidated  transferred cases on the common issue of whether silicones cause diseases as alleged by plaintiffs 
on september   judge hood of the michigan federal court issued an order granting the motion to transfer the dow corning cases to federal court  but denying the motion to the extent it requested the transfer of cases against dow corning s shareholders to her court 
judge hood also denied the motion for the purpose of holding one causation trial prior to the estimation process by the bankruptcy court  but without prejudice to subsequent motions for one or more such trials to assist in the bankruptcy estimation process 
dow corning  corning and dow chemical have filed an appeal from judge hood s order in the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit 
oral argument of the appeal is scheduled for march  in march  dow corning along with other defendants and representatives of breast implant litigation plaintiffs signed a breast implant litigation settlement agreement the global settlement under which industry participants would contribute billion over a period of more than thirty years to establish several special purpose funds 
corning was not a signatory or contributor to the global settlement 
the global settlement  if implemented  would have provided for a claims based structured resolution of claims arising out of silicone breast implants and defined periods during which breast implant plaintiffs could opt out of the settlement and instead continue their individual breast implant litigation against manufacturers and other defendants 
on october   the united states district court for the northern district of alabama entered an order declaring that claimants participating in the global settlement would have an additional right to opt out of that settlement 
those who do opt out will have the right to pursue individual lawsuits 
the global settlement has been effectively terminated

several state and private insurers have made claims based on the practices covered by the metpath settlement agreement 
several have settled but it is not clear at this time what  if any  additional exposure corning may have to these entities and to other persons who may assert claims on the basis of these or other practices 
during august  metpath  metwest and damon which was acquired by corning earlier that month together with other participants in the industry received subpoenas from the inspector general seeking information regarding their practices with respect to enumerated tests offered in conjunction with automatic chemical test panels 
metpath  metwest and damon submitted information pursuant to these subpoenas and the investigation into metpath and metwest has been closed 
damon was also served with two additional subpoenas in november and january from the inspector general and was directed by the us attorney s office in boston  to which its investigation has been referred  to submit additional information in response to the august subpoena 
the november subpoena supplements the august subpoena and requires the submission of supplemental information 
the january subpoena seeks information regarding the addition of the enumerated tests to organ function profiles rather than the automated multichannel chemistry profiles as in earlier subpoenas 
damon has completed its production to each of the foregoing subpoenas 
in march  damon received a subpoena from the department of defense criminal investigative service on behalf of champus  apparently covering the same practices as the earlier subpoenas 
compliance with that subpoena has been completed

consolidated operations consolidated sales and earnings in this segment increased in and primarily due to the continued growth in worldwide demand for optical fiber and optical cable and strength in the conventional video components and projection video businesses 
approximately one third of the sales growth in and was due to acquisitions in sales of corning s optical fiber and optical cable businesses increased significantly in and significant volume growth is being driven by domestic customers who are installing fiber to reduce operating cost and add new services 
in addition  international volume increased due to developing countries which are modernizing telecommunications infrastructures and developed countries which are privatizing government owned networks and deregulating the telecommunications industry 
sales growth also resulted from the acquisition of the optical fiber and optical cable businesses of northern telecom limited in february despite stable pricing during  volume growth was offset by lower year over year price comparisons 
earnings in this business increased significantly in both and  primarily as a result of the increased sales

the sales increase is due to volume gains resulting from strong market demand and the addition of new melting capacity in japan 
sales in increased over  but the rate of growth was impacted by increased competition and the delay by some customers in bringing new capacity on line 
the business incurred a loss in both and due to manufacturing inefficiencies in  start up costs for the capacity expansion in and development spending for improved manufacturing capabilities and the next generation substrate glass in both and in  corning decided to delay the launch of its glass ceramic memory disk product due to technical problems detected in the final stages of customer testing 
after significant development efforts in the first half of  corning decided that  although it had developed a product which met the market s technical requirements  the projected profitability of the product did not warrant gearing production for commercial quantities 
as a result  the restructuring charge reflected management s decision to exit the manufacturing facility for this product and significantly reduce the amount of development spending on this project
