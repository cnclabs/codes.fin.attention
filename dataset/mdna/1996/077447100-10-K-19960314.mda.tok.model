item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the selected financial information included elsewhere in this report 
general on march   the company succeeded to the belden interests 
the transaction was accounted for on the basis of historical cost in a manner similar to a pooling of interests 
as a result  the consolidated financial statements of the company reflect the combined historical results of operations of only the belden interests prior to march  also on march   the company acquired the assets and assumed the liabilities of the partnership and bbi in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the consolidation 
the consolidation was accounted for as a purchase  and the results of operations of the partnership and bbi have been included from that date 
prior to march   the company was engaged principally in managing the assets and business activities of the partnership  bbi and non affiliated entities and in gas gathering and marketing 
accordingly  a significant portion of the company s income was derived from transactions with the partnership and bbi  including well operating fees  sales of oilfield supplies and services at fixed mark ups over cost and fees for accounting and related services 
since march   the company s principal business has been the acquisition  development and production of  and exploration for  oil and gas reserves  principally in ohio  west virginia  pennsylvania  michigan and new york  and the gathering and marketing of natural gas 
consequently  the historical statements of operations prior to the consolidation do not reflect the company s current or planned business activities 
the company utilizes the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas properties 
under this method  property acquisition and development costs and productive exploration costs are capitalized while non productive exploration costs  which include certain geological and geophysical costs  dry holes  expired leases and delay rentals  are expensed as incurred 
capitalized costs related to proved properties are depleted using the unit of production method 
no gains or losses are recognized upon the disposition of oil and gas properties except in extraordinary transactions 
sales proceeds are credited to the carrying value of the properties 
maintenance and repairs are expensed  and expenditures which enhance the value of properties are capitalized 
the company s gas gathering and marketing operations consist of purchasing gas at the wellhead and from interstate pipelines and selling gas to industrial customers and local gas distribution companies 
the cost of gas purchased from the company is the wellhead price stipulated by the well operating or gas purchase agreements relating to the wells and is included in cost of gas and gathering expense 
the company provides oilfield sales and services to its own operations and to third parties 
oilfield sales and service provided to the company s own operations are provided at cost and all intercompany revenues and expenses are eliminated in consolidation 
prior to the consolidation  revenues from oilfield sales and service provided to the partnership and bbi were accounted for as third party revenues 
results of operations compared to oil and gas sales

oil volumes increased  bbls from  bbls in to  bbls in resulting in an increase in oil sales of approximately million 
gas volumes increased bcf from bcf in to bcf in resulting in an increase in gas sales of approximately million 
these volume increases were primarily due to production from the company s acquisitions and from wells drilled in and gas volumes produced in were less than the company s full production potential as a result of the company s decision to curtail gas production due to low spot market gas prices 
interstate pipeline repairs and construction in michigan and west virginia also reduced potential production volumes 
the average price paid for the company s oil increased from per barrel in to per barrel in which increased oil sales by approximately  the average price paid for the company s natural gas decreased

depletion per mcfe remained consistent at 
per mcfe in and income from continuing operations before income taxes 
income from continuing operations before income taxes increased million from million in to million in the operating income from the oil and gas operations segment increased million from million in to million in the increase was attributable to the items discussed above

per share in this increase was primarily the result of the factors discussed above partially offset by the increase in the average number of common shares outstanding from  in to  in the average number of shares outstanding increased primarily as a result of the company s sale of million common shares in may loss from discontinued operations 
loss from discontinued operations was   net of tax benefit or 
per share in compared to   net of tax benefit or 
per share in the increase was attributable to operating losses from magnolia compression services  inc  which was formed in  and engine power systems  inc  which was acquired in liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital is closely related to and dependent on the current prices paid for its oil and gas 
the company s current ratio at december  was to 
during  working capital increased million from million to million 
the increase was primarily due to increases in cash million  accounts receivable million and inventories million related to the quaker state and other acquisitions  which was largely offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses million from these same acquisitions 
the company s operating activities provided cash flow of million during on may   the company s bank group amended its revolving bank facility 
the facility was increased to million  the maturity date was extended to march   and the borrowing base was increased to million 
the borrowing base is calculated by the bank group and is based on the cash flows generated by the company s proved developed reserves  gas gathering systems and other corporate assets 
generally  the company can expect to have the borrowing base increased by at least of the present value before income taxes discounted at per annum of any proved developed reserves added through acquisition or drilling 
outstanding balances under the agreement incurred interest at the company s choice of either the one  two or three month libor for the three month libor interest rate option at december  or the bank s prime rate at december  
at december   the company had million outstanding under this facility 
on february   the company s bank group further amended its revolving bank facility 
the maturity date was extended to march  and the libor interest rate option was modified to decrease from libor to a range of libor to libor as outstanding balances decrease in relation to the borrowing base 
when market conditions are favorable  the company may enter into interest rate swap arrangements  whereby a portion of the company s floating rate exposure is exchanged for a fixed interest rate 
the company had no such derivative financial instruments at december  or the amended agreement will continue to restrict the sale of assets to no more than of shareholders equity in any one year and will require the company to maintain certain levels of net worth  working capital and debt service coverage 
during  the company placed million of fixed rate senior notes with five insurance companies in a private placement 
these notes  which are interest only for four years  mature on september  equal annual principal payments of  will be required on each september commencing in the senior note agreement limits the company s senior debt to of the discounted present value at of the company s oil and gas reserves plus the net book value of its gas gathering systems 
other terms and covenants are substantially the same as those contained in the million revolving credit facility 
the company issued  shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share pursuant to an underwriting agreement dated july  with johnson rice company  mcdonald company securities  inc and southcoast capital corporation  as representatives of the underwriters 
net proceeds were approximately million and were used to purchase the quaker state properties for approximately million with the balance used to reduce the outstanding balances under the company s revolving bank facility 
the company currently expects to spend approximately million during on its drilling activities and approximately million for other capital expenditures 
the company s acquisition program is expected to be financed with any available cash flow over million and with its available bank credit line 
the company believes that its existing sources of working capital are sufficient to satisfy all currently anticipated working capital requirements 
the level of the company s cash flow in the future will depend on a number of factors including the demand and price levels for oil and gas  its ability to acquire additional producing properties and the scope and success of its drilling activities 
the company intends to finance such activities principally through its available cash flow  through additional borrowings and  to the extent necessary  the issuance of additional common or preferred stock 
inflation and changes in prices during  the price paid for the company s crude oil fell from a high of per barrel at the beginning of the year to a low of per barrel at year end with an average price of per barrel 
during  the price paid for the company s crude oil increased from per barrel to a high of per barrel  then decreased to per barrel at year end  with an average price of per barrel 
during  the price paid for the company s crude oil increased from per barrel to a high of per barrel  then decreased to per barrel at year end  with an average price for the year of per barrel 
the average price of the company s natural gas increased from per mcf in to per mcf in and decreased to per mcf in the price of oil and gas has a significant impact on the company s results of operations 
oil and gas prices fluctuate based on market conditions and  accordingly  cannot be predicted 
as a result of increased competition among drilling contractors and suppliers and reduced levels of drilling  costs to drill  complete  and service wells have remained relatively constant in recent years 
historically  a large portion of the company s natural gas sales has been under long term fixed price contracts 
as a result of recent acquisitions  certain natural gas sales are currently based on indexed prices 
the company may  from time to time  enter into hedging transactions with financial institutions to reduce its exposure to variable commodity pricing
