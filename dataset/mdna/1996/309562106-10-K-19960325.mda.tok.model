asset quality the provision for loan losses represents charges made to earnings to maintain an adequate allowance 
each subsidiary determines its level for the allowance and maintains it at an amount believed to be sufficient to absorb possible losses that may be experienced in the credit portfolio 
the following factors are used in establishing an appropriate allowance a careful assessment of the financial condition of individual borrowers a realistic determination of the value and adequacy of underlying collateral a thorough review of historical loss experience the condition of the local economy a comprehensive analysis of the levels and trends of loan categories a review of delinquent and criticized loans the provision for loan losses increased million compared to the company had net charge offs of million compared to million the prior year

average savings accounts have declined to a total of million 
the primary increase in the deposit base has been with time deposits 
average time deposits have increased million  or to million due to the creation of a new flexible rate certificate of deposit product flexsaver introduced during the fourth quarter of the increase is the result of both new deposits and the migration of existing accounts into the flexsaver 
the decline in noninterest bearing deposits can be attributed to the introduction of the flexsaver and the unpredictable fluctuation in activity from the commonwealth of kentucky deposits

management expects that in the aggregate  its subsidiary banks will continue to have the ability to dividend adequate funds to the company 
the company s objective as it relates to liquidity is to insure that subsidiary banks have funds available to meet deposit withdrawals and credit demands without unduly penalizing profitability 
in order to maintain a proper level of liquidity  the banks have several sources of funds available on a daily basis which can be used for liquidity purposes 
those sources of funds are the banks core deposits consisting of both business and non business deposits cash flow generated by repayment of loan principal and interest federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase for the longer term  the liquidity position is managed by balancing the maturity structure of the balance sheet 
this process allows for an orderly flow of funds over an extended period of time 
interest rate sensitivity in that it is extremely difficult to accurately predict interest rate movements  it is management s intention to maintain the cumulative interest sensitivity gap at the one year time frame between plus or minus as a percent of total assets 
the gap position may be managed by purchasing investment securities with a maturity date within the desired time frame  offering interest rate incentives to encourage loan customers to choose the desired maturity  and offer interest rate incentives to encourage deposit customers to choose the desired maturity 
the following chart illustrates interest rate sensitivity at december  for various time periods 
the purpose of this gap chart is to measure interest rate risk utilizing the repricing intervals of the interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
rising interest rates are likely to increase net interest income in a positive gap position while falling interest rates are beneficial in a negative gap position 
the company has a negative gap position through three months  but then shifts to a nearly neutral gap position at twelve months 
this positioning is due to management s anticipated economic outlook and other competitive factors

effects of inflation since most of the assets and liabilities are monetary in nature  inflation has a minor effect on banking concerns
