item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the company and its consolidated subsidiaries should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
general over the past five years  premiums written in the company s insurance operations have consistently increased  both as the result of acquisitions and through internal growth 
in the third quarter of  the company s decision to strengthen loss reserves resulted in a loss for that quarter of  otherwise  the company has reported operating profits in each quarter beginning with the third quarter of  when the phasing out of its prior non insurance operations was substantially completed 
increased premium volume in recent periods has been the result of the company s strategy of acquiring niche businesses and increasing premiums written in selected lines 
the company s most significant recent acquisition was its purchase in july of the redland group  inc  which provides mpci  crop hail and other named peril crop insurance and certain standard property and casualty coverages to the rural market 
following its acquisition by the company  redland has increased the volume of its mpci premium  and was the fourth largest mpci writer in the united states in mpci is a government sponsored program with accounting treatment which differs from more traditional property and casualty insurance lines 
for income statement purposes  gross premiums written consist of the aggregate amount of mpci premiums paid by farmers  and does not include any related federal premium subsidies or expense reimbursement 
the company s profit or loss from its mpci business is determined after the crop season ends on the basis of a profit sharing formula established by law and the cfsa 
for income statement purposes  any such profit share earned by the company  net of the cost of third party reinsurance  is shown as net premiums written  which equals net premiums earned for mpci business  whereas  any share of losses payable by the company is charged to losses and loss adjustment expenses 
due to various factors  including timing and severity of losses from storms and other natural perils and crop production cycles  the profit or loss on mpci premiums is primarily recognized in the second half of the calendar year 
the company relies on loss information from the field to determine utilizing a formula established by the cfsa the level of losses that should be considered in estimating the profit or loss during this period 
based upon available loss information  the company records an estimate of the profit or loss during the third quarter and then re evaluates the estimate using additional loss information available at year end to determine any remaining portion to be recorded in the fourth quarter 
all expense reimbursements received are credited to underwriting expenses 
certain other characteristics of the company s crop business also may affect comparisons  including i the seasonal nature of the business whereby profits or losses are generally recognized predominantly in the second half of the year  ii the short term nature of crop business whereby losses are known within a short time period  and iii the limited amount of investment income associated with crop business 
in addition  cash flows from such business differ from cash flows from certain more traditional lines 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
the seasonal and short term nature of the company s crop business  as well as the impact on such business of weather and other natural perils  may produce more volatility in the company s operating results on a quarter to quarter or year to year basis than has historically been present in the operations of the company 
forward looking information except for the historical information contained in this annual report on form k  matters discussed herein are forward looking 
such forward looking information reflects the company s current best estimates regarding future operations  but  since these are only estimates  actual results may differ materially from such estimates 
a variety of events  most of which are outside the company s control  cannot be accurately predicted and may materially impact estimates of future operations 
important among such factors are adverse weather conditions  natural disasters  changes in state and federal regulations  price competition impacting premium levels  changes in tax laws  financial market performance  changes in court decisions effecting coverages  and adverse general economic conditions 
the company s results are significantly impacted by its crop business  particularly its mpci line 
results from the crop lines are not generally known until the third and fourth quarters of the year  after crops are harvested 
crop results are particularly dependent on events beyond the company s control  notably weather conditions during the crop growing seasons in the states where the company writes a substantial amount of its crop insurance 
additionally  federal regulations governing aspects of crop insurance are frequently modified  and any such changes may impact crop insurance results 
forward looking information set forth herein does not take into account any impact from adverse weather conditions during the crop season  or the various other factors noted above which may adversely affect crop and non crop operating results 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  the company s net income fell for the year ended december  from million in to million in this reduction in net income resulted as premium growth in the company s general agency and program divisions  an increase in investment income and an increase in underwriting profits from the company s crop division were offset by higher than expected losses in the general agency and program divisions  an increase in the company s expense ratio and a change in the company s tax status 
the company experienced strong premium growth in its general agency division as direct premiums written increased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   and net premiums earned grew from to earned premiums grew more rapidly than direct premiums as premium growth slowed progressively in each quarter of the growth in this division came from the continued growth in new business produced from the company s scottsdale office which was established in late the rate of premium growth in slowed due to an increase in the competitive environment for lines of business written in the general agency division 
the company expects the competitive marketplace to continue unabated  and therefore  is expecting a more modest growth rate during the company s program division also experienced excellent premium growth during as direct premiums written increased from million in to million in  an increase of 
net earned premium increased at a rate of from million in to million in this premium growth was principally from new programs established during and the company continues to seek and establish new lines of business within the program division but competitive factors in the marketplace have resulted in somewhat lower growth rates than expected in many of these new programs 
the company continues to emphasize the production of new business within this division as programs within this division typically operate at underwriting expense levels approximately below the general agency division  and therefore  continued growth is expected during the company s non standard auto division did not grow during as premiums remained relatively stable with million in direct written premium during as compared to million during this lack of growth during resulted primarily from the company s desire to establish new computer software for its principal programs before seeking additional growth opportunities 
the new computer software is now operational in most states  and the company expects to expand its premium writings as a result of the beneficial marketing impact of this new software and through expansion into new states in the company s crop division also experienced strong premium growth in as direct written premiums and net earned premiums increased and respectively from to this premium growth resulted from an increase in the federal mpci program  and increases in premium levels under the company s crop hail insurance program resulting from an increase in rates and the writing of more exposure units in certain states 
in late  congress expanded the mpci program by enacting the reform act 
the act seeks to encourage farmers to participate in the mpci program and thereby reduce dependencies on traditional disaster relief measures see the discussion under general above 
as a result  the company s mpci premium increased from million in to million in in addition  the company s mpci retention also increased from million in to million in the crop industry had experienced several years of adverse experience in the crop hail business prior to  and as a result  crop hail rates have increased while capacity has decreased 
therefore  the company was able to increase its crop hail writings from million in direct written premiums in to million in direct written premiums for the company s investment income increased from million in to million in while the company s net realized capital gains increased from million in to million investment income increased from both an increase in the average size of the company s investment portfolio as well as an increase in the average yield on the company s fixed income investments 
the average size of the investment portfolio increased from million in to million in while the company s pre tax yield on its portfolio increased from in to in the company s investment portfolio increased from additional borrowings under the company s credit facility  positive cash flows from operations  funds from the exercise of warrants in december of as well as retained earnings 
investment yields increased as the overall interest rate environment provided higher yields during as compared to while was a difficult growing season  the company s underwriting income within its crop division increased from million in to million in this increase was a result of the growth in the mpci premium and better results in the company s hail division  offsetting negative results in the company s named peril crop programs principally from an active storm season in california during the growing season in the upper midwest was afflicted with wet weather during the planting season resulting in delayed planting of crops  followed by periods of severe heat in july  stressing newly emerging crops  and an early frost in september of no such adverse activity occurred in in addition  the reform act changed the profit sharing matrix for participants in the mpci program providing a higher degree of profit sharing  particularly for companies accepting risks in the commercial underwriting pool 
these two factors combined to change the percentage of the company s profit sharing under the mpci program from in to in this decrease in the profit sharing percentage was more than offset by the described increase in mpci premiums and improved crop hail results 
the reform act was not passed until october of  and therefore  the federal agencies charged with the oversight of the program had a limited time frame in which to enact guidelines and administrative rules and procedures for changes brought about by the reform act 
in addition  the wet planting season created additional stress on the mpci program which required further administrative changes by the federal government 
as a result  exact results of the mpci program were more difficult to estimate at december  than they had been in previous years 
any change in the company s estimate of results in the mpci program will be recorded in future periods 
the aforementioned positive factors were offset by higher than expected losses in the company s general agency and program division  including losses resulting from the strengthening of reserves during for prior year losses 
during the second quarter of  the company experienced a deterioration in the loss ratio of its commercial automobile liability business 
at that time  this was principally attributable to a more rapid emergence of losses from the year than had been expected by the company 
this trend continued in the third quarter of  and while the noted deterioration was principally in the automobile liability business  the company believed that similar deviations were likely to appear in other lines of business which develop more slowly than automobile  and therefore  the company chose in the third quarter to evaluate all major lines of business 
after an extensive study by the company in consultation with its independent actuaries  a pre tax charge of million was made in the third quarter for prior year losses 
for the year  the company increased its reserves for and prior year losses by million pre tax 
after the company completed its review of prior year losses  the new development pattern assumptions were used to estimate ultimate losses for the current accident year 
these new assumptions  severe wind and hail storms in texas during the second quarter of the year  and adverse results in a few of the company s business lines such as nursing home liability  homeowners business in south carolina and used car dealer business in california  combined to create a million underwriting loss in the property and casualty divisions of the company for the accident year 
for the accident year  the company s accident year loss ratio was for the property and casualty division 
the company s underwriting results in the non standard automobile division were fairly consistent from to with this division experiencing a loss ratio of in as compared to in the company believes that its loss reserves are adequate  but will continue to monitor such reserves closely as new development patterns are verified over time 
the company has curtailed or terminated the programs which experienced the highest loss ratios during therefore  the company would expect property and casualty operation loss ratios to return to a level more similar to during underwriting expenses for increased as a percentage of earned premium from during to during general and administrative expenses also increased by million from to  and expenses in the company s crop division net of ceding commissions from reinsurers and expense reimbursements from the federal government under the mpci program decreased slightly from million in to million in the increase in the underwriting expense levels were principally attributable to increases in non standard automobile division expenses related to the implementation of new computer software programs designed to make the company s product more saleable in the marketplace and to reduce expenses in future years as the division grows 
in addition  the company sought to strengthen its information systems and audit procedures within the program and general agency divisions 
the cost of implementation of several new programs in the program division also added to the higher expense ratio for as compared to the company expects the implementation of the new computer program for the non standard automobile program as well as the investments in systems for the general agency and program divisions to begin to slowly reduce its expense ratio over the next few years 
offsetting these internal expense reductions  the company is experiencing intense competition in the area of agent s commissions as capacity in the insurance marketplace continues to exceed demand 
the company s net income during was also effected by the impact of income taxes 
the company received a benefit of million from income taxes in as opposed to an expense of million from income taxes in as a result of prior noninsurance operations  the company generated significant tax loss carryforwards and other temporary differences  all of which were used by the end of the company does not expect any further tax benefits during  and therefore  would expect its tax rate to normalize at a percentage rate in the low thirties of net income before income taxes 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the company s net premiums earned increased for the year ended december  to million from million in the principal components of this increase were an increase of million and million in earned premium in redland s crop and standard property and casualty lines of business  respectively  following the acquisition of redland in the third quarter of  and an increase of million in general agency earned premium primarily resulting from the expansion of this segment following the hiring of four new managers in august included in the million increase in net earned premiums for crop business for was million in profit sharing before deducting the cost of third party reinsurance earned on the company s mpci business  compared to no profit sharing earned for such business for when the company recorded a loss share of million net of recoveries from third party reinsurers 
because of its accounting treatment  such loss share is not reflected as a reduction in net premiums earned but instead as an increase in the company s losses and loss adjustment expenses for the period 
the profit resulted primarily from increases in the company s mpci premiums and mpci retention as defined herein after ceding risk to federal reinsurance pools  as well as the occurrence of fewer insured losses  as adverse weather conditions in gave way to favorable weather conditions in the company s net investment income increased to million in versus million during the prior year 
the average size of the investment portfolio increased from approximately million during the year ended december  to approximately million during this increase resulted primarily from internally generated cash flows and the ownership of redland for a full year 
the investment yield decreased from to primarily as a result of redland s portfolio generally being invested in short term investments due to the nature of its business 
net realized capital gains were approximately million for versus million for the higher amount in resulted from the company s decision to reposition its portfolio in a higher concentration of tax exempt securities during when market values of the company s fixed income securities in many cases exceeded cost due to lower prevailing interest rates 
losses and loss adjustment expenses increased to million versus million in or a  increase  consistent with the increase in net premiums earned 
the results were affected by adverse loss and loss adjustment expense development of approximately million  primarily from the company s general liability and commercial multi peril lines 
this adverse development principally related to the and accident years  and to a lesser extent to the and years  when actual experience differed from historical patterns 
in mid  the company hired a senior vice president of claims to oversee claims operations for all of the insurance subsidiaries 
subsequently  the company established new policies  procedures  and standards for claims handling 
as a result of these changes  the company experienced an increase in its average reported case reserves during accordingly  the company and its actuaries have placed more emphasis on methodologies  such as  paid loss development and incurred loss development adjusted for increases in its average case reserves 
the company s underwriting and other expenses increased to million in versus million in the primary causes for this increase were the increase in premium volume  and to a lesser extent  the need to increase the staff and systems at the insurance companies in order to monitor the larger operations of the company during and the expenses associated with the establishment of an office for general agency business in scottsdale  arizona 
partially offsetting this increase was the full year impact of the company s book of crop insurance  which typically has a lower expense ratio than most of the company s other businesses 
the company s interest expense for the year decreased to million versus million in the prior year 
this decrease in interest expense was principally caused by the retirement during of million of higher interest rate debt issued in connection with the restructuring in  which was partially offset by a million increase in the outstanding debt of the company during the company s net income benefitted from the recognition during the year ended december  of a deferred tax benefit of million  which offset taxes that otherwise would have been accrued and resulted in a net income tax benefit of million 
this net income benefit resulted from the release of a valuation allowance established for a deferred tax asset upon the company meeting the realizability tests for such asset under statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for income taxes  adopted by the company in january a valuation allowance was recorded for the full amount of the deferred tax asset at december  because the company had reported pretax losses from through although the circumstances that generated these losses were not indicative of operating income  management was uncertain of future earnings 
as of december   the company has reported ten consecutive quarters with pre tax earnings and the company has used all of its net operating loss carryforwards 
accordingly  management believes it is more likely than not that the company will realize a portion of the deferred tax asset 
the valuation allowance at december  primarily relates to capital loss items whose realization is uncertain due to insufficient carryforwards of capital gains 
the company s net income increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  because of the factors discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources the company has included a discussion of the liquidity and capital resources requirements of the company and the insurance companies 
the company parent only as an insurance holding company  the company s assets consist primarily of the capital stock of its subsidiaries  million in surplus notes issued by acceptance insurance and investment assets held at the holding company level 
the company s primary sources of liquidity are the receipt of dividends or other distributions from subsidiaries  interest payments on such surplus notes  tax sharing payments from its subsidiaries and net investment income from  and proceeds from the sale of  holding company investments 
the company needs liquidity primarily to service debt  pay operating expenses and taxes and make investments in subsidiaries 
the four domiciliary states of the insurance companies limit the payment of dividends and other distributions by such companies 
under these laws  the maximum aggregate amount of dividend payments permitted to be made by the insurance companies in without prior regulatory approval is approximately million  none of which has been paid 
in addition to dividends from the insurance companies  the company also may receive distributions from its non insurance subsidiaries which are engaged in agency  premium finance and claims service operations 
the company is currently a party to a tax sharing agreement with its subsidiaries  under which such subsidiaries pay the company amounts in general equal to the federal income tax that would be payable by such subsidiaries on a stand alone basis 
the company is also a party to a million credit agreement with a group of bank lenders  secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
the credit agreement provides for a three year revolving credit facility in amounts not exceeding million and a one year term loan facility in amounts not exceeding million 
interest is payable quarterly at a rate selected by the company equal to either the prime rate or libor plus a margin which varies depending on the company s debt to equity ratio and whether funds have been borrowed under the line of credit facility 
at december   the outstanding balance under the facility was million  bearing interest at 
borrowings under the facility were used to provide capital for the insurance companies and to repay other debt 
the revolving credit facility expires on july   and may be extended annually for additional one year periods with the consent of the lenders 
the term loan facility expires to the extent not drawn upon on july   and the balance due thereunder must be re paid july  the company is currently negotiating with its banks to extend the expiration date of the term loan facility or to increase the revolving credit facility to include amounts expiring under the term loan facility 
the company s history is one of continuing premium growth as a result both of acquisitions and other equity investments and of internal growth  and it intends to continue to pursue additional opportunities in the insurance business 
such growth requires capital  and as a result the company may seek additional debt or equity financing in the future to provide capital for the insurance companies  to fund further acquisitions or for other purposes 
there can be no assurance that the insurance companies will have access to sufficient capital in future periods to continue their growth and also satisfy the capital requirements of rating agencies and regulators 
insurance companies the principal liquidity needs of the insurance companies are to fund losses and loss adjustment expense payments and to pay underwriting expenses  including commissions and other expenses 
the available sources to fund these requirements are net premiums received and  to a lesser extent  cash flows from the company s investment activities  which together have been adequate to meet such requirements on a timely basis 
the company monitors the cash flows of the insurance companies and attempts to maintain sufficient cash to meet current operating expenses  and to structure its investment portfolio at a duration which approximates the estimated cash requirements for the payment of loss and loss adjustment expenses 
cash flows from the company s mpci and crop hail businesses differ in certain respects from cash flows associated with more traditional property and casualty lines 
mpci premiums are not received from farmers until the covered crops are harvested  and when received are promptly remitted by the company in full to the government 
covered losses are paid by the company during the growing season as incurred  with such expenditures reimbursed by the government within three business days 
policy acquisition and administration expenses are paid by the company as incurred during the year 
the company periodically throughout the year receives a payment in reimbursement of its policy acquisition and administration expenses 
the company s profit or loss from its mpci business is determined after the crop season ends on the basis of a profit sharing formula established by law and the cfsa 
at such time  the company receives a profit share in cash  with any amount in excess of of its mpci retention in any year carried forward to future years  or it must pay its share of losses 
the company recognized million  before private reinsurance  in profit sharing earned on the mpci business during in the crop hail insurance business  premiums are generally not received until after the harvest  while losses and other expenses are paid throughout the year 
changes in financial condition the naic has released its risk based capital rbc formula for property and casualty insurance companies 
the rbc initiative is designed to enhance the current regulatory framework for the evaluation of the capital adequacy of a property and casualty insurer 
the formula requires an insurer to compute the amount of capital necessary to support four areas of risk facing property and casualty insurers a asset risk default on fixed income assets and market decline  b credit risk losses from unrecoverable reinsurance and inability to collect agents balances and other receivables  c underwriting risk premium pricing and reserve estimates  and d off balance sheet growth risk excessive premium growth and unreported liabilities 
the insurance companies have reviewed and applied the rbc formula for the year and have exceeded these requirements 
the company s unrealized gain or loss on marketable equity securities and fixed maturities available for sale  net of tax  changed from a million loss as of december  to an approximate  gain as of december  such change was caused by lower interest rates which prevailed in consolidated cash flows cash flows from operations for the year ended december  were a positive million as compared to a positive million for the year 
cash flows from financing activities for were positively impacted primarily by the restructuring of the company s bank borrowings upon its entering into the credit agreement in july inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations
