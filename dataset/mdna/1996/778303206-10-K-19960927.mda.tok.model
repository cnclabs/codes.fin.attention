item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview variability of quarterly results 
the company s software product license revenues can fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending upon  among other things  such factors as overall trends in the united states and international economies  new product introductions by the company  hardware vendors and other software vendors  and customer buying patterns 
because the company typically ships software products within a short period after orders are received  and therefore maintains a relatively small backlog  any weakening in customer demand can have an almost immediate adverse impact on revenues and operating results 
moreover  a substantial portion of the revenues for each quarter is attributable to a limited number of sales and tends to be realized in the latter part of the quarter 
thus  even short delays or deferrals of sales near the end of a quarter can cause substantial fluctuations in quarterly revenues and operating results 
finally  certain agreements signed during a quarter may not meet the company s revenue recognition criteria 
consequently  the company could meet or exceed its internal estimates of aggregate contracting activity  but not be able to meet its internal estimates for revenues 
because the company s operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and a high percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed  a small variation in the timing of the recognition of specific revenues can cause significant variation in operating results from quarter to quarter

this increase was offset by a decrease in european software product license revenues of approximately  or  the increase in north american revenues was principally a result of increased demand for the company s renaissance cs manufacturing series  sales of which increased from fiscal s results 
the company believes this increase in demand was impacted by the final settlement of two significant lawsuits early in fiscal and a certain alleviation of customer concerns with respect to the company s financial condition 
fiscal decreases in european software product license revenues were primarily related to overall decreases in the european sales personnel during the year  especially in the united kingdom

in addition  customer concerns at that time regarding the company s financial condition  including resolution of an arbitration proceeding unfavorably impacted fiscal sales  particularly in the company s third fiscal quarter

as a percentage of total revenues  the company s international operations remained constant at in fiscal and  as compared to in decreases in total european revenues during fiscal were partially offset by increases in revenues from the pacific rim and canada 
fiscal declines in european revenues were primarily attributable to overall decreases in european personnel during fiscal  whereas increases in the pacific rim and canada were primarily a result of improved execution by the sales organizations in these locations 
fiscal increases in international revenues were primarily a result of improved execution by the company s new european management team put in place during fiscal revenues have been derived from a relatively large number of customers

there were no similar cost transfers between the two organizations during fiscal the decrease in fiscal related primarily to reductions in personnel related expenses associated with the sale of the pro fit division and other staff reductions  as well as decreased usage of outside consultants during fiscal to meet short term customer consulting requirements 
the company s gross profit margins resulting from consulting  maintenance and other services revenues for fiscal  and were  and  respectively 
the unchanged gross profit margin from fiscal to was a result of a decline in consulting and other services revenues  partially a result of the sale of the pro fit division in the first quarter of fiscal  offset by the declines in consulting and other services expenses discussed above 
the gross profit margin increase from fiscal to was a result of year over year decreases in consulting staff expenses due to reductions in consulting personnel during the second half of fiscal and all of fiscal software product license sales and marketing expenses 
software product license sales and marketing expenses decreased in fiscal over  and in fiscal over the decrease in sales and marketing expenses during fiscal were primarily due to of decreases in personnel related expenses  marketing programs and travel expenses from prior year levels 
also  fiscal results included approximately  of cost transfers related to consulting personnel temporarily working in the sales organization
