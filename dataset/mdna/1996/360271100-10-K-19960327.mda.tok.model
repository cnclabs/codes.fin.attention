employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions and no 
accounting for income taxes  which resulted in a net charge to income of million 
the corporation s income before the cumulative effect of these accounting changes  which is indicative of ongoing operations  increased million or in all ratios presented herein for reflect income before the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles 
the corporation continued to achieve an outstanding return on average assets roa  a widely used performance barometer within the financial services industry 
this ratio was for compared to for and for return on average shareholders equity roe  another measure of performance  increased in to from the level achieved in both and the increase in earnings in was driven by significant growth in both net interest income and other income  offset somewhat by related increases in noninterest expenses 
as a financial institution  net interest income is a major contributor to the corporation s net income 
during  net interest income increased to million compared to increases of and during and  respectively 
the comparative average balance sheets and net interest income analysis on page summarizes the components of the net interest income growth 
the increases in interest income and interest expense were due to both the growth in interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the increases in interest rates 
interest income increased million or during  reflecting the growth in interest earning assets as well as the increase in the yield on these assets 
interest earning assets increased million or during  after increasing million or during and million or during a significant portion of the growth during and is due to the october  acquisition of cpfc 
the corporation has generated significant growth in loans reflecting the strong economy in its markets 
loans increased million  million and million during  and  respectively 
these increases in loans were partially funded by decreases in investments including short term investments  of million and million during and  respectively 
the yield on interest earning assets increased to in from in the yield represents a decrease from in the changes in the yields reflect both the shift in the composition of the corporation s interest earning assets and the fluctuations of the interest rate environment 
the shift in the composition of the corporation s interest earning assets  with a greater proportion representing loans and a lesser proportion representing investments  has positively impacted yields  since loans generally earn interest at higher rates than investments 
the interest rate environment positively impacted the yield in the prime rate  a reliable gauge of interest rates in general  was at december  and however the average prime rate was for compared to for interest expense increased at a much greater rate than interest income during  increasing million or  reflecting both the growth in interest bearing liabilities as well as the increase in the cost of these funds 
interest bearing liabilities increased million or during  after increasing million or during and million or during while a significant portion of the growth during and is due to the october  acquisition of cpfc  the corporation has also been able to generate deposit growth through its competitive marketing efforts 
total interest bearing deposits increased million  million and million during  and  respectively 
these increases provided funding for loans 
the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased from for to for  after decreasing during the changes in the cost of funds primarily reflects fluctuations of the interest rate environment and the ever increasing competition for customer deposits 
the provision for loan losses for totaled million  compared to the and provisions of million and million  respectively 
the statement of income for does not reflect the addition to the allowance for loan losses of million as a result of the cpfc acquisition 
at december   the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans net of unearned income stood at  which is consistent with the levels of and registered at december  and  respectively 
the corporation s subsidiary banks continued their excellent net charge off record during for the year  the subsidiary banks recorded net charge offs of million or of average loans outstanding 
this represents an increase from the level recorded during  million or  and a decline from the net charge offs recorded during  million or 
in management s opinion  the allowance for loan losses of million  or of loans and times nonperforming assets at december  is adequate to absorb any foreseeable loan losses 
the detail of nonperforming assets as of december  and net charge offs by category for and is as follows nonperforming assets net charge offs in thousands real estate loans    commercial industrial loans   consumer loans  other real estate owned   total     nonperforming assets include all loans days or more past due as to principal or interest  nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned 
it should be noted that the great majority of the nonperforming real estate loans above represents residential real estate loans which  in the opinion of management  are adequately secured 
noninterest income was million for this represents an increase of million or over the total of million  which  in turn  was lower than the total of million 
almost all noninterest income categories increased during  reflecting the corporation s growth 
the decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in gains on sales of mortgage loans from the level as refinance volume virtually disappeared with rising interest rates 
investment management and trust services income reached a record level of million in  an increase of  or  following a increase of  or 
the growth during and was due to ongoing expansion and increased marketing of traditional trust services as well as the continued success of several innovative investment management products 
the customized cash reserve investment management product continued to grow as an important vehicle for companies  municipalities  and not for profit institutions looking to enhance the short term return on their invested funds 
likewise  the asset management account  which integrates personalized investment portfolio management with traditional commercial bank deposit and loan services  continued to attract new clients 
an expanded  full service k program was introduced toward the end of which should significantly contribute to trust revenue growth in service charges on deposit accounts increased  or for  after decreasing  or in the increase in is attributable to growth in the corporation s fee based deposits  as a result of both internally generated growth and the acquisition of cpfc 
the decrease in was also volume driven  since the corporation had not made significant changes in service charge pricing during the past few years 
product pricing is reviewed through a product review and development process in which all products and services provided by the corporation s subsidiary banks  both in terms of features and price  are reviewed on a rotating basis 
the corporation recently introduced revised fee schedules at certain affiliate banks in an effort to enhance fee income  while remaining competitive in its markets 
other service charges and fees increased million or during after remaining flat in other customer fees increased  largely from increased customer usage of debit cards 
fulton bank  the corporation s lead bank  unveiled a debit card during which continues to significantly enhance fee income as the program gains acceptance and is expanded to the market areas serviced by the corporation s other subsidiary banks 
mortgage servicing fees increased  due to growth in the corporation s servicing portfolio caused by continuing sales in the secondary market and the acquisition of the servicing portfolio from cpfc in the fourth quarter of the category of other service charges and fees also benefitted from certain nonrecurring items in  including the receipt of life insurance proceeds of  and gains on the disposition of other real estate of  investment security gains increased  or to a level of million for as a percentage of noninterest income  investment security gains represented  and during  and  respectively 
all of the gains realized during were generated from the sale of equity securities 
management continuously reviews the performance and quality of securities within the investment portfolio 
during  management concluded that several of the equity securities in the corporation s portfolio had market prices likely to decline in the near future 
the securities were sold  resulting in increased gains 
noninterest expense for rose million or from the total of million  after increasing only million or during the increase in noninterest expense primarily reflects the effect of the fourth quarter cpfc acquisition 
the largest noninterest expense increase occurred in salaries and employee benefits  which increased million or during increases of million  or  and million  or  were registered for and  respectively 
the increase reflects the growth in the number of employees  inflationary increases in salaries  and an additional bonus paid to all employees 
the number of full time equivalent employees increased from an average of  in to  in  an increase of 
while the number of average full time equivalents increased  the ratio of employees per million dollars of average assets decreased to 
in as compared to 
in this decrease was due  in part  to the acquisition of cpfc and the related integration of branches and backroom operations 
management continues to balance the minimal increases in staffing levels with the commitment to providing the superior service that customers have come to expect 
the additional bonus  which was paid to substantially all employees  cost the corporation approximately several items occurred during and which distort underlying trends 
during  as previously discussed  the corporation adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  which increased employee retiree benefit expense by  to million 
during  after concluding that major changes in the healthcare system through federal legislation were not imminent  and having conducted an employer peer group review of retiree health benefits  the corporation reduced the level of healthcare coverage which would be provided to future retirees 
the changes resulted in a significantly reduced cost to the corporation of  for  a  reduction over the million recognized in in addition  during the corporation accrued  for certain supplemental retirement benefit liabilities assumed from a merged institution 
employee benefits expense  particularly medical benefits  has been an area of management focus in recent years 
management will continue to monitor and study employee benefits with the goal of providing a competitive and supportive benefit package at a reasonable cost 
excluding the impact of the bonus  the supplemental retirement expense and the accounting change in  salaries and employees benefits expense increased by in and in net occupancy expense increased  or during  compared to a decrease of  or in and an increase of million or in the significant increase in reflects the cost of operating the eight remaining branches acquired from cpfc in  as well new branches opened during and during  the corporation accrued  for the estimated cost of remediation and monitoring of ground water contamination and  for the early termination of a branch lease 
the core results for each year may be obtained by factoring out these items 
for adjusted net occupancy expense rose  or as compared to an increases of  or for equipment expense decreased  or in  after increasing  or in and  or in the decrease in is attributable to tighter expense controls in this area during the year 
fdic assessment expense decreased significantly during million or as the bank insurance fund bif reached maximum funding 
the assessment rate for the majority of the corporation s deposits decreased from basis points to four basis points effective june  under the current insurance system  bank strength is measured on three factors asset quality  capital strength  and management 
premium assessments are assigned based on an institution s overall rating  with stronger institutions paying lower premium assessment rates 
as of january  and  each of the corporation s banking subsidiaries qualified for the lowest premium rate 
the fdic has reduced the assessment rate on bif deposits for the first six months of from four basis points to zero  with a minimum annual premium of  per covered institution 
this will result in a substantial reduction in the corporation s fdic assessment expense in in addition to its bif deposits  the corporation has approximately million in deposits that are insured by the savings association insurance fund saif 
these consist of deposits at great valley savings bank and deposits acquired from cpsa which have been distributed to the corporation s bank subsidiaries 
congress has been considering a one time surcharge on saif deposits to re capitalize the fund 
this surcharge  if enacted as presently proposed  could result in an additional expense of approximately million million net of tax 
the same proposal provides for the merging of bif and saif  and the reduction of fdic insurance premiums on saif deposits to the current bif levels 
if enacted  this proposal could reduce the corporation s fdic insurance expense by  annually 
special services expense  which represents the cost of data processing  increased  or during after remaining relatively flat during and the corporation has generally been able to control this cost by implementing and maintaining a common system for all subsidiaries under a corporate contract 
the increase is due to growth in trust operations and loans  resulting in larger transaction volumes and costs 
in addition  the corporation outsourced its student loan processing in  which increased this expense by approximately  other expenses increased or million during after increasing minimally during expenses in this category include stationery and supplies  postage  audits  telecommunications  pennsylvania shares tax  advertising  insurance  legal fees and goodwill amortization 
contributing to the significant increase during were goodwill amortization increase of  or related to cpfc acquisition which was effective october   stationary and supplies increase of  or due to increases in both volume and increased paper costs in general  and postage increase of  or due to increases in both volume and postage rates 
also included in other expenses are the noncash operating losses recorded by the corporation under the equity method related to its investment in affordable housing projects 
operating losses of million  million  and million  were recorded in  and  respectively 
other expenses during these periods were affected by shares tax related to denver national bank  which was acquired by the corporation in and merged into fulton bank 
during  the state agreed to a settlement which allowed the corporation to reverse  of amounts previously accrued 
during  the corporation received  in settlement of related claims 
income tax expense continues to increase both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of pretax income 
the effective tax rate was in compared to and in and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate reflects the reduction in the beneficial effect of tax exempt income 
income tax expense was reduced by million  million and million during  and  respectively  by federal income tax credits received from the corporation s investments in low and moderate income housing projects 
as previously discussed  the corporation adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes as of january  the application of this statement did not have a material effect on the corporation s tax provision in  or financial condition the corporation functions as a financial intermediary and therefore its financial condition should be analyzed in terms of its sources and uses of funds 
the table on page highlights the trends in the balance sheet over the past two years 
because annual averages tend to conceal trends and year end balances can be distorted by one day fluctuations  the december monthly averages for each year are provided to give a better indication of trends in the balance sheet 
all references within the discussion that follows are to such average balances unless specifically noted otherwise 
the corporation s assets continued to grow during  reaching the level of billion for  an increase of million or as compared to the rate of growth for can be attributed to the continuing loan demand throughout the corporation s markets that resulted in loan growth of approximately million or for the year 
this loan growth was funded primarily through a similar increase in deposits 
loans outstanding net of unearned income increased million or for  compared to the increase of million or 
the dramatic increase for reflects the approximately million in loans acquired from cpfc 
excluding these loans  the increase was 
the corporation s loan to deposit ratio increased slightly  from for to for fulton financial corporation average consolidated balance sheets december dollars in thousands assets cash and due from banks    interest bearing deposits in other banks    federal funds sold  investment securities    loans  including loans held for sale    less allowance for loan losses    net loans    premises and equipment    other assets    total assets    liabilities and shareholders equity deposits noninterest bearing    interest bearing    total deposits    short term borrowings    long term debt    other liabilities    total liabilities    total shareholders equity    total liabilities and shareholders equity    demand for consumer credit again provided a significant share of loan growth during  increasing million or 
as in  the dramatic increase was largely due to high demand for automobiles resulting in an installment loan increase of million or 
the corporation succeeded in establishing financing relationships with additional automobile dealers in its market areas 
also contributing to the increase in consumer loans were student loans increase of million or  credit cards increase of million or  and leasing increase of million or 
commercial loans and commercial mortgages continued to exhibit growth reflecting the strength of the economy 
these loans increased million or in  compared to an increase of million or in the increase was primarily in fixed rate categories  as customers sought to lock in the relatively lower rates in effect throughout the period 
residential mortgage loans outstanding decreased million or in  following a million or increase in after adjusting for the approximately million of mortgage loans acquired from cpfc during  the decrease was 
the decrease is wholly attributable to a decrease in fixed rate residential loans 
this portion of the residential loan portfolio was impacted by maturities and refinancings  as well as the corporation s general policy of selling newly originated fixed rate mortgages in the secondary market rather than holding them in the portfolio 
adjustable rate mortgage balances increased million or during  after increasing million or in after adjusting for the approximately million of mortgage loans acquired from cpfc during  this increase was million or 
investment securities increased million or during  compared to a decrease of million or during during both years  proceeds from maturities and sales were generally used to fund loan growth rather than reinvestment in securities 
the growth in investment securities during consisted of increases in mortgage backed securities of million  us government and agency securities of million and equity securities of million offset by decreases in corporate debt securities of million and municipal obligations of million 
in recent years  the corporation has increased the use of asset backed and mortgage backed securities 
these securities have provided superior returns over similarly rated conventional securities 
as of december   the corporation had mortgage backed securities in its portfolio with an amortized cost of million as compared to million at december  and million at december  the corporation s investment in equity securities was million amortized cost basis at year end  of which million represents holdings of stock issued by the federal home loan bank fhlb 
as of december   all subsidiary banks were members of the fhlb and therefore eligible for its funding programs 
the corporation continues to follow an equity securities investment strategy of seeking and maintaining long term investment positions in financial institutions which in management s view represent solid investment value 
the continuing decline in tax exempt municipal securities reflects the effect of the tax reform act of  which sharply reduced the tax benefit of the majority of tax exempt securities acquired subsequent to its passage and thus reduced the corporation s incentive to invest in them 
in may of  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
this statement  which was adopted by the corporation effective december   requires that all investment securities be classified as either i held to maturity  ii available for sale  or iii a trading security 
the corporation possesses both the intent  subject to credit impairment  and ability to hold each debt security in its investment portfolio to maturity 
management does  however  recognize the portfolio to be an important potential source of liquidity 
therefore at december   million or amortized cost basis of the portfolio was classified as available for sale 
this compares to million or classified as available for sale at december  debt securities are classified as available for sale upon purchase primarily based upon liquidity considerations 
all equity securities are classified as available for sale since the corporation does not engage in trading activities 
during  the corporation transferred securities with an amortized cost of million and a fair value of million from held to maturity to available for sale 
these transfers were made to address potential liquidity considerations 
at december   securities available for sale had a fair value of million and an amortized cost of million compared to a fair value of million and an amortized cost of million at december  the significant increase in the aggregate unrealized appreciation reflects the effect of decreasing interest rates on the market value of fixed rate securities within this portfolio  as well as the favorable performance of the corporation s equity portfolio  offset by the gains realized during at december   securities held to maturity had an aggregate fair value of million  million above their amortized cost  compared to an aggregate fair value of million  million below their amortized cost at december  short term investments  which include federal funds sold  money market investments and interest bearing deposits in other banks  have decreased significantly over the past several years in order to fund loan growth 
short term investments increased million during after decreasing million during noninterest earning assets decreased million or in after increasing million or in the decrease primarily reflects a million decrease in transaction balances maintained with correspondent banks and vault cash 
during  the corporation restructured its check clearing procedures and switched this function to a different correspondent bank  thereby reducing required cash balances 
the increase was due to the noninterest earning assets acquired from cpfc 
capital expenditures on premises and equipment totaled million during  compared to million and million during and  respectively 
in  the corporation completed the implementation of an automated platform system at fulton bank that provided each branch with the ability to more effectively and efficiently service customers and enhanced the ability to cross sell bank products 
the corporation anticipates that this system will be implemented at additional subsidiary banks over the next several years 
expansion of the branch office network of bank subsidiaries continued during the year 
capital expenditures in are expected to total approximately million 
during  the corporation continued its participation in affordable housing and community development projects through investments in partnerships 
equity commitments totaling million were made to four new projects 
the corporation made its initial investment of this type during and is now involved in projects located in communities served by its subsidiary banks 
the carrying value of such investments was approximately million at december  with these investments  the corporation not only improves the quantity and quality of available housing for low and moderate income individuals in its service area in support of its subsidiary bank s community reinvestment act compliance effort  but also becomes eligible for tax credits under federal and  in some instances  state programs 
asset growth has been funded primarily by deposit growth 
during  deposits increased million or to billion  exceeding the growth experienced in when deposits increased only million or after factoring out the increase attributable to the cpfc acquisition 
deposit activity in the last few years has been impacted by competition for consumer savings dollars from non banks and other financial institutions 
interest bearing deposits grew million or compared to growth of million or excluding the effect of cpfc savings deposits in savings deposits  including money market deposit accounts  decreased million or following a million or decrease during these decreases reflect the movement of customer funds into time deposit products  which the affiliate banks have aggressively marketed 
time deposits increased million or during after increasing million or in million or excluding the effect of cpfc time deposits 
negotiated rate jumbo certificates of deposit increased significantly during to million 
this represented an increase of million or over and follows the increase of million or during this growth is the result of continuing aggressive pricing by the corporation to obtain and maintain funding for loan demand 
significant growth in noninterest bearing demand deposit accounts continued during and  increasing million or and million or  respectively 
short term borrowings  consisting of federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase repurchase agreements  and treasury  tax and loan notes  decreased million or in after increasing million or in the net increase over the past two years is attributable primarily to the use of fed funds purchased to meet customer loan demand in the face of lower deposit growth  and the continuing flow of corporate funds from deposit accounts into repurchase agreements due to the availability of higher returns 
during and  repurchase agreements increased million or and million or  respectively 
long term debt increased million or during after increasing million or during during and  the corporation took advantage of fhlb funding programs 
fhlb advances represent the majority of the long term debt balances 
during  the corporation redeemed million of subordinated debentures due to the availability of lower cost funding 
shareholders equity continues to be an important funding source  providing a funding level of million  an increase of million or from the million provided in in spite of increasing dividends  the corporation maintained a strong rate of internal capital generation and in and  respectively 
this internal capital generation is dependent upon superior earnings performance in conjunction with a prudent dividend policy represented by payout ratios of for and for liquidity and interest rate sensitivity management the goals of the corporation s asset liability management function are to ensure adequate liquidity and to maintain an appropriate balance between the relative rate sensitivity of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
liquidity management encompasses the ability to meet the ongoing cash flow requirements of customers  who  as depositors  want to withdraw funds or who  as borrowers  need credit availability 
interest rate sensitivity management attempts to provide stable net interest margins through changing interest rate environments and thereby achieve consistent growth in net interest income 
liquidity sources are found on both sides of the balance sheet 
liquidity is provided on a continuous basis through scheduled and unscheduled principal reductions and maturities  as well as interest payments  on outstanding loans and investments 
liquidity is also provided through the availability of borrowings 
at december   liquid assets defined as cash and due from banks  short term investments  securities available for sale  and non mortgage backed securities held to maturity due in one year or less totaled million or of total assets 
this represents an increase from the december  total of million or of total assets 
liquidity is also provided by non mortgage backed securities held to maturity due from one to five years  which totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
scheduled and unscheduled principal payments received on the million at december  million at december  of mortgage backed securities held to maturity also provide liquidity 
the corporation s practice is to purchase mortgage backed securities with relatively accurately defined principal repayment schedules of short duration 
the loan portfolio provides an additional source of liquidity due to the corporation s ability to participate in the secondary mortgage market 
sales of residential mortgages into the secondary market of million and million in and  respectively  provided the necessary funding which allowed the corporation to meet the needs of its customers for new mortgage financing 
from a funding standpoint  the corporation has been able to rely over the years on a stable base of core deposits 
even though the corporation has experienced notable changes in the composition and interest sensitivity of this deposit base  it has been able to rely on the steady growth of this base to provide needed liquidity 
the corporation has access to significant sources of large denomination or jumbo time deposits and repurchase agreements as potential sources of liquidity 
however  the corporation has attempted to minimize its reliance upon these more volatile short term funding sources and to use them primarily to meet the requirements of its existing customer base or when it is profitable to do so 
each of the corporation s subsidiary banks are members of the federal home loan bank  which provides them access to fhlb overnight and term credit facilities 
at december   the corporation had million in term advances from the fhlb with an additional million of borrowing capacity including both short term funding on its lines of credit and long term borrowings 
this availability  along with federal funds lines at various correspondent commercial banks  provides the corporation with additional liquidity 
interest rate sensitivity varies widely with different types of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
at the short end of the asset spectrum are overnight federal funds  on which rates change daily  and loans  whose rates float with the prime rate or a similar index 
at the other end are long term investment securities and fixed rate loans 
on the liability side  jumbo time deposits and short term borrowings are much more interest rate sensitive than passbook savings and fhlb advances 
while the interest rate sensitivity gap the difference between repricing opportunities available for interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities must be managed over all time horizons  the corporation focuses on the month period as the key interval affecting net interest income 
this shorter period is monitored because a large percentage of the corporation s interestearning assets and interest bearing liabilities are subject to repricing or maturity within this period 
in addition  short term interest rate swings can be more pronounced and provide a shorter time for reaction or strategy adjustment 
the following shows the interest sensitivity gaps for four different time intervals as of december  daily adjustable days days days gap 

cumulative gap the corporation s policy provides for the month gap to be maintained between 
and 
the corporation is was positioned within this range throughout and as of december  capital resources the capital resources of the corporation as represented by the two major components of regulatory capital  shareholders equity and the allowance for loan losses  displayed continued steady growth during  increasing by a net of after increasing in the majority of this growth has been in shareholders equity  as the allowance for loan losses has remained flat due to improving credit quality and charge off history 
current capital guidelines attempt to measure the adequacy of a bank holding company s capital by taking into consideration the differences in risk associated with holding various types of assets as well as exposure to off balance sheet commitments 
the guidelines call for a minimum tier i capital percentage of and a minimum total capital of 
tier i capital includes common shareholders equity less goodwill and non qualified intangible assets 
total capital includes all tier i capital components plus the allowance for loan losses 
the corporation is also subject to a leverage capital requirement  which compares capital using the definition of tier i capital to total balance sheet assets and is intended to supplement the risk based capital ratios in measuring capital adequacy 
the minimum acceptable leverage capital ratio is for institutions which are highly rated in terms of safety and soundness and which are not experiencing or anticipating any significant growth 
other institutions are expected to maintain capital levels at least one or two percent above the minimum 
the following presents the corporation s capital ratios as of december minimum tier i capital total capital leverage capital due to its strong capital position  the corporation possesses the flexibility to meet opportunities for strategic expansion in both banking and non banking arenas 
in december  the board of directors approved a plan to repurchase up to  shares of the corporation s common stock through december  in addition  treasury stock is also purchased under certain other programs approved by the board of directors 
treasury stock acquired is used for various corporation plans  including profit sharing  dividend reinvestment  employee stock purchase and option plans 
treasury stock may also be used for stock dividends 
during and  the corporation purchased a total of  shares at a total cost of approximately million and re issued a total of  shares for the above mentioned plans 
there were  shares held in treasury as of december  in december   the board of directors approved a new plan authorizing the purchase of up to  additional shares of the corporation s common stock through june  the corporation has continued the practice of sharing excellent earnings performance with shareholders in the form of cash dividends 
during  cash dividends per share increased from declared in to for as of year end  the indicated annual per share cash dividend was
