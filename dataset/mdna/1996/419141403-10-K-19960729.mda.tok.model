item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company continued to invest its technology and finances to secure its position as a multi product  multi customer company focused on the development  manufacturing and marketing of special products from natural sources during its fiscal year ended april  for the three years prior to fiscal  substantially all of the revenue  profitability and cash flow of the company had come from the production and sale of paclitaxel to bristol 
in fiscal  sales to bristol amounted to only of total revenues  and in fiscal  no revenues from bristol were recognized 
final shipments of paclitaxel to bristol were made during fiscal under the terms of an amended contract which bristol chose not to renew 
the company was not profitable in fiscal and as plans were implemented to broaden product lines and enter new markets 
during fiscal  management implemented comprehensive plans for business growth 
through continued cost controls during fiscal  these plans could return the company to profitability late in fiscal these plans  particularly in the new product areas  anticipate certain revenue levels and minimal problems with production of the new products 
however  there can be no assurance of when profitability will be attained 
during fiscal and  the company invested its technical and financial resources to develop its four major product areas health care products  natural ingredients  technical services  and secondary forest products 
at the same time  management continued to analyze its cost structure and reduced costs to minimize operating losses by restricting salaries  benefits  and travel and controlling other specific expenses as appropriate 
these cost controls are expected to continue until such time as the company becomes profitable again 
in fiscal  as part of its dedicated effort to find new sources of revenue through business development activities with new customers or by acquisition  the company acquired all of the stock of shuster effective july  for approximately  in cash and notes plus a performance based earnout for meeting certain milestones over the next five years 
shuster is a consumer research and development firm and contract laboratory with headquarters in the boston area and another facility in the atlanta area 
see further discussion under technical services section 
the following is a discussion of the company s activities in its four product areas 
health care products pharmaceuticals on may   the company entered into a multi year  world wide and mutually exclusive supply agreement supply agreement with american home products  formerly american cyanamid company cyanamid  whereby the company will supply bulk paclitaxel to american home products 
on that same day  the company and american home products also entered into the r d agreement which called for the two companies to cooperate in the research and development of new products derived from naturally or synthetically produced taxanes 
the research and development program  which had an initial two year term  was funded by american home products 
this program  and its associated funding  ended in may the r d agreement called for the two companies to cooperate in a mutually exclusive manner in a research and development program funded by american home products which was designed to develop new products derived from naturally or synthetically produced taxanes 
during the two year term of the program  several taxanes were evaluated and submitted for in vitro pre clinical testing 
no patentable products have beeen identified by the parties at this time for worldwide development 
the r d agreement expired in may and was not extended by american home products 
american home products has the right to review any products derived by hauser from naturally or synthetically produced taxanes during the one year period after expiration of the r d agreement 
the company will supply the bulk paclitaxel to american home products on a two part formula price basis which includes an initial transfer payment upon transfer of the bulk paclitaxel and a subsequent final payment when american home products sells finished products which contain the bulk paclitaxel 
the contract calls for certain minimum purchase requirements which are subject to variation based upon the company s production costs which are expected to result in aggregate transfer payments of approximately  during the first three years 
the contract also called for a  payment upon execution of the agreements received by the company in may and advance purchase payments aggregating up to  contingent upon the following milestones being met the first filing of a product registration for a finished product anywhere in the world  first approval of such product registration  the first filing of such a product registration in the united kingdom  germany or france  upon approval of such foreign product registration  upon filing of such product registration with the fda and upon approval of such fda registration 
amounts otherwise payable to the company by american home products as final payments when finished products are sold will be reduced by as much as in any calendar year until such reductions aggregate advance purchase payments previously made 
during fiscal  the company produced paclitaxel for american home products development needs  including final product formulations and clinical trials 
while difficult to predict the exact timing  the company s management expects that approval to sell paclitaxel internationally will be obtained by american home products in the latter part of fiscal during fiscal  the minimum shipments of paclitaxel provided for in the supply agreement were made to american home products and continued minimal requirements for sales are expected to be fulfilled in fiscal in the year ended april   revenues under the supply agreement with american home products totaled  subsequent to april   american home products notified the company of its decision to maintain exclusivity of the supply of paclitaxel from hauser in the united states and canada 
in addition  american home products released its exclusive supply position in the rest of the world 
currently  the parties are negotiating terms of an amended contract 
subsequent to april   the company signed a non binding letter of intent with a major european pharmaceutical firm  for a three year supply agreement for gmp bulk paclitaxel in europe and eastern europe 
the agreement will be mutually exclusive to both parties  except for hauser s existing obligation to supply paclitaxel to american home products in europe and eastern europe  which obligation is pursuant to the company s existing contract 
the pharmaceutical firm intends to purchase from hauser all supplies of gmp bulk paclitaxel for its total market needs in europe 
the letter of intent is a non binding agreement subject to contract negotiation  due diligence and approval of the boards of both companies 
the company continued to produce sanguinaria extract for colgate during fiscal sanguinaria extract  a natural antimicrobial  is the key ingredient in colgate s viadent 
registered trade mark 
toothpaste and oral rinse products 
shipments totaling  were made during fiscal production will continue into fiscal as the company will ship sanguinaria extract to complete the current contract with colgate 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company entered into a research agreement with dovetail to work on a novel class of compounds which demonstrate potent anticancer activity in animal studies 
the company provided chemistry and manufacturing services for dovetail s proprietary compounds during fiscal the company will provide chemistry and manufacturing services for dovetail s proprietary compounds 
these compounds appear to reinforce the body s inherent ability to fight cancer by enhancing the body s immune system at low doses 
they may also amplify vaccine response to increase protection from future infections 
these compounds have been found to be non toxic  even at relatively high doses 
they have produced a dramatic anticancer response in early laboratory studies 
the company does not expect to recognize significant revenues on this research project in the foreseeable future 
natural ingredients nutraceuticals the company initiated the technical and business plans necessary to enter the nutraceuticals market during fiscal and made its initial shipment in the first quarter of fiscal total revenues for the year ended april  were  the term nutraceuticals is used to identify the broad range of natural  healthful products that are used to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake of important nutrients 
the united states market is estimated to be over million and is growing at over per year  according to industry resources 
the company s current products include liquid and dry herbal extracts of echinacea  valerian  siberian ginseng  panax ginseng  rosemary  goldenseal and chamomile 
management believes that the company s expertise in the production of special products from natural sources and its extensive regulatory experience position it well in this market area 
however  management is unable to predict the amount of future revenues from these nutraceutical products 
natural flavor extracts in july  the company and tastemaker  the fifth largest flavor producer in the world  renewed a strategic alliance for the joint development and manufacture of natural flavor extracts 
effective april   the company and tastemaker jointly agreed to dissolve the strategic alliance relationship 
the company will assume the responsibilities for marketing and sales of the natural flavor extracts in addition to their manufacture 
these and other natural flavor extracts will be marketed under the company s new brand name naturenhance 
trademark 
flavor extracts 
under the dissolution agreement  the company incurred no monetary liabilities  and tastemaker intends to continue to purchase the company s natural flavor extracts for use in flavors 
revenues and profits were well below expectations in fiscal due to lower than expected requirements from the final customers 
management intends to continue to invest in natural flavor extracts with the belief that these products can become significant to overall revenues 
natural food ingredients during fiscal  the company continued to develop and manufacture natural food ingredients products 
food ingredients are products which perform a function in foods  such as preservatives  stabilizers  colorants  antioxidants  and nutritional additives 
the company s objective is to build a quality line of products generating revenues and profits as a world leader in the development  manufacture and sales of natural food additives 
during fiscal  the company manufactured and began marketing rosemary extracts 
rosemary extracts have been used for centuries to inhibit oxidative deterioration of fats and oils  however  widespread use has been limited by excessive flavor and odor of rosemary extracts 
the company s patent pending extraction process minimizes rosemary s flavor and odor components while preserving its natural oxidative stabilization characteristics 
in addition  the company engaged in process development efforts on beta carotene  a new product for the company  which is sold into the healthcare products and food ingredients markets as a colorant  antioxidant and a nutritional supplement 
the beta carotene market represents million in annual worldwide sales  according to industry sources 
in fiscal  the company established a joint venture relationship with cyanotech betapharm with the intent to manufacture  market and sell natural beta carotene 
subsequent to april   the company received notification from cyanotech that it had decided to end its participation in the betapharm joint venture project 
cyanotech has decided to apply its resources to its own proprietary products 
the company believes that the results of the research over the past two years have been encouraging and the demand for natural beta carotene continues 
the company and cyanotech are working on an agreement whereby cyanotech will be available in a technical advisory role on the growing and harvesting of microalgae for the betapharm project 
the company is currently evaluating the possibility of continuing to pursue this product by itself or with another partner 
pursuant to the terms of the joint venture  cyanotech will grant an exclusive  perpetual  royalty free worldwide license of the cyanotech technology as defined in the joint venture agreement to make  have made  use and sell the products  in consideration for the payment of aggregate out of pocket expenses incurred by cyanotech on the joint venture project since august  estimated to be approximately 
the company intends to complete the pilot project and evaluate whether or not to acquire the cyanotech technology license and proceed with the final commercialization phase 
as construction and funding of the facilities are required for commercialization  it is expected that the evaluation will take approximately six to nine months 
effective july   the company will receive of the profits or losses of the betapharm project if it proceeds on its own 
minimal revenue from natural food additive products was recognized in fiscal but shipments are expected to increase in fiscal because of increased interest expressed by potential customers 
however  management is unable to predict the timing and amount of future revenues from natural food additive products 
secondary forest products the company acquired substantially all of the net assets of ironwood in may through its wholly owned subsidiary hauser northwest 
while revenues in fiscal of  were higher than fiscal revenues of  operating results were disappointing and below expectations 
ironwood s domestic christmas season had a negative impact on profitability when anticipated sales did not materialize 
moreover  ironwood s profitability was negatively affected through strong price competition in europe 
by maintaining only appropriate margin business  volumes and profitability were severely affected 
in addition  ironwood incurred higher than expected manufacturing overhead costs 
as a result  ironwood s operating loss in fiscal was  prior to the acquisition in may  per unaudited financial statements  the revenues of ironwood were  in fiscal year ended april  and it experienced a loss of  the acquisition of ironwood enabled the company to retain its bark harvesting capabilities in the northwest and incorporate that seasonal activity into ironwood s year around operation  thereby significantly reducing the cost of bark collection 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company completed its annual harvest of pacific yew bark for the manufacture of bulk paclitaxel 
in addition  the company is continuing to harvest bark during the summer months of to obtain enough bark to satisfy the production and sales requirements of the supply agreement for the next three to four years 
with the completion of this harvest  management believes that the company will no longer need to harvest yew bark in the future because cultivated sources will be utilized 
nursery grown  cultivated yew trees are believed to be the next source of paclitaxel and have proven to provide an acceptable raw material for processing 
management has defined important specific strategies designed to improve the profitability of ironwood 
during the next year  the company will focus on expanding penetration of the domestic wholesale market base  shortening distribution channels in europe and expanding its new dried and preserved tropical product lines 
with emphasis in these strategic areas  management believes that ironwood can return to profitability 
however  because of uncertainty in the market place  volatility in weather conditions and availability of raw materials  management is unable to quantify the timing and amount of future revenues and profitability of ironwood 
technical services the technical services division  which includes chemistry and engineering laboratory services and shuster  experienced revenue growth in fiscal of over the previous fiscal year  primarily as a result of the acquisition of shuster 
management believes that demand for technical services provided by the company will continue and expects this service group to continue to grow 
as part of its dedicated effort to find new sources of revenue through business development activities with new customers or by acquisition  the company acquired all of the stock of shuster effective july  for approximately  in cash and notes plus a performance based earnout for meeting certain milestones over the next five years 
shuster is a consumer research and development firm and contract laboratory with headquarters in the boston area and another facility in the atlanta area 
shuster  over a forty year period  has developed a reputation for delivering high quality services 
shuster has a clientele of nationally known companies and operates in areas that are complementary to the services provided by the company s own laboratories 
areas of expertise for shuster include food product development  household chemical formulation  nutritional supplement and pharmaceutical assay and formulation  microbiological assay  fda labeling and a significant number of related areas focused around consumer products 
the company believes that there are significant opportunities to leverage the compatibility and reputation of shuster with its own technical services capabilities 
shuster operates as a wholly owned subsidiary under its own name and key shuster executives will continue to manage the new subsidiary 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of revenues of selected amounts from the company s consolidated statements of operations 
percentage of revenues of selected operating statement amounts year ended april  revenues natural product processing technical services total revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative income loss from operations interest income expense writedown of other investment income loss before income taxes net income loss amounts may not total due to rounding revenues 
revenues increased to  in fiscal from  in the increase in fiscal was primarily due to the acquisition of shuster  which contributed  to consolidated revenues 
in addition  the company recognized revenues of  in fiscal from the sales of nutraceutical products  these products were not sold in prior fiscal years 
these increases were offset by reduced sales of bulk paclitaxel due to the cessation of the amended contract with bristol 
the company also recognized revenue of  in both fiscal years and for activities performed under the r d agreement with american home products 
revenues decreased in fiscal to  from  in fiscal primarily due to the reduced sales of bulk paclitaxel  which were recognized primarily in the first six months of fiscal  to bristol based on the cessation of the amended contract  offset by the shipments of paclitaxel to american home products pursuant to the supply agreement 
also  there were no bark revenues in fiscal pursuant to the amended contract with bristol as compared to  in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was partially offset by the inclusion revenues of  from ironwood 
fiscal was the first year ironwood was consolidated into the company s operations 
included in fiscal revenues from american home products is  the payment of which was received by the company at the inception of the supply agreement in june pursuant to the supply agreement  american home products agreed to pay  to the company for the right to terminate the supply agreement at its option during the first year which expired may  of its ten year term 
the company had no obligation under any circumstances to repay any of the  payment received 
revenues from american home products were  in fiscal  or of total revenues  and  or of total revenues  in fiscal there were no corresponding revenues from american home products in fiscal revenues from bristol amounted to  in fiscal and  in fiscal and constituted and of total revenues  respectively 
flavors revenues increased in fiscal to  from  in fiscal this increase was primarily due to increased market acceptance of natural flavor extracts 
flavors revenues decreased in fiscal to  from  in fiscal this decrease resulted primarily from lower demand from the final customers for natural flavor extract products 
revenues from secondary forest products in fiscal were  compared to  in fiscal  an increase of 
this increase was primarily the result of higher sales of domestic greens and the introduction of the dried and preserved product lines 
revenues in fiscal were  compared to  in fiscal this increase was the result of the company s acquisition of substantially all of the net assets of ironwood on may  for comparative purposes  unaudited revenues for ironwood prior to the acquisition were  in fiscal technical services revenues increased to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  primarily due to the acquisition of shuster which contributed  to consolidated revenues 
excluding shuster  technical services revenues grew in fiscal over the previous year 
the increase in fiscal was the result of a redirection and emphasis of efforts to revenue producing activities for outside clients including the expansion of laboratory services into the natural products market 
technical services revenues of  in fiscal increased as compared to  in fiscal this reflects a decreasing use of technical services personnel in paclitaxel activities and a redirection and emphasis of their efforts to revenue producing activities for outside clients 
gross margin 
gross margin in fiscal was of total revenues compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the reduction in fiscal is the result of revenue generating products in fiscal  including bulk paclitaxel to american home products  nutraceuticals  natural flavor extracts  secondary forest products and technical services  which all yield significantly lower margins than the sale of paclitaxel to bristol in prior fiscal years 
gross margins on current paclitaxel sales are low in anticipation of future royalties 
in addition  the company is incurring high overhead costs in relation to its current sales levels in anticipation of growth in other product lines 
the company also incurred a loss in fiscal of approximately  due to a contract amendment with a customer 
moreover  ironwood experienced a negative gross margin of approximately  in fiscal due to higher than anticipated manufacturing overhead costs and severe pricing pressures 
although gross margins will most likely remain lower than historical levels  management believes improved gross margins from current levels are possible as growth in revenues is realized  particularly in the new product areas  and production capacities are more fully utilized 
improving gross margins are a specific goal for the company in fiscal operating expenses 
research and development expenses were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  a decrease of 
gross research costs in fiscal  which included costs related to work for american home products under the r d agreement  which are included in costs of sales  were  the company continued its efforts in fiscal in new product development  particularly in the areas of paclitaxel extraction from cultivated sources  nutraceuticals and food ingredients products 
research and development expenses were  in fiscal the slight decrease in research and development costs in fiscal as compared to fiscal was related to the cessation of the bristol contract 
the company also performs  from time to time  research and development services related to potential pharmaceutical products under sbir agreements small business innovation research programs for which it is reimbursed 
during fiscal  the company completed work on artemisinin analogs for the national institutes of health 
the company intends to actively pursue research and development efforts and these costs are likely to increase in future periods 
sales and marketing expenses were  in fiscal compared to  an increase of  this increase results from the acquisition of shuster in july which contributed  to consolidated sales and marketing expenses 
in fiscal  sales and marketing expenses were  the increase in fiscal was due to the acquisition of ironwood  which added  to consolidated sales and marketing expenses 
general and administrative expenses were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal included in fiscal is  from shuster 
excluding shuster  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were  an increase of  as compared to the prior fiscal year due 
fiscal general and administrative expenses were up slightly in comparison to fiscal expenses because of cost reduction efforts offset by the addition of  of ironwood costs 
general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues increased to in fiscal from in and in fiscal in the fourth quarters of fiscal and  the company implemented further cost reduction programs and incurred  and  in severance costs as a result  respectively 
in addition  in fiscal  the company performed an evaluation of its production facility assets and concluded that certain assets should be redeployed in connection with the company s transition to a multi product  multi customer manufacturer of special products from natural sources 
as a result  certain remaining costs for assets being redeployed totaling  were expensed 
the company continues to evaluate opportunities to reduce general and administrative costs where appropriate 
interest income 
interest income was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal the decrease in fiscal is primarily due to the lower amount of funds available for investment 
the increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to an increase in availability of funds for investment and an increase in interest rates 
writedown of other investment 
in april   the company s investment in a development stage company was written down resulting in a loss of  the investment was liquidated in the first quarter of fiscal liquidity and capital resources general 
total cash and cash equivalents plus short term investments were  at april  compared to  including long term investments at april  the decrease is due primarily to expenditures for the harvesting of pacific yew bark  the purchase of shuster  the purchase of raw materials and manufacture of finished goods inventory for nutraceuticals and food ingredients products  and the funding of operating losses 
the company has a line of credit totaling  which expires in september and is used primarily for letters of credit related to raw material purchases 
as of april    was available for use under this line of credit 
the company believes that cash reserves  funds generated from operations and the line of credit will be sufficient to fund the company s operations through at least the next twelve months 
the maturities of the company s investments  which as of april  do not extend beyond one year  are staggered such as to allow the company to access the funds upon their maturation in a manner to allow the company to meet its obligations as they become due 
working capital 
working capital as of april  was  compared to  as of april  the decrease is primarily due to the use of working capital for the acquisition of shuster and the build up of noncurrent inventory 
property and equipment 
purchases of property and equipment totaled  in fiscal this was principally comprised of equipment required for the production of rosemary and paclitaxel and of equipment purchased as part of the acquisition of shuster 
backlog 
backlog of unfilled purchase orders was  as of april  compared to  as of april  backlog as of april  consist of unfilled purchase orders for nutraceuticals  flavors and sanguinaria products 
seasonality 
the company s operations have previously been subject to seasonality due to the concentration of bark collection revenues for bristol in the summer months when the bark is easiest to collect 
because of this concentration  total revenues had historically been higher in the first and second quarter of each fiscal year but  because of the lower gross margin associated with bark collection compared to processing of natural products  the gross margins in the first and second quarters had historically been lower than those normally experienced in the other two quarters of the fiscal year 
beginning in fiscal and beyond  although the company may be collecting bark for its own use  it will no longer be recognizing bark revenue 
thus the effect of this seasonal activity on the results of operations will be significantly diminished 
ironwood s results from operations are expected to be strongest in the third and fourth quarters because of the nature of the decorative forest products business 
additionally  the company has experienced seasonality in its flavors product line primarily in advance of the demand for summer beverages  in which most of its products are used
