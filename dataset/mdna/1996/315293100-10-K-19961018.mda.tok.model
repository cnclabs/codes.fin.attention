item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the historical and pro forma consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
general the partnership is engaged in the sale  distribution  marketing and trading of propane and other natural gas liquids 
the partnership s revenue is derived primarily from the retail propane marketing business 
the general partner believes the partnership is the second largest retail marketer of propane in the united states  based on gallons sold  serving more than  residential  industrial commercial and agricultural customers in states and the district of columbia through approximately retail outlets and satellite locations 
annual retail propane sales volumes were million  million and million gallons for the fiscal years ended july    and  respectively 
the retail propane business of the partnership consists principally of transporting propane purchased in the contract and spot markets  primarily from major oil companies  to its retail distribution outlets and then to tanks located on the customers premises  as well as to portable propane cylinders 
in the residential and commercial markets  propane is primarily used for space heating  water heating and cooking 
in the agricultural market  propane is primarily used for crop drying  space heating  irrigation and weed control 
in addition  propane is used for certain industrial applications  including use as an engine fuel which is burned in internal combustion engines that power vehicles and forklifts and as a heating or energy source in manufacturing and drying processes 
the partnership is also engaged in the trading of propane and other natural gas liquids  chemical feedstocks marketing and wholesale propane marketing 
through its natural gas liquids trading operations and wholesale marketing  the partnership is one of the largest independent traders of propane and natural gas liquids in the united states 
in fiscal year  the partnership s wholesale and trading sales volume was approximately billion gallons of propane and other natural gas liquids  over of which was propane 
the partnership s traders are engaged in trading propane and other natural gas liquids for the partnership s account and for supplying the partnership s retail and wholesale propane operations 
the partnership primarily trades products purchased from its over suppliers  however  it also conducts transactions on the new york mercantile exchange 
trading activity is conducted primarily to generate a profit independent of the retail and wholesale operations  but is also conducted to insure the availability of propane during periods of short supply 
propane represents over of the partnership s total trading volume  with the remainder consisting principally of various other natural gas liquids 
the partnership attempts to minimize trading risk through the enforcement of its trading policies  which include total inventory limits and loss limits  and attempts to minimize credit risk through credit checks and application of its credit policies 
however  there can be no assurance that historical experience or the existence of such policies will prevent trading losses in the future 
for the partnership s fiscal years ended july  and  and the pro forma fiscal year ended july   net revenues from trading activities were million  million and million  respectively 
selected quarterly financial data in thousands  except per unit data due to the seasonality of the retail propane business  first and fourth quarter revenues  gross profit and net earnings are consistently less than the comparable second and third quarter results 
the following presents the partnership s selected quarterly financial data for the two years ended july  fiscal year ended july  first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter revenues     gross profit     earnings loss before extraordinary loss     earnings loss before extraordinary loss per limited partner unit net earnings loss     reflects a extraordinary loss on early retirement of debt  net of minority interest of fiscal year ended july  first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter revenues     gross profit     net earnings loss    net earnings loss per limited partner unit results of operations fiscal year ended july  versus fiscal year ended july  total revenues 
total revenues increased as compared to the prior year  primarily due to increased retail propane volumes and increased sales price per retail gallon  partially offset by the decline in revenues from other operations net trading operations  wholesale propane marketing and chemical feedstocks marketing 
retail volumes increased by or million gallons  primarily due to the impact of colder weather during fiscal as compared to fiscal and acquisition related growth 
fiscal winter temperatures  as reported by the american gas association  were colder than the prior year and colder than normal 
colder winter temperatures also caused higher cost of product which in turn produced a corresponding increase in sales price per gallon as compared to the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in revenues from other operations to  is primarily due to a decrease in chemical feedstocks marketing revenues due to a decrease in sales volume and selling price 
both volume and price decreased as a result of decreased availability of product from refineries and decreased demand from petrochemical companies 
unrealized gains and losses on options  forwards  and futures contracts were not significant in fiscal and the acquisition of skelgas in may did not have a significant impact on fiscal revenues due to the expected low retail volumes in the fourth quarter of fiscal the partnership expects fiscal retail propane revenues to increase primarily due to the full fiscal year impact of the skelgas acquisition 
due to  among other factors  the uncertainty in both fiscal temperature levels and sales price per gallon  the partnership is unable to predict the impact of the skelgas acquisition on future revenues 
during the nine months ended april   skelgas sold approximately million retail propane gallons  however  temperatures were colder than normal 
gross profit 
gross profit increased as compared to the fiscal year  primarily due to a  increase in retail sales gross margin and to a lesser extent gross profits from other operations 
retail operations results increased primarily due to the increase in retail volumes 
other operations increased  mainly due to the increased activity of a non retail transportation operation 
this increased activity did not materially impact income from continuing operations due to the related increase in operating expenses 
chemical feedstocks is comprised of low margi sales  therefore  the decrease in revenues did not significantly impact gross profit 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased over the prior year 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased over the prior year due primarily to acquisitions of propane businesses 
o acquisitions of propane businesses 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased over the prior year due primarily to acquisitions of propane businesses 
interest expense and extraordinary loss 
interest expense increased over the prior year 
this increase is primarily the result of the mlp s issuance of  of senior secured notes in april the mlp senior notes  the increased net borrowings from the operating partnership s revolving credit loans during the first nine months of the year  partially offset by decreasing interest rates during the first nine months of the year 
the partnership expects interest expense to increase in fiscal due to the full year effect of the issuance of the mlp senior notes 
the extraordinary charge of  is due to the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs as a result of the refinancing of the  of floating rate debt previously issued by the operating partnership 
the partnership expects interest expense related to this debt to decrease by per annum in fiscal fiscal year ended july  versus pro forma year ended july  the pro forma year ended july  equals the sum of the predecessor s eleven months ended june  and the partnership s one month ended july   adjusted for the effects of the transactions consummated in connection with the formation of the partnership principally related to the reduction in interest expense resulting from early retirement of debt  net of additional borrowings 
total revenues 
total revenues increased to  as compared to  for the prior year 
the increase is attributable to acquisitions of propane businesses during november and to revenues from other operations net trading operations  wholesale propane marketing and chemical feedstocks marketing increasing to  the increase in revenues from other operations is primarily due to an unusually strong demand for chemical feedstocks driving increased prices and volumes 
these increases were offset by a decrease in revenues from existing retail operations due to warmer temperatures as compared to normal and to the prior period that have affected the majority of the operating partnership s areas of operation 
unrealized gains and losses on options  forwards  and futures contracts were not significant in fiscal and fiscal winter temperatures  as reported by the american gas association  were warmer than normal and warmer than the prior year 
the average degree days in regions served by the company have historically varied on an annual basis by a greater amount than the average national degree days 
gross profit 
total retail gallons sold increased to million as compared to million for the prior year 
this increase is due to sales contributed by acquisitions  partially offset by warmer temperatures 
despite the increase in sales volume  gross profit was essentially flat at  as compared with  for the prior year due primarily to the weather impact on higher margin residential sales 
other operations is comprised of low margin sales  therefore  the increase in revenues did not impact gross profit significantly 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased to  as compared to  for the prior year 
the increase is primarily attributable to acquisitions of propane businesses offset by a reduction in expenses of the base business primarily personnel and vehicle expenses as compared to the prior year 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to  as compared to  for the prior year due primarily to acquisitions of propane businesses 
net earnings 
net earnings decreased to  as compared to  for the prior year 
this decrease is due to acquisition driven increases in expenses  including interest expense  combined with the warm weather impact on gross profit 
liquidity and capital resources the ability of the mlp to satisfy its obligations is dependent upon future performance  which will be subject to prevailing economic  financial  business and weather conditions and other factors  many of which are beyond its control 
for the fiscal year ending july   the general partner believes that the olp will have sufficient funds to meet its obligations and enable it to distribute to the mlp sufficient funds to permit the mlp to meet its obligations with respect to the mlp senior notes issued in april  and enable it to distribute the minimum quarterly distribution per unit on all common units and subordinated units 
future maintenance and working capital needs of the mlp are expected to be provided by cash generated from future operations  existing cash balances and the working capital borrowing facility 
in order to fund expansive capital projects and future acquisitions  the olp may borrow on existing bank lines or the mlp may issue additional common units 
toward this purpose the mlp maintains a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for  common units representing limited partner interests in the mlp 
during the year ended july   the mlp issued  common units in connection with the acquisition of propane businesses 
the common units may be issued from time to time by the mlp in connection with the olp s acquisition of other businesses  properties or securities in business combination transactions 
operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended july   compared to  in the prior year 
this slight decrease is primarily due to the decrease in accounts payable offset by a decrease in inventories related to the decreased level of chemical feedstocks operations 
additional factors impacting cash provided from operating activities include an increase in other liabilities  offset by an increase in retail accounts receivable primarily due to unfavorable economic conditions 
investing activities 
on april   the general partner completed the acquisition of skelgas for a cash purchase price of  following the closing of the acquisition  the general partner i caused skelgas and each of its subsidiaries to be merged into ferrellgas and ii transferred all of the assets of skelgas and its subsidiaries to the operating partnership 
in exchange  the operating partnership assumed substantially all of the liabilities  whether known or unknown  associated with skelgas and its subsidiaries and their propane business excluding income tax liabilities 
in consideration of the retention by ferrellgas of certain income tax liabilities  the partnership issued  common units to ferrellgas 
the liabilities assumed by the operating partnership included the obligations of ferrellgas under a  million bank of america bofa acquisition loan 
immediately following the transfer of assets and related transactions described above  the operating partnership repaid the bofa acquisition loan principally fromcash proceeds of the mlp senior notes and borrowings under the operating partnership s existing acquisition bank credit line 
including the skelgas acquisition  the partnership made total acquisition capital expenditures of  including working capital acquired of  in fiscal this amount was funded by  debt assumed   cash payments   common units issued  and  in other costs and consideration 
during the year ended july   the partnership made growth and maintenance capital expenditures of  consisting primarily of the following additions to partnership owned customer tanks and cylinders  vehicle lease buyouts  relocating and upgrading district plant facilities  and development and upgrading computer equipment and software 
capital requirements for repair and maintenance of property  plant and equipment are relatively low since technological change is limited and the useful lives of propane tanks and cylinders  the partnership s principal physical assets  are generally long 
the partnership maintains its vehicle and transportation equipment fleet by leasing light and medium duty trucks and tractors 
the general partner believes vehicle leasing is a cost effective method for meeting the partnership s transportation equipment needs 
the partnership continues seeking to expand its operations through strategic acquisitions of smaller retail propane operations located throughout the united states 
these acquisitions will be funded through internal cash flow  external borrowings or the issuance of additional partnership interests 
the partnership does not have any material commitments of funds for capital expenditures other than to support the current level of operations 
in fiscal  the partnership expects growth and maintenance capital expenditures to increase over fiscal levels
