item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations overview on a quarter to quarter basis  the company s financial results have and will vary widely  due to seasonal fluctuations and market factors affecting the demand for logs  lumber and other wood products 
therefore  past results for any given year or quarter are not necessarily indicative of future results 
the industry is subject to fluctuations in sales and earnings due to such factors as industry production in relation to product demand and variations in interest rates and housing starts 
currency fluctuations affect the forest products industry when exchange rates spur log exports and drive up domestic log prices  and when a relatively strong us dollar encourages imports of lumber from competing countries 
the industry is also affected by weather conditions and changing timber management policies 
fire danger and excessively dry or wet conditions temporarily reduce logging activity and may increase open market log prices 
timber management policies of various governmental agencies change from time to time  periodically causing actual or perceived shortages in some areas 
these policies change because of environmental concerns  public agency budget issues and a variety of other reasons 
it is generally wtd s practice to curtail production at facilities from time to time due to conditions which temporarily impair log flow or when imbalances between log costs and product prices cause the cost of operation to exceed the cost of shutdown 
management believes that wtd s labor practices and compensation systems  as well as a relatively low capital cost in relation to production capacity  give it the flexibility to curtail operations and resume production as conditions warrant 
the company may also permanently close facilities that are determined to lack future profit potential under expected operating conditions 
market conditions in the housing sector deteriorated during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year and continued weak through the third quarter of fiscal year in addition  lumber imported into the united states from canada continued at high volumes and put downward pressure on lumber prices in the united states 
low lumber prices  combined with relatively high log prices  created losses for the company during each quarter of fiscal year in response to the generally weak market conditions  the company curtailed production at selected mills and reduced the level of operations at various times during the year 
by the end of the fiscal year  lumber prices had increased and operating conditions had improved enough to allow the company to run substantially all of its mills on a full one shift operation in march and april  raw materials raw materials comprise the majority of the cost of products sold by the company 
the company depends principally on open market log purchases for its raw materials needs 
wtd s log inventory policy is to maintain  where possible  a supply equal to three to four weeks of production 
during the s  public timber accounted for a significant portion of the supply used by the forest products industry in the pacific northwest 
on june   the northern spotted owl was listed by the us fish and wildlife service as a threatened species in oregon  washington and northern california 
this required the us forest service usfs and bureau of land management blm to develop plans to protect the owl s habitat  primarily in old growth timber  by limiting timber harvests on public lands in the pacific northwest 
this decision resulted from many years of controversy and litigation surrounding the harvest of old growth timber in oregon  washington and northern california 
since that time  new controversies surrounding ecosystem management  biological diversity  and other threatened species such as various strains of wild salmon  have caused the usfs and blm to limit further timber harvests 
in the marbled murrelet was listed as a threatened species and on may  the federal government designated almost million acres of forest in oregon  washington and california as critical habitat for the bird  which may result in further restrictions on timber harvesting 
as a result of these controversies  logging on public lands is greatly reduced from the harvest levels of the s 
state and federal policies regarding the appropriate level of timber harvests on public lands will continue to be challenged by industry and preservationist groups resulting in increased uncertainty regarding the availability of public timber 
during fiscal years through  the company operated most of its mills on a one shift basis  typically using logs purchased on the open market from industrial and non industrial private land owners 
the ability to maintain the present level of operations at the company s mills depends on a continuing supply of logs from these private sources 
the sharp reduction in available timber in the pacific northwest contributed to increased open market log costs since the late s 
however  log costs have stabilized  although at much higher levels  in the company s last three fiscal years 
the company has generally been able to obtain sufficient raw materials for its mills from private sources at prices which ensure a gross margin 
however  management anticipates that uncertainty associated with timber supply issues  combined with a continued lack of significant public timber sale activity  may contribute to further log price volatility 
log and lumber markets may continue to experience rapid changes in values due to actual and perceived market conditions  which may sometimes result in inconsistent relationships between log and lumber prices 
these changes could result in large swings in the gross margin on lumber produced 
the long term impact of this issue cannot be predicted at this time

comparison of to net sales for the year ended april  decreased million percent from the year ended april  this was principally caused by a percent decrease in lumber shipments  a percent decrease in chip deliveries and a percent decrease in lumber prices  partially offset by a percent increase in chip prices 
the reduced lumber and chip deliveries reflect the company s reduced production resulting from a weak lumber market during most of fiscal gross profit for the year ended april  was percent of net sales  compared to percent of net sales for the year ended april  lumber prices declined by percent from the year ended april   while the company s log costs increased by percent 
the higher chip prices were not sufficient to offset the effect of lower lumber prices and higher log costs 
management believes that a significant portion of the increase in log cost is attributable to the strength in chip demand 
despite the sharply lower production levels in fiscal  the company reduced its unit manufacturing costs by percent from fiscal this reduction resulted from steps taken to increase operating time without increasing payroll costs  and from continued focus on cost control 
the gross profit for the fourth quarter ended april  was  but there is no assurance that margin improvement will continue 
selling  general and administrative expenses in the year ended april  decreased by million percent from the year ended april  this decrease reflects reduced profit sharing bonus payments stemming from lower pretax profits  as well as the company s continued focus on cost control 
interest expense in the year ended april  was million below that incurred in the year ended april  this decrease was the result of scheduled reduction of debt 
in the year ended april   the company recorded a tax benefit equal to percent of its pretax loss 
in the year ended april   the company recorded a benefit of percent of the pretax loss  which included million as a result of certain elections made under internal revenue service regulations which allow it to utilize net operating loss carryforwards without annual limitation

comparison of to net sales for the year ended april  decreased by million percent from the year ended april  this decrease was mainly the result of a percent decrease in lumber prices  partially offset by a percent increase in lumber production  a percent increase in chip production and a percent increase in chip prices 
gross profit in fiscal was percent of sales versus percent of sales in fiscal lumber prices received by the company during fiscal were  on average  percent lower than in fiscal  while the company s log costs were  on average  only percent lower than in the prior year 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in the year ended april  decreased by million percent from those of a year earlier 
this decrease was the result of lower profit sharing bonus payments resulting from a lower level of pretax profits  as well as from ongoing efforts to reduce overhead expenses 
sg a expenses were percent of sales in fiscal versus percent of sales in fiscal reorganization credits in fiscal primarily reflect the reduction of certain valuation and holding costs reserves associated with the company s remaining non core assets 
reorganization credits in fiscal primarily reflect gains recognized on the sale of idle assets

interest expense in the year ended april  was million below that incurred in the year ended april  this decrease was the result of both scheduled and voluntary reductions of debt 
the company s tax benefit in fiscal was percent of its pretax loss  pursuant to the provisions of sfas number see note to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources at april   the company had net working capital of million  or million less than at april  the working capital decrease was primarily the result of operating losses  capital spending  scheduled principal payments and dividends paid on the company s series a preferred stock 
cash and cash equivalents decreased by million during the year ended april   to million at year end 
approximately million of cash was provided by operations 
about million was used to repay various debt obligations 
the company also paid million in dividends to holders of its series a preferred stock 
during fiscal  the company spent million for capital improvements to its facilities 
capital spending for the year ending april  is currently projected to be approximately million 
the company had no material commitments for capital spending at april  the company does not have a credit facility for working capital and therefore relies on cash provided by its operations to fund its working capital needs 
there is no assurance that such cash will be sufficient to fund the company s operations 
substantially all of the company s assets are pledged to secure various debt obligations 
the company s credit and security agreement dated as of november  contains certain covenants  including the maintenance of prescribed levels of collateral coverage as defined  tangible net worth  working capital and adjusted cumulative operating income as defined 
this debt agreement was most recently amended as of may   with respect to certain affirmative financial performance covenants 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
at april  the company s tangible net worth was million compared to million required by the covenant 
at that same date  the company s working capital was million  compared to million required by the covenant 
also  at april   the company s adjusted cumulative operating income was million  compared to million required 
the collateral coverage ratio at april  was percent  compared to a percent minimum required level 
the required level of working capital increases to million on july  and to million on july  the required level of tangible net worth decreases to million from july  through june   then increases to million at july   million at may  and million at may  the required level of adjusted cumulative operating income increases to million at july   million at january  and million at july  the minimum required collateral coverage ratio increases to percent at july   and to percent at may  improved operating results from those achieved in fiscal year will be necessary for the company to remain in compliance with its debt agreement 
during the year ended april   the company s adjusted cumulative operating income decreased by million while incurring a loss before tax benefit of million 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with the company s primary debt agreement  additional prepayments are required if the company s cumulative operating income exceeds certain specified amounts 
no such prepayment will be required for the year ended april  in connection with the may  amendment  the company has agreed to an additional prepayment computed at percent of quarterly net income 
the company has no floating rate debt  but the dividend rate on its series a preferred stock varies based on bank of america s prime rate in effect at the time the dividends are declared 
based on the prime rate in effect at june   annual preferred dividends would decrease by about million from the amount incurred in the year ended april  information included in this report on form k relating to projected environmental and capital expenditures constitutes forward looking statements
