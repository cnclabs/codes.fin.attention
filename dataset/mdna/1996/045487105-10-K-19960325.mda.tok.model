net interest income represents the difference between interest earned on loans  securities and other earning assets  and the interest expense associated with the deposits and borrowings that fund them 
interest rate fluctuations together with changes in the volume and types of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities combine to affect total net interest income 
the remainder of this analysis discusses net interest income on a fully tax equivalent fte basis in order to provide comparability among the types of interest earned 
net interest income on a fte basis reached million in  an increase of over the level of million 
net interest margin  or fte net interest income as a percent of total average earning assets  decreased slightly to in from the recorded for the strong growth in earning assets more than offset the basis point decline in net interest margin  creating the million increase in net interest income

the improvement in the corporation s earning asset yield reflects the higher rate environment in and the continued shift in earning assets toward higher loan composition 
the larger increase in the cost of funding the balance sheet is attributable to the continued shift in the mix of deposits to higher cost certificates of deposit and away from lower cost savings  now  and money market accounts

as the largest component of operating income  improvements in the growth of net interest income are important to the corporation s earnings performance 
growth in the corporation s net interest income during the past several years has primarily been a result of growth in the level of earning asset volumes and changes in asset mix toward higher yielding assets 
the corporation uses certain modeling and analysis techniques to manage net interest income and the related interest rate risk position see interest rate sensitivity 
the corporation seeks to meet the needs of its customers  yet provide for stability in net interest income in the event of significant interest rate changes 
downward pressure on the net interest margin is expected in the future as margins return to more historical levels due to compression in the interest rate spread and the potential shifting of interest bearing deposits to higher cost categories

factors that are critical to managing overall credit quality are sound loan underwriting and administration  systematic monitoring of existing loans and commitments  effective loan review on an ongoing basis  an adequate allowance for possible loan losses  and sound non accrual and charge off policies

this philosophy is embodied through the monitoring and reviewing of credit policies and procedures to ensure that all problem loans are identified quickly and the risk of loss is minimized 
non performing loans are considered a leading indicator of future loan losses 
non performing loans are defined as non accrual loans  loans days or more past due but still accruing  and restructured loans 
loans are normally placed on non accrual status when contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal payments 
additionally  whenever management becomes aware of facts or circumstances that may adversely impact on the collectibility of principal or interest on loans  it is management s practice to place such loans on non accrual status immediately  rather than delaying such action until the loans become days past due 
previously accrued and uncollected interest on such loans is reversed and income is recorded only to the extent that interest payments are subsequently received in cash and a determination has been made that the principal balance of the loan is collectible 
if collectibility of the principal is in doubt  payments received are applied to loan principal 
loans past due days or more but still accruing interest are also included in non performing loans 
loans past due days or more but still accruing are classified as such where the underlying loans are both well secured the collateral value is sufficient to cover principal and accrued interest and in the process of collection 
also included in non performing loans are restructured loans 
restructured loans involve the granting of some concession to the borrower involving the modification of terms of the loan  such as changes in payment schedule or interest rate

at december   potential problem loans totaled million 
the loans that have been reported as potential problem loans are not concentrated in a particular industry  but rather cover a diverse range of businesses  eg communications  wholesale trade  manufacturing  finance insurance real estate  and services

liquidity at banking subsidiaries is derived from deposit growth  money market investments  maturing loans  the maturity of investment securities held to maturity  the maturity or sale of investment securities available for sale  access to other funding sources and markets  and a strong capital position 
deposit growth is the primary source of liquidity at the banking subsidiaries 
total period end deposits increased million from to the corporation s overall deposit base grew an average of million or during deposit growth  especially in the core deposit base  is the most stable source of liquidity of a bank 
another substantial source of liquidity is the corporation s maturing investment securities portfolio  particularly those maturing within one year 
at december   the amortized cost of securities  both securities held to maturity and securities available for sale  maturing within one year amounted to million or of the total securities portfolio 
at the end of  the securities portfolio contained million at amortized cost of us treasury and federal agency securities available for sale  representing of the total securities portfolio 
these government securities are highly marketable and had a market value of million or of amortized cost at year end 
money market investments  consisting of federal funds sold  securities purchased under agreements to resell  and interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions  averaged million in compared to million in the funds provided from the maturity of these assets were used as a funding source for the growth in loans and securities  which generally have higher yields 
being short term and liquid by nature  money market assets generally provide a lower yield than other earning assets 
the corporation has a strategy of maintaining a sufficient level of liquidity to accommodate fluctuations in funding sources and will periodically take advantage of specific opportunities to temporarily invest excess funds at narrower than normal rate spreads while still generating additional net interest income 
at december   the corporation had million outstanding in short term money market investments  serving as an essential source of liquidity 
the year end amount represents of total assets compared to at december  the loan portfolio is also a source of additional liquidity 
the corporation has million of commercial loans and real estate construction loans maturing within one year and a steady flow of repayments in the mortgage and installment loan portfolios 
additionally  the corporation has million of loans secured by one to four family residential property that could possibly be securitized 
within the classification of short term borrowings at year end  federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled million compared with million at the end of federal funds are purchased from a sizeable network of correspondent banks while securities sold under agreements to repurchase are obtained from a base of individual  business and public entity customers 
the aggregate subsidiary liquidity resources were sufficient in to fund the growth in loans and the investment securities portfolio  and to meet other needs for cash when necessary 
as of december   there were no material commitments for capital expenditures  ie to purchase fixed assets 
however  the corporation is making investments in equipment and facilities to support its technology upgrades 
deposit growth will continue to be the primary source of bank subsidiary liquidity on a long term basis  along with stable earnings  the resulting cash generated by operating activities and strong capital positions 
shorter term liquidity needs will mainly be derived from growth in short term borrowings  maturing money market and investment portfolio securities  loan maturities and access to other funding sources 
liquidity is also necessary at the parent company level 
the parent company s primary sources of funds are dividends and service fees from subsidiaries  borrowings and proceeds from issuance of equity 
the parent company manages its liquidity position to provide the funds necessary to pay dividends to shareholders  service debt  invest in subsidiaries and satisfy other operating requirements 
dividends received from subsidiaries totaled million in and will continue to be the parent s main source of long term liquidity 
the dividends from subsidiaries  along with a million increase in net short term borrowed funds  were sufficient to pay cash dividends to the corporation s shareholders of million in  and fund increased lending activities of nonbanking subsidiaries of million 
at december   million in dividends could be paid to the parent by subsidiary banks without obtaining prior regulatory approval  subject to the capital needs of the banks 
additionally  the parent company had million of established lines of credit with nonaffiliated banks  of which million was in use 
of the amount in use  the parent company downstreamed the majority to the corporation s residential and commercial mortgage banking subsidiaries and leasing company for their use in funding loans and leases 
the parent company also has access to funds from the issuance of the corporation s commercial paper  although such funds are also downstreamed to the non bank subsidiaries 
commercial paper outstanding at december   totaled million 
the corporation s long term debt to equity ratio at december   was compared to at december  the increase is attributable to certain banking subsidiaries funding with the federal home loan bank at terms to maturity greater than one year 
management believes that  in the current economic environment  the corporation s subsidiary and parent company liquidity positions are adequate 
there are no known trends nor any known demands  commitments  events or uncertainties that will result or are reasonably likely to result in a material increase or decrease in the corporation s liquidity 
interest rate sensitivity interest rate risk is the exposure to a bank s earnings and capital arising from changes in future interest rates 
all banks assume interest rate risk as an integral part of normal banking operations 
the management of interest rate risk includes four components policy statements  risk limits  risk measurement and reporting procedures 
an important responsibility of the asset liability committee alco of each subsidiary bank is the management of risks associated with changing interest rates  changing asset and liability mixes  and their impact on earnings 
these alcos  in turn  operate under the advisory policy guidelines on interest rate sensitivity set by the corporation s alco 
the sensitivity of net interest income to market rate changes is evaluated regularly by the corporation to determine the effectiveness of interest rate risk management 
interest rate sensitivity analysis can be performed in several different ways 
the traditional method of measuring interest sensitivity is called gap analysis 
gap analysis is used to identify mismatches in the repricing of assets and liabilities within specified periods of time or interest sensitivity gaps 
for all assets and liabilities repriced within one year  the ratio of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities was at december  as presented  this traditional gap analysis does not accurately reflect the corporation s true rate sensitivity position 
the categories of savings  now  and money market accounts have been included in the days category for this gap analysis 
while these accounts are contractually short term in nature  it is management s experience that repricing occurs over a longer period of time 
the year end liability sensitive position would tend to provide favorable short term effects on earnings during periods of declining rates while rising rates would tend to affect net interest income unfavorably over the short run 
the corporation uses simulation modeling results that incorporate the dynamics of balance sheet and interest rate changes and reflect the related impact on net interest income over a specified time horizon 
the corporation is continually reviewing its interest rate risk position and modifying its strategies based upon simulation projections under various interest rate levels 
additionally  the corporation may enter into interest rate swap agreements to assist in managing interest rate risk 
management s philosophy is to maintain an appropriate rate sensitive asset and liability position to provide for stability in earnings in the event of significant interest rate changes 
the corporation believes that it has an effective process for managing interest rate risk

while these accounts are contractually short term in nature  it is management s experience that repricing occurs over a longer period of time

cash dividends have increased at a compounded rate during the past five years 
the adequacy of the corporation s capital is regularly reviewed to ensure that sufficient capital is available for current and future needs and is in compliance with regulatory guidelines 
the assessment of overall capital adequacy depends on a variety of factors  including asset quality  liquidity  stability of earnings  changing competitive forces  economic conditions in markets served and strength of management 
as of december  and  the corporation s tier risk based capital ratios  total risk based capital tier and tier ratios and tier leverage ratios were well in excess of regulatory requirements 
management of the corporation expects to continue to exceed the minimum standards in the future 
similar capital guidelines are also required of the individual banking subsidiaries of the corporation 
at december  and  each banking subsidiary exceeded the minimum ratios for tier capital  total capital and the tier leverage ratio

the shares repurchased would be available in connection with the corporation s employee incentive plans and for other corporate purposes 
shares repurchased are held as treasury stock and  accordingly  are accounted for as a reduction of stockholders equity 
the corporation purchased  of its common shares in and  in management believes that a strong capital position is necessary to take advantage of opportunities for profitable geographic and product expansion  and to provide depositor and investor confidence 
the corporation s capital level remains strong  but must also be maintained at an appropriate level that provides the opportunity for a superior return on the capital employed 
management actively reviews capital strategies for the corporation and each of its subsidiaries to ensure that capital levels are appropriate based on the perceived business risks  future growth opportunities  industry standards  and regulatory requirements

 accounting for mortgage servicing rights 
sfas  an amendment of statement  requires the recognition of rights to service loans for others as separate assets  however those servicing rights are acquired 
sfas also requires that a mortgage banking enterprise assess its capitalized servicing rights for impairment based on the fair value of those rights  using a disaggregated approach for mortgage servicing rights capitalized after adoption of the new standard 
mortgage servicing rights are amortized on an accelerated basis over the estimated period of net servicing revenue 
adjustments to reduce amortized cost to estimated fair value are included in noninterest income or noninterest expense  as appropriate 
the corporation adopted sfas on january  management believes that the impact of adoption will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements of the corporation 
in october  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which is effective in the statement requires that a fair value based method be used to value employee compensation plans that include stock based awards
