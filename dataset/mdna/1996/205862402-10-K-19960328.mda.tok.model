liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately  short term investments of approximately  and working capital of approximately  the company believes that its existing working capital  together with funds generated from operations  will be sufficient to provide for its planned operations for the foreseeable future 
the company regularly examines opportunities for strategic acquisitions of other companies or lines of business  and anticipates that it may from time to time issue additional debt and or equity securities either as direct consideration for such acquisitions or to raise additional funds to be used in whole or in part in payment for acquired securities or assets 
the issuance of such securities can be expected to have a dilutive impact on the company s shareholders  and there can be no assurance as to whether or when any acquired business would contribute positive operating results commensurate with the associated acquisition cost 
the company s liquidity and capital resources have not been  and are not anticipated to be  materially affected by restrictions pertaining to the ability of its subsidiaries in israel to pay dividends or by withholding taxes associated with any such dividend payments 
cash dividends paid by an israeli corporation to foreign residents are subject to withholding of israeli income tax at source at rates of up to  depending on the particular facilities that have generated the earnings that are the source of the dividends 
certain trends and uncertainties the industries in which the company is principally involved are highly competitive and characterized by frequent technological and market changes 
the voice processing and message management industry has undergone consolidation in recent periods  as a result of corporate acquisitions and attrition 
in addition  the industry has experienced a continuing evolution of product offerings and alternatives for delivery of services 
these trends have affected and may be expected to have a significant continuing influence on conditions in the industry  although the impact on the industry generally and on the company s position in the industry cannot be predicted with assurance 
significant changes in the industry make planning decisions more difficult and increase the risk inherent in the planning process 
the market for telecommunications monitoring systems is also in a period of significant transition 
budgetary constraints  uncertainties resulting from the introduction of new technologies in the telecommunications environment and shifts in the pattern of government expenditures resulting from geopolitical events have increased uncertainties in the market  resulting in certain instances in the attenuation of government procurement programs beyond their originally expected performance periods and an increased incidence of delay  cancellation or reduction of planned projects 
competitive conditions in this sector have also been affected by the efforts of government contractors  particularly developers and integrators of technology products  to redirect their marketing strategies and product plans in reaction to cut backs in their traditional areas of focus  resulting in an increase in the number of competitors and the range of products offered in response to particular requests for proposals 
the lack of predictability in the timing and scope of government procurements have similarly made planning decisions more difficult and have increased the associated risks 
the company has historically derived a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from a relatively small number of contracts for large system installations with customers in both the commercial and government sectors 
while the growth of the company s business has reduced its dependence on any specific customers  it continues to emphasize large capacity systems in its product development and marketing strategies 
contracts for large installations typically involve a lengthy and complex bidding and selection process  and the ability of the company to obtain particular contracts is inherently difficult to predict 
the company believes that opportunities for large installations will continue to grow in both its commercial and government markets  and intends to continue to expand its research and development  manufacturing  sales and marketing and product support capabilities in anticipation of such growth 
however  the timing and scope of these opportunities and the pricing and margins associated with any eventual contract award are difficult to forecast  and may vary substantially from transaction to transaction 
the company s future operating results may accordingly exhibit a higher degree of volatility than the operating results of other companies in its industries that have adopted different strategies  and than the company has experienced in prior periods 
although the company is actively pursuing a number of significant procurement opportunities in the united states and internationally  both the timing of any eventual procurements and the probability of the company s receipt of significant contract awards are uncertain 
the degree of dependence by the company on large orders  and the investment required to enable the company to perform such orders  without assurance of continuing order flow from the same customers and predictability of gross margins on any future orders  increase the risk associated with its business 
the company has significantly increased its expenditures in all areas of its operations during recent periods  including the areas of research and development and marketing and sales  and the company plans to further increase these expenditures during the increase in research and development expenditures reflects the company s concentration on enhancing the range of features and capabilities of its existing product lines and developing new generations of its products 
the company believes that these efforts are essential for the long and short term competitiveness of its product offerings and for positioning itself to participate in future growth opportunities in both the commercial and government sectors 
the increase in sales and marketing expenditures primarily results from the company s decision to expand its activities and direct presence in a number of world markets 
the company s costs of operations have also been affected by increases in the cost of its operations in israel  resulting both from general inflation and increases in the cost of attracting and retaining qualified scientific  engineering and technical personnel in israel  where the demand for such personnel is growing rapidly with the expansion of technology based industries in that country 
the increase in these costs in recent periods has not been offset by proportional devaluation of the israeli shekel against the us dollar  and accordingly has had a negative impact on the company s overall results of operations 
the company currently derives a majority of its total revenues from sales to customers outside of the united states 
international transactions involve particular risks  including political decisions affecting tariffs and trade conditions  rapid and unforeseen changes in economic conditions in individual countries  turbulence in foreign currency and credit markets  and increased costs resulting from lack of proximity to the customer 
volatility in international currency exchange rates may have a significant impact on the company s operating results to the extent that it is unable to completely hedge the exchange rate risk of long term contracts denominated in foreign currencies  or by the cost of such hedging 
the trading price of the company s shares may be affected by the factors noted above as well as prevailing economic and financial trends and conditions in the public securities markets 
during recent periods  share prices of companies in technology and government contracting businesses  and particularly smaller and medium sized publicly traded companies such as the company  have exhibited a high degree of volatility 
shortfalls in revenues or earnings from the levels anticipated by the public markets could have an immediate and significant effect on the trading price of the company s shares in any given period 
such shortfalls may result from events that are beyond the company s immediate control  can be unpredictable and  since a significant proportion of the company s sales during each fiscal quarter tend to occur in the latter stages of the quarter  may not be discernible until the end of a financial reporting period  which may contribute to the volatility of the trading value of its shares regardless of the company s long term prospects 
the trading price of the company s shares may also be affected by developments  including reported financial results and fluctuations in trading prices of the shares of other publicly held companies in the voice processing industry  which may not have any direct relationship with the company s business or prospects
