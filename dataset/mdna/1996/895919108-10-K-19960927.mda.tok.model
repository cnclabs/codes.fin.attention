the company plans to continuously introduce new and higher performance gui accelerators  graphics controller and multimedia products which it will seek to sell to existing customers as well as new customers in asia  north america and europe 
the company s future success depends upon the company successfully introducing these and other new products on a regular and timely basis and upon those products meeting customer requirements 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully complete the development of new products or to commence shipments of new products in a timely manner  or that product specifications will not change during the development period 
in addition  even if successfully developed and shipped  there can be no assurance that new products described above will be successful in the marketplace 
gross margin trident s gross margin remained constant at in fiscal and fiscal gross margins were generally higher in because of the high percentage of sales of gui accelerators with higher gross margins and a relative stable pricing environment for all products because of industry supply constraints 
however  the increase in gross margin for the fiscal year was offset by a million lower cost or market charge to inventory in the fourth quarter of fiscal which reduced gross margins for that quarter to 
gross margin increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in gross margin during the year was primarily the result of volume shipments of new gui accelerator products with higher gross margins  reduction in the manufacturing costs of certain svga products and lower per unit overhead cost associated with higher unit volumes 
the company believes that it is common for the prices of high technology products to decline over time  as availability and competition increase and new  advanced products are introduced 
the company expects asps of existing products to continue to decline  although average asps may remain constant or increase as a result of introductions of new higher performance products often with additional functionality 
the company s strategy is to maintain gross margins through the introduction of new products which have higher margins and the reduction in manufacturing costs accomplished through the company s custom design methodology and migration to new process technology  and by taking advantage of the economies of scale of volume production 
as a result  the company depends upon the success of new product development and the timely introduction of new products  as well as upon the success of its manufacturing cost reduction efforts 
there can be no assurance that the company can successfully or timely develop and introduce new products or that it can successfully reduce manufacturing costs 
research and development research and development expenditures increased to million from million and million in fiscal  and  respectively

future results  forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements regarding expected increases in sales to system manufacturers  expected increases in sales and marketing personnel  expected increases in research and development and general and administrative expenses  trends in the graphics marketplace and the introduction of new technologies in the company s products 
actual results could vary significantly from those expected by the company 
the factors that could affect actual results include those specified below  as well as those specifically identified elsewhere in this report 
the company has experienced fluctuations in its operating results in the past and anticipates such fluctuations in the future 
these fluctuations have been caused by a variety of factors  including seasonal customer demand particularly during the summer when sales of pcs have traditionally been slower  the timing of new product introductions  the acceptance of new products  competitive pressures on average selling prices  the availability of foundry and assembly capacities and changes in the mix of products sold 
the company s prior performance should not be presumed to be an accurate indicator of future performance 
future results will depend substantially on whether the company can timely bring new products to market  and upon the acceptance of those products 
operating results would be adversely affected by a downturn in the market for desktop or notebook pcs  order cancellations or order rescheduling 
because the company is continuing to increase its operating expenses for personnel and new product development  the company would be adversely affected if its sales did not correspondingly increase 
the company s future operating results also may be affected by various factors which are beyond the company s control 
these include adverse changes in general economic conditions  political instability  governmental regulation or intervention affecting the personal computer industry  government regulation resulting from us foreign and trade policy  and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates particularly in relation to the us dollar and asian currencies 
because the company s customers distribute their products worldwide  changes in the global graphics market place  such as the shift in market share from asian clone makers to leading north american systems manufacturers  have affected and will continue to affect the company s operating results 
furthermore  the company s operating results will fluctuate with changes in the asian economies  particularly those of taiwan and hong kong  since the company s revenues have been and are expected to be generated primarily from customers in asia 
the market for graphics controllers has become increasingly competitive  and the company s results could be adversely affected by the actions of existing or future competitors  including the development of new technologies  the incorporation of graphics functionality into other components and claims by third parties of infringement of patent or similar intellectual property rights 
the company currently relies on several independent foundries to manufacture its products either in finished form or wafer form 
to the extent a foundry terminates its relationship with the company or should the company s supply from a foundry be interrupted or terminated for any other reason  such as a natural disaster  the company may not have a sufficient amount of time to replace the supply of products manufactured by that foundry 
while the company has made significant investments to secure foundry capacity  there can be no assurance that the company will obtain sufficient foundry capacity to meet customer demand in the future  particularly if that demand should increase 
the company is continuously evaluating potential new sources of supply 
however  the qualification process and the production ramp up for additional foundries has in the past taken  and could in the future take  longer than anticipated 
there can be no assurance that capacity from current foundries and new foundry sources will be available and will satisfy the company s requirements on a timely basis or at acceptable quality or per unit prices 
the company s products are assembled and tested by several independent subcontractors 
the company s reliance on independent assembly and testing houses to provide these services involves a number of risks  including the absence of guaranteed capacity and reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance and costs 
constraints or delays in the supply of the company s products  whether because of capacity constraints  unexpected disruptions at the foundries or assembly or testing houses  delays in obtaining additional production at existing foundries or in obtaining production from new foundries  shortages of raw materials  or other reasons  could result in the loss of customers and other material adverse effects on the company s operating results  including effects that may result should the company be forced to purchase products from higher cost foundries or pay expediting charges to obtain additional supply in a timely manner 
the market price of the company s common stock has been  and may continue to be  extremely volatile 
factors such as new product announcements by the company or its competitors  quarterly fluctuations in the company s operating results and general conditions in the graphics controller market may have a significant impact on the market price of the company s common stock 
these conditions  as well as factors which generally affect the market for stocks of high technology companies  could cause the price of the company s stock to fluctuate substantially over short periods 
the company has recently experienced a period of significant growth  which has placed  and could continue to place  a significant strain on trident s limited personnel and other resources 
the company s ability to manage any further growth  should it occur  would require significant expansion of its research and development and marketing and sales capabilities 
in particular  the sale and distribution of products to numerous large system manufacturers in diverse markets and the requirements of such manufacturers for design support would place substantial demands on trident s research and development and sales functions 
in addition  the company s ability to manage any further growth  should it occur  would depend upon its ability to manage and expand its foundry relationships 
the failure of trident s management to effectively expand these functions consistent with any growth which may occur could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   the company s principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million 
cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was mainly due to profitable operations  adjustment of non cash expenses and expansion of vendor credit  offset by increased requirements for working capital due to increases in accounts receivable  inventory and prepaid expenses and other current assets 
cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was mainly due to profitable operations  adjustment of non cash expenses  increase in the income taxes payable in foreign operations  and the increase of accrued liabilities  offset by increased requirements for working capital due to the increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in accounts payable 
cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was mainly due to profitable operations  adjustment of non cash expenses  expanding vendor credit and refund of income taxes  increase in the income taxes payable in foreign operations  and the increase of accrued liabilities including the accrual for legal fees  offset by increased requirements for working capital due to increases in accounts receivable and inventory 
capital expenditures in fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the company expects to spend approximately million on additions to property and equipment during fiscal during fiscal the company issued  shares of common stock and generated million of cash 
during fiscal the company issued  shares of common stock and generated million of cash 
in order to obtain a supply of wafers sufficient to meet anticipated increased demand  and especially to obtain wafers manufactured using advanced process technologies  the company entered into an agreement in june with taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc  one of the company s current foundries  under which the company is committed to purchase and tsmc is committed to provide a certain number of wafers each year through december  in addition  the company has the option to purchase an additional amount of wafers each year during the period 
the company made a prepayment to tsmc of million in august in august the company also entered into a joint venture agreement with united microelectronics corporation umc  under which the company is committed to invest a certain amount of new taiwan dollars currently equivalent to approximately us million over the next three years for certain equity ownership in a joint ventures with umc and other venture partners to establish a new foundry 
under the agreement  the new foundry guaranties to trident a certain percentage of its total wafer supply 
the company made the first payment amounting to us million in january the remaining committed equity contributions during calendar years and are currently equal to approximately us million and us million 
these investments with tsmc and umc are intended to secure capacity so that the company can meet expected increased demand  should it occur  and are an investment in the future of trident 
however  there are certain risks associated with these methods including the ability of the company to utilize the capacity for which it has made substantial investments and the inability of umc together with its partners to successfully build the new foundry 
these agreements and the risks associated with these and other foundry relationships are described under the caption business manufacturing 
the company will continue to consider possible transactions to secure additional foundry capacity when circumstances warrant 
the aforementioned agreements with tsmc and umc have utilized a significant amount of the company s available funds  however the company believes its current resources are sufficient to meet its needs for at least the next twelve months 
the company regularly considers transactions to finance its activities  including debt and equity offerings and new credit facilities or other financing transaction 
inventory increased during fiscal to a level of million at year end compared to million at the end of fiscal reflecting the increased deliveries from foundries during the third fiscal quarter of fiscal in part to support the company s increased sales level  and in part due to higher than expected yields 
the increased inventory was primarily work in process of products which are currently shipping in high volume 
the company took a million lower cost or market charge to inventory during the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal while the company believes that this charge sufficiently protects the company from the risk that this inventory will not be sold at normal gross margins  there is no assurance that prices might not fall more than anticipated  requiring further charges or that similar charges might not be required as to other company products in the future 
in may  the company entered into a million unsecured revolving credit line with a bank which expires on december  of which no amounts are outstanding 
the availability of the credit facility depends upon the company meeting certain financial ratios and operating results
