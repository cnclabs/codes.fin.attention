item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion presents our past results and our expectations for the near term future 
the supplementary financial information and consolidated financial statements and related notes  all of which are integral parts of the following analysis of our results and our financial position  are incorporated by reference from the corporation s annual report to shareholders  pages  and through net income amounted to million in compared with million in and million in net income in reflected a net charge of million after taxes related to an agreement for the settlement of asbestos related litigation as well as the corporation s decision to exercise its option to commute an unrelated medical malpractice reinsurance agreement 
net income in also reflected a one time charge of million for the cumulative effect of adopting new accounting requirements for postretirement benefits other than pensions and for income taxes 
net income included realized investment gains after taxes of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
decisions to sell securities are governed principally by considerations of investment opportunities and tax consequences 
thus  realized investment gains and losses may vary significantly from year to year 
as a result  net income may not be indicative of our operating performance for the period 
property and casualty insurance property and casualty income was significantly higher in than in  such income was significantly higher than that in results in were adversely affected by a million increase in loss reserves related to an agreement for the settlement of asbestos related litigation the million charge  which is further described under loss reserves 
the million charge was partially offset by a million return premium to our property and casualty insurance subsidiaries related to the corporation s decision to exercise its option to commute a medical malpractice reinsurance agreement the million return premium 
property and casualty income after taxes was million in compared with million in and million in excluding the effects of the million charge and the million return premium  property and casualty income after taxes was million in earnings in benefited from highly profitable underwriting results and an increase in investment income compared with earnings in were adversely affected by higher catastrophe losses  resulting from the earthquake in california and the winter storms in the eastern and midwestern parts of the united states in the first quarter 
investment income increased modestly in compared with the prior year 
catastrophe losses were million in compared with million in and million in our initial retention level for each catastrophic event is approximately million 
we did not have any recoveries from our catastrophe reinsurance coverage during the past three years since there were no individual catastrophes for which our losses exceeded the initial retention 
net premiums written amounted to billion in  an increase of compared with net premiums written in increased compared with  after excluding the million return premium from the amount 
personal coverages accounted for million or of premiums written  standard commercial coverages for  million or  specialty commercial coverages for  million or and reinsurance assumed for million or 
the marketplace continued to be competitive  particularly in the commercial classes 
price increases in the casualty classes have been difficult to achieve for several years 
prices for property classes have remained stable in the past two years  despite the significant catastrophe losses experienced by the industry 
premium growth in and was due primarily to the selective writing of new business and exposure growth on existing business 
a significant portion of premium growth in both years was achieved outside the united states  from our expanding international branch network and our participation in the business of the sun alliance group plc 
underwriting results were highly profitable in compared with near breakeven results in underwriting results were extremely unprofitable in due to the adverse effect of the million charge 
the combined loss and expense ratio  the common measure of underwriting profitability  was in compared with in and in excluding the effects of the million charge and the million return premium  the combined loss and expense ratio was in the loss ratio was in compared with in and in excluding the effects of the million charge and the million return premium  the loss ratio was in the loss ratios continue to reflect the favorable experience resulting from the consistent application of our disciplined underwriting standards 
losses from catastrophes represented  and percentage points of the loss ratio in  and  respectively 
our expense ratio was in compared with in and in excluding the effect of the million return premium  the expense ratio was in the expense ratio in and benefited from growth in written premiums at a greater rate than the increase in overhead expenses 
expenses were reduced by contingent profit sharing accruals of million in and million in relating to the medical malpractice reinsurance agreement 
after a review of the cost of our casualty excess of loss reinsurance  we modified the program  principally for excess liability and executive protection coverages  effective january  the changes include an increase in the initial retention for each loss from million to million and an increase in the initial aggregate amount of losses that we will retain for each year before reinsurance becomes available 
these changes in our casualty reinsurance program are expected to increase net premiums written in by approximately million 
for many years  a portion of the us insurance business written by the corporation s property and casualty subsidiaries has been reinsured on a quota share basis with a subsidiary of sun alliance 
similarly  a subsidiary of the corporation has assumed a portion of sun alliance s property and casualty business on a quota share basis  such participation having increased in recent years 
effective january   the agreements pertaining to the exchange of reinsurance were amended to reduce the portion of each company s business that is reinsured with the other 
as a result  our property and casualty subsidiaries will retain a greater portion of the business they write directly and will reduce the amount of reinsurance they assume from sun alliance 
as a result of the changes to the agreements with sun alliance  our net premiums written are expected to increase by approximately million in the terms of the reinsurance agreements with sun alliance will be reviewed annually  at which time further reductions in the portion of each company s business that is reinsured with the other may occur 
the impact on underwriting results in of the changes to our casualty reinsurance program and to the agreements with sun alliance is not expected to be significant 
personal insurance premiums from personal insurance increased in compared with  such premiums in were virtually unchanged from our disciplined approach to pricing and risk selection  together with our efforts to control exposure in catastrophe prone areas  made it difficult to increase homeowners and other non automobile business 
however  gradual progress was made in to increase premiums written in non catastrophe prone areas 
personal automobile premiums increased modestly in as the result of our marketing efforts to provide coverage for high value automobiles 
our personal insurance business produced a substantial underwriting profit in compared with breakeven results in and an underwriting profit in the combined loss and expense ratio was in compared with in and in results in each of our personal classes of business improved significantly in homeowners results were profitable in  benefiting from lower catastrophe losses  fewer large losses and a reduction in non catastrophe loss frequency 
results were adversely affected by significant catastrophe losses in each of the past three years  but particularly in due to the winter storms and  to a lesser extent  the california earthquake 
catastrophe losses represented percentage points of the loss ratio for this class in compared with percentage points in and percentage points in other personal coverages  which include insurance for personal valuables and excess liability  were increasingly profitable in and personal excess liability results improved in both years due to favorable loss experience 
our automobile business produced profitable results in each of the last three years 
results in were particularly strong due to lower loss frequency and severity 
automobile results were adversely affected each year by losses from the mandated business that we are required by law to accept for those individuals who cannot obtain coverage in the voluntary market 
standard commercial insurance premiums from standard commercial insurance  which include coverages for multiple peril  casualty and workers compensation  increased in compared with premiums in were higher than in  after excluding the million return premium discussed below from the premium amounts 
market competition has continued to place significant pressure on prices 
premium growth in both years was due primarily to the selective writing of new accounts and exposure growth on existing business 
premium growth in and for multiple peril was particularly strong outside the united states 
medical malpractice business  which we stopped writing in  was reinsured effective year end the reinsurance agreement included a commutation provision under which our property and casualty subsidiaries had an option to reassume the remaining liability of the reinsurer as of december  and receive payment of an amount determined by a formula based on experience under the agreement 
the property and casualty subsidiaries exercised this option  which resulted in an amount due from the reinsurer of million and a reduction in reinsurance recoverable from the reinsurer of million 
the difference of million represents a return premium to our property and casualty subsidiaries  which was recognized in at the time the corporation announced its intention to exercise the commutation option 
the amount due from the reinsurer was received in january our standard commercial results were unprofitable in each of the past three years 
the combined loss and expense ratio was in compared with in and in results were extremely unprofitable in due to the adverse effect of the million charge 
excluding the effects of that charge and the million return premium  the combined loss and expense ratio was in casualty results in included the effects of the million charge and the million return premium 
excluding the effects of these items  casualty results deteriorated in casualty results deteriorated further in in each of the past three years  casualty results have been adversely affected in varying degrees by increases in loss reserves for asbestos related and toxic waste claims 
the substantial deterioration in was due to a larger increase in such reserves compared with the prior year 
the excess liability component of our casualty coverages has remained profitable due to favorable loss experience in this class 
results in the automobile component were also profitable in each of the last three years 
multiple peril results improved in but remained unprofitable 
results in the property component of this business improved in due to an absence of catastrophe losses 
results in were adversely affected by significant catastrophe losses  primarily from the earthquake in california 
catastrophe losses for this class represented of a percentage point of the loss ratio for compared with percentage points in and percentage points in the liability component of this business was particularly unprofitable in due to an increased frequency and severity of losses 
workers compensation results improved substantially in and results were profitable in compared with unprofitable results in the prior two years 
results in our voluntary business have benefited from rate increases  reform of the benefit provisions of workers compensation laws in many states  and the impact of medical cost containment and disability management activities 
results from our share of the involuntary pools and mandatory business in which we must participate by law also benefited from these positive factors 
specialty commercial insurance premiums from specialty commercial business increased by in compared with in premium increases for our executive protection and financial fidelity coverages were due primarily to new business opportunities 
our strategy of working closely with our customers and our ability to differentiate our products have enabled us to renew a large percentage of this business 
growth in several of our specialty classes was particularly strong outside the united states in both years 
our specialty commercial business produced substantial underwriting profits in each of the past three years with combined loss and expense ratios of in  in and in our executive protection and financial fidelity results were highly profitable in each year due to favorable loss experience 
results in the non fidelity portion of our financial institutions business improved in  results for these coverages had deteriorated in due in part to several large losses 
surety results were unprofitable in due to several large losses compared with profitable results in and marine results were profitable in compared with unprofitable results in and profitable results in results in were adversely affected by significant catastrophe losses  resulting primarily from the earthquake in california 
results in our smaller specialty classes were near breakeven in and these classes were unprofitable in due primarily to an increased frequency of large losses 
reinsurance assumed premiums from reinsurance assumed  which is primarily treaty reinsurance assumed from sun alliance  increased in compared with in the growth in both years was primarily due to an increase in our participation in the business of sun alliance 
premium growth in also benefited from a firming of rates  primarily in the united kingdom 
underwriting results for this segment were near breakeven in and compared with unprofitable results in the combined loss and expense ratio was in compared with in and in results in and benefited from rating measures taken by sun alliance as well as favorable weather conditions in the united kingdom 
regulatory initiatives in  voters in california approved ballot proposition  an insurance reform initiative affecting most property and casualty insurers writing business in the state 
provisions of proposition would have required insurers to roll back property and casualty rates for certain lines of business to percent below november levels and would have required an additional percent reduction in automobile rates by november in may  our property and casualty subsidiaries reached an agreement with the california insurance department to refund premiums  with interest  totaling million related to business written during the rollback period 
the agreement settles all rollback refund obligations of the property and casualty subsidiaries related to proposition a consumer group challenged the rollback settlement 
in december  an administrative law judge affirmed the rollback settlement 
the california insurance commissioner has adopted the judge s decision and the period during which the commissioner s action could be appealed has expired 
loss reserves loss reserves are our property and casualty subsidiaries largest liability 
at the end of  gross loss reserves totaled billion compared with billion and billion at year end and  respectively 
reinsurance recoverable on such loss reserves was billion at year end and compared with billion at the end of loss reserves  net of reinsurance recoverable  increased in compared with in loss reserves included billion  billion and billion at year end  and  respectively  related to the settlement of asbestos related claims against fibreboard corporation  which is discussed below 
excluding such reserves  loss reserves  net of reinsurance recoverable  increased in both and substantial reserve growth has occurred each year in those liability coverages  primarily excess liability and executive protection  that are characterized by delayed loss reporting and extended periods of settlement 
during  we experienced overall favorable development of million on loss reserves established as of the previous year end 
this compares with favorable development of million in and unfavorable development of million in such redundancies and deficiency were reflected in operating results in these respective years 
excluding the effect of the million increase in loss reserves related to the fibreboard settlement  we experienced favorable development of million in each of the past three years benefited from favorable claim severity trends for certain liability classes  this was offset each year in varying degrees by increases in loss reserves relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
the process of establishing loss reserves is an imprecise science and reflects significant judgmental factors 
in many liability cases  significant periods of time  ranging up to several years or more  may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of the loss and the settlement of the loss 
in fact  approximately of our loss reserves at december  were for claims that had not yet been reported to us  some of which were not yet known to the insured  and for future development on reported claims 
judicial decisions and legislative actions continue to broaden liability and policy definitions and to increase the severity of claim payments 
as a result of this and other societal and economic developments  the uncertainties inherent in estimating ultimate claim costs on the basis of past experience have increased significantly  further complicating the already difficult loss reserving process 
the uncertainties relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims on insurance policies written many years ago are exacerbated by judicial and legislative interpretations of coverage that in some cases have tended to erode the clear and express intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability 
the industry is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues and is thus confronted with a continuing uncertainty in its effort to quantify these exposures 
our most costly asbestos exposure relates to an insurance policy issued to fibreboard corporation by pacific indemnity company in in  pacific indemnity company  a subsidiary of the corporation  entered into a global settlement agreement with continental casualty company a subsidiary of cna financial corporation  fibreboard corporation  and attorneys representing claimants against fibreboard for all future asbestos related bodily injury claims against fibreboard 
this agreement is subject to final appellate court approval 
pursuant to the global settlement agreement  a billion trust fund will be established to pay future claims  which are claims that were not filed in court before august  pacific indemnity will contribute approximately million to the trust fund and continental casualty will contribute the remaining amount 
in december  upon execution of the global settlement agreement  pacific indemnity and continental casualty paid their respective shares into an escrow account 
upon final court approval of the settlement  the amount in the escrow account  including interest earned thereon  will be transferred to the trust fund 
all of the parties have agreed to use their best efforts to seek final court approval of the global settlement agreement 
pacific indemnity and continental casualty have reached a separate agreement for the handling of all asbestos related bodily injury claims pending on august  against fibreboard 
in february  the agreement was amended to extend for several years the period over which pacific indemnity will pay its remaining obligation  plus interest  under this agreement 
pacific indemnity s obligation under this agreement is not expected to exceed million  of which approximately million remained unpaid at december  the agreement further provides that the total responsibility of both insurers with respect to pending and future asbestos related bodily injury claims against fibreboard will be shared between pacific indemnity and continental casualty on an approximate and basis  respectively 
pacific indemnity  continental casualty and fibreboard have entered into a trilateral agreement  subject to final appellate court approval  to settle all present and future asbestos related bodily injury claims resulting from insurance policies that were  or may have been  issued to fibreboard by the two insurers 
the trilateral agreement will be triggered if the global settlement agreement is disapproved by an appellate court 
pacific indemnity s obligation under the trilateral agreement is therefore similar to  and not duplicative of  that under those agreements described above 
the trilateral agreement reaffirms portions of an agreement reached in march between pacific indemnity and fibreboard 
among other matters  that agreement eliminates any pacific indemnity liability to fibreboard for asbestos related property damage claims 
in july  the united states district court of the eastern district of texas approved the global settlement agreement and the trilateral agreement 
the judgments approving these agreements have been appealed to the united states court of appeal for the fifth circuit 
the appeals were argued in early march the period of ultimate judicial review continues to lengthen and may well extend into management is optimistic that the approval of the settlement will be upheld 
however  if both the global settlement agreement and the trilateral agreement are disapproved by an appellate court  there can then be no assurance that the loss reserves established for future claims would be sufficient to pay all amounts which ultimately could become payable in respect of future asbestos related bodily injury claims against fibreboard 
pacific indemnity  continental casualty and fibreboard have requested a california court of appeal to delay its decisions regarding asbestos related insurance coverage issues  which are currently before it and involve the three parties exclusively  while the approval of the global settlement is pending in court 
continental casualty and pacific indemnity have dismissed disputes against each other which involved fibreboard and were in litigation 
prior to the settlement  the corporation s property and casualty subsidiaries had existing loss reserves of million to cover a portion of their obligation under these agreements 
this amount included million of general liability incurred but not reported ibnr reserves which were not previously classified as specific reserves for asbestos claims since it was management s belief that doing so would increase the demands of plaintiffs attorneys 
additional loss reserves of million were provided in the third quarter of at the time the settlement was negotiated 
loss and expense payments related to the settlement aggregated million and million in and  respectively 
we have additional potential asbestos exposure on insureds for which we wrote excess liability coverages 
such exposure has increased due to the erosion of much of the underlying limits 
the number of claims against such insureds and the value of such claims have increased in recent years due in part to the non viability of other defendants 
our other remaining asbestos exposures are mostly peripheral defendants  including a mix of manufacturers and distributors of certain products that contain asbestos as well as premises owners 
generally  these insureds are named defendants on a regional rather than a nationwide basis 
we continue to receive notices of new asbestos claims and new exposures on existing claims as more peripheral parties are drawn into litigation to replace the now defunct mines and bankrupt manufacturers 
the courts have been engaged in developing guidelines regarding coverage for asbestos claims and have begun to articulate more consistent standards regarding the extent of the obligation of insurers to provide coverage and the method of allocation of costs among insurers 
however  we still do not know the universe of potential claims 
therefore  uncertainty remains as to our ultimate liability for asbestos related claims 
hazardous waste sites are another significant potential exposure 
under the superfund law and similar state statutes  when potentially responsible parties prps fail to handle the clean up  regulators have the work done and then attempt to establish legal liability against the prps 
the prps  with proper government authorization in many instances  disposed of toxic materials at a waste dump site or transported the materials to the site 
most sites have multiple prps 
insurance policies issued to prps were not intended to cover the clean up costs of pollution and  in many cases  did not intend to cover the pollution itself 
pollution was not a recognized hazard at the time many of these policies were written 
in more recent cases  however  policies specifically excluded such exposures 
as the cost of environmental clean up continues to grow  prps and others have increasingly filed claims with their insurance carriers 
ensuing litigation extends to issues of liability  coverage and other policy provisions 
there is great uncertainty involved in estimating our liabilities related to these claims 
first  the underlying liabilities of the claimants are extremely difficult to estimate 
at any given clean up site  the allocation of remediation costs among governmental authorities and the prps varies greatly 
second  different courts have addressed liability and coverage issues regarding pollution claims and have reached inconsistent conclusions in their interpretation of several issues 
these significant uncertainties are not likely to be resolved in the near future 
uncertainties also remain as to the superfund law itself  which has generated far more litigation than it has brought about the cleanup of hazardous waste sites 
superfund s taxing authority expired on december  notwithstanding continued pressure by the insurance industry and other interested parties to achieve a legislative solution to rewrite this law  the superfund issue may not be addressed until after the elections 
it is currently not possible to predict the direction that any reforms may take  when they may occur or the effect that any changes may have on the insurance industry 
in addition  the superfund law does not address non superfund toxic sites 
for that reason  it does not cover all existing toxic waste exposures  such as those involving sites that are subject to state law only 
such sites could prove even more numerous and thus more costly than superfund sites 
litigation costs continue to escalate  particularly for toxic waste claims 
a substantial portion of the funds expended to date by us has been for legal fees incurred in the prolonged litigation of coverage issues 
primary policies provide a limit on indemnity payments but many do not on defense costs 
this language in the policy sometimes leads to the payment of defense costs in multiples of the policy limits 
reserves for asbestos and toxic waste claims cannot be estimated with traditional loss reserving techniques 
we have established case reserves and expense reserves for costs of related litigation where sufficient information has been developed to indicate the involvement of a specific insurance policy 
in addition  ibnr reserves have been established to cover additional exposures on both known and unasserted claims 
these reserves are continually reviewed and updated 
loss reserve increases relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims were million in  million in and  million in excluding the million increase in loss reserves related to the fibreboard settlement and the reclassification of million of general liability ibnr reserves as specific reserves for this settlement  the increase in loss reserves relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims was million in further increases in such reserves in and future years are possible as legal and factual issues concerning these claims are clarified  although the amounts cannot be reasonably estimated 
management believes that the aggregate loss reserves of the property and casualty subsidiaries at december  were adequate to cover claims for losses which had occurred  including both those known to us and those yet to be reported 
in establishing such reserves  management considers facts currently known and the present state of the law and coverage litigation 
however  given the expansion of coverage and liability by the courts and the legislatures in the past and the possibilities of similar interpretations in the future  particularly as they relate to asbestos and toxic waste claims  as well as the uncertainty in determining what scientific standards will be deemed acceptable for measuring hazardous waste site clean up  additional increases in loss reserves may emerge which would adversely affect results in future periods 
the amount cannot reasonably be estimated at the present time 
investments and liquidity investment income after taxes increased in compared with in growth was primarily due to increases in invested assets  which reflected strong cash flow from operations over the period 
growth was tempered in by the million paid in december into an escrow account related to the fibreboard settlement 
similarly  growth was tempered as a result of the february amendment to the agreement between pacific indemnity and continental casualty  whereby an additional million of the corporation s assets were designated as funds held for asbestos related settlement 
these assets accrue income for the benefit of participants in the class settlement of asbestos related bodily injury claims against fibreboard 
the effective tax rate on our investment income was in compared with in and in the effective tax rate increased in and as the percentage of our investment income subject to tax has increased 
generally  premiums are received by our property and casualty subsidiaries months or even years before we pay the losses under the policies purchased by such premiums 
these funds are used first to make current claim and expense payments 
the balance is invested to augment the investment income generated by the existing portfolio 
historically  cash receipts from operations  consisting of insurance premiums and investment income  have provided more than sufficient funds to pay losses  operating expenses and dividends to the corporation 
the main objectives of the investment portfolio of the property and casualty subsidiaries are to maximize after tax investment income and total investment returns while minimizing credit risks as well as to provide maximum support to the insurance underwriting operations 
investment strategies are developed based on many factors including underwriting results and our resulting tax position  fluctuations in interest rates and regulatory requirements 
new cash available for investment was approximately million in compared with million in and million in the lower amount in was due to the designation of million of new cash as funds held for asbestos related settlement 
the lower amount in was due to the million paid in december into an escrow account 
in  we invested new cash primarily in tax exempt bonds 
in  we invested new cash in taxable bonds and  to a lesser extent  tax exempt bonds while reducing our equity security portfolio 
in each year we tried to achieve the appropriate mix in our portfolio to balance both investment and tax strategies 
the property and casualty subsidiaries have consistently invested in high quality marketable securities 
taxable bonds in our domestic portfolio comprise us treasury  government agency and corporate issues 
approximately of these bonds are either backed by the us government or rated aa or better by moody s or standard poor s 
of the tax exempt bonds  practically all are rated a or better  with approximately half rated aaa 
taxable bonds have an average maturity of years while tax exempt bonds mature on average in years 
actual maturities could differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations 
common stocks are high quality and readily marketable 
at december   the property and casualty subsidiaries held foreign investments of billion supporting their international operations 
such foreign investments have quality and maturity characteristics similar to our domestic portfolio 
we reduce the risks relating to currency fluctuations by maintaining investments in those foreign currencies in which we transact business  with characteristics similar to the liabilities in those currencies 
the property and casualty subsidiaries maintain sufficient investments in highly liquid  short term securities at all times to provide for immediate cash needs 
at year end  such investments were at a higher than normal level so that funds would be readily available to pay amounts related to the fibreboard settlement 
short term securities were reduced to a more normal level in as the expected payout period for fibreboard related amounts has been extended 
the corporation maintains bank credit facilities that are available to respond to unexpected cash demands 
life and health insurance life and health insurance earnings after taxes were million in compared with million in and million in premiums and policy charges were million in compared with million in and million in personal insurance earnings from personal insurance were million in compared with million in and million in earnings in benefited from favorable mortality 
the earnings decrease in was primarily due to a decrease in the spread between interest earned on our invested assets and interest credited to policyholders on interest sensitive products 
premiums and policy charges amounted to million in compared with million in and million in new sales of personal insurance as measured by annualized premiums were million in compared with million in and million in our strategy is to focus on the affluent individual interested in estate planning and wealth creation utilizing equity linked products as well as on financial planning for business owners 
our ability to increase revenues has been enhanced through marketing initiatives conducted with our property and casualty producers 
we have taken a number of steps to increase operating efficiencies in order to improve the competitive position of our personal insurance business 
we reduced field office staffing levels by consolidating the offices as of the beginning of into as of year end and also consolidated three service centers into two 
in addition  we streamlined our producer network and raised their minimum production requirements 
group insurance group insurance operations resulted in losses of million in and million in compared with earnings of million in group health insurance results in and were adversely affected by a high level of claims resulting from the increased cost of medical services and the increased utilization of those services 
results in benefited from significant rate increases  this was offset in part by the adverse effect of premium revenue decreasing at a greater rate than the decrease in expenses 
premiums were million in compared with million in and million in new group sales as measured by annualized premiums were million in compared with million in and million in our group health business is concentrated in the new york and new jersey markets 
in  both states adopted legislation which eliminated health insurance underwriting  created community based rating and limited pre existing condition exclusions for insured groups with fewer than covered lives 
as a result  several insurers reduced their market share in the small group health segment in new york in we offered a competitive product and thus substantially increased our sales in that market during the high level of premium revenue in and the first six months of reflected the effect of the significant increase in sales of new policies during due to the increased availability of alternative small group markets in as well as our significant rate increases in and  many of the new policies written in  which became eligible for renewal in  were not renewed 
due to this increase in non renewals  we expected the decline in premium revenue which occurred in in response  we took a number of steps to reduce our costs including the closing of field offices and regional claim offices  reducing staffing levels by 
given the changes in our marketplace and the continuation of the shift away from traditional indemnity products to managed care alternatives  we anticipate that traditional indemnity premium revenue will continue to decline 
in response to this shift  we are offering managed care products through chubbhealth  inc  a health maintenance organization 
because of the continuing adverse effects of the legislative changes and other health industry factors on our group health results  we are evaluating our future role in the traditional indemnity and managed care markets 
investments and liquidity gross investment income increased in compared with in growth in was primarily due to an increase in invested assets 
premium receipts in excess of payments for benefits and expenses  together with investment income  continue to provide new cash for investment 
new cash amounted to million in compared with million in and million in the increase in new cash in was primarily due to increases in deposits credited to policyholder funds 
the decrease in new cash in was due to the reduced cash flow from group insurance operations 
in  new cash was invested in mortgage backed securities and  to a lesser extent  corporate bonds and us treasury securities 
in  new cash was invested primarily in mortgage backed securities 
we invest predominantly in fixed income securities with cash flows and maturities which are consistent with life insurance liability characteristics 
approximately are investment grade and more than half are rated aaa 
we maintain sufficient funds in short term securities to meet unusual needs for cash 
the life and health subsidiaries held fixed maturity securities with a carrying value of billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
corporate bonds comprised and of the portfolio at year end and  respectively  and mortgage backed securities comprised of the portfolio at both year ends 
more than of our mortgage backed securities holdings at december  and related to residential mortgages consisting of government agency pass through securities  government agency collateralized mortgage obligations cmos and aaa rated by government agency collateral or single family home mortgages 
the majority of the cmos are actively traded in liquid markets and market value information is readily available from broker dealers 
the notion of impairment associated with default in paying principal is less applicable to residential cmos 
other risks  most notably prepayment and extension risks  are monitored regularly 
changes in prepayment patterns can either lengthen or shorten the expected timing of the principal repayments and thus the average life and the effective yield of the security 
we invest primarily in those classes of residential cmo instruments that are subject to less prepayment and extension risk and are therefore less volatile than other cmo instruments 
real estate real estate earnings after taxes were million in compared with a loss of million in both and results continue to be adversely affected by progressively higher portions of interest cost being charged directly to expense rather than being capitalized and by provisions for possible uncollectible receivables related to mortgages 
results for benefited from an increase in earnings from rental operations  residential sales and a land sale as well as from a decrease in the provision for uncollectible receivables 
the provision for uncollectible receivables was lower in than in the prior year despite an increase of million to the allowance for uncollectible receivables resulting from the initial application of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which established new criteria for measuring impairment of a loan 
revenues were million in compared with million in and million in revenues in and included higher levels of rental revenues on owned properties 
revenues in also included increased revenues from residential development and the land sale 
our commercial real estate activities traditionally centered around acquiring suburban  multi site land parcels in locations considered prime for office development and then developing the land in progressive stages 
in the late s  we expanded our activities to include a few metropolitan office building projects 
we develop real estate properties ourselves rather than through third party developers 
we are distinguished from most other real estate developers in that we coordinate all phases of the development process from concept to completion 
upon completion of development  the properties may be either owned and operated for our own account or sold to third parties 
we directly manage virtually all of the properties which we either own or have sold and retained interests in through secured loans 
our continuing investment interests in joint ventures generally consist of the ownership and lease of the underlying land and the management and operation of the buildings 
our agreements with joint ventures to manage all aspects of the joint venture properties  including debt structures  tenant leasing  and building improvements and maintenance  have put us in a strong position to protect our ongoing financial interests in the current difficult real estate environment 
the commercial real estate industry continues to suffer from a reduced demand for real estate investment 
for the past several years  the supply of available office space has exceeded the demand 
corporate restructurings and downsizings have exacerbated the problem as businesses consolidated their facilities  increasing the supply of available space 
while selected real estate markets have experienced increases in leasing activity and some stability in rental rates  the oversupply of available office space for lease in most markets and the resultant low rental rates will continue to cause pressure on the earnings of the real estate development industry 
in consideration of the difficult environment in most real estate markets  we have curtailed our construction of new office buildings in recent years 
we have focused instead on leasing newly constructed facilities and maintaining established properties at high occupancy levels 
current development activities consist almost exclusively of preconstruction type efforts such as site planning  zoning and similar activities 
as a consequence  we expect revenues from our commercial real estate activities for the next several years to come from ongoing income from owned properties and from management and financing activities related to previously sold properties or properties held in joint ventures 
this does not preclude us from entertaining proposals to purchase our properties when such offers provide a reasonable return 
our vacancy rates are better than the average in substantially all markets in which we operate 
we have been successful in both retaining existing tenants and securing new ones and have not had significant credit problems with tenants 
during  a total of  square feet was leased compared with  square feet in and  square feet in at december   we owned or had interests in  square feet of office and industrial space 
our vacancy rate was at year end compared with at year end and at year end the lower vacancy rates in and were due to our ability to market space as it became available despite the difficult leasing market 
in certain markets  renewing leases in established buildings has been difficult as newly constructed space is available nearby at competitive rates 
while we have experienced significant leasing activity in recent years  we have had to enter into multiple year leases at low market rental rates 
this  together with the lack of construction and transaction based activity  will place continued pressure on our real estate earnings for the next several years 
ultimate realizable value for real estate properties is determined based on our ability to fully recover costs through a future revenue stream 
in many instances  there currently is not an active market for commercial real estate 
therefore  the prices which might be realized if we were forced to liquidate such properties on an immediate sale basis would probably be less than the carrying values 
in light of current market conditions and our intent and ability to hold properties for the long term  our primary focus is to ensure that we can recover our costs through ownership and operation rather than sale 
we analyze both individual buildings and development sites on a continuing basis
