total debt to net worth 

profitability ratios return on sales  net return on net wort gross profit these measurement factors for the past three years  particularly working capital and profitability ratios  indicate positive trends toward improved liquidity and strengthened financial posture

for the past three years the company has operated on an even or positive cash flow basis 
this is because the company receives typically progress payments on its actual costs incurred on most of its contracts
