this stable occupancy as well as increasing rental rates should improve the company s results of operations from its in service properties 
the company s strategy for continued growth also includes developing and acquiring additional rental properties in its primary markets and expanding into other attractive midwestern markets

as part of its october acquisition of duke associates  the company acquired an option to purchase an interest in an entity which provided telecommunication services to tenants in properties owned and managed by the company

funds from operations management believes that funds from operations ffo  which is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts as net income or loss excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for minority interest  unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures adjustments for minority interest  unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis  is the industry standard for reporting the operations of real estate investment trusts 
the following table reflects the calculation of the company s ffo for the years ended december  as follows in thousands net income    add back depreciation and amortization    amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non rental real estate assets   share of joint venture depreciation and amortization gain on property sales  adjustment for minority interest share of add backs   funds from operations    cash flow provided by used by operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    the increase in ffo for the three year period results primarily from the increased in service rental property portfolio as discussed above under results of operations 
the following table indicates components of such growth for each of the years ended december  as follows in thousands rental operations original portfolio    development   acquisitions   investments in unconsolidated companies   interest expense    net rental operations    service operations  net of minority interest    minority interest of unitholders    other  net  adjustment for minority interest share of add backs   funds from operations    in march  nareit issued a clarification of its definition of ffo effective for years beginning after december  the clarification provides that amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non rental real estate assets are no longer to be added back to net income in arriving at ffo 
the company s ffo under the new method of calculation would have been million  million  and million for the three years ended december    and  respectively 
the calculation of ffo for the years ended december  and has been revised to conform with the presentation of ffo for the year ended december  which excludes amounts attributable to minority interests 
while management believes that ffo is the most relevant and widely used measure of the company s operating performance  such amount does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles  should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance  and is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs
