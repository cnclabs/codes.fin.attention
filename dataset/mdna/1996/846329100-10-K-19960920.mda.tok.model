million in lost sales due to the temporary closure of the marietta and addison restaurants for their conversion to other concepts 
the decline in same store sales was the result of an decrease in customer counts offset by a increase in check averages 
management believes that same store customer count comparisons were negatively affected by the continued growth of competitors in the casual dining and italian restaurant segments and to periods of unusually severe winter weather in january and early february 
the increase in check averages was primarily the result of new menu items introduced over the last months 
additionally  higher check averages at the italian grill units and modest menu price adjustments made during the last months also contributed to the increase in check averages 
although total same store sales declined by from fiscal  during current year periods operating under the italian grill format  the two italian grill same store sales showed increases of in comparison to corresponding periods in fiscal these increases in italian grill same store sales were the result of a increase in customer counts coupled with a increase in check averages 
due to these favorable sales results  the company plans to convert a minimum of six units to the italian grill format in fiscal costs and expenses cost of sales cost of sales as a percentage of total revenues decreased slightly from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease was the result of improved inventory controls and modest price adjustments made during the last months 
due to higher food costs associated with the italian grill and cappellini s concepts  management anticipates that cost of sales as a percentage of total revenues will increase modestly in fiscal as more units are converted to the italian grill format 
operating expenses operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased from in fiscal to in fiscal this increase is primarily attributed to a significant increase in marketing expenditures over fiscal additionally  increases in management labor  kitchen labor  and property taxes as a percentage of revenues also contributed to the overall increase

the fixed nature of certain costs  relative to the decline in same store sales  also contributed to the increase in fiscal operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues 
operating expenses as a percentage of revenues are expected to decline slightly in fiscal due to the closure of the seven low volume units in february general and administrative expenses g a g a expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the fixed nature of certain g a expenses  relative to the decrease in revenues  contributed to the increase in g a as a percentage of total revenues 
additionally  increased marketing research costs  legal fees  travel costs and a non cash write off of certain costs incurred in the preparation of the addison property for its conversion to cappellini s also contributed to the current year increase in g a as a percentage of revenues 
depreciation and amortization d a d a as a percentage of total revenues increased from in fiscal to in fiscal this increase was due to the fixed nature of depreciation relative to the decline in same store sales and to an increase in depreciation incurred on new point of sale pos equipment 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in pre opening amortization on new stores resulting from a reduction in the company s new unit expansion rate 
restructuring charges on january  the company s board of directors approved a restructuring plan intended to strengthen the company s competitive position and improve cash flow and profitability 
in conjunction with the plan  the company closed seven under performing restaurants in february and identified one additional restaurant to be sold as an operating unit 
the seven closed stores include those previously located in hartford  connecticut  providence  rhode island  buffalo  new york  rochester  new york  columbia  south carolina  greenville  south carolina  and little rock  arkansas

the company has disposed of all of the closed locations except hartford  which is currently under contract to be sold at the end of the first quarter of fiscal the company anticipates that the original million pre tax charge will be sufficient to complete the restructuring plan by the end of fiscal gain on asset scheduled for divestiture in fiscal  the company purchased its existing austin  texas location and ceased development of an alternate austin location 
in fiscal  the company recorded a non cash charge of  to write down the alternate property to its estimated net realizable value at that time 
the company sold the alternate austin location in fiscal for an amount exceeding its recorded book value  thus recognizing a  gain at the time of its sale 
net interest expense net interest expense decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decrease was primarily attributed to decreases in the average debt outstanding under the company s credit facilities 
additionally  interest earned on cash proceeds from the disposal of closed restaurants also helped reduce current year net interest expense 
to the extent allowable by the company s credit facilities  management intends to incur additional long term debt to the extent that future cash flow from operations is insufficient to cover planned restaurant conversions  capital expenditures and possible further repurchases of the company s stock 
income taxes the company s effective income tax rate increased from a provision in fiscal to a benefit in fiscal the prior year rate is below statutory rates due primarily to the utilization of the federal fica tax tip credit

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
compared to revenues fiscal revenues increased million  or  over fiscal due to million of incremental sales from the six restaurants opened after july  this increase was offset by a million decline in fiscal same store sales 
the decline in same store sales was the result of a decrease in customer counts offset by a increase in check averages 
same store customer count comparisons were negatively affected by the rapid growth of competitors in the casual dining and italian restaurant segments and to the normal decline in customer traffic for stores in their second and third years of operation 
the increase in check averages was primarily the result of new menu items introduced during the second half of fiscal some slight menu price adjustments made throughout fiscal also contributed modestly to the increase in check averages 
costs and expenses cost of sales cost of sales as a percentage of total revenues increased slightly from in fiscal to in fiscal this increase was the result of menu price reductions made in the fourth quarter of fiscal which continued throughout the first half of fiscal additionally  temporary increases in various raw material costs including lettuce  pasta and tomato products also contributed to the increase in cost of sales in fiscal operating expenses operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased from in fiscal to in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to increased store management costs resulting from a new salary structure that was implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal to enable the company to be more competitive in attracting high quality management personnel and to reduce management turnover 
the fixed nature of certain costs  relative to the decline in fiscal same store sales  also contributed to the increase in fiscal operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues 
in addition  server labor  utility costs and property taxes were all higher in fiscal these increases were largely offset by reductions in cashier labor  group medical costs and workman s compensation insurance resulting from the implementation of various cost reduction initiatives in fiscal general and administrative expenses g a g a expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased from in fiscal to in fiscal this increase was primarily the result of increased corporate labor costs 
the increase in labor costs is attributable to positions in place in fiscal that were not in place for all of fiscal  including president and chief executive officer  vice president of operations  vice president of product development and purchasing  health benefits coordinator  one additional regional director  and two additional information systems employees 
these salary increases were largely offset by the reduction of corporate level positions in the first quarter of fiscal  however  the company did not receive the full cost benefit of these reductions in fiscal due to severance packages paid to these former employees 
in addition to the increase in corporate labor costs  computer maintenance  management relocation costs and property taxes were all higher in fiscal these increases were offset by reductions in management training expenses  recruitment expenses  donations and a loss on the write off of certain previously incurred costs in searching for new locations no longer under consideration for company owned restaurant expansion 
depreciation and amortization d a d a as a percentage of total revenues decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease was the result of a significant decrease in pre opening expense amortization on new stores due to the reduction in the number of new stores opened by the company

unusual charge the company recorded a  write down of its one third investment in fp corporation pty ltd 
and fp restaurants pty ltd 
collectively fasta pasta in the fourth quarter of fiscal the write down of the company s investment in fasta pasta was the result of an alleged misappropriation of fasta pasta assets by the joint venture s former managing director discovered during the fourth quarter of fiscal net interest expense net interest expense increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase was attributable to an increase in the average debt outstanding under the company s credit facilities and to increases in short term borrowing rates on the company s revolving credit facility during fiscal income taxes the company s effective income tax rate decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal during this period  the company utilized the federal targeted jobs tax credit and the fica tax tip credit to reduce its effective rates below the statutory rates 
the decrease in the effective tax rate over this period was due primarily to the increase in the benefit received from the targeted jobs tax credit and the fica tax tip credit relative to the decline in pre tax income over the same period 
liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital deficit increased from million on july  to million on june  this increase is due to an increase in the current portion of long term debt resulting from the execution of a new amendment to the company s existing credit facility 
this increase was partially offset by increases in cash and cash equivalents resulting from the fourth quarter disposal of six of the seven restaurant properties closed in february and the disposal of the excess austin  texas property 
the company is currently operating with a working capital deficit  which is common in the restaurant industry since restaurant companies do not normally require significant investment in either accounts receivable or inventory 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased from in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease was attributed to the decline in current year earnings  certain cash expenses incurred in relation to the fiscal restructuring plan  and to changes in certain components of working capital 
in order to obtain approval of the restructuring plan from its lenders  the company amended certain provisions of its existing bank credit facility in march this amendment reduced the total amount available under the credit facility from million to million and added a covenant requiring the company to meet a certain funded debt to cash flow ratio prior to borrowing any additional funds under such agreement 
long term debt outstanding on june  consisted primarily of amounts borrowed under the company s existing bank credit facility  including a million fixed rate term loan and million borrowed against its floating rate revolving credit facility 
due to the company s failure to meet the fixed charge coverage requirement contained in its existing bank credit facility at march   the company negotiated with its lenders to amend the terms of its borrowing arrangements and to obtain a waiver for this event of technical default 
on august   the company executed a new amendment to its bank credit facility  effective june   and received a waiver from its lenders for the march  event of default 
the terms of the amended credit agreement contain  among other things  the immediate paydown of approximately million of debt  future additional debt payments upon the disposal of assets and settlement of the bright kaplan litigation  variable interest rates on both revolving credit loans and term loans based on company performance  and various changes to minimum financial ratio requirements 
additionally  in the event that the company has a material default spanning two consecutive quarters  the lenders may request that the company grant to them a lien on a sufficient number of properties in order to secure their interest in the loans 
as of june   the company was in compliance with all requirements under the amended credit agreement 
in fiscal  the company s board of directors authorized a program for the repurchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock for investment purposes 
as of june   the company had repurchased  shares of common stock under this program  including  shares in fiscal further purchases with respect to this program are dependent upon various business and financial considerations 
the company s capital expenditures increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal fiscal expenditures consistent primarily of renovations made to four spaghetti warehouse restaurants  replacement of point of sale equipment in five restaurants  and costs relating to the conversion of three of its locations to the italian grill format and one unit to the cappellini s concept 
during fiscal  the company converted three of its existing spaghetti warehouse units to the spaghetti warehouse italian grill format 
two additional units have also been converted to the italian grill format during the first quarter of fiscal the italian grill  an updated version of the existing spaghetti warehouse concept  features a lighter  brighter decor package  increased menu variety  and enhanced service 
based on favorable sales and operating results achieved thus far in units previously converted to the italian grill format  the company plans to convert six units to the new format during fiscal in a separate endeavor  the company s newest concept called cappellini s opened on january  in addison  texas 
the company s previous addison spaghetti warehouse was closed on october  to undergo conversion to the cappellini s concept 
cappellini s is an upscale restaurant featuring authentic italian dishes prepared fresh to order  served in large portions 
although cappellini s was designed to generate check averages and revenues significantly greater than the traditional spaghetti warehouse restaurant  it has not yet produced sufficient revenues necessary to sustain profitable operations 
the company currently does not plan to open or convert any additional locations to the cappellini s concept in fiscal in addition to italian grill conversions  the company plans to continue to make necessary replacements and upgrades to its existing restaurants and information systems during fiscal total planned capital expenditures relating to these fiscal projects are million 
cash flow from operations and current cash balances are expected to be sufficient to fund planned capital expenditures  payment of required debt maturities under the company s bank credit facility and possible further repurchases of company stock in fiscal effect of inflation management does not believe inflation has had a significant effect on the company s operations during the past several years 
the company has historically been able to pass on increased costs through menu price increases  however  due to the competitive environment of the restaurant industry  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to pass on such cost increases in the future 
seasonality the company s business is subject to seasonality with revenues generally being highest during the months of july and august and lowest during the months of september through january 
this seasonality is due to the dining out patterns of the company s customers
