analysis of the results of operations the company reported net earnings of million for the year ended december  this represented an increase of  or  over earnings of million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   the company reported earnings of million 
earnings per share  adjusted for the effects of a stock dividend declared each year  were   and per share for   and  respectively 
the increase in earnings for compared to resulted primarily from the increase in net interest income and  to a lesser extent  the increase in other operating income 
increased net interest income for generally reflected the higher volume of average earning assets coupled with higher yields on these assets 
the increases were partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses and increased other operating expenses 
the increase in earnings for compared to was also the result of an increase in net interest income due primarily to an increase in the volume of average earning assets and a lower cost of average deposits 
a lower provision for credit losses also contributed to the increase in earnings for compared to the previous year 
the lower provision for credit losses for compared to reflected nominal internal loan growth  net of acquired loans  and lower net charge offs for the year 
earnings for included a million gain on the sale of investment securities that resulted from a restructure of the investment portfolio in anticipation of the adoption of sfas no 
for the year ended december   the company s return on average assets was  compared to a return on average assets of for the year ended december   and for the year ended december the decrease in the return on average assets for the last two years is primarily the result of decreases in the level of average earning assets in relation to average total assets 
increases in other real estate owned and goodwill contributed to the increase in nonearning assets

net interest income was million for  an increase of million  or  over net interest income of million for net interest income increased million  or  for  from a total of million for the increase in net interest income for was the result of higher yields on larger average balances of earning assets 
the net interest margin is net interest income measured as a percentage of average earning assets 
the net interest margin can be affected by changes in the yield on earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities  as well as changes in the level of interest bearing liabilities in proportion to earning assets 
the company s net interest margin was for  compared to for  and for the ability to fund higher levels of earning assets with noninterest bearing demand deposits contributed to the increases in the net interest margin for each of the last three years 
average noninterest bearing deposits as a percentage of earning assets increased to for  from for  and for the net interest spread is the difference between the yield on average earning assets less the cost of average interest bearing liabilities 
the company s net interest spread was for this represented a decrease from a net interest spread of for and for the decrease in the net interest spread for resulted from the cost of interest bearing liabilities increasing faster than the yield on earning assets 
the company earned total interest income of million for this represented an increase of million  or  from interest income of million for interest income totaled million for the increases in interest income for compared to was the result of the combined effects of an increase in the level of average earning assets and a higher yield earned on these assets

there was no interest income that was accrued and not reversed on any nonperforming loan at december    or had nonperforming loans for which interest was no longer accruing complied with the original terms and conditions of their notes  interest income would have been  higher in   higher in  and  higher in accordingly  yields on loans would have increased by   and  for   and  respectively 
included in other real estate owned at december   were two loans totaling million which  although performing according to their original terms  were accounted for as other real estate owned as required under sfas no 
as principal and interest payments on these loans were current at december   the average balance of the loans were included in total loans  and the yield on total loans was adjusted accordingly 
fees collected on loans are an integral part of the loan pricing decision 
loan fees and the direct costs associated with origination of loans are deferred and netted against the loan balance 
deferred net loan fees are recognized in interest income over the term of the loan in a manner that approximates the level yield method 
for the year ended december   the company recognized million in loan fee income 
this represented an increase of  or  over loan fees of million recognized for for  the page company recognized million in loan fee income 
the decrease in loan fee income recognized for compared to was the result of the recognition of lower direct costs associated with loan origination

table loan fee activity amounts in thousands fees collected    fees and costs deferred    accretion of deferred fees and costs    total fee income reported    deferred net loan origination fees acquired deferred net loan origination fees at end of year    during periods of changing interest rates  the ability to reprice interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can influence net interest income  the net interest margin  and consequently  the company s earnings 
the bank s management monitors the interest rate sensitivity for potential changes in interest rates using a maturity repricing gap analysis 
this analysis measures  for specific time intervals  the differences between earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for which repricing opportunities will occur 
a positive difference  or gap  indicates that earning assets will reprice faster than interest bearing liabilities 
this will generally produce a greater net interest margin during periods of rising interest rates  and a lower net interest margin during periods of declining interest rates 
conversely  a negative gap will generally produce a lower net interest margin during periods of rising interest rates and a greater net interest margin during periods of decreasing interest rates 
table provides the bank s maturity repricing gap analysis at december   and the bank had a negative one year cumulative gap of million at december   compared to a negative one year cumulative gap of million at december  the increased negative gap for compared to was primarily the result of a lower volume of loans repricing within one year  a greater level of time deposits maturing within one year  and an increase in short term borrowings for compared to table asset and liability maturity repricing gap amounts in thousands over over days days to days to over or less days days days earning assets fed funds  investment securities and debt securities held for sale     deposits with other financial institutions total loans     total     interest bearing liabilities savings deposits  time deposits     other borrowings  total     period gap     cumulative gap     earning assets fed funds  investment securities and debt securities held for sale     deposits with other financial institutions total loans     total     interest bearing liabilities savings deposits  time deposits     other borrowings  total     period gap     cumulative gap     the interest rates paid on deposit accounts do not always move in unison with the rates charged on loans 
in addition  the magnitude of changes in the rates charged on loans is not always proportionate to the magnitude of changes in the rate paid for deposits 
consequently  changes in interest rates do not necessarily result in an increase or decrease in the net interest margin solely as a result of the differences between repricing opportunities of earning assets or interest bearing liabilities 
the fact that the bank reported a negative gap at december   does not necessarily indicate that if interest rates decreased net interest income would increase  or if interest rates increased net interest income would decrease 
credit risk implicit in lending activities is the risk that losses will be experienced and that the amount of such losses will vary over time 
consequently  the company maintains an allowance for credit losses by charging a provision for credit losses to earnings 
loans determined to be losses are charged against the allowance for credit losses 
the company s allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level considered by the bank s management to be adequate to provide for estimated losses inherent in the existing portfolio  including commitments under commercial and standby letters of credit 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses  the bank s management estimates the amount of potential loss for each loan that has been identified as having greater than standard credit risk  including loans identified as nonperforming 
loss estimates also consider the borrowers financial data and the current valuation of collateral when appropriate 
in addition to the allowance for specific problem credits  an allowance is further allocated for all loans in the portfolio based on the risk characteristics of particular categories of loans including historical loss experience in the portfolio 
additional allowance is allocated on the basis of credit risk concentrations in the portfolio and contingent obligations under off balance sheet commercial and standby letters of credit 
effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for the impairment of a loan  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
the statements prescribe that a loan is impaired when principal and interest are deemed uncollectable according to the original contractual terms of the loan 
impairment is to be measured as either the expected future cash flows discounted at each loan s effective interest rate  the fair value of the loan s collateral  or an observable market price of the loan if one exists 
the amount of impairment is to be reported as a part of the company s allowance for credit losses 
at december   the company reported an allowance for credit losses of million 
of this total  million represented reserves for specific problem loans   represented reserves for specific impaired loans  and million represented that portion allocated to provide for general risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
nonperforming loans totaled million  or of gross loans at december  nonperforming loans totaled million  or of gross loans at december   and million  or of gross loans at december  nonperforming loans include loans for which interest is no longer accruing 
in addition  nonperforming loans include loans that have been renegotiated from their original contractual terms  even if the loan is paying as agreed under the renegotiated terms 
the increase in nonperforming loans in was due to a million increase in restructured loans and a  increase in nonaccrual loans 
the increase in nonperforming loans for was the result of increases in restructured loans 
all restructured loans were paying in accordance with the renegotiated terms at december  see table nonperforming assets for additional information concerning nonperforming loans 
while management believes that the allowance was adequate to provide for both recognized potential losses and estimated inherent losses in the portfolio  no assurances can be given that future events may not result in increases in the provision for credit losses

net loans charged to the allowance for credit losses during included million in real estate loans  compared to  in real estate loans charged to the allowance for credit losses during the increase reflects the continued soft southern california economy and declining real estate values 
the lower provision for credit losses for  reflected a slower growth rate in loans net of acquisitions for that year 
loans acquired through merger for included an adjustment to the allowance for credit losses incidental to the merger of million 
while the company s management believes that the allowance was adequate to provide for both recognized potential losses and estimated inherent losses in the portfolio  no assurances can be given that future events may not result in increases in the provision for credit losses 
there is no precise method of predicting specific losses that ultimately may be charged against the allowance for credit losses 
as such  the company s management is unable to reasonably estimate the full amount of loans to be charged to the reserve in future periods 
table provides a summary of the allocation of the allowance for credit losses for specific loan categories at the dates indicated 
the allocations presented should not be interpreted as an indication that loans charged to the allowance for credit losses will occur in these amounts or proportions  or that the portion of the allowance allocated to each loan category represents the total amount available for future losses that may occur within these categories 
there is a large unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses and the total allowance is applicable to the entire loan portfolio

these loans are classified as real estate mortgage loans for the financial statements  but are accounted for as commercial and industrial loans on the company s books 
as a normal practice in extending credit for commercial and industrial purposes  the bank may accept trust deeds on real property as collateral 
in some cases  when the primary source of repayment for the loan is anticipated to come from cash flow from normal operations of the borrower  the requirement of real property as collateral is not the primary source of repayment but an abundance of caution 
in these cases  the real property is considered a secondary source of repayment for the loan 
since the bank lends primarily in southern california  its real estate loan collateral is concentrated in this region 
at december   approximately of the bank s loans secured by real estate were collateralized by properties located in southern california 
this concentration is considered when determining the adequacy of the company s allowance for credit losses 
at december   nonperforming assets  which included nonperforming loans see credit risk and other real estate owned  totaled million 
this represented an increase of million  or  from total nonperforming assets of million at december  the increase in nonperforming assets for was the result of increased nonperforming loans 
other real estate owned declined  to million at december   compared to million at december  although management believes that nonperforming loans are generally well secured and that potential losses are provided for in the company s allowance for credit losses  there can be no assurance that future deterioration in economic conditions or collateral values will not result in future credit losses

the bank has allocated specific reserves included in the allowance for credit losses for potential losses on these loans 
a restructured loan is a loan for which the bank has reduced the rate of interest to a lower rate  forgiven all or a part of the interest income  or forgiven part of the principal balance of the loan  due to the borrower s financial condition 
at december   the company had a total of million in loans that were classified as restructured 
except for nonperforming loans as set forth in table  and loans disclosed as impaired  the bank s management is not aware of any loans as of december   for which known credit problems of the borrower would cause serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with their present loan repayment terms  or any known events that would result in the loan being designated as nonperforming at some future date 
the bank s management cannot  however  predict the extent to which the current economic environment may persist or worsen or the full impact the current economic environment may have on the loan portfolio

the bank is actively marketing these properties 
the bank s management cannot predict when these properties will be sold or what the terms of sale will be when they are sold 
while the bank s management recognizes that the southern california real estate market continues to remain weak  the bank has recent appraisals on each property that support the carrying costs of these properties at december  no assurances can be given that further charges to earnings may not occur if southern california real estate values continue to decrease  and the bank cannot promptly dispose of the properties held

liquidity management includes projections of future sources and uses of funds to insure the availability of sufficient liquid reserves to provide for unanticipated circumstances 
for the bank  sources of funds normally include principal payments on loans and investments  other borrowed funds  and growth in deposits 
uses of funds include withdrawal of deposits  interest paid on deposits  increased loan balances  purchases  and other operating expenses 
the bank maintains funds as overnight federal funds sold and other short term investment securities to provide for short term liquidity needs 
in addition  the bank maintains short term unsecured lines of credit with correspondent banks to provide for contingent liquidity needs 
other borrowed funds averaged million for the year ended december  this represented an increase of million over average borrowed funds of million for the year ended december  the increased borrowing for is primarily the result of a secured short term loan from the federal home loan bank 
borrowed funds were used to purchase investment securities at a positive net interest spread 
net cash provided by operating activities  primarily representing net interest income  totaled million for  million for  and million for financing activities were primarily comprised of increased time certificates of deposits of million  short term borrowed funds of million  and a decrease in noninterest bearing deposits and money market and savings accounts of million

liquid assets represented of total assets at december  since the primary sources and uses of funds for the bank are loans and deposits  the relationship between gross loans and total deposits provides a useful measure of the bank s liquidity 
typically  the closer the ratio of loans to deposits is to  the more reliant the bank is on its loan portfolio to provide for short term liquidity needs 
since repayment of loans tends to be less predictable than the maturity of investments and other liquid resources  the higher the loan to deposit ratio the less liquid are the bank s assets 
for  the bank s loan to deposit ratio averaged  compared to an average of for and an average of for the liquidity ratio provides another measure of the bank s liquidity 
this ratio is calculated by dividing the difference between short term liquid assets less short term volatile liabilities by the sum of loans and long term investments 
this ratio measures the percentage of illiquid long term assets that are being funded by short term volatile liabilities 
at december   this ratio was  compared to at december   and  at december  cvb is a company separate and apart from the bank that must provide for its own liquidity 
substantially all of cvb s revenues are obtained from dividends declared and paid by the bank 
there are statutory and regulatory provisions that could limit the ability of the bank to pay dividends to cvb 
at december   approximately million of the bank s equity was unrestricted and available to be paid as dividends to cvb 
management of cvb believes that such restrictions will not have an impact on the ability of cvb to meet its ongoing cash obligations 
as of december   neither the bank nor cvb had any material commitments for capital expenditures
