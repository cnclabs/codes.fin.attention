item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors affecting future performance the industry and competition 
the interactive software business has historically been a volatile and highly dynamic industry affected by changing technology  limited hardware platform life cycles  hit products  competition  component supplies  seasonality  consumer spending and other economic trends 
the business is also intensely competitive 
a variety of companies offer products that compete directly with one or more of the company s products 
these direct competitors vary in size from very small companies to companies with financial  managerial and technical resources comparable to or greater than those of the company 
typically  the company s chief competitor on dedicated game platforms is the hardware manufacturer licenser itself  to which the company must pay royalties  and in the case of sony and nintendo  manufacturing charges 
for example  sony has aggressively launched sports product lines that directly compete with the company s sports products on the playstation 
in addition  competition for creative talent has intensified  and the attraction and retention of key personnel by the company is increasingly difficult 
products 
interactive entertainment software products typically have life spans of only to months 
in addition  the market is crowded with a large number of titles competing for limited shelf space at retail 
the company s future success will depend in large part on its ability to develop and introduce new competitive products on a timely basis and to get those products distributed widely at retail 
to compete successfully  new products must adapt to new hardware platforms and emerging industry standards  provide additional functionality and be successfully distributed in numerous changing worldwide markets 
if the company were unable  due to resource constraints or technological or other reasons  to successfully develop and distribute such products in a timely manner  this inability would have a material adverse effect on its operating results and financial condition 
development 
product development schedules  particularly for new hardware platforms and high end multimedia pc s are difficult to predict because they involve creative processes  use of new development tools for new platforms and the learning process  research and experimentation associated with development for new technologies 
cd rom products frequently include more content and are more complex  time consuming and costly to develop than cartridge products and  accordingly  cause additional development and scheduling risk 
for example  wing commander iv  a major product scheduled to ship for the pc platform in the december quarter  did not ship until february   due to delays in the final editing and testing process 
similarly  john madden football and nhl hockey for the sony playstation did not ship at all due to significant delays in development that made the delayed completion date untimely for these products 
because of the increased cost of compact disk product development  write offs of advance payments made to outside artists for discontinued or unsuccessful products have and may continue to increase 
in addition  development risks for cd rom products can cause particular difficulties in predicting quarterly results because brief manufacturing lead times allow finalizing products and projected release dates late in a quarter 
manufacturing lead times during the year for cd based products have been as brief as one to three weeks  cartridge products more typically have had a six to twelve week lead time for manufacture 
platform changes 
a large portion of the company s revenues are derived from the sale of products designed to be played on proprietary videogame platforms such as the sony playstation  sega saturn  super nintendo entertainment system and sega genesis 
the interdependent nature of the company s business and that of its hardware licensers brings significant risks to the company s business 
the success of the company s products is significantly affected by market acceptance of the new videogame hardware systems and the life span of older hardware platforms  and the company s ability to accurately predict these factors with respect to each platform 
in many cases  the company will have expended a large amount of development and marketing resources on products designed for new videogame systems such as the new bit systems that have not yet achieved large installed bases or continued product development for older hardware platforms that may have shorter life cycles than the company expected 
conversely  if the company does not choose to develop for a platform that achieves significant market acceptance  or discontinues development for a platform that has a longer life cycle than expected  the company s revenue growth may be adversely affected 
hardware companies 
the company s contracts with hardware licensers  which are also some of the company s chief competitors  often grant significant control to the licenser over the manufacturing of the company s products 
this fact could  in certain circumstances  leave the company unable to get its products manufactured and shipped to customers 
in most events  control of the manufacturing process by hardware companies increases both the manufacturing lead times and the expense to company over the lead times and costs that the company can achieve independently 
in fiscal  for example  the company experienced delays in the manufacturing of sony playstation products which caused delays in shipping those products 
the results of future periods may be affected by similar delays 
finally  the company s contracts with its hardware licensers often require the company to take significant risks in holding or prepaying for its inventory of products 
revenue and expenses 
a substantial majority of the revenue of the company in any quarter typically results from orders received in that quarter and products introduced in that quarter 
the company s expenses are based  in part  on development of products to be released in the future 
certain overhead and product development expenses do not vary directly in relation to revenues 
as a result  the company s quarterly results of operations are difficult to predict  and small delays in product deliveries may cause quarterly revenues  operating results and net income to fall significantly below anticipated levels 
the company typically receives orders shortly before shipments  making backlog an unreliable indicator of quarterly results 
a shortfall in shipments at the end of any particular quarter may cause the results of that quarter to fall significantly short of anticipated levels 
in addition  due in part to the volume of products introduced into the market and the short shelf life of most products  there is increasing pressure from retailers to offer price protection and accept returns of retailers excess inventory 
film and videotape 
the company produces film and videotape to include in certain products pursuant to agreements between certain of the company s subsidiaries with sag  aftra and equity 
however  the costs of video production are significantly higher than for software production  and for products which include a substantial amount of video such as certain interactive movies  the costs of producing the video component is significantly higher than the cost of developing the software component 
for example  the film component of wing commander iv cost approximately million 
accordingly  more units of such products must be sold to recoup the development and production costs 
while wing commander iv has sold sufficient units to recoup the full costs of development  there can be no assurances that other products including significant film or videotape components be commercially successful enough to recoup development costs 
in addition  the company s agreements with sag and aftra expire during the current calendar year  and there can be no assurances that the company will be able to renegotiate favorable terms 
employees 
competition for employees in the interactive software business is intense and increasing as competition in the industry increases 
in the last fiscal year  recruiting of the company s employees generally and its executive officers in particular has been severe 
large software and media companies frequently offer significantly larger cash compensation than does the company  placing pressure on the company s base salary and cash bonus compensation 
small start up companies such as those proliferating in the on line business areas offer significant potential equity gains which are difficult for more mature companies like the company to match without significant shareholder dilution 
in the last eighteen months  three of the company s executive officers have resigned to work with small start up ventures  and virtually all of the executives are under intense recruiting pressure 
there can be no assurances that the company will be able to continue to attract and retain enough qualified employees in the future 
none of the company s employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement  and the company believes that its employee relations are excellent 
fluctuations in stock price 
due to analysts expectations of continued growth and other factors  any shortfall in earnings could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock in any given period 
as a result of the factors discussed in this annual report and other factors that may arise in the future  the market price of the company s common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations over a short period of time 
these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to the company  to changes in analysts earnings estimates  or to factors affecting the computer  software  entertainment  media or electronics industries or the securities markets in general 
because of the foregoing factors  as well as other factors affecting the company s operating results and financial condition  past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods
