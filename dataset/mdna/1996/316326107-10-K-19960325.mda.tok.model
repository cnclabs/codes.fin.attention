other factors affecting real estate activity include demand  mortgage interest rates  family income levels and general economic conditions 
while the level of sales activity was relatively depressed in certain geographical areas during the period through mid  lower mortgage interest rates beginning in the latter part of triggered an increase in refinancing activity which continued at record levels through and into the first quarter of during and early  steady interest rate increases caused by actions taken by the federal reserve board resulted in a significant decline in refinancing transactions and a stagnation in residential resales and new home sales

the following table sets forth information regarding title related revenue derived from direct operations and title related revenue derived from agency operations years ended december  of total of total of total dollars in thousands revenue from direct operations title insurance premiums    escrow fees    other title related fees and revenue    total    revenue from agency operations title insurance premiums    total title related revenue    during  and   and  respectively  of total title related revenue excluding interest and investment income and non title related other fees and revenue was generated from direct operations 
the company focuses on direct operations because it retains the entire premium from each transaction and is able to generate additional sources of revenue by providing other title related services 
the fluctuation in the percentage of revenue generated by direct operations versus the percentage of revenue generated by agency operations between and is due to several factors 
during  the company terminated a number of agency relationships based on the company s agency retention criteria 
the company continually monitors agency relationships for quality and productivity 
audits of agents are conducted on a periodic basis  and agents which do not meet the company s standards are not retained 
in addition  during  the company acquired certain former agents which were converted to direct operations 
see recent developments 
finally  in certain states where a significant amount of premium volume was generated  the company operates on a direct basis 
during agency operations generated a slightly larger percentage of total title related revenue as compared to  primarily as a result of the increased contributions made by fidelity pennsylvania  atic and fidelity new york 
the company s strategy of expanding into selected geographic markets through the acquisition of title insurance operations continued during the last three years 
the company s acquisition strategy includes the restructuring of acquired operations by focusing on direct operations in residential resale and refinance markets  enhancing sales and marketing efforts  minimizing net claim payments through stringent quality controls and effectively managing overhead costs 
results of operations revenue 
the following table presents information regarding the components of the company s revenue years ended december  dollars in thousands  other than fee per file title insurance premiums    escrow fees    other fees and revenue    interest and investment income  including realized gains losses    total revenue    orders closed by direct operations    average fee per file from direct operations favorable mortgage interest rates in the latter part of through early triggered refinancing activity at record levels 
beginning in early through mid  steady interest rate increases caused by actions taken by the federal reserve board resulted in a significant decline in refinancing transactions and a stagnation in residential resales and new home sales 
title orders and requests for title related services followed the market trend as expected 
since late  decreases in mortgage interest rates and the resulting improvement in the real estate market have had a positive impact on the level of real estate activity 
these factors have resulted in title premiums of million  million and million  for  and  respectively 
the difference in title insurance premiums between and of million represents a decrease of 
title insurance premiums decreased million  or  in from the average fee per file increased to in from in  which had previously increased from in the increase can be attributed to the change in the mix of business from refinance to resale 
as mortgage interest rates increased due to the actions taken by the federal reserve board  the refinancing trend ended 
thus  title business that was generated was primarily related to new home sale or resale transactions  which typically charge higher fees than refinancing transactions 
fees generated from refinancing transactions are generally less than fees generated from resale transactions because the base rate charged on such a policy is usually lower 
furthermore  one policy is issued to a lender in a refinance transaction and two policies are issued in a resale transaction buyer and lender 
the company s direct operations generate escrow fees from holding funds and documents in connection with the closing of real estate transactions  as well as other fees and revenue 
other fees and revenue primarily include document preparation fees  reconveyance fees  real estate information fees  foreclosure publishing and posting fees  exchange intermediary fees and fees received by acs systems  inc see note b of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the trends in escrow fees are primarily related to the title insurance activity generated by the company s direct operations 
escrow fees have fluctuated during the  and years in a pattern generally consistent with the fluctuation in title insurance premiums 
escrow fees have decreased million to million in  a decrease from million in the percentage decrease in escrow fees is not as significant as the percentage decrease in title premiums due to the change in the direct operation agency business mix 
see overview 
escrow fees decreased million  or  in from to million from million 
the decrease in escrow fees in from is greater than the decrease in title insurance premiums due to the increase in agency title insurance premiums as a percentage of total title related revenue 
agency title insurance premiums do not generate escrow fees for the company 
other fees and revenue remained relatively stable during the three year period ended december  during  other fees and revenue decreased million  or  to million from million in and decreased million  or  to million from million in other fees and revenue were generated at comparable levels in and  primarily as a result of the type of business in  which was primarily resale business  and the direct operation agency business mix 
see overview 
direct operations generate other fees and income 
thus  even in a year when overall title revenue may be down  the level of other fees and revenue can be maintained  depending on the direct operation agency business mix 
the consistency between years is primarily attributable to the nature of the revenues included and the current title insurance market environment which has shifted from a refinance to a resale oriented market 
see recent developments 
in a resale transaction  other fees and revenues are greater than in a refinancing transaction 
interest and investment income levels are primarily a function of securities markets  interest rates and the amount of cash available for investment 
during  interest and investment income increased million  or  to million from million in the tax adjusted yield decreased slightly  to in compared to in  while average invested assets  excluding real estate  decreased  or million  to million in from million in the difference in investment results is primarily attributable to the net capital gains losses recorded in versus during  the company recognized million in capital gains compared to million in capital losses recognized in included in the gain amount is a net million gain realized upon the sale of the company s us facilities corporation common stock holdings during the third quarter of see recent developments

see extraordinary item 
million of capital gains realized on the sale of assets  primarily fixed maturity and equity securities  are included in interest and investment income for the year 
see note c of notes to consolidated financial statements

during  due to favorable market prices and the company s belief that the company s common stock and lyons represent excellent investments  the board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to million shares of its common stock or a comparable amount of its lyons which are convertible into shares of common stock per  maturity of lyons 
in accordance with this authorization  the company purchased million principal amount of lyons at an average purchase price of per  maturity of lyons 
as a result of the lyons purchase transactions  the company recorded an extraordinary gain on the early retirement of debt of million  net of the related income tax effect

the percentage of agent premiums retained by the company has increased in each of the last three years primarily due to the company s expansion of operations outside of california into states where underwriters retained premiums are generally greater 
as the company continues to expand its operations in markets outside california  the company believes it may retain a larger percentage of agent premiums 
the provision for claim losses includes an estimate of anticipated title claims and major claims 
the estimate of anticipated title claims is accrued as a percentage of title premium revenue based on the company s historical loss experience and other relevant factors 
the company monitors its claims experience on a continual basis and adjusts the provision for claim losses accordingly 
based on company loss development studies  the company believes that as a result of its underwriting and claims handling practices  as well as the refinancing business of prior years  the company will maintain the trend of favorable claim loss experience 
based on this information  in and the company recorded a provision for claim losses of of title insurance premiums prior to major claim expense  net of recoupments and the impact of premium rates and company loss experience in the state of texas

two of the significant sources of the company s funds are dividends and distributions from its subsidiaries 
as a holding company  the company receives cash from its subsidiaries in the form of dividends and as reimbursement for operating and other administrative expenses it incurs 
the reimbursements are executed within the guidelines of various management agreements among the company and its subsidiaries 
fluctuations in operating cash flows are primarily the result of increases or decreases in revenue 
see overview 
the company s insurance subsidiaries and utcs collect premiums and pay claims and operating expenses 
the insurance subsidiaries also have cash flow sources derived from investment income  repayments of principal and proceeds from sales and maturities of investments and dividends from subsidiaries 
positive cash flow from insurance subsidiaries is invested primarily in short term investments and medium term bonds 
short term investments held by the company s insurance subsidiaries provide liquidity for projected claims and operating expenses 
the insurance subsidiaries are restricted by state regulations in their ability to pay dividends and make distributions 
each state of domicile regulates the extent to which the company s six title underwriters can pay dividends or make other distributions to the company 
the utcs are also regulated by insurance regulatory or banking authorities 
positive cash flow from the utcs is invested primarily in cash and cash equivalents 
the short and long term liquidity requirements of the company  insurance subsidiaries and utcs are monitored regularly to match cash inflows with cash requirements 
the company  insurance subsidiaries and utcs forecast their daily cash needs and periodically review their short and long term projected sources and uses of funds  as well as the asset  liability  investment and cash flow assumptions underlying these projections 
for purposes of satisfying insurance regulatory requirements  the company is required to maintain certain levels of readily marketable securities and other liquid assets

no such release has yet been executed 
the company does not believe that manchester will require additional capital contributions from the company that will materially impact liquidity  nor will manchester s operations materially impact the company s results of operations 
in the normal course of business certain of the company s subsidiaries enter into off balance sheet credit risk associated with certain aspects of its title insurance policies and manchester s real estate activities 
this credit risk is in the form of standby letters of credit and general partnership guarantees 
the company believes that this credit risk is adequately secured by either legal remedies associated with settlement procedures or the underlying real estate assets

opinion 
however  the statement does not require an entity to adopt the new fair value based method for purposes of preparing its basic financial statements 
entities are allowed to continue to use the opinion method or to adopt the statement fair value based method 
once the fair value based method is adopted  an entity cannot change back to the opinion method

the statement fair value based method will result in higher compensation cost than the opinion intrinsic value based method for fixed stock option compensation plans and will result in a different compensation cost for variable stock option compensation plans 
sometimes the amount will be higher and sometimes the amount will be lower 
also  many employee stock purchase plans that are considered noncompensatory under opinion will be compensatory and result in the recognition of compensation costs under the fair value based method 
for entities not adopting the statement fair value based method  the statement creates a unique financial reporting situation 
it requires entities that retain the opinion method for preparing their basic financial statements to display in the footnotes pro forma net income and earnings per share information as if the fair value based method had been adopted
