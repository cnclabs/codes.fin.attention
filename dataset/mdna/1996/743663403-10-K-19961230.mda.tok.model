protection one provides security alarm monitoring services for residential and small business subscribers 
based on its  subscribers as of september  approximately of which are residential  protection one believes it is the fourth largest residential security alarm monitoring company in the united states and the largest in the seven western states of arizona  california  nevada  new mexico  oregon  utah and washington 
the company s revenues consist primarily of recurring payments under written contracts for the monitoring and servicing of security systems and the provision of additional enhanced security services 
for the year ended september  fiscal  monitoring and service revenues represented of total revenues 
the company monitors digital signals arising from burglaries  fires and other events through security systems installed at subscribers premises 
most of these signals are received and processed at the company s state of the art central monitoring station located in portland  oregon  which  as currently configured  has the capacity to support up to  subscribers 
the company also sells enhanced security services  patrol and alarm response services and alarm systems and provides local field repair services through branch offices 
enhanced security services provided by the company include  among others  two way voice communication  supervised monitoring services  pager service  medical identification card  wireless backup service and extended service protection 
from the company s inception  the company s growth has come primarily through the acquisition of portfolios of subscriber accounts 
between september  and september   the company acquired subscriber portfolios  representing an aggregate of approximately  subscribers 
management believes that numerous acquisition opportunities continue to be available  and the company is pursuing  and intends to continue to pursue  acquisitions of portfolios of subscriber accounts  some of which may be significant 
since the beginning of fiscal  the company has increased its emphasis on the dealer program  which has become a more significant source of growth than in prior years 
in fiscal  for instance  subscribers generated by the dealer program comprised of the company s total subscriber additions  compared to in fiscal the company plans to continue its emphasis on the dealer program because of the greater predictability  expected lower attrition and relatively lower cost of adding subscribers through its dealers as compared with acquisitions of larger portfolios of subscriber accounts 
in addition  the dealer program generates a comparatively steady flow of new subscribers spread more evenly over the company s branch offices  making it easier for the company s branch operations to successfully assimilate these accounts 
see the dealer program 
market overview and trends the company s target market consists of owners of single family residences and small businesses 
according to the most recent us census bureau data  there are over million single family residences and over  businesses with or fewer employees in the seven states in which the company operates 
the security alarm industry is characterized by the following attributes high degree of fragmentation 
the security alarm industry is currently comprised mostly of a large number of small providers of alarm systems and services 
according to certain data concerning the residential security alarm market prepared in december by the j 
p 
freeman co 
the freeman data  there are approximately  security alarm companies nationally  and the company estimates that approximately  operate in the seven states the company currently serves 
a survey published by sdm magazine formerly security distributing and marketing in may reported that in  based upon information provided by the respondents  the largest companies in the industry accounted for approximately of alarm industry revenues 
based on its acquisition experience  the company believes that many smaller alarm service companies  because of their size  have higher overhead expenses as a percentage of revenues than the company and lack access to capital on terms as attractive as those available to the company 
due to a decline in security system installation prices over the last two years  security alarm companies participating in market growth are required today to make a substantial investment in each new subscriber 
as a result  access to capital has become an increasingly important factor in a security alarm company s success 
rapid growth and low penetration 
the residential security alarm market is growing rapidly but is still characterized by a low level of market penetration 
the freeman data indicate that residential security alarm monitoring revenues grew at a compounded annual rate of between and the company believes that several factors  including increased concern about crime and favorable demographic trends  have contributed to the increased demand for residential security alarm services 
in addition  based on the freeman data  the company estimates that at november  the percentage of total households in the united states with monitored security alarm systems was approximately 
advances in digital communications technology 
prior to the development of digital communications technology  alarm monitoring required a dedicated telephone line  which made long distance monitoring uneconomic 
consequently  in order to achieve a national or regional presence  alarm monitoring companies were required to maintain a large number of geographically dispersed monitoring stations 
the development of digital communications technology eliminated the need for dedicated telephone lines  reducing the cost of monitoring services to the subscriber and permitting the monitoring of subscriber accounts over a wide geographic area from a central monitoring station 
the elimination of local monitoring stations has decreased the cost of providing alarm monitoring services and has substantially increased the economies of scale for larger alarm service companies 
in addition  the concurrent development of microprocessor based control panels has substantially reduced the cost of the equipment available to subscribers in the residential and small business markets 
digital technology has also enabled equipment manufacturers to build more features into security systems ie  remote user interface  lighting and heating controls  user programming features 
increasing false alarms 
according to american city county magazine  police officers respond to more than million alarm activations annually  to of which are false 
the magazine reports that while alarm ownership is increasing by annually  police department budgets are rising by annually 
municipalities have responded to increasing false alarms by implementing alarm permit and fine systems and by limiting police response to private alarms until further verified by another response entity 
the company believes this trend will continue in the future 
entrance of telecommunications companies and utilities 
large  consumer oriented companies in industries facing deregulation  including long distance and local telephone companies and electric and gas utilities  have demonstrated an increased interest in the security alarm industry over the last several years 
for instance  in october  the ameritech corporation  a regional bell operating company  completed the acquisition of national guardian corp  and in december  western resources  an electric utility  announced an agreement to acquire westinghouse security systems 
these two acquisitions are the largest in the security industry as of the date of this annual report on form k 
the company believes telecommunication and utility companies are interested in offering their customers additional services  including security services  as a means of enhancing customer loyalty and reducing future risk of losing customers in a fully competitive environment 
the company believes that several factors contribute to a favorable market for security alarm services both generally in the united states and specifically in the western portion of the country increase in crime rates 
according to the uniform crime report published by the federal bureau of investigation in the ucr  between and the number of violent crimes reported in the united states increased by and the total number of reported criminal offenses increased by 
the ucr also reported that although the number of reported criminal offenses decreased on a nationwide basis from to by  a property crime was committed in the united states in once every three seconds 
in the states in which the company operates  the property crime rate in was higher than the nation as a whole  averaging approximately  property crimes per  residents 
in california  protection one s largest market  the property crime and overall crimes rates were and  respectively  above the national averages 
high level of concern about crime 
as violent crime and the reporting of crime by the news media has increased  the perception by americans that crime is a significant problem has also grown 
in a december poll conducted by the wall street journal  survey participants ranked reducing crime as one of the two highest priorities for congress 
per capita police protection 
the ucr reported that urban areas in the western region of the united states had the lowest ratio of law enforcement employees per capita of the four reporting regions in  the most recent period for which a ucr has been published 
according to population and law enforcement employee data presented in the ucr  in los angeles had law enforcement employees per  citizens  while new york had and chicago had the number of law enforcement employees per  citizens was for las vegas  for phoenix  for portland  for salt lake city  for san diego  for san francisco  for seattle and for tucson 
demographic trends 
according to the united states census bureau  from to the rate of population growth in the states in which the company operates was approximately twice the national average 
according to the united states department of commerce  median income in california has been above the national average since other recent trends that are favorable to the residential security alarm business include the increase in women in the workforce resulting in more children being left at home alone and creating increased demand for security alarm services  the aging of the population in general  as older people tend to be more concerned about security  and the increase in people working at home  resulting in increasing demand for security services to protect home office equipment 
insurance discounts 
the increase in demand for security systems may also be attributable in part to the granting by insurance companies of discounts to homeowners who purchase alarm systems  and such discounts are typically greater when systems are monitored by a central station 
in addition  insurance companies may require that businesses install an alarm system as a condition of insurance coverage 
business strategy the company s strategy is to enhance its position as the largest residential security alarm monitoring company in the seven western states in which it operates by pursuing a balanced growth plan incorporating the dealer program  acquisitions of portfolios of subscribers  joint ventures and other strategic alliances and the sale of enhanced services and new alarm systems 
the company s historical growth has enabled it to realize economies of scale in its central monitoring station  branch operations and corporate offices 
as the number of subscribers monitored by the company has increased  the fixed costs of the central monitoring station have been spread over a larger base  improving monitoring gross margins 
additionally  subscribers have been added in areas surrounding the company s branch offices ie  increasing the density of the company s subscriber base  allowing the company to spread the branch office fixed costs over a larger base and increasing the productivity of field service technicians through more efficient scheduling and dispatching 
based on the company s subscriber base at september   the company services an average of over  subscribers per branch  which it believes to be among the highest averages in the security industry 
finally  the company s revenue growth has exceeded the growth of its selling  general and administrative expenses  as the company has realized management efficiencies and has spread additional revenue over its fixed corporate expenses 
such economies of scale have allowed the company to add subscriber accounts at attractive purchase prices 
the principal components of the company s business strategy are as follows the dealer program 
the company participates in the growth of the residential security alarm market by providing monitoring and field repair services to subscriber accounts generated on a monthly basis through exclusive purchase agreements with independent alarm companies specializing in the sale and installation of new alarm systems 
the company added approximately  subscriber accounts through its dealer program in fiscal  an increase of approximately over the approximately  subscribers added through the dealer program in fiscal as of september   the company had active participants in the dealer program 
the company believes that participation in the dealer program will expand due to i the company s concentrated presence in areas surrounding its branch offices  which enhances the company s name recognition and therefore the marketability of the company s services  ii the company s ability to obtain volume purchase discounts on security system equipment on behalf of its dealers  iii the company s support services provided to dealers in the areas of administration  marketing and employee training  and iv the company s ability to generate new customer leads through affinity programs and strategic alliances 
acquisitions of portfolios of subscriber accounts 
the company also grows by acquiring subscriber accounts from smaller alarm companies 
these acquisitions represented approximately   and  subscribers in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company typically acquires only the subscriber accounts  and not the facilities or liabilities  of such companies 
as a result  the company is able to obtain gross margins on the monitoring of acquired subscriber accounts that are similar to those the company currently generates on the monitoring of its existing subscriber base 
in addition  the company institutes price increases over time for acquired subscriber accounts where the company determines that the charges previously paid by those subscribers do not appropriately reflect the higher quality of services to be provided by the company 
joint ventures and other strategic alliances 
to evaluate other potential sources of subscriber growth  the company analyzes companies in other industries that may have an interest in entering the residential security alarm market 
in addition  as mentioned above  certain companies in industries facing deregulation such as the telecommunications and electric utility industries have expressed to the company an interest in offering security alarm services to develop more comprehensive relationships with their customers 
the company has entered into a co branding arrangement with pacificorp  a portland  oregon based utility holding company  and an affinity marketing relationship with kaufman broad home corporation  the largest homebuilder in the company s markets 
in addition  the company is discussing with certain other companies  and intends to continue to explore  additional joint ventures  co marketing arrangements and other strategic alliances as a method of enhancing its subscriber growth and reducing its costs of generating new subscribers 
as of the filing of this annual report on form k  the company does not believe that any such joint venture or other strategic alliance is probable 
sale of enhanced services  patrol and alarm response services 
the company seeks to increase revenues from current and newly added subscribers by actively marketing enhanced services to such subscribers 
such services include extended service protection  two way voice communication  supervised monitoring services  pager service  medical identification card and wireless back up 
the company also offers patrol and alarm response services  principally in southern california and las vegas 
conversions  new owners and new alarm systems 
the company seeks to convert subscribers from competitors services to the company s services  particularly in areas in which the company s patrol and alarm response services enhance the company s presence and name recognition 
the company also generates new subscriber accounts by signing monitoring contracts with new owners of residences previously occupied by protection one subscribers and through sales of alarm systems by its own personnel 
the company believes the successful execution of its growth strategy will lead to increases in subscribers and high margin monitoring revenues in excess of the growth in selling  general and administrative expenses 
for instance  in fiscal  monitoring and service revenues increased by while selling  general and administrative expenses increased by 
see selected consolidated financial data in item in addition  the company intends to continue to grow primarily in the areas surrounding its branch offices 
as the density of its subscriber account base in such areas increases  the company expects to achieve further economies of scale in the scheduling and dispatching of field service technicians and alarm response officers 
the dealer program the dealers the company selects for the dealer program are small alarm companies that specialize in selling and installing alarm systems for residential or small business subscribers  as well as specialized direct sales companies 
such companies often cannot profitably provide monitoring and repair services because they lack a sufficient number of subscribers to support the fixed operating expenses associated with such services 
also  many dealers do not have access to capital on attractive terms  a key factor that the company believes is necessary to finance the investment required to grow rapidly 
the company enters into exclusive contracts with such dealers that provide for the purchase by the company of the dealers subscriber accounts on an ongoing basis 
the dealers install alarm systems which have a protection one logo on the keypad  arrange for subscribers to enter into protection one alarm monitoring agreements  and install protection one yard signs and window decals 
all of these subscribers are contacted individually by company personnel  at the time of the purchase of the accounts from the dealers  to facilitate subscriber satisfaction and quality control 
in addition  the company requires dealers to evaluate the credit history of prospective new subscribers 
the company strives to provide quality  responsive field service to accounts purchased from dealers  the company s principal competitors often subcontract the field service of subscriber accounts they purchase  which the company believes increases attrition rates and may dissuade dealers from selling their subscriber accounts to such competitors 
the company believes that its increased market share in the areas surrounding its branch offices has enhanced both the company s ability to attract dealers and the ability of such dealers to attract new subscribers 
to further attract high quality dealers  the company enables them to obtain volume purchase discounts on security systems  coordinates cooperative dealer advertising  and provides administrative  marketing and employee training support services 
the company s dealers employ a variety of marketing methods to identify and create sales leads  including telemarketing  direct mail and door to door solicitation 
in addition  in certain markets  the company has organized a cooperative television advertising effort through which dealers make voluntary contributions to an advertising fund in exchange for sales leads generated by such advertising 
the majority of the company s dealers sell and install a hard wired  low cost security system manufactured by ademco  a subsidiary of pittway corporation 
the typical system includes protection of the front and back doors of a home  one interior motion detection device  a central processing unit with the ability to communicate signals to the company s central monitoring station  a siren  window decals and a lawn sign 
this basic system often will be offered for little or no up front price  but will be sold to a subscriber with additional equipment customized to a subscriber s specific needs 
such equipment add ons encompass additional perimeter protection  fire protection devices heat and smoke detectors  environmental protection devices freeze sensors and water detectors  panic buttons and home automation devices lighting or appliance controls 
typically  dealers sign subscribers to alarm monitoring contracts that include a bundled monthly charge for monitoring and extended service protection 
extended service protection covers the normal costs of repair of the security system by the company s service technicians at the subscriber s premises during normal business hours after the expiration of the security system s initial warranty period 
although a customer may elect to sign an alarm monitoring contract that excludes extended service protection  few customers choose to do so  and the company believes the bundling of monitoring and extended service protection provides additional value to subscribers and allows the company to more efficiently provide field repair services 
dealers also sell the company s enhanced services 
the acquisition program the company also seeks to grow by acquiring portfolios of subscriber accounts from other alarm companies 
the company focuses on acquisitions that allow it to infill areas surrounding branch operations  which in turn leads to greater field maintenance  repair and patrol efficiencies 
the company estimates there are approximately  alarm companies in its markets  substantially all of which are independently owned and may  from time to time  become acquisition targets 
the company believes that it is an effective competitor in the acquisition market because of the substantial experience of its management in acquiring alarm companies and subscriber accounts  both as a result of the acquisitions made by the company between september  and september  and acquisitions made by members of management when they were employed by other alarm service companies 
the company also believes that  through its acquisition activities  it has developed a reputation in the alarm service industry as an active purchaser of subscriber accounts 
although most acquisitions add subscribers in the company s existing market areas to achieve greater account density  the company may also make acquisitions outside these areas 
because the company s primary consideration in making an acquisition is the amount of cash flow that can be derived from the mrr associated with the purchased accounts  the price paid by the company is customarily based upon such mrr 
to protect the company against the loss of acquired accounts and to encourage the seller of such accounts to facilitate the transfer of subscribers  management typically requires the seller to provide guarantees against account cancellations for a period following the acquisition 
the company usually holds back from the seller a portion of the acquisition price  and has the contractual right to utilize such holdback to recapture a portion of the purchase price based on the lost mrr arising from the cancellation of acquired accounts 
in evaluating the quality of the accounts acquired  the company relies primarily on management s knowledge of the industry  its due diligence procedures  its experience integrating accounts into the company s operations  its assumptions as to attrition rates for the acquired accounts  and the representations and warranties of the sellers 
the acquisition management system the company employs a comprehensive acquisition management system to identify  evaluate  and assimilate acquisitions of new subscriber accounts that includes three components i the identification and negotiation stage  ii the due diligence stage  and iii the assimilation stage 
the company actively seeks to identify prospective companies and dealers with targeted direct mail  trade magazine advertising  trade show participation  membership in key alarm industry trade organizations  and contacts through various prominent vendors and other industry participants 
management s extensive experience in identifying and negotiating previous acquisitions  and the company s use of standard form agreements  help to facilitate the successful negotiation and execution of acquisitions in a timely manner 
the company conducts an extensive pre closing review and analysis of all facets of the seller s operations 
the process includes a combination of selective field equipment inspections  individual review of substantially all of the subscriber contracts  an analysis of the rights and obligations under such contracts and other types of verification of the seller s operations 
the company develops a specific assimilation program  in conjunction with the seller  for each acquisition 
assimilation efforts typically include a letter  approved by the company  from the seller to its subscribers  explaining the sale and transition  followed by one or more letters and packages that include the company s subscriber service brochures  field service and monitoring phone number stickers  yard signs and window decals 
thereafter  each new subscriber is contacted individually by telephone by a member of the company s customer service group for the purpose of soliciting certain information and addressing the subscriber s questions or concerns 
finally  the subscriber receives a follow up telephone call after six months and periodically thereafter 
the acquisition management system s goal is to enhance new subscriber identification with protection one as the service provider and to maintain subscriber satisfaction  and thus realize a higher portion of the potential value of the mrr generated by purchased subscriber accounts 
description of operations the company s operations consist principally of alarm monitoring services  enhanced security services  field repair services and patrol and alarm response services 
alarm monitoring services subscriber security alarm systems 
security alarm systems include devices installed at the subscribers premises designed to detect or react to various occurrences or conditions  such as intrusion or the presence of fire or smoke 
these devices are connected to a computerized control panel that communicates through telephone lines to a central monitoring station 
subscribers may also initiate an emergency signal from a device such as a panic button 
in most systems  control panels can identify the nature of the alarm and the areas within a building where the sensor was activated  and can transmit that information to the central monitoring station 
the central monitoring station 
the company monitors substantially all of its subscriber accounts at its central monitoring station in portland  oregon 
in addition  in connection with certain acquisitions  the monitoring of certain subscriber accounts is subcontracted to independent monitoring companies to comply with certain state regulations 
however  it is the company s policy to transfer all monitoring services for its acquired subscriber accounts to its central monitoring station as soon as practicable 
the central monitoring station incorporates the use of advanced communications and computer systems that route incoming alarm signals and telephone calls to operators 
each operator sits before a computer monitor that provides immediate information concerning the nature of the alarm signal  the subscriber whose alarm has been activated  and the premises on which such alarm is located 
all telephone conversations are automatically recorded 
the central monitoring station has the capacity to monitor up to  subscribers and its capacity can be increased to  subscribers for a cost of approximately  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources included in item the equipment at the central monitoring station includes sophisticated phone switching equipment  digital receivers that process the incoming signals  two computers with built in redundancy  a network of smart computer terminals  a multi channel  voice activated recording system  uninterruptable power supply  and dual backup generators supplied by different fuel sources 
the company s central monitoring station is listed by underwriters laboratories inc ul as a protective signaling services station 
ul specifications for central monitoring stations include building integrity  back up systems  staffing and standard operating procedures 
in many jurisdictions  applicable law requires that security alarms for certain buildings be monitored by ul listed facilities 
in addition  such listing is required by certain commercial subscribers insurance companies as a condition to insurance coverage 
operation of the central monitoring station 
depending upon the type of service for which the subscriber has contracted  central monitoring station personnel respond to alarms by relaying information to the local fire or police departments  notifying the subscriber  or taking other appropriate action  such as dispatching alarm response personnel to the subscriber s premises where this service is available 
the company also provides a substantial number of subscribers with remote audio verification capability that enables the central monitoring station to listen and speak directly into the subscriber s premises in the event of an alarm activation 
this feature allows the company s personnel to verify that an emergency exists  to reassure the subscriber  and to expedite emergency response  even if the subscriber is unable to reach a telephone 
remote audio verification capability also assists the company in quickly determining if the alarm was activated inadvertently  and thus whether a response is required 
the company s central monitoring station operates hours per day  seven days a week  including all holidays 
each operator receives training that includes familiarization with substantially every type of alarm system in the company s subscriber base 
this enables the operator to tell subscribers how to turn off their systems in the event of a false alarm  thus reducing the instances in which a field service person must be dispatched 
other non emergency administrative signals are generated by low battery status  deactivation and reactivation of the alarm monitoring system  and test signals  and are processed automatically by computer 
subscriber contracts 
the company s alarm monitoring subscriber contracts generally have initial terms ranging from one to five years in duration  and provide for automatic renewal for a fixed period typically one year unless the company or the subscriber elects to cancel the contract at the end of its term 
the company maintains an individual file with a signed copy of the contract for each of its subscribers and a computerized customer data base 
substantially all of the company s alarm monitoring agreements for the company s residential subscribers which constitute approximately of the company s total accounts provide for subscriber payments of between and per month 
the company s commercial subscribers typically pay from to per month 
in the normal course of its business  the company experiences customer cancellations of monitoring and related services as a result of subscribers relocating  the cancellation of purchased accounts in the process of assimilation into the company s operations  unfavorable economic conditions  dissatisfaction with field maintenance services and other reasons 
this attrition is offset to a certain extent by revenues from the sale of additional services to existing subscribers  price increases  the reconnection of premises previously occupied by subscribers  conversions of accounts previously monitored by other alarm companies and guarantees provided by the sellers of such accounts 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview subscriber attrition included in item enhanced security services additional mrr is generated by the provision of enhanced security services that the company offers to both its existing subscribers and in conjunction with the sales of new systems 
these enhanced security services include extended service protection  which covers the normal costs of repair and maintenance of the system during normal business hours  after the expiration of the initial warranty period 
two way voice communication remote audio verification  which consists of the ability  in the event of an alarm activation  to listen and talk to persons at the monitored premises from the central monitoring station through speakers and microphones located within the premises 
among other things  such remote audio verification helps the company to determine whether an alarm activation is a false alarm 
supervised monitoring service  which allows the alarm system to send various types of signals containing information on the use of the system  such as what users armed or disarmed the system and at what time of the day 
this information is supplied to subscribers for use in connection with the management of their households or businesses 
supervised monitoring service can also include a daily automatic test feature 
pager service  which provides the subscriber  at discounted rates  with standard pager services that also enable the company to reach the subscriber in the event of an alarm activation 
medical identification card  which enables medical personnel in the event of a medical emergency to access a subscriber s medical information ie  allergies  medications and family history  emergency contacts and doctors by calling the company s central monitoring station 
wireless back up  which permits the alarm system to send signals over a cellular telephone or dedicated radio system  in the event that regular telephone service is interrupted 
field repair services the company believes one of the most effective ways of improving customer retention is the provision of quality  responsive field repair service by company employees 
field service personnel are trained by the company to provide repair services for the various types of security systems owned by the company s subscribers 
field service personnel also inspect installations performed by the company s installation subcontractors 
repair services generate revenues primarily through billable field service calls and contractual payments under the company s extended service program 
the increasing density of the company s subscriber base  as a result of the company s continuing effort to infill areas surrounding its branch operations with new subscribers  permits more efficient scheduling and routing of field service technicians  and results in economies of scale at the branch level 
the increased efficiency in scheduling and routing also allows the company to provide faster field service response and support  which leads to a higher level of subscriber satisfaction 
alarm response and patrol services  propac r the company offers its subscribers in southern california and las vegas a patrol and alarm response enhanced service in addition to its other security services  and employs over alarm response and patrol officers operating in regular patrol beats  or designated neighborhoods to provide such service 
these armed officers supplement the company s alarm monitoring service by providing alarm response service to alarm system activations  patrol service consisting of routine patrol of subscribers premises and neighborhoods and  in a few cases  special watch services  such as picking up mail and newspapers and increased surveillance when the subscriber is traveling 
alarm response service requires the company s patrol officers to observe and report to police or other emergency agencies any potential criminal activity at a subscriber s home 
the company has begun to offer a new bundle of services under the propac r brand name in las vegas 
propac consists of alarm monitoring  field repair and alarm response services billed to the subscriber as a flat monthly charge regardless of the number of service calls or responses to alarm activations 
the company believes this service package is attractive to current and prospective subscribers because it i enables the company to offer a reliable and timely alarm response service and ii eliminates subscriber uncertainty arising from per response charges 
the company intends to expand the offering of propac to other areas within its markets over the next several years 
patrol officers are dispatched by a hour central radio dispatch office located in the local dispatch office 
an alarm activation signal from a subscriber to alarm response service is automatically processed by computer at the central monitoring station in portland and sent electronically to the local dispatch office 
if the patrol officer dispatched observes potential criminal activity  the officer will report the activity to the dispatch office  which will in turn notify local law enforcement 
the patrol officer will then maintain surveillance until law enforcement officers arrive 
if a patrol officer does not detect criminal activity  he will report his conclusion to the dispatch office  which will cancel police response and thereby reduce the potential for a false alarm fine 
the company also offers dedicated patrol service to homeowners associations in selected markets  for which the company provides a company marked car for patrol exclusively in such association s neighborhood 
a significant percentage of the homeowners in such associations purchase the company s alarm monitoring services 
the company s patrol officers are subject to extensive pre employment screening 
officers are subject to background checks and drug screening before being hired  and are required to have gun and baton permits and state and city guard licenses 
officers also must be licensed by the state to carry firearms and to provide patrol services 
the company s training program includes arrest procedures  criminal law  weaponless defense  firearms and baton usage  patrol tactics  and first aid and cpr 
this training program exceeds state mandated training requirements 
however  the provision of patrol and alarm response services subjects the company to greater risks  relating to accidents or employee behavior  than other types of businesses 
the cost of providing patrol and alarm response services presently exceeds the revenues generated by such services 
however  the company believes that its ability to provide these services gives the company a competitive advantage in marketing its monitoring services over alarm service companies that do not have these capabilities 
additionally  the company believes such services are an effective impediment to subscriber attrition 
the company believes that demand for alarm response and patrol services is likely to increase as a result of a trend on the part of local police departments to limit their response to alarm activations and other factors that may lead to a decrease of police presence 
although the company currently incurs a loss in its patrol and alarm response operations  the company believes further demand for such services would allow the company to increase subscriber density in its patrol routes  thereby reducing losses 
in addition  the company s provision of alarm response and patrol services is a sales method used to convert subscribers of other alarm monitoring companies that do not provide such services 
to the extent that further demand develops for alarm response and patrol services  the company believes its current presence will enable it to increase its conversions of competitors subscribers to the company s services 
sales and marketing each of the company s branch offices includes sales representatives who sell new systems  equipment add ons and upgrades and enhanced services to subscribers 
although the company does not actively use outbound marketing methods to sell new security alarm systems  the company receives in bound telephone requests for such systems  primarily as a result of subscriber referrals  local crime activity and responses to yellow pages advertising 
such leads are pursued by one of the company s sales representatives 
alarm sales are made at the subscriber s home  typically in a single visit by a sales representative 
the company markets additional services through both its account sales representatives and through a centralized telephone sales force in the company s corporate offices 
the company believes that the increasing density of the company s subscriber base has increased the overall presence and visibility of the company 
both in the dealer program and in company sales  new subscribers are provided with highly visible reflective yard signs placed prominently in front of their homes or businesses 
the presence of these signs develops greater awareness in a neighborhood and leads to more inbound and referral business 
the company encourages referrals from existing subscribers through an incentive program promoted through newsletters  billing inserts and employee contacts 
alarm response service  which uses marked patrol cars  also increases the company s visibility 
competition the security alarm industry is highly competitive and highly fragmented 
the company competes with major firms with substantial financial resources  including adt operations inc  the protection securities division of honeywell  inc  the national guardian corporation  a subsidiary of the ameritech corporation  brinks home security inc  a subsidiary of the pittston company  and westinghouse security  currently a division of westinghouse electric corporation 
other alarm service companies have adopted a strategy similar to the company s that entails the aggressive purchase of alarm monitoring accounts both through acquisitions of account portfolios and through dealer programs 
some of such competitors have greater financial resources than the company  or may be willing to offer higher prices than the company is prepared to offer to purchase subscriber accounts 
competition in the security alarm industry is based primarily on reliability of equipment  market visibility  services offered  reputation for quality of service and price 
the company believes it competes effectively with other national  regional and local security alarm companies in the western united states because of the company s reputation for reliable equipment and services  its concentrated presence in the areas surrounding its branch offices  its ability to bundle monitoring  maintenance and repair and enhanced services and its low cost structure 
regulatory matters a number of local governmental authorities have adopted or are considering various measures aimed at reducing the number of false alarms 
such measures include i subjecting alarm monitoring companies to fines or penalties for transmitting false alarms  ii licensing individual alarm systems and the revocation of such licenses following a specified number of false alarms  iii imposing fines on alarm subscribers for false alarms  iv imposing limitations on the number of times the police will respond to alarms at a particular location after a specified number of false alarms  and v requiring further verification of an alarm signal before the police will respond 
the company s operations are subject to a variety of other laws  regulations and licensing requirements of federal  state  and local authorities 
in certain jurisdictions  the company is required to obtain licenses or permits  to comply with standards governing employee selection and training  and to meet certain standards in the conduct of its business 
many jurisdictions also require certain of the company s employees to obtain licenses or permits 
those employees who serve as patrol officers are often subject to additional licensing requirements  including firearm licensing and training requirements in jurisdictions in which they carry firearms 
the alarm industry is also subject to requirements imposed by various insurance  approval  listing and standards organizations 
depending upon the type of subscriber served  the type of security service provided  and the requirements of the applicable local governmental jurisdiction  adherence to the requirements and standards of such organizations is mandatory in some instances and voluntary in others 
the company s advertising and sales practices are regulated by both the federal trade commission and state consumer protection laws 
such laws and regulations include restrictions on the manner in which the company promotes the sale of its security alarm systems and the obligation of the company to provide purchasers of its alarm systems with certain recision rights 
from time to time subscribers have submitted complaints to state and local authorities regarding the company s sales and billing practices 
such complaints can result in regulatory action against the company  including civil complaints seeking monetary and injunctive remedies 
the company s alarm monitoring business utilizes telephone lines and radio frequencies to transmit alarm signals 
the cost of telephone lines  and the type of equipment which may be used in telephone line transmission  are currently regulated by both federal and state governments 
the operation and utilization of radio frequencies are regulated by the federal communications commission and state public utilities commissions 
risk management the nature of the services provided by the company potentially exposes it to greater risks of liability for employee acts or omissions  or system failure  than may be inherent in other businesses 
substantially all of the company s alarm monitoring agreements  and other agreements pursuant to which it sells its products and services contain provisions limiting liability to subscribers in an attempt to reduce this risk 
the company s alarm response and patrol services require company personnel to respond to emergencies that may entail risk of harm to such employees and to others 
in most cities in which the company provides such services  the company s patrol officers carry firearms  which may increase such risk 
although the company conducts extensive screening and training of its employees  the provision of patrol and alarm response service subjects it to greater risks related to accidents or employee behavior than other types of businesses 
the company carries insurance of various types  including general liability and errors and omissions insurance 
the loss experience of the company  and other security service companies  may affect the availability and cost of such insurance 
certain of the company s insurance policies  and the laws of some states  may limit or prohibit insurance coverage for punitive or certain other types of damages  or liability arising from gross negligence

mrr is a term commonly used in the security alarm industry as a measure of the size of a company  but not as a measure of profitability or performance  and does not include any allowance for future attrition or allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company does not have sufficient information as to the attrition of acquired subscriber accounts to predict the amount of acquired mrr that will be realized in future periods or the impact of the attrition of acquired accounts on the company s overall rate of attrition 
e ebitda does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles  should not be construed as an alternative to net income and is indicative neither of the company s operating performance nor of cash flows available to fund all the company s cash needs 
items excluded from ebitda are significant components in understanding and assessing the company s financial performance 
management believes presentation of ebitda enhances an understanding of the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows because ebitda is used by the company to satisfy its debt service obligations and its capital expenditure and other operational needs as well as to provide funds for growth 
in addition  ebitda has been used by senior lenders and subordinated creditors and the investment community to determine the current borrowing capacity and to estimate the long term value of companies with recurring cash flows from operations and net losses

for a description of such risks and uncertainties  see the information set forth and incorporated by reference in the introductory note to this annual report on form k under the caption forward looking statements  which information is incorporated in this item by reference 
as described in introductory note company structure  poi s sole asset is  and all of poi s operations are conducted through  poi s investment in monitoring  in addition  all of monitoring s long term debt has been guaranteed on a full and unconditional basis by poi 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item hereof 
accordingly  no separate analysis of the results of operations of monitoring has been included herein 
overview a majority of the company s revenues are derived from recurring payments for the monitoring and servicing of security systems and additional security services  pursuant to contracts with initial terms ranging from one to five years 
service revenues are derived from payments under extended service contracts and for service calls performed on a time and materials basis 
the remainder of the company s revenues are derived from revenues from the sale and installation of security systems  add ons and upgrades 
payment for monitoring services is typically required in advance 
monitoring and service revenues are recognized as the service is provided 
installation  add on and upgrade revenue is recognized when the required work is completed 
all direct installation costs  which include materials  labor and installation overhead  and selling and marketing costs are expensed in the period incurred 
alarm monitoring services generate a significantly higher gross margin than do the other services provided by the company 
in fact  the cost of providing patrol and alarm response services exceeds the revenues generated by patrol services and  while sales and installation services contribute to the company s gross profits  the total expenses associated with alarm system installations including not only the direct costs of providing such services but also the expenses associated with the sales and marketing of alarm systems also exceed the revenues generated by such services 
the company s strategy  however  is to provide patrol and alarm response services and to invest in system sales and installation because the company believes that such services and products contribute to the generation and retention of alarm monitoring subscribers 
accounting differences for account purchases and new installations 
a difference between the accounting treatment of the purchase of subscriber accounts and the accounting treatment of the generation of subscriber accounts through direct sales by the company s sales force has a significant impact on the company s results of operations 
all direct external costs associated with purchases of subscriber accounts either through the dealer program or through acquisitions of subscriber account portfolios are capitalized and amortized over years on a straight line basis 
company personnel and related support and duplicate costs incurred solely in connection with subscriber account acquisitions and transitions are expensed as incurred 
other acquisition transition costs that reflect the company s estimate of costs associated with incorporating the purchased subscriber accounts into its operations  including costs incurred by the company in fulfilling the seller s pre acquisition warranty repair service and other obligations to the acquired subscribers are capitalized and amortized as described above 
in contrast  all of the company s costs related to the sales  marketing and installation of new alarm monitoring systems generated by the company s sales force are expensed in the period in which incurred 
the company s purchase activity increased significantly in fiscal and in addition  beginning in fiscal  the company adopted a strategy of reducing its sales of new systems and related marketing expenditures 
as a result of the difference in the methods by which such activities are accounted for  the combined effect of these two factors was to improve operating results during fiscal and the company does not expect to further reduce sales of new systems by company personnel and related marketing expenditures 
change in accounting method 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company changed its method of accounting for certain subscriber account acquisition and transition costs  effective as of october  the acquisition and transition costs previously capitalized  which under the new method are expensed as incurred  are the company personnel and related support and duplicate costs incurred solely in connection with acquisitions and transitions 
the new method is consistent with the guidelines published on july  by the emerging issue task force of the financial accounting standards board 
see accounting for account purchases and new installations and note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item as a result of the change in accounting policy i in the quarter ended december   the company recorded a non cash  non recurring charge of approximately million  which amount represents the cumulative effect net of income tax benefit of approximately million of the accounting change on prior years results of operations  and ii the company s statements of operations include an expense item captioned acquisition and transition expenses 
the expense was approximately million for fiscal and million for fiscal in each case before associated tax benefit 
the foregoing non recurring charge and expenses are reflected in the financial information presented in this report 
such expenses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based primarily on the amount of the company s acquisition activity and its ability to require sellers to bear certain of such acquisition related expenses 
acquisition and dealer program activity 
as described in this annual report on form k  a significant portion of the company s growth has been generated by the acquisition of portfolios of subscriber accounts from other alarm companies 
because the company typically acquires only the subscriber accounts and not the accounts receivable or other assets of the sellers  the company focuses its pre acquisition review and analysis on the quality and stability of the subscriber accounts to verify the mrr represented by such accounts 
if the subscriber accounts to be purchased pass such due diligence scrutiny  the company then applies its monitoring costs to such mrr as a basis for determining the purchase price to be paid by the company 
to protect the company against the loss of acquired accounts  the company typically seeks to obtain from the seller a guarantee against the subscriber account cancellation for a period following the acquisition and the right to retain a portion of the acquisition price a purchase price holdback against the mrr lost due to subscriber account cancellations during the specified period 
during fiscal  the company added through acquisitions of portfolios of subscriber accounts and through its dealer program an aggregate of approximately  subscriber accounts for a total purchase price of approximately million including assumed liabilities of approximately million 
the mrr of the acquired accounts ranged from approximately to  with an average of 
of the acquisitions completed during fiscal by the company  the substantial majority included purchase price holdbacks in amounts that ranged from to of the initial purchase price and averaged of the initial purchase price and attrition guarantees for periods that ranged from six months to months and averaged months 
two of the company s acquisitions during fiscal involved portfolios representing mrr that exceeded of the company s mrr at the time of the acquisition  as set forth below percentage of number of average mrr range of mrr residential seller accounts per account per account subscribers intercap funds joint venture 
 metrol security services  subscriber attrition 
subscriber attrition has a direct impact on the company s results of operations  since it affects both the company s revenues and its amortization expense 
attrition can be measured in terms of canceled subscriber accounts and in terms of decreased mrr resulting from canceled subscriber accounts 
gross subscriber attrition is defined by the company for a particular period as a quotient  the numerator of which is equal to the number of subscribers who disconnect service during such period and the denominator of which is the average of the number of subscribers at each month end during such period 
net mrr attrition is defined by the company for a particular period as a quotient  the numerator of which is an amount equal to gross mrr lost as the result of canceled subscriber accounts or services during such period  net of i mrr generated during such period by the sale of additional services and increases in rates to existing subscribers  ii mrr generated during such period from the connection of subscribers who move into premises previously occupied by subscribers and in which existing systems are installed and from conversion of accounts that were previously monitored by other companies to the company s monitoring service ie  reconnects and conversions  and iii mrr attributable to canceled accounts that  by virtue of a purchase holdback are put back to the seller of such accounts during such period ie  guaranteed accounts  and the denominator of which is the average month end mrr in effect during such period 
while the company reduces the gross mrr lost during a period by the amount of guaranteed accounts provided for in purchase agreements with sellers  in some cases the company may not collect all or any of the reimbursement due it from the seller 
the following table sets forth the company s gross subscriber attrition and net mrr attrition for the periods indicated year ended september gross subscriber attrition net mrr attrition mrr represents the monthly recurring revenue the company is entitled to receive under subscriber contracts in effect at the end of the period 
included in mrr and the number of subscribers are amounts associated with subscribers with past due balances 
it is the policy and practice of the company that every effort be made to preserve the revenue stream associated with these contractual obligations 
to this end  the company actively works to both collect amounts owed and to retain the subscriber 
in certain instances  this collection and evaluation period may exceed six months in length 
when  in the judgment of the company s collection personnel  all reasonable efforts have been made to collect balances due  subscribers are disconnected from the company s monitoring center and are included in the calculation of gross subscriber and net mrr attrition 
because the company determines payments to sellers under purchase price holdbacks subsequent to the periods to which such holdbacks apply  and because holdbacks are not allocated to specific guaranteed accounts or specific fiscal periods  the company reduces gross mrr lost during a period by the amount of guaranteed accounts provided for in purchase agreements with sellers 
however  in some cases  the company has not retained the full amount of such holdback to which the company is contractually entitled 
if guaranteed accounts for which the company was not compensated by the seller were taken into account in calculating net mrr attrition  net mrr attrition would have been higher in each period presented in the table above 
generally  net mrr attrition is less than actual net account attrition  which the company defines as canceled subscriber accounts net of reconnects  conversions and guaranteed accounts 
estimated net account attrition is the basis upon which the company determines the period over which it amortizes its investment in subscriber accounts 
the company amortizes such investment over years based on current estimates 
if actual subscriber account attrition were to exceed such estimated attrition  the company could be required to amortize its investment in subscriber accounts over a shorter period  thus increasing amortization expense in the period in which such adjustment is made and in future periods 
since the majority of the subscriber accounts acquired by the company since its formation were purchased recently  there can be no assurance that the actual attrition rates for such accounts will not be greater than the rate assumed by the company 
see results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal amortization of subscriber accounts and goodwill and note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item the table below sets forth the change in the company s subscriber base over fiscal years year ended september  number of subscribers beginning of period    additions through portfolio acquisitions and dealer program  net of sales of subscriber accounts    installations by company personnel   reconnects and conversions    gross subscriber attrition    end of period    impact of sfas in march of  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  this statement requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company determines the value of its subscriber accounts and intangibles  net based on the undiscounted cash flows from the mrr stream using the most recent historical attrition rate and aggregate mrr 
at september   the undiscounted cash flows from the mrr stream were significantly in excess of the carrying value of subscriber accounts and intangibles  net 
the company does not anticipate a material impact on its financial statements resulting from the adoption of this standard 
restrictions on dividends 
poi has never paid any cash dividends on the common stock and does not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
the revolving credit facility and the discount note indenture restrict poi s ability to declare or pay any dividend on  or make any other distribution in respect of  poi s capital stock
