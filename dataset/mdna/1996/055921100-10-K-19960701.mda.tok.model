item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview this discussion comprises historical information for the periods covered  followed by certain forward looking information and information about certain risks and uncertainties that could cause the company s future operating results to differ from any results indicated by any forward looking statements made by the company or others 
it is important that the historical discussion be read together with the discussion of such risks and uncertainties  and that these discussions are read in conjunction with the accompanying audited financial statements and notes thereto 
bmc software specializes in the development  marketing and maintenance of systems software products for large enterprises operating ibm and ibm compatible mainframes or client server information systems 
the company is currently offering software products  of which are mainframe products and are client server products 
the company s core business is the provision of high performance utilities and administrative tools for the primary high end ibm mainframe database management systems  ims and db in each of the last three fiscal years  these products generated approximately of the company s total revenues and higher percentages of its earnings 
the utility products provide high performance replacement functionality that performs time critical operations such as loading  copying or reorganizing a database  thereby increasing the availability of the data and the applications that require it 
the administrative tools increase productivity by automating routine and repetitive database management operations 
over the last three years  the company has invested significantly in extending its product offerings to open systems hardware and software platforms 
the company s patrol product  acquired in january  has emerged as a leading monitoring and management tool for open systems applications  databases and operating systems 
including the patrol acquisition  the company has invested over  in its open systems product strategies  including both internal research and development and external technology acquisitions 
the company s open systems strategy has been concentrated in three areas a the extension of patrol s support of additional applications  the continued enhancement of its functionality and the integration of patrol with the leading third party network and systems management frameworks  b the provision of heterogeneous back up and recovery products for open systems relational database management systems  and c the delivery of open systems equivalents of its database administration products for db the company is also developing high speed utilities for the leading open systems relational database management systems 
during june of  the company released version of patrol  which incorporated significant enhancements in scalability  interoperability and flexibility including autonomous agents  agent to agent integration and independent consoles 
in addition  during fiscal the patrol suite was expanded to operate with an increased number of different systems management frameworks  databases and applications 
in the third quarter of fiscal  to further expand the scope of patrol and to augment the company s client server offerings  the company acquired hawknet  inc  and peer networks  inc 
the acquisitions of hawknet and peer expanded the company s product offerings in the enterprise networking area 
hawknet provides network server optimization and tuning software for novell netware and windows nt environments and peer provides snmp management agents and agent development tool kits 
fiscal s total revenues of  were higher than fiscal total revenues 
the increase was the result of a increase in north american product license revenues  a increase in international product license revenues and a increase in worldwide maintenance revenues 
net earnings in fiscal were  excluding a one time write off of  net of income taxes related to the third quarter acquisitions of stock and assets of certain technology companies 
these results represent a increase over fiscal net earnings of  excluding the acquired research and development charge related to acquisitions of technology and the write off of the purchase option to acquire datatools  inc 
increased net earnings were attributable to the total revenue growth  operating income as a percentage of revenues operating margins remained relatively unchanged from fiscal to there can be no assurance that operating margins will be sustained at historical levels 
for a discussion of factors affecting operating margins  see the discussions below under the headings quarterly results and forward looking information and certain risks and uncertainties that could affect future operating results 
historical information results of operations the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  the percentages that selected items in the consolidated statements of earnings bear to total revenues

in fiscal  revenues totaled  a increase over fiscal revenues of  from fiscal to fiscal  total revenues increased to  license revenues comprised  and of total revenues in fiscal  and  while maintenance revenues for the same years contributed  and  respectively 
the company s north american operations generated of license revenues in fiscal and and in fiscal the company has increased its product list prices by approximately in each of the last three fiscal years  although discounting has mitigated the effect of such price increases for many customers 
although the company expects revenues to continue to grow in fiscal and beyond  there can be no assurance that such growth will be achieved or that growth rates in the future will be comparable to those in prior years 
as of march   bmc marketed systems software products designed to improve the availability  reliability  accuracy and integrity of enterprise data maintained in ibm mainframe and open systems environments 
during fiscal  the company continued to diversify its product offerings beyond the ibm mainframe environment  which has been its traditional market 
the company s open system products including the datatools sql backtrack products generated  in total revenues in fiscal  an increase of approximately over the prior fiscal year 
from fiscal to fiscal  open systems total revenues increased from  to  mainframe related product revenues increased from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal as discussed below  the company s mainframe revenues are dependent on large customers and their current and anticipated mainframe capacity needs 
license revenues the company s license revenues include both product license fees and product upgrade fees 
product license fees are generated from the initial licensing of a product and from license restructurings wherein a customer pays a fee to increase the discounts used to calculate future maintenance and upgrade charges for their installed products 
product upgrade fees are charged when a customer acquires the right to run an already licensed product on additional processing capacity  which may be measured traditionally by central processing unit cpu tier or by the aggregate millions of instructions per second mips on which the company s products are installed 
these upgrade fees include fees for current additional processing capacity and for future additional processing capacity 
product upgrade fees accounted for  and of total revenues for fiscal years  and  respectively 
all license and upgrade fees are recognized as revenue when the license agreement is executed and the applicable products if any  in the case of upgrade fees have been delivered 
north american license revenue grew in fiscal and in fiscal increased sales of the company s open systems products have represented a significant part of north american license revenue growth over the past two years and represented the single largest component of north american license revenue growth from fiscal to fiscal in addition to the increased open systems licenses  increased mainframe product license fees and upgrade fees for current additional processing capacity drove license growth in fiscal north american license revenue growth in fiscal was derived primarily from restructuring fees and increased product license fees for the company s mainframe products 
international operations contributed of license revenues in fiscal and and of license revenues in fiscal from fiscal to fiscal  international license revenues grew and from fiscal to fiscal in fiscal  international license revenues grew as a result of increased upgrade fees for future processing capacity  product license sales of open systems products and restructuring fees 
international license revenue growth from fiscal to fiscal was derived principally from upgrade fees for future processing capacity and  to a lesser extent  by product license sales of mainframe and open systems products 
international license revenues received a benefit of approximately and from the weakening of the dollar  respectively from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal enterprise license transactions have been and continue to be a significant component of the company s license revenues and license revenue growth 
an enterprise license allows the customer to run an unlimited number of copies of a product on its cpus without regard to their size  subject to a maximum limit on the aggregate power of the cpus as measured in mips 
substantially all of these transactions include a fee for additional processing capacity beyond the customer s current usage level and or a restructuring fee  and some include license fees for additional products 
the fees for future additional processing capacity typically comprise from one half to substantially all of the license fees included in an enterprise license transaction 
the aggregate fees for future additional processing capacity and license restructuring comprised of total revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal in addition to the administrative and pricing benefits that an enterprise license agreement offers the customer  the company believes that the multi year relationship offers a strategic advantage for additional revenues in that it establishes the company s technology and product strategy within key accounts and eases the competitive pressures from other independent software vendors 
the enterprise license program has been successful and most of the company s larger customers have converted their licenses to enterprise license terms 
an enterprise license typically requires an evaluation of the customer s processing capacity level periodically throughout the term of the agreement or at the end of the term 
the licensee is required to pay additional charges if the mips capacity on which the licensed products are being used exceeds the stipulated processing capacity level previously purchased 
the continued growth of the company s mainframe revenues is dependent on the company s success in the closing of additional enterprise license agreements as well as the expansion of existing agreements as customers continue to require additional mainframe processing capacity 
maintenance revenues maintenance revenues represent annual maintenance fees charged to perpetual license customers entitling them to product enhancements  technical support services and ongoing compatibility with third party operating systems  subsystems and applications 
maintenance charges are generally to of the license fee for the product at the time of renewal 
maintenance revenues also include the bundled fees for first year maintenance services covered by the related perpetual license agreement 
all maintenance fees are deferred at the time of billing and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
the company intends to continue to invest heavily in product maintenance and support and believes that maintaining its reputation for superior product support is a key component of its value pricing model 
maintenance revenues have increased over the last three fiscal years as a result of the continued growth in the base of installed products and the cpu capacity on which they run and high maintenance renewal rates 
under the traditional  tier pricing model  maintenance fees are calculated on the current list price of the product which is dependent upon the size of the cpu on which the product is installed 
consequently  the company receives higher maintenance fees as the customers install its products on larger cpus 
maintenance revenue in a particular year is impacted by the level of license revenue in the preceding years  the bundled fees for first year maintenance and by restructuring transactions 
as discussed above  restructuring fees entitle a customer to higher  volume based discounts that apply to future maintenance and other charges 
the reduction in the rate of maintenance revenue growth rate from in fiscal to in fiscal and in fiscal is primarily attributable to these discounts 
product line revenues the ims database utilities and masterplan for db product series represent the company s largest revenue producing product lines 
the ims database utilities represented  and of total revenues and  and of license revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
the masterplan for db line comprised  and of total revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively  and contributed of license revenues in fiscal and and of license revenues in fiscal these product lines showed combined total revenue growth of from to and from to license revenues for these product lines grew in fiscal and in fiscal the company believes that these product lines will continue to be a significant source of revenues and continues to invest heavily in the support and enhancement of these products 
the company offers several other product lines in the mainframe environment which include  but are not limited to network optimization  data backup and availability enhancement and data compression and performance 
in the aggregate  these product lines accounted for  and of total revenues and  and of license revenues for fiscal year  and  respectively 
the company s current product offerings outside of the ibm mainframe environment fall into four categories the patrol database monitoring and application management series introduced in late fiscal  the metasuite sm database administration series  introduced in fiscal  the sql backtrack database backup and recovery series from datatools  inc  for whom the company acts as an exclusive distributor and nettune pro and netreport introduced in fiscal the aggregate total and license revenues from these four product series comprised and of total and license revenues  respectively  for fiscal the patrol product line represented less than of total and license revenues in fiscal  of total revenues and of license revenues in fiscal  of total revenues and of license revenues in fiscal while the open systems potential for revenue growth is substantial  the environment is extremely competitive 
the company believes that the application of its expertise in data administration and management to the open systems environment will enable it to compete effectively in this market  consequently  the company has invested heavily in the acquisition and development of its open systems products and intends to continue this investment 
other income other income was approximately  and of total revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
other income consists primarily of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents  financed receivables and marketable securities 
other income increased by from fiscal to fiscal and by from fiscal to the increase in interest income is primarily due to larger invested cash balances in than in expenses percentage changes fiscal year ended march  compared compared to to in thousands selling and marketing    research and development    cost of maintenance services and product licenses    general and administrative    acquired research and development    total operating expenses    selling and marketing the company s selling and marketing expenses are comprised primarily of personnel and related costs  sales commissions and costs associated with industry trade shows and sales seminars 
compensation costs were the largest single contributor to the expense growth in fiscal due to the continued hiring of sales and marketing personnel to promote and sell the company s increasing number of product offerings 
selling and marketing headcount increased by from march  to march  sales commissions increased as a result of the increase in license revenues  although the increase was lower than the growth in license revenues 
also  the company increased its participation in trade shows and sponsored more sales seminars during fiscal the company s increase in selling and marketing activities was distributed ratably between its domestic and international operations 
increased selling and marketing expenses from fiscal to was the result of increases in the company s marketing organization and increases in sales commissions 
as a percentage of total revenues  selling and marketing expenses increased from in fiscal and to in fiscal research and development research and development expenses are mainly comprised of personnel costs related to software developers and development support personnel 
these expenses also include computer hardware software costs and telecommunications expenses necessary to maintain the company s data processing center 
the company s net research and development expenditures during fiscal increased slightly over fiscal levels although the company s investment in research and development activities during fiscal was greater than the indicated growth 
a portion of the company s research and development expenditures were capitalized as software development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
in all three fiscal years 
during fiscal  and  the company capitalized approximately   and  respectively of software development costs 
the growth in capitalized costs during fiscal was due to increases in new product development of open systems products and  to a lesser degree  mainframe software products that have reached the stage of development where the costs are capitalized under sfas no 
excluding the effect of capitalized software on research and development expenses  the growth in research and development occurred primarily in increased compensation 
the company increased its headcount in the research and development organization by from fiscal year end to fiscal year end including contracted personnel 
increased personnel and related costs were the primary cause for research and development expense growth from fiscal to fiscal cost of maintenance services and product licenses cost of maintenance services and product licenses consists of compensation for technical employees providing customer support  amortization of both purchased and internally developed software and royalty fees paid to third parties 
the increase in cost of maintenance services and product licenses is mainly due to increases in amortization of both purchased and internally developed software and the advent of royalty fees 
royalty fees were not incurred by the company prior to fiscal the company amortized   and  in fiscal  and  respectively of capitalized software development costs pursuant to sfas no 
during fiscal  and  the company accelerated the amortization of certain products which contributed to the increase in all fiscal years 
the company s cost of maintenance services and product licenses is expected to continue increasing as the company capitalizes a higher level of software development costs and as royalties paid to third parties  such as datatools  increase 
as a percentage of total revenues  cost of maintenance services and product licenses was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal general and administrative general and administrative expenses were comprised primarily of key executive compensation and personnel costs within finance and accounting  product distribution  human resources and word processing 
other expenses included in general and administrative expenses are fees paid for legal services  accounting services  consulting projects  insurance  travel and costs of managing the company s foreign currency exposure 
growth in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to personnel costs and costs associated with managing the company s foreign currency exposure 
the increase in personnel costs was driven by a increase in headcount from fiscal year end to fiscal year end as well as by expenses associated with the termination and hiring of management personnel in europe in the last half of fiscal costs associated with the company s foreign currency exposure increased due to the increase in international license revenues from fiscal to fiscal the percentage growth in general and administrative expenses was split evenly between the domestic and international operations 
as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses remained constant at in fiscal years  and growth in general and administrative expenses from fiscal to fiscal was due primarily to an increase in personnel and related costs 
acquired research and development costs the company completed various technology acquisitions during fiscal the aggregate purchase price for these transactions totaled  including direct acquisition costs 
the company funded these acquisitions primarily through the issuance of its own common stock  and to a lesser extent  with cash 
as of march   approximately  of such consideration had not been paid and was included in accrued liabilities 
the company used the purchase method of accounting for these technology acquisitions 
the company recorded a  charge  net of an income tax benefit of  for acquired research and development costs during fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company completed the acquisitions of stock and assets including in process research and development of several technology companies for an aggre gate purchase price of  including warrants to purchase the company s stock valued at approximately  and direct acquisition costs 
also  as of march   the company obtained exclusive product distribution rights and a purchase option from datatools  inc for  the term of the company s option is march  through march  the distribution rights expire on march   if the company does not exercise its purchase option 
the company accounted for all of the acquisition transactions discussed above using the purchase method and recorded a  charge  net of an income tax benefit of  for acquired research and development costs during the fourth quarter of fiscal in fiscal  the company acquired patrol software pty 
ltd  an australian corporation and patrol software  inc  a california corporation 
the aggregate cost to the company was approximately  including direct acquisition and integration costs and was paid primarily in cash  with approximately  of the purchase price represented by options in the company s common stock 
the company used the purchase method of accounting for the acquisition and recorded a charge for acquired research and development costs of  net of an income tax benefit of  in the fourth quarter of fiscal income taxes the company recorded income tax expense of   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company s effective tax rates were  and for fiscal years ended  and  respectively 
an analysis of the differences between the statutory and effective income tax rates is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency rate fluctuations for the fiscal years ended march  and  and  respectively of the company s consolidated revenues were derived from customers outside north america 
substantially all of the company s sales outside north america are billed and collected in foreign currencies 
substantially all the expenses of operating the company s foreign subsidiaries and compensating its independent agents are similarly incurred in foreign currencies 
consequently  the company s reported financial results are affected by fluctuations of those foreign currencies against the us dollar 
the company has adopted a foreign currency hedging strategy designed to reduce its foreign currency transaction exposures 
for the years ended march   and currency rate fluctuations did not have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
risk management the functional currency for most of the company s international subsidiaries is the local currency of the subsidiary 
changes in exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar may negatively affect the company s sales as expressed in us dollars and gross profit margins from the international operations 
the company monitors this currency risk and attempts to mitigate the exposure through hedging transactions involving derivative financial instruments 
specifically  with respect to future revenues  the company utilizes put options to protect the majority of anticipated foreign exchange denominated revenues primarily in deutsche marks and british pounds 
the term of the option contracts is rarely more than one year 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
the company also enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge firm commitments  specifically  accounts receivable  intercompany transactions  cash balances and certain liabilities 
the term of the forward contracts is generally days 
the currencies hedged include several european currencies  as well as the japanese yen and australian dollar 
pursuant to sfas no 
 sfas no 
and related literature  the company applies hedge accounting treatment to all of its hedging transactions ie  instruments are effective as and are designated hedge instruments 
specifically  gains and losses on forward contracts are recognized at each month end in connection with the translation of the related hedged exposure into us dollars 
gains and premiums associated with purchased put options are deferred until their maturity or until they are exercised or when a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur 
all gains and losses attributable to the company s current hedging strategy are expected to occur within one year from the reporting date 
the company is exposed to credit related losses in the event of non performance by counterparties to financial instruments  but it does not expect any such counterparties to fail to meet their obligations  given their high credit ratings

the proportion of second half revenues and earnings relative to those in the first half of the company s fiscal year is expected to increase in fiscal in addition  the company has historically realized sequentially lower revenues and net earnings in the first quarter of its fiscal year than in the last quarter of the prior fiscal year 
the company s largest expense component is compensation and the related fringe benefits  which are fixed in the short term except for commissions and bonuses  which were of operating expenses in fiscal the costs of the company s data center  office equipment and facilities also are essentially fixed 
numerous factors may cause significant fluctuations in the company s quarterly revenues  including competition  industry or technological trends  customer budgetary decisions  mainframe processing capacity growth  general economic conditions or uncertainties  the timing of closing of individually significant sales  mainframe industry pricing and other trends  announcements of new hardware or software products and the timing of price increases 
because the high percentage of expenses is fixed  any such fluctuations in revenues will also significantly affect net earnings and any shortfall in revenues in a period would have an immediate and material adverse effect on earnings 
liquidity and capital resources at march   the company s cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were  the company s working capital as of march   was  the company continues to invest cash in securities with longer maturities yielding greater returns 
this has the impact of reducing working capital 
the company s securities are investment grade and liquid 
the company had no debt as of march   other than normal trade payables and liabilities and a  payable relating to technology acquisitions discussed under acquired research and development costs above 
stockholders equity as of march   was  the company continues to finance its growth through funds generated from operations 
for the year ended march   net cash provided by operating activities was  net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was  primarily related to the acquisition of computers and related equipment  the purchase of investment securities and the technology acquisitions discussed above 
net cash used in financing activities in fiscal was  the primary uses of cash generated from operations pertained to the company s stock repurchase program and to purchases of investment securities 
during fiscal  the company repurchased  shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of  as of march   the company was authorized to acquire  shares of its common stock under its stock repurchase program 
in addition  the company continues to evaluate business acquisition opportunities that complement the company s strategic plans 
the company believes that its existing cash balances and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet its liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future 
forward looking information and certain risks and uncertainties that could affect future operating results 
the forward looking statements made in the above management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition include statements regarding the continued significance of enterprise license transactions and the company s ims database utilities and masterplan for db product series  as well as the company s ability to compete effectively in the open systems market 
in addition  the company s statement regarding the expected increase in the proportion of second half revenues and earnings to those in the first half and the company s statement regarding its ability to meet its future liquidity requirements are forward looking statements 
numerous important factors affect the company s operating results and could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from the results indicated in this discussion or in any other forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of the company 
there can be no assurance that future results will meet expectations 
these important factors include  but are not limited to  those described in the following paragraphs and in the discussion above under the heading business  including  without limitation  the discussion under the subheading competition  system dependence 
the company derives approximately of its revenues from software products for ibm and ibm compatible mainframe computers 
ibm is attempting to reduce the overall software costs associated with the mvs mainframe platform and is continuing to enhance its utilities for ims and db to provide lower cost alternatives to those provided by bmc and other independent software vendors 
the company has traditionally maintained sufficient performance and functional advantages over ibm s base utilities  although there can be no assurances that it will continue to maintain such advantages 
cpu upgrade fees and enterprise license transactions are a substantial and integral component of the company s mainframe business  and the percentage of license revenues contributed by enterprise license transactions has increased over the last three fiscal years 
in fiscal and  the enterprise license fees for future additional processing capacity and license restructurings comprised and  respectively  of total revenues 
the company s future operating results are dependent upon customers continued requirements for  and investment in  their mainframe systems software and customers continually increasing need to use the company s existing software products on substantially greater mainframe processing capacity 
the company believes that the demand for enterprise licenses has been driven by customers re commitment over the last to months to the mvs mainframe platform for large scale  transaction intensive information systems 
whether this trend will continue is difficult to predict 
there can be no assurance that these trends of mips growth and of customers using the company s current mainframe products on more powerful computers will continue or that demand for enterprise license transactions will be sustained 
future operating results are also dependent on sustained improvement of the company s international operating results  which have been inconsistent over the last three fiscal years 
the company s operations and financial results could be significantly adversely affected by factors associated with international operations  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  uncertainties relative to regional economic circumstances and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 
operating income as a percentage of revenues operating margins remained relatively unchanged in the reported periods from fiscal to fiscal since the company s costs are to a large extent fixed in the short term and are planned primarily based on sales forecasts  failure to achieve planned revenue growth in a period would likely have a material adverse affect on operating margins and net earnings 
the company has increased its spending significantly in fiscal on its open systems initiatives  with the investment being targeted to research and development  sales and pre sales personnel 
the company intends to continue such increased investment  which will place additional pressure on its operating margins  particularly if revenue expectations are not met by its open systems products 
the company s financial model in fiscal anticipates a reduction in operating margins in the first two quarters  with expenses increasing more rapidly than revenues 
sales  support and distribution costs for client server software products are generally higher  as a percentage of sales  than for mainframe products  because of lower unit prices  more widely dispersed customers and prospects and intense competition 
the company is developing indirect channels through major open systems vendors to increase its coverage and presence in open systems markets in a cost effective manner 
there can be no assurance that this strategy will be effective  however 
although the company has made significant progress in implementing reseller and distribution arrangements for patrol  open systems indirect sales were not material in fiscal and generated approximately  in sales 
if the company s direct sales force remains the primary channel for its client server products  its cost of sales will likely increase and operating margins could be reduced 
the company s stock price has been highly volatile over the last several years 
future revenues  earnings and stock prices may be subject to wide swings  particularly on a quarterly basis in response to variations in operating and financial results  perceived revenue growth rates and other factors 
the stock price of software companies in general  and the company in particular  is primarily based on expectations of future revenue and earnings growth 
any failure of revenues or earnings to meet expected levels in a period would likely have a significant adverse effect on the company s stock price 
the timing and amount of the company s license revenues are subject to a number of factors that make estimation of operating results prior to the end of a quarter extremely uncertain 
the company generally operates with little or no sales backlog and  as a result  license revenues in any quarter are dependent on contracts entered into or orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
most of the company s sales are closed at the end of each quarter  and there has been and continues to be a trend toward larger single enterprise license transactions  which can have extended sales cycles and are less predictable 
the timing of closing large license agreements also increases the risks of quarter to quarter fluctuations and the uncertainty of estimating quarterly operating results 
failure to close an expected individually significant transaction could cause the company s revenues and earnings in a period to fall short of expectations 
the company generally does not know whether revenues and earnings will meet expected results until the last days of a quarter 
the company s ability to sustain growth depends in part on the timely development or acquisition of successful new and updated products 
the company s growth prospects are dependent upon the success of its open systems products 
software development is  however  a complex and creative process that can be difficult to accurately schedule and predict  and the company has experienced long development cycles and product delays in the past and expects to have delays in the future 
delays in new mainframe or client server product introductions or less than anticipated market acceptance of these new products are possible and would have an adverse effect on the company s revenues and earnings 
new products or new versions of existing products may  despite testing  contain undetected errors or bugs that will delay the introduction or adversely affect commercial acceptance of such products 
the company s strategic plans and business models contemplate significant revenue growth from its open systems product families 
this market is highly dynamic and is characterized by rapid change and intense competition 
many of the company s competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  sales and marketing resources than the company and greater experience in open systems development and sales 
a key factor in determining the success of the company s products  particularly its open systems offerings  will be their ability to interoperate and perform well with existing and future leading database management systems and other systems software products supported by the company s products 
while the company believes its products that address this market  including those under development  will compete effectively  this market will be relatively unpredictable over the next few years and there can be no assurance that anticipated results will be achieved 
the emergence of the internet and enterprise intranets as potential alternatives to the client server paradigm heightens such unpredictability 
cpu upgrade fees contributed  and of total revenues in fiscal years  and the charging of upgrade fees based on cpu tier classifications is standard among mainframe systems software vendors  including ibm 
the pricing of mainframe systems software  including the charging of tier based upgrade fees or other capacity based fees  is under continued pressure from customers 
although the company has adopted mips based pricing for enterprise licenses  it has not significantly changed the fact that customers pay more to use its products on more powerful cpus 
the company believes its current pricing policies most properly reflect the value provided by its products 
ibm provides alternatives to tier based pricing with respect to its large mainframe cpus and is attempting to reduce the costs of its mainframe systems software to increase the overall cost competitiveness of its mainframe computing platforms 
these actions have increased pricing pressures within the mainframe systems software markets 
the advent of ibm s sysplex pricing of its mainframe systems software when installed in a complex of coupled mainframe cpus may additionally increase these pricing pressures 
if changes in mainframe systems software pricing or increased competition were to result in significant price decreases that were not offset by sales volume increases  the company s business and financial results would be adversely affected 
litigation seeking to enforce patents  copyrights and trade secrets is increasing in the software industry 
there can be no assurance that a third party will not assert that its patents or other proprietary rights are violated by products offered by the company 
any such claims  with or without merit  can be time consuming and expensive to defend and could have an adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  financial position and cash flows
