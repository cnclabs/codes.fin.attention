the company s borrowing requirements are seasonal  with peak working capital needs generally arising at the end of the third quarter and the beginning of the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 
the company typically generates nearly all of its operating cash flow in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year reflecting third and fourth quarter shipments and the sale of inventory built during the first half of the fiscal year 
the acquisition of catalina cole has impacted this seasonal trend 
the women s fashion swimwear business is seasonal as merchandise is manufactured in the summer and fall months for shipment to department and specialty stores on regular day terms in the period from november to mid april

although the company believes that its current credit agreement and cash flow to be generated from future operations will also be sufficient for its long term operations periods beyond the next twelve months circumstances may arise that would require the company to seek additional financing 
in those circumstances the company expects to evaluate potential additional sources of funds  for example  sales of additional common stock and expanded or additional bank credit facilities

in fiscal  approximately of the company s net revenues were generated in the second half of the fiscal year and substantially all of the company s cash flow from operating activities is generated in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year

inflation the company does not believe that the relatively moderate levels of inflation which have been experienced in the united states and canada have had a significant effect on its net revenues or its profitability 
in the past  the company has been able to offset such effects by increasing prices or by instituting improvements in efficiency 
impact of new accounting standards the company accounts for its stock compensation arrangements under the provisions of apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and intends to continue to do so
