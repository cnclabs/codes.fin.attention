demand for financial market information is largely dependent upon activity levels in the securities markets 
the company s share of that demand is based on its ability to compete effectively with other financial information providers 
in the event that the us financial markets were to experience a prolonged period of investor inactivity in trading securities  the company s business could be adversely affected 
the degree of such consequences is uncertain 
the company continues to pursue projects to increase its share of its current markets and to broaden the scope of the markets in which the company competes 
certain isn customers have informed the company that they do not intend to renew their contracts upon expiration in revenues from these customers amounted to million in and forecasted revenues on these contracts prior to expiration are million 
while isn expects to replace these customers in  there can be no assurance that it will be successful in doing so 
pricing for communication services to certain isn customers has declined as a result of increased competition 
the company expects these pricing declines to continue as contracts are renewed in the near future 
in this market  revenue growth  if any  will come from the delivery of new services and increased market share 
inflation although management believes that inflation has not had a material effect on the results of its operations during the past three years  there can be no assurance that the company s results of operations will not be affected by inflation in the future
