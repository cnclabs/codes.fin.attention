item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the company operates in three principal business segments plastics machinery  machine tools and industrial products 
in the last year  all three segments experienced internal growth 
machine tools sales increased largely because of growth in sales of wolfpack designed standard products 
in the last three years  the plastics machinery and industrial products segments have experienced more rapid growth  primarily as a result of four major acquisitions 
on july   the company acquired talbot holdings  ltd 
talbot for approximately million in cash and assumed debt 
talbot operates primarily in the us and is a major supplier of round metalcutting tools 
with sales of about million  it is included in the industrial products segment 
the company s consolidated sales includes five months of talbot s sales 
on february   the company acquired krupp widia gmbh widia for approximately million of cash and assumed debt 
headquartered in germany  widia is one of the world s leading producers of metalcutting products and industrial magnets and is also being operated as part of the industrial products segment 
widia s sales approximated million  although the company s consolidated sales include only the eleven months in which the company owned widia 
on november   the company acquired ferromatik  the plastics injection molding machine business of kloeckner werke ag  for approximately million in cash and assumed debt 
ferromatik is also headquartered in germany  and is one of the world s leading producers of injection molding machines  it is part of the company s plastics machinery segment 
its annual sales approximated million 
all twelve months sales were included in and results  while only two months sales were included in consolidated results 
on february   the company acquired gte valenite corporation valenite for million of cash and assumed debt 
valenite  with its principal operations in the us and canada  is a leading us producer of consumable industrial metalcutting tools 
part of the industrial products segment  valenite s sales approximated million  excluding about million of european sales now managed by widia 
except for one month in  valenite s results are included for all of the years shown in the accompanying consolidated statement of earnings 
also in the last three years  the company has completed three divestitures 
the divestitures of electronic systems division esd and american mine tool amt resulted in gains  while the disposition of sano resulted in a loss  as described below 
except for these gains and the loss  these divestitures did not otherwise have a material effect on the comparability of the consolidated statement of earnings 
because of the company s recent acquisitions  as well as the company s internal growth in non us markets  close to half of the company s sales and operating earnings were generated outside the us foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect the translation of non us sales and earnings  as well as consolidated shareholders equity 
however  the company s major foreign operations are in european countries which have not experienced significant currency exchange rate fluctuations in recent years 
in  the generally stronger european currencies had the translation effect of increasing new orders and sales by approximately million and net earnings by million 
in addition  in there was an increase in shareholders equity due to a million reduction in the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment 
compared to new orders and backlog new orders for were  million  which represented a million  or  increase over of the million increase  million resulted from the widia and talbot acquisitions 
orders for plastics machinery increased million  or  primarily due to increased orders for german built injection molding machines 
although the segment experienced increased orders for the year  new business in the fourth quarter decreased compared to the exceptionally strong order level in the fourth quarter of machine tool orders increased in by million  or  as all major uk and uk product lines  including aerospace products  showed increases 
machine tool orders in the fourth quarter of were million  up over the fourth quarter of  however  the million was not as strong as earlier quarters 
this decline is expected to affect sales in the first quarter of orders for industrial products  excluding the acquisitions  increased by million  or  primarily as a result of increased industrial activity in the us and europe 
us export orders approximated million in compared to million in this represents a increase  which was primarily attributable to increased machine tool orders from european customers 
at december   the backlog of unfilled orders was million 
this figure has been reduced by esd s backlog of unfilled orders from non milacron customers as a result of the esd sale in december  despite this reduction  the backlog increased in by million  primarily as a result of the widia acquisition 
sales sales in were  million  which represented a million  or  increase over of the million increase  million represented sales from the acquisitions  widia and talbot 
the rest of the increase was attributable to i a million  or  increase in sales of plastics machinery resulting primarily from growth in the company s european injection molding and extrusion businesses  ii a million  or  increase in sales of machine tools resulting primarily from increased sales of uk built vertical machining centers  and iii excluding the acquisitions  a million  or  increase in industrial products sales due to increased sales in all businesses cutting fluids  grinding wheels and valenite cutting tools 
sales of all segments to non us markets totaled million  an increase in of million primarily due to the widia acquisition 
export sales totaled million  an increase of million  or  primarily due to increased sales of machine tools in europe 
in  products manufactured outside the us constituted of consolidated sales as compared to in  while products sold outside the us were of consolidated sales as compared to in margins  costs and expenses manufacturing margins increased to in compared to in  due primarily to the increased proportion of industrial products sales which have higher margins than the machinery businesses 
plastics machinery margins were unchanged for the year although they were lower in the last half of  largely due to increased exports and reduced automotive sales 
machine tools experienced a slight decline largely due to phasing out some older product lines 
industrial products margins declined slightly because of the mix of product sales 
selling and administrative expense increased due to the acquisitions and increased sales 
as a percent to sales  selling expense increased from to due to the higher proportion of industrial products sales which have higher selling costs 
administrative expense increased because the administrative costs of the newly acquired subsidiaries exceeded a reduction in corporate overhead expenses  although the total was less than of sales 
the million gain on disposition of businesses resulted from the million before tax gain on the sale of esd  which was sold in the fourth quarter of  and the million before tax gain on the sale of amt  which was sold in the first quarter of these transactions had the effect of increasing net earnings by million  or per share 
the esd sale is expected to have a material effect on the company s future operating results  its sales to non milacron customers approximated million and its before tax operating profit totaled approximately million 
however  the proceeds from the sale were used in january   to repay bank borrowings and to partially fund the d m e acquisition which is expected to increase earnings see subsequent events 
the million pretax integration charge million after tax relates to the company s february   acquisition of widia 
the widia acquisition allows the company to capitalize on synergistic opportunities with valenite  an existing subsidiary which manufactures similar products 
accordingly  in may   management formally approved a plan to integrate certain operations of these businesses at an expected cost of million which was increased to million million in cash in december   to include additional actions at widia 
that portion of the cost directly related to widia  totaling million  has been recorded as a purchase accounting adjustment  while the remaining million  which is directly related to valenite  was recorded as a charge to earnings 
the million plan involves the closing or downsizing of three manufacturing plants and the consolidation of numerous sales  service and warehouse operations in europe and asia 
the million integration charge includes million for severance and other termination benefits and million for facility exit costs and asset write downs 
as a result of the actions included in the million plan  which were started in and all of which are expected to be substantially completed in the first half of except for certain personnel reductions at widia  the company expects annual cost savings of approximately million 
the total cash cost of million will be funded by operations and bank borrowings 
other net increased by million due to a million increase in financing fees on the sale of receivables  as well as the effects of the acquisitions 
minority shareholders interests in earnings of subsidiaries relates principally to widia s interest in a public company in india 
interest expense  net of interest income  was million in compared to million in the primary cause of the increase was higher borrowing levels to support the widia and talbot acquisitions 
income taxes the provision for income taxes in both and consists primarily of us state and local income taxes and us income taxes in certain profitable jurisdictions 
the company entered and with us net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively 
the company also had net operating loss carryforwards in certain non us jurisdictions 
as a result  us federal income taxes and taxes in certain non us jurisdictions are minimal in both years due to the realization of certain fully reserved deferred tax assets  particularly the aforementioned net operating loss carryforwards 
earnings net earnings in were million  or per share  compared to million  or per share in the net earnings in included million  or per share  resulting from the combined effects of the gain on the disposition of two businesses  offset by the integration charge 
excluding these items  net earnings increased from by million  or 
per share 
compared to new orders and backlog new orders for were  million  which represented a million  or  increase over orders for plastics machinery increased million  or 
approximately million of the increase resulted from the acquisition of ferromatik late in other contributing factors included higher demand for us built injection molding machines and a single million european order 
machine tool new orders increased million  or  due to a greater demand for wolfpack designed products  primarily vertical machining centers 
orders for industrial products increased million  or  due primarily to the timing of the valenite acquisition and strengthening demand in the us us export orders approximated million in compared to million in the increase in export orders was primarily attributable to the plastics machinery segment 
at december   the backlog of unfilled orders was million compared with million at the beginning of the increase in backlog was primarily attributable to greater demand for ferromatik plastics machinery and vertical machining centers 
sales sales in were  million  which represented a million  or  increase over the sales increase was primarily attributable to i a million  or  increase in plastics machinery sales  which included an approximate million increase resulting from the acquisition of ferromatik in late  with the rest of the plastics machinery increase coming from injection molding machines and ii a million increase in industrial products sales  of which about half resulted from the inclusion of valenite s sales for twelve months in versus eleven months in machine tool sales declined by million  or  resulting primarily from a decline in demand from the aerospace market 
sales of all segments to non us markets increased in by million  or  primarily due to the effect of the ferromatik acquisition 
export shipments increased by million  or  primarily due to increases in exports of injection molding machines to mexico 
in  products manufactured outside the us were of consolidated sales as compared to in  while products sold outside the us were of consolidated sales as compared to in margins  costs and expenses manufacturing margins increased to in from in margins for all three segments improved 
plastics machinery benefited from increased volume and more stable pricing  machine tool reduced its costs due to the consolidation see consolidation charge  and industrial products achieved benefits from increased us sales of grinding wheels  metalworking fluids and cutting tools 
selling and administrative expense as a percent of sales was in both and the million disposition of a business in resulted from the decision to sell sano  due in part to continuing operating losses 
sano was included in the plastics machinery segment 
other net increased by million due to i a million increase in financing fees  principally attributed to the sale of receivables and ii the inclusion in of a million gain on the sale of surplus land 
interest expense  net of interest income  was million in compared to million in the increase was due to higher borrowing levels as well as higher interest rates 
consolidation charge in december   management adopted a plan to reduce machine tool manufacturing capacity by consolidating us machine tool manufacturing into facilities in cincinnati and accordingly recorded a charge of million in the fourth quarter of production at the company s two machine tool facilities in fountain inn and greenwood  south carolina  was phased out during and the plants were closed in the fourth quarter of the consolidation plan included a provision for the phase out of production in south carolina offset by a simultaneous ramp up of production in cincinnati to minimize the effect of the consolidation on sales 
however  two important factors necessitated adjustments to the original plan 
first  the favorable job market in south carolina resulted in an unexpectedly high early attrition rate affecting both production employees and certain other employees who were key to the execution of the production phase out plan 
the early attrition was particularly acute in parts manufacturing and resulted in an earlier than expected loss of capability in this area  slowing the phase out of production in south carolina and hampering the ramp up of production in cincinnati 
to offset some of the lost capability  the company had to temporarily utilize more costly subcontract sources 
second  market demand for machine tool products  including products previously manufactured in south carolina  was strong in this temporarily strained key suppliers  causing parts shortages and further slowing the ramp up of production in cincinnati 
these production delays and inefficiencies during the consolidation process contributed to lower than expected operating earnings in the machine tools segment and resulted in an estimated million to million reduction in sales of products previously manufactured in south carolina 
completion of the consolidation was originally expected to result in a net employee reduction of in us machine tool operations 
however  increased customer demand for machine tool products  including the products being transferred from south carolina  resulted in a net employee reduction of as a result of the larger than expected number of voluntary terminations and transfers to cincinnati  the cost for severance and other fringe benefits was approximately million less than anticipated 
simultaneously  the delay in the phase out of production in south carolina resulted in additional operating losses of approximately million through the closure date of the two plants 
the net million reduction in the cost of the consolidation was utilized to absorb incremental costs arising from the and machine tool restructurings  including the lower estimated net proceeds from the sale of the heald facility  the closure of certain overseas sales offices and the restructuring of us machine tool operations 
the consolidation was originally expected to result in annual cost savings of approximately million 
approximately million of the million in anticipated savings related to the planned net employee reduction of people 
as a result of the lower than expected reduction  the actual annual cost savings were million less than originally anticipated 
however  higher margins associated with increased sales offset this reduction 
the consolidation plan was essentially completed by year end   although the company experienced some production difficulties in early which were related to the consolidation and a simultaneous increase in customer demand 
income taxes the provision for income taxes in both and consists primarily of us state and local income taxes and us income taxes in certain profitable jurisdictions 
income taxes were minimal in because benefits from the utilization of the company s us and us net operating loss carryforwards were applied as a reduction of the provision for income taxes 
current tax benefits were not offset against the us loss in in accordance with the income tax accounting rules that became effective january  in addition  current tax benefits could not be recognized for losses in certain non us jurisdictions 
earnings earnings before extraordinary item and cumulative effect of changes in methods of accounting improved to million  or per share  in compared to a loss of million  or per share  in the loss was caused by the million consolidation charge described above and the million charge for the disposition of a business described above 
the net loss for included the effect of an extraordinary charge of million  or 
per share  related to the early extinguishment of million of debentures 
the net loss for also included the effect of adopting sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  effective january   resulting in charges to earnings totaling million  or per share 
except for the cumulative effect  the new rules regarding postretirement medical benefits did not significantly affect the company s earnings in any of the years presented  while the new rules regarding income taxes had the effect of reducing the company s effective tax rate in all the years presented due to the realization of net operating loss carryforwards 
net earnings were million  or per share  in  compared to a net loss of million  or per share  in the net loss was caused by the aforementioned charges  the extraordinary item and the cumulative effect of changes in methods of accounting that totaled million 
liquidity and sources of capital at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million  an increase of million during the year 
the increase resulted primarily from the sale of esd near the end of operating activities provided million of cash in after deducting incremental cash costs of the industrial products integration and the us machine tool consolidation of million 
operating activities provided million in working capital improved by million in and the current ratio improved to these improvements resulted primarily from the acquisitions and divestitures 
expenditures for new property  plant and equipment in were million  compared to million in proceeds from the disposal of property  plant and equipment for were million compared to million in proceeds during both years included amounts related to the sale of surplus assets and the sale and operating leaseback of certain manufacturing equipment 
the capital budget is million  some of which may be financed through operating leases 
in  the acquisitions of widia and talbot resulted in cash payments of million  including the related professional fees 
also in  the company realized proceeds of million on the disposition of esd and amt 
while a portion of the proceeds from the esd sale were used to partially repay existing bank borrowings before year end  the majority is included in cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
the widia acquisition was financed by borrowing million under the company s revolving credit facility  that portion of which is classified as long term debt 
also in  the company issued million of notes 
the proceeds were used principally to pay down other long term debt and to reduce amounts payable to banks 
the subsequent acquisition of talbot was financed by available cash and increasing amounts payable to banks 
the company had a number of short term intercompany loans and advances denominated in various currencies totaling approximately million at december   that were subject to foreign currency exchange risk 
the company also enters into various transactions  in the ordinary course of business  for the purchase and sale of goods and services in various currencies 
the company hedges its exposure to currency fluctuations related to short term intercompany loans and advances and the purchase and sale of goods under firm commitments by entering into foreign exchange contracts to minimize the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to significant transactions 
the company is currently not involved with any additional derivative financial instruments 
at year end  the company had lines of credit with various us and non us banks of approximately million  including a million committed revolving credit facility 
these credit facilities support letters of credit and leases in addition to providing borrowings under varying terms 
the revolving credit facility was amended in may   to allow for the purchase of talbot  to extend the debt maturity to  and  at the company s request  to reduce the amount of the facility to million to reduce facility fees 
the facility imposes a number of restrictions  including restrictions on total indebtedness in relation to total capital 
the company has remained in compliance with the restrictions imposed by the facility since its inception 
under the provisions of the amended facility  the company s additional borrowing capacity totaled approximately million at year end the interest rates on the lines of credit and the financing fees on the receivables purchase agreement fluctuate based on changes in prevailing interest rates in the countries in which amounts are borrowed or receivables are sold 
at december   approximately million was subject to the effects of fluctuations in interest rates under these arrangements 
future changes in interest rates will affect the company s interest expense and other financing costs 
total debt was million at december   an increase of million over the ratio of total debt to total capital debt plus equity was at december   down from at year end the company believes that its cash flow from operations and available credit lines will be sufficient to meet its debt service  capital expenditures and other operating requirements  including those associated with the acquisition of d m e see subsequent events 
subsequent events on january   the company completed the acquisition of d m e 
with sales of approximately million  d m e is the largest us producer of mold bases  standard components and supplies for the plastics injection mold making industry 
the acquisition was financed initially through the execution of million of notes payable to the seller along with million of cash 
one promissory note of million was subsequently paid 
the other notes mature on january   but are subject to prepayment at the option of either the buyer or the seller at any time after july  to finance the acquisition  the company completed an amendment to its revolving credit facility that increased the facility to million and extended the debt maturity to january  after giving effect to the acquisition on a pro forma basis  as if the transaction had been completed by year end  the company s unused borrowing capacity would be approximately million and its debt to capital ratio would be 
longer term financing for the acquisition will be completed at a later date and may include the issuance of some form of equity 
outlook as for the future  the slowdown in the north american and european economies  which began in mid  is likely to persist and the company is planning on only modest economic growth in the second half of the year 
even in this environment  however  due to new product introductions and productivity improvements  the company expects good improvements in sales and earnings in  compared with results after excluding the effect of dispositions and the integration charge
