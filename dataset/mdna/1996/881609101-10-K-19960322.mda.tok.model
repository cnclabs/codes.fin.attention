comparability between and was further impacted by certain significant transactions 
earnings for included an after tax gain of approximately million from the sale of certain interests in the bob west field in south texas and a charge of approximately million for employee terminations and other restructuring costs 
during  earnings were favorably impacted by a refund of million received in settlement of a tariff dispute and a gain of million from the sale of assets  partially offset by net charges of approximately million related to environmental contingencies and other matters 
excluding these significant transactions from both years  the improvement in net earnings of approximately million in was primarily attributable to increased natural gas production from the company s exploration and production operations in south texas and improvements in the company s refining and marketing operations  in spite of difficult industry conditions that prevailed throughout most of the year 
net earnings of million

per share in earnings before the extraordinary loss in were million 
per share 
as described above  earnings in benefited from a refund received in settlement of a tariff dispute and a gain from the sale of assets  partially offset by net charges related to environmental contingencies and other matters 
during  the company s earnings benefited from the resolutions of several state tax issues  resulting in a net reduction of million in income tax expense and million in interest expense 
in addition  a gain of million was recognized in for the retirement of million principal amount of subordinated debentures  which were purchased to satisfy the initial sinking fund requirement on such debt 
excluding these transactions  the improvement in net earnings of approximately million in was primarily attributable to increased natural gas production from the company s exploration and production operations in south texas  partially offset by the impact of lower spot market prices for sales of natural gas and lower operating results from the company s refining and marketing operations 
a discussion and analysis of the factors contributing to these results are presented below 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes  together with the following information  are intended to provide shareholders and other investors with a reasonable basis for assessing the company s operations  but should not serve as the sole criterion for predicting the future performance of the company

sources of total product sales include products manufactured at the refinery  existing inventory balances and products purchased from third parties 
margins on sales of purchased products  together with the effect of changes in inventories  are included in the gross margin on total product sales presented above 
during  and  the company s purchases of refined products for resale approximated   and  average daily barrels  respectively 
the refinery product spread presented above represents the excess of yield value of the products manufactured at the refinery over the cost of raw materials used to manufacture such products 
compared to the refining and marketing segment attained operating profit of 
million in  despite industry refining margins that were among the lowest in a decade 
these results compare with operating profit of million in  which benefited from an million refund received in settlement of a tariff dispute  a gain of million from the sale of assets and favorable feedstock cost adjustments of million  partially offset by million for environmental contingencies and other matters 
there were no comparable significant transactions recorded in excluding these items from  operating profit in reflected an improvement of million from the operating results 
the company s average feedstock costs increased by  from per barrel in to per barrel in  while the average yield value of the company s refinery production increased by only  from per barrel in to per barrel in increased demand for alaska north slope ans crude oil for use as a feedstock in west coast refineries and declining production volumes of ans  combined with an oversupply of products in alaska and on the west coast  resulted in higher feedstock costs for the company relative to increases in refined product sales prices 
as a result  the company s refined product margins were depressed in the start up in december of a vacuum unit at the company s refinery increased the yield of higher valued products during and lessened the impact of these industry conditions on the company s refinery spread 
the company s refinery yield of residual products was reduced to of total production in from of total production in in addition  margins on sales of inventories and purchased volumes combined to improve the segment s gross margins on total product sales to per barrel in  compared to per barrel in the company s total refinery production increased by  including a increase in gasoline volumes and a increase in middle distillates volumes 
accordingly  in  the company implemented initiatives that increased the demand for the refinery s production and improved the refinery s capacity utilization and efficiencies 
in these regards  the company expanded its marketing efforts by branding and rebranding sales outlets in alaska and the pacific northwest and by exporting refined products to the far east  including russia 
revenues from export sales totaled million in compared to million in the company s total product sales increased to  average barrels per day in from  average barrels per day in revenues from sales of refined products in were higher than in due to higher sales prices and the increase in sales volumes 
to optimize the refinery s feedstock mix and in response to market conditions  the company at times resells previously purchased crude oil which aggregated million in and million in costs of sales were higher in due to higher volumes and prices 
operating expenses decreased by million in primarily due to lower environmental costs  partly offset by increased employee costs and fuels and utilities expense 
depreciation and amortization increased by million in due to capital additions  primarily the vacuum unit  completed in late included in was a million gain from the sale of assets 
compared to throughout most of  the refining and marketing segment was adversely affected by the volatile product market and increased demand for ans crude oil 
the adverse effect of market conditions on the segment s results  combined with charges of million for environmental contingencies and other matters  was partially offset by a refund of million received in settlement of a tariff dispute  a gain of million from the sale of assets and favorable feedstock cost adjustments of million 
excluding these items  the segment s operating profit of million for would be reduced to a loss of million  compared with operating profit of million in the decrease in operating results was primarily attributable to lower gross margins on sales of refined products  which fell to per barrel in  from per barrel in revenues from sales of refined products in were lower than due to lower sales prices 
however  these lower refined product revenues in were partially offset by crude oil resales of million  compared to million in the increase in operating expenses of million was primarily for environmental matters and  to a lesser extent  higher advertising and maintenance expenses 
during  the company improved the refinery s economics  which included upgrading feedstocks  more closely matching production with product demand within alaska and initiating new marketing efforts within and outside alaska 
these efforts reduced the company s overall refinery production in  particularly residual fuel oil 
during  the company reduced its average daily refinery throughput and production by from the levels 
this reduction in throughput enabled the company to reduce the percentage of lower quality ans crude oil in the feedstock mix to in  compared with in by utilizing a greater percentage of higher quality feedstocks which results in higher valued production yields  the company can economically operate the refinery at reduced throughput levels 
operating the refinery at lower throughput levels resulted in less production of certain products in  particularly residual fuel oil  for which there is no significant market in alaska 
during  residual fuel oil produced at the refinery was exported from alaska and sold into us west coast and far east markets 
these markets had generally been weak for and the past several years due to a global oversupply of this product

the company is involved in litigation with tennessee gas pipeline company tennessee gas relating to a natural gas sales contract tennessee gas contract 
see capital resources and liquidity tennessee gas contract and notes n and q of notes to consolidated financial statements in item amounts previously reported have been restated for certain reclassifications between revenues and operating expenses 
production costs for the company s us operations include such items as severance taxes  property taxes  insurance and materials and supplies 
since severance taxes are based upon sales prices of natural gas  the average production costs presented above include the impact of above market prices for sales under the tennessee gas contract 
production costs per mcf of natural gas sold in the spot market were approximately  
and 
for  and  respectively 
exploration and production united states compared to operating profit of million in from the company s us oil and gas operations included a gain of approximately million from the sale of certain interests in the bob west field 
excluding this gain  operating profit from these operations would have been approximately million in compared with million in  reflecting a continued successful drilling program which resulted in an increase in the company s us natural gas production in south texas 
after the sale of certain bob west field interests in september  which included interests in gross producing wells  the number of wells in which the company had an interest was reduced to at year end  compared with producing wells at year end the company s us natural gas production sold into the spot market increased by and production sold under the tennessee gas contract increased by 
revenues increased by million due to these increases in production  but were partially offset by lower spot market natural gas sales prices 
the company s weighted average sales price decreased to per mcf during from per mcf in  reflecting lower spot market sales prices and a lower percentage of production sold to tennessee gas at above market prices 
in  approximately of the company s total us production was sold to tennessee gas  compared to in and in the company recognizes revenues for sales to tennessee gas based on a contract price  which exceeded a nonrefundable cash price by an aggregate of million  net of severance taxes  in total production costs and other operating expenses were higher in due to the increased production levels and severance taxes related to the above market pricing of sales to tennessee gas  but were relatively unchanged on a per mcf basis 
the impact of the increased production volumes on depletion expense was substantially offset by a reduction in the depletion rate which resulted from additions to proved reserves during the year and elimination of proportionately higher future development costs on the reserves sold in the bob west field 
in  operating results from the exploration and production segment included natural gas production of approximately mmcf per day  revenues of million and operating profit of million related to the interests that were sold in the bob west field 
for further information regarding the sale of these interests  see note b of notes to consolidated financial statements in item under the terms of a bond posting related to the tennessee gas litigation  tennessee gas must until april  take at least its entire monthly take or pay obligation and pay for gas taken at per mmbtu 
without the bonding arrangements associated with the litigation  tennessee gas could elect  and from time to time has elected  not to take gas under the tennessee gas contract 
the company recognizes revenues under the tennessee gas contract based on the quantity of natural gas actually taken by tennessee gas 
while tennessee gas has the right to elect not to take gas during any contract year  this right is subject to an obligation to pay within days after the end of such contract year for gas not taken  subject to the provisions of the bond posting 
the contract year ends on january of each year 
although the failure to take gas could adversely affect the company s income and cash flows from operating activities within a contract year  the company should recover reduced cash flows shortly after the end of the contract year under the take or pay provisions of the tennessee gas contract  subject to the provisions of the bond posting 
see capital resources and liquidity tennessee gas contract and notes n and q of notes to consolidated financial statements in item the company enters into commodity price swap agreements to reduce the risk caused by fluctuations in the prices of natural gas in the spot market 
during and  the company used such arrangements to set the price of and  respectively  of the natural gas production that it sold in the spot market 
during each of the years and  the company realized net gains in gas revenues of approximately 
million from these price swap arrangements 
these gains had the effect of adding 
per mcf to the company s average spot market sales price for and as of january   the company had entered into such price swaps for production totaling billion cubic feet for an average houston ship channel price of per mcf 
in  the company s average spot market wellhead price per mcf was 
less than the average houston ship channel index  the difference representing transportation and marketing costs from the wellhead in south texas 
for further information on the company s natural gas price swap agreements  see note p of notes to consolidated financial statements in item in addition to the natural gas producing activities  during the company s results included revenues of million and operating profit of million for transportation of natural gas to common carrier pipelines in the south texas area  of which approximately relates to transportation of the company s production 
the increase in these results in  compared to  was due to higher transmission volumes stemming primarily from the development of the bob west field together with an expansion of the pipeline in mid compared to the number of producing wells in which the company has a working interest increased to at year end  compared with at the end of  resulting in a increase in the company s us natural gas production 
revenues from the us oil and gas operations increased by million in primarily due to the increased production 
however  revenues were adversely impacted by a decline in the weighted average sales price of natural gas  which included a drop in spot market prices 
due to the increase in volumes sold in the spot market  the percentage contribution of sales at above market prices under the tennessee gas contract was reduced 
in  approximately of the company s net production from the bob west field was sold under the tennessee gas contract  compared with in total production costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization were higher in due to the increased production level 
operating results from the company s natural gas transportation operations increased by million due to higher transmission volumes associated with the increased production levels in south texas 
transportation of the company s production accounted for approximately and of these results in and  respectively 
exploration and production bolivia compared to operating profit from the company s bolivian operations decreased by million in  reflecting a decrease in net natural gas production 
during  the company had benefited from higher levels of production due to the inability of another producer to satisfy gas supply requirements 
partially offsetting the decrease in production in were increases in the average prices of natural gas and condensate production 
the company s bolivian natural gas production is sold to yacimientos petroliferos fiscales bolivianos ypfb  which in turn sells the natural gas to yacimientos petroliferos fiscales  sa ypf  a publicly held company based in argentina 
during  the contract between ypfb and ypf was extended through march   maintaining approximately the same volumes as the previous contract 
currently  the company is selling its natural gas production to ypfb based on the volume and pricing terms in the contract between ypfb and ypf 
compared to results from the company s bolivian operations improved by 
million in  primarily due to a increase in average daily natural gas production 
the company was producing gas at higher levels during due to the inability of another producer to satisfy gas supply requirements

operating loss capital expenditures 


refined product sales average daily barrels    compared to in  the company continued consolidating certain operations in its former oil field supply and distribution segment by exiting the land based portion of its petroleum product distribution business  reducing the total number of company sites to  primarily marine based  at year end 
in these regards  four texas locations were sold in included in operating and other expenses in was a charge of 
million related to employee terminations and other exit costs 
revenues and costs of sales were lower in due to reduced volumes while these operations were being consolidated 
in february  the company purchased of the outstanding capital stock of coastwide energy services  inc coastwide 
coastwide is primarily a provider of services and a wholesale distributor of diesel fuel and lubricants to the offshore drilling industry in the gulf of mexico 
the company will combine its remaining petroleum distribution operations with coastwide  forming a marine services segment 
as a combined operation  the marine services segment will consist of terminals  primarily marine based  and will provide a broad range of products and logistical support services to the offshore drilling and drilling related businesses 
on a pro forma basis  if the purchase would have occurred at the beginning of  the coastwide operations would have added approximately million to the company s revenues 
for additional information on this acquisition  see note b of notes to consolidated financial statements in item compared to although sales volumes of refined products increased by in  sales prices and gross margins were impacted by strong competition in an oversupplied market 
by consolidating certain of the company s terminals and discontinuing the environmental products marketing operations  operating and other expenses were reduced to million in from million in included in operating expenses in were charges of million for discontinuing the company s environmental products marketing operations 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses of million in compare with million in and million in the increase in was primarily due to higher employee and other benefit costs 
the decrease in  compared to  was principally due to lower expenses resulting from cost reduction measures previously implemented at the company 
interest expense interest expense of million in compares with million in and million in the increase in  compared with  was primarily due to interest on the vacuum unit financing and cash borrowings under the revolving credit facility during and interest capitalized in related to the construction of the vacuum unit 
as discussed in notes h and i of notes to consolidated financial statements  in december  the company redeemed million of its subordinated debentures which  together with lower borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility  are expected to result in future annual interest expense savings of approximately million 
the increase in  compared with  was primarily due to a reduction of million recorded in related to the resolution of outstanding issues with several state taxing authorities  partially offset by 
million of capitalized interest in other expense other expense of million in compares with million in and million in the increase in  compared with  was primarily due to severance costs and related benefits of million resulting from a reduction in administrative workforce and other employee terminations see note j of notes to consolidated financial statements in item  partially offset by lower environmental and other expenses related to the company s former operations 
the increase in  compared with  was primarily due to higher environmental and other costs associated with the company s former operations and to a gain of million recorded in for the extinguishment of debt 
income taxes income taxes of million in compare with million in and million in the decrease in was primarily due to lower state income taxes 
no income taxes were provided on the gain on sales of assets during due to the utilization of previously unrecognized net operating losses and other carryforwards 
the increase in  compared with  was primarily due to a reduction of million recorded in for resolution of outstanding issues with several state taxing authorities 
impact of changing prices the company s operating results and cash flows are sensitive to the volatile changes in energy prices 
major shifts in the cost of crude oil used for refinery feedstocks and the price of refined products can result in a change in gross margin from the refining and marketing operations  as prices received for refined products may or may not keep pace with changes in crude oil costs 
these energy prices  together with volume levels  also determine the carrying value of crude oil and refined product inventory 
likewise  changes in natural gas prices impact revenues and the present value of estimated future net revenues and cash flows from the company s exploration and production operations 
from time to time  the company may increase or decrease its natural gas production in response to market conditions 
the carrying value of oil and gas assets may also be subject to noncash write downs based on changes in natural gas prices and other determining factors 
capital resources and liquidity the company operates in an environment where markets for crude oil  natural gas and refined products historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
the company s liquidity and capital resources are significantly impacted by changes in the supply of and demand for crude oil  natural gas and refined petroleum products  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond the control of the company 
these factors include  among others  the level of consumer product demand  weather conditions  the proximity of the company s natural gas reserves to pipelines  the capacities of such pipelines  fluctuations in seasonal demand  governmental regulations  the price and availability of alternative fuels and overall economic conditions 
the company cannot predict the future markets and prices for its natural gas or refined products and the resulting future impact on earnings and cash flows 
the company s future capital expenditures  borrowings under its credit arrangements and other sources of capital will be affected by these conditions 
although the company expects continued market improvement  the company s operations in the past have been adversely affected by depressed market conditions 
the company continues to assess its existing asset base in order to maximize returns and financial flexibility through diversification  acquisitions and divestitures in all of its operating segments 
this ongoing assessment includes  in the exploration and production segment  evaluating ways in which the company might diversify the mix of its oil and gas assets and reduce the asset concentration associated with the bob west field 
in the refining and marketing segment  the company has been engaged in an ongoing effort to evaluate these assets and operations and has considered possible joint ventures  strategic alliances or business combinations  however  such evaluations have not resulted in any transaction 
the company continues to assess its marine services segment  pursuing opportunities to consolidate operations and improve efficiencies 
as a result of this ongoing assessment  the company has taken two significant steps in o in september  the company sold certain interests in the bob west field which would have required approximately million of capital expenditures for future development of proven reserves 
net proceeds from the sale of these interests in the bob west field were used to redeem million of the company s outstanding subordinated debentures  reduce borrowings under its revolving credit facility and improve corporate liquidity see notes b and i of notes to consolidated financial statements in item 
o during  the company restructured certain operations in its former oil field supply and distribution segment by exiting the land based portion of its petroleum product distribution business  and in february the company acquired coastwide and combined these operations with the company s remaining oil field supply and distribution operations 
at closing  consideration for the stock of coastwide includes  shares of tesoro s common stock and approximately million in cash 
the market price of tesoro s common stock was per share at closing of this transaction 
upon exchange of coastwide s remaining warrants  options and convertible debentures  the company will issue approximately  additional shares of tesoro s common stock and pay million in cash 
credit arrangements the company has financing and credit arrangements under a three year corporate revolving credit facility facility dated april   with a consortium of ten banks 
the facility  which is subject to a borrowing base  provides for i the issuance of letters of credit up to the full amount of the borrowing base and ii cash borrowings up to the amount of the borrowing base attributable to domestic oil and gas reserves 
outstanding obligations under the facility are secured by liens on substantially all of the company s trade accounts receivable and product inventory and by mortgages on the company s refinery and south texas natural gas reserves 
under the terms of the facility  which has been amended from time to time  the company is required to maintain specified levels of working capital  tangible net worth  consolidated cash flow and refining and marketing cash flow  as defined 
among other matters  the facility contains certain restrictions with respect to i capital expenditures  ii incurrence of additional indebtedness  and iii dividends on capital stock 
the facility contains other covenants customary in credit arrangements of this kind 
future compliance with certain financial covenants is primarily dependent on the company s maintenance of specified levels of cash flows from operations  capital expenditures  levels of borrowings and the value of the company s domestic oil and gas reserves 
in october  the facility was amended which  among other matters  i reduced available commitments from million to million  ii permitted the company to redeem a portion of its outstanding subordinated debentures  and iii reduced the required level of refining and marketing cash flow 
if the company s refining and marketing cash flow  as defined  does not meet required levels  the million availability will be incrementally reduced  but not below million 
at december   the company had available commitments under the facility of million which included a domestic oil and gas reserve component of million 
at december   the company had outstanding letters of credit under the facility of approximately million and no cash borrowings outstanding  with remaining unused available commitments of million 
for the year ended december   the company s gross borrowings and repayments under the facility totaled million  averaging approximately million outstanding per day  which were used on a short term basis to finance working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
debt and other obligations on december   the company redeemed million of its outstanding subordinated debentures at a price equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued interest to the redemption date 
following this partial redemption  all future sinking fund requirements are satisfied and the company has million principal amount of subordinated debentures outstanding  which is due march  and bears interest at per annum 
the company s funded debt obligations as of december  also included million principal amount of exchange notes exchange notes which bear interest at per annum  mature december  and have no sinking fund requirements 
the subordinated debentures and exchange notes are redeemable at the option of the company at of principal amount  plus accrued interest 
the company continuously reviews financing alternatives with respect to its subordinated debentures and exchange notes 
however  there can be no assurance whether or when the company would propose other refinancings 
during  the company reduced its ratio of long term debt to capitalization from at year end to at year end the indenture governing the subordinated debentures contains certain covenants  including a restriction that prevents the current payment of cash dividends on common stock and currently limits the company s ability to purchase or redeem any shares of its capital stock 
the limitation of dividend payments included in the indenture governing the exchange notes is less restrictive than the limitation imposed by the subordinated debentures 
for further information on redemption provisions and restrictions on dividends  see note i of notes to consolidated financial statements in item under an agreement reached in  which settled a contractual dispute with the state of alaska state  the company paid the state million in january and is obligated to make variable monthly payments to the state through december based on a per barrel charge on the volume of feedstock processed at the company s refinery 
in  and  based on a per barrel throughput charge of cents  the company s variable payments to the state amounted to million  million and million  respectively 
the per barrel charge increases to cents in and to cents in with one cent annual incremental increases thereafter through in january  the company is obligated to pay the state million  provided  however  that such payment may be deferred indefinitely by continuing the variable monthly payments to the state beginning at cents per barrel for and increasing one cent per barrel annually thereafter 
variable monthly payments made after january will not reduce the million obligation to the state 
the million obligation is evidenced by a security bond  and the bond and the throughput barrel obligations are secured by a mortgage on the company s refinery 
the company s obligations under the agreement with the state and the mortgage are subordinated to current and future senior debt of up to million plus any indebtedness incurred subsequent to the date of the agreement to improve the company s refinery 
capital expenditures capital spending in amounted to million  which was funded from available cash reserves  cash flows from operations and borrowings under the facility 
capital expenditures for the company s exploration and production segment were approximately million  or  of total capital expenditures 
during  the company participated in the drilling of development wells in the bob west field and nine exploratory wells in other areas of south texas 
capital projects for the company s refining and marketing operations for totaled million  primarily for capital improvements at the refinery and expansion of the company s retail locations in alaska and the pacific northwest 
for  the company has under consideration total capital expenditures of approximately million excluding amounts related to the purchase of coastwide 
the exploration and production segment accounts for million  or  of the budgeted expenditures with million planned for us activities and million for bolivia 
planned us expenditures include million for exploration  development and acquisition outside of the bob west field and million for development of the bob west field which the company expects to substantially complete in as a result of the sale in september of certain interests in the bob west field  the company reduced future capital expenditures by approximately million which would otherwise have been required to develop the proved reserves that were sold 
in bolivia  the drilling program includes two exploratory wells  one of which is currently being tested 
capital spending for the refining and marketing segment is projected to be million  which includes amounts for installation of facilities to allow the company to begin producing and marketing asphalt in alaska and for improvements and upgrades at the company s refinery and convenience store operations 
capital expenditures for are expected to be financed through a combination of cash flows from operations  available cash reserves and borrowings under the facility 
cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities at december   the company s net working capital totaled million  which included cash and cash equivalents of million

during  net cash from operating activities totaled million  compared with million in although natural gas production from the company s south texas operations increased during  lower cash receipts for sales of natural gas adversely affected the company s cash flows from operations 
under a settlement agreement entered into in  variable payments to the state totaled million in net cash from investing activities of million in included proceeds of million from sales of assets  primarily certain interests in the bob west field  partially offset by million of capital expenditures and million for acquisition of the kenai pipe line company kpl 
net cash used in financing activities of million in was primarily related to the redemption of million of subordinated debentures and other payments of long term debt 
the company s gross borrowings and repayments under the facility totaled million during net cash from operating activities increased to million in  compared with million in this increase in cash flows was primarily related to sales of increased natural gas production from the bob west field  partially offset by lower prices received for such sales of natural gas and reduced cash flows from the refining and marketing operations 
variable payments to the state totaled million in net cash used in investing activities of million during included capital expenditures of million  mainly for exploration and production activities in the bob west field and installation of the vacuum unit at the company s refinery 
during  the company participated in the drilling of development wells and two exploratory wells in the bob west field and the expansion of the field s gas processing facilities and pipelines 
in addition  the company participated in the drilling of five exploratory wells and one unsuccessful development well in other areas of south texas 
these uses of cash in investing activities in were partially offset by a net decrease of million in short term investments and cash proceeds of million from sales of assets 
net cash from financing activities of million during included million in borrowings under the vacuum unit loan and million net proceeds from an equity offering see note h of notes to consolidated financial statements in item 
these financing sources of cash during were partially offset by the repayment of net borrowings of million under interim financing arrangements early in and dividends of million paid on preferred stock 
during  cash and cash equivalents decreased by million 
during  cash and cash equivalents decreased by million 
net cash from operating activities of million in was primarily due to net earnings adjusted for certain noncash charges  partially offset by payments totaling million to the state under a settlement agreement and increased working capital requirements 
net cash used in investing activities of million during included capital expenditures of million  mainly for exploration and production activities in the bob west field 
during  the company completed the expansion of a gas processing facility and pipeline and participated in the drilling of development gas wells in this field 
in addition  the company participated in drilling four exploratory wells and one development well outside of the bob west field in these uses of cash in investing activities were partially offset by a net decrease of million in short term investments 
net cash used in financing activities of million in included the repurchase of million principal amount of subordinated debentures for million in cash  partially offset by borrowings of million under interim financing arrangements 
the company did not pay dividends on preferred stocks in tennessee gas contract the company is selling a portion of the gas produced from its bob west field to tennessee gas pipeline company tennessee gas under a gas purchase and sales agreement tennessee gas contract which provides that the price of gas shall be the maximum price as calculated in accordance with section b contract price of the natural gas policy act of ngpa 
in august  tennessee gas filed suit against the company in the district court of bexar county  texas  alleging that the tennessee gas contract is not applicable to the company s properties and that the gas sales price should be the price calculated under the provisions of section of the ngpa rather than the contract price 
during the month of december  the contract price was in excess of per mcf and the average spot market price was per mcf 
for the year ended december   approximately of the company s net us natural gas production was sold under the tennessee gas contract 
tennessee gas also claimed that the contract should be considered an output contract under section of the texas uniform commercial code ucc and that the increases in volumes tendered under the contract exceeded those allowable for an output contract 
the district court judge returned a verdict in favor of the company on all issues 
on appeal by tennessee gas  the court of appeals for the fourth supreme judicial district of texas affirmed the validity of the tennessee gas contract as to the company s properties and held that the price payable by tennessee gas for the gas was the contract price 
the court of appeals remanded the case to the trial court based on its determination i that the tennessee gas contract was an output contract and ii that a fact issue existed as to whether the increases in the volumes of gas tendered to tennessee gas under the contract were made in bad faith or were unreasonably disproportionate to prior tenders 
the company sought review of the appellate court ruling on the output contract issue in the supreme court of texas 
tennessee gas also sought review of the appellate court ruling denying the remaining tennessee gas claims in the supreme court of texas 
the appellate court decision was the first decision reported in texas holding that a take or pay contract was an output contract 
the supreme court of texas heard arguments in december regarding the output contract issue and certain of the issues raised by tennessee gas 
on august   the supreme court of texas  in a divided opinion  affirmed the decision of the appellate court on all issues  including that the price under the tennessee gas contract is the contract price  and determined that the tennessee gas contract was an output contract and remanded the case to the trial court for determination of whether gas volumes tendered by the company to tennessee gas were tendered in good faith and were not unreasonably disproportionate to any normal or otherwise comparable prior output or stated estimates in accordance with the ucc 
the company filed a motion for rehearing before the texas supreme court on the issue of whether the tennessee gas contract is an output contract 
the company believes that  if this issue is tried  the gas volumes tendered to tennessee gas will be found to have been in good faith and otherwise in accordance with the requirements of the ucc 
however  there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome at trial 
in conjunction with the district court judgment and on behalf of all sellers under the tennessee gas contract  tennessee gas is presently required to post a supersede as bond in the amount of million 
under the terms of this bond  for the period september  through april   tennessee gas is required to take at least its entire monthly take or pay obligation and pay for gas taken at per mmbtu  which approximates per mcf bond price 
the million bond represents an amount which together with anticipated sales of natural gas at the bond price will equal the anticipated value of the tennessee gas contract from september  through april  except for the period september  through august   the difference between the spot market price and the bond price is refundable in the event tennessee gas ultimately prevails in the litigation 
the company retains the right to receive the contract price for all gas sold to tennessee gas 
through december   under the tennessee gas contract  the company recognized cumulative net revenues in excess of spot market prices totaling approximately million 
of the million incremental net revenues  the company has received million that is nonrefundable and million which the company could be required to repay in the event of an adverse ruling 
the remaining million of incremental net revenues is classified in the company s consolidated balance sheet as a noncurrent receivable at december  and represents the unpaid difference between the contract price and the bond price as described above 
an adverse outcome of this litigation could require the company to reverse as much as million of the incremental revenues and could require the company to repay as much as million for amounts received above spot prices  plus interest if awarded by the court
