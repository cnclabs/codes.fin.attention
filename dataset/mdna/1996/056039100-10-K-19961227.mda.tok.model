general industry the company currently derives substantially all of its revenues from the sale of steel containers manufactured at the company s plants 
the specific metal packaging markets in which the company competes are generally mature and stable 
on average  domestic industry growth rates have historically followed us gdp growth rates 
management believes that companies that have managed sustained growth in these markets above the gdp level have typically accomplished this growth primarily through acquisitions 
industry consolidation has occurred during recent years 
sales growth the company s net sales have grown at a compounded annual rate of from through primarily as a result of acquisitions during this period and  to a lesser extent  market penetration in key existing product segments and new product development 
the acquisitions have strengthened and expanded the company s position in key product and geographic markets and  through consolidation  have enabled the company to achieve operating synergies 
raw materials the largest component of cost of sales is tinplate steel  which is currently supplied by large  national manufacturers 
tinplate prices have historically been negotiated once per year  with changes effective january  and have typically remained stable for the subsequent one year period 
the company is working with other companies to lower the overall cost of its steel purchases 
tinplate consumers typically negotiate late in the year for the next calendar year on terms of volumes and price 
terms agreed to have historically held through the following year  but there is no assurance that this practice will remain unchanged in the future 
steel prices have historically been adjusted as of january of a calendar year 
most steel producers have announced their intentions to increase prices for tinmill products by approximately to  and cold rolled products by approximately to effective january  the company has historically arranged for raw material prices which are lower than those publicly announced by its suppliers  although there can be no assurances that this practice will continue 
gross profit margins continuous advances in manufacturing productivity and cost reduction have been critical to the company s ability to improve margins 
the bsnj acquisition and the dcc acquisition during fiscal and the acquisition of bmfcc s aerosol business subsequent to fiscal year are expected to increase the company s sales by approximately 
these acquired sales have historically provided lower gross margins than those reported by the company 
the company s objective is to maximize synergies by employing the historically successful r strategic initiative to rationalize  reengineer and recapitalize these acquired businesses 
although employee termination costs in connection with plant rationalizations  administrative workforce reductions  and other plant exit costs associated with the recent acquisitions have been accrued for through purchase accounting adjustments  the company incurred in fiscal  and will incur in fiscal  other non recurring costs which under current accounting pronouncements will be charged against operating gross margins 
as a result of the lower margins of the acquired businesses and the effect of rationalization initiatives  overall margins for the company decreased during the fourth quarter of fiscal and are expected to be lower during management s objective is to return to historical gross margin levels through employment of the r initiative
