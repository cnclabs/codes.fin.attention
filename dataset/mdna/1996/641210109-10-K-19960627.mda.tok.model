the company currently has no outstanding bank borrowings and has no established lines of credit 
the company believes cash generated from operations  together with existing cash and investment balances  will be sufficient to satisfy operating cash and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next twelve months 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in march  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  which requires impairment losses to be recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amount 
statement also addresses the accounting for long lived assets that are expected to be disposed of 
the company will adopt statement in the first quarter of fiscal year and does not believe the effect of adoption will be significant 
business risks the company s future operating results may be adversely affected by certain factors and trends of its market which are beyond its control 
the market for network general s products is characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards 
included in such changes is the development of switching technologies for the transmission of data along local area and wide area networks  such as asynchronous transfer mode atm and switched ethernet 
network general believes its future success will depend  in part  on its ability to continue to develop  introduce and sell new products 
the company is committed to continuing investments in research and development  however  there is no assurance these efforts will result in the development  timely release or market acceptance of new products 
in addition  the company s results may be adversely affected by the actions of existing or future competitors including established and emerging computer  communications  intelligent network wiring  network management and test instrument companies 
new and competitive entrants into the field of network fault and performance management may come from areas as diverse as embedded systems in network hardware from established network hardware companies  as well as certain software referred to as network management by smaller companies 
there can be no assurance network general will be able to compete successfully in the future with existing or future competitors 
new entrants  new technology and new marketing techniques may cause customer confusion  thereby lengthening the sales cycle process for the company 
increased competition may also lead to downward pricing pressure on the company s products 
the company is in the early stages of developing its direct sales force in certain countries in europe 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract qualified salespeople in europe or that any salespeople hired will be successful 
network general does not carry a significant level of backlog 
the majority of the company s revenues in each quarter are a result of orders booked in that quarter 
expense levels are based on expectations of future revenues 
expense levels would be disproportionately high in the event of a decrease in near term demand for the company s products and would  therefore  have an adverse effect on the company s operating results 
network general products may be considered by certain customers to be capital purchases 
an adverse change in general economic conditions could cause certain of the company s customers to reduce their capital spending  which may adversely affect the company s operating results 
in september  the company acquired the remaining of voting interest of aim 
the successful combination of companies in the high technology industry may be more difficult to accomplish than in other industries 
there can be no assurance that network general will be successful in developing products based on aim s engineering expertise and technology  that network general will be successful in integrating its own distribution channels with those of aim  that network general will be successful in penetrating aim s customer base  that network general will be successful in selling aim s products to its own customer base  that the combined companies will retain their key personnel or that network general will realize any of the benefits anticipated at the time of the merger 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the software industry 
as is typical in the software industry  the company has received from time to time notices from third parties alleging infringement claims 
although there are currently no pending lawsuits against network general regarding any possible infringement claims  there can be no assurance infringement claims will not be asserted in the future or that such assertions will not materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
if any such claims are asserted against network general  the company may need to seek to obtain a license under the third party s intellectual property rights 
there can be no assurance a license will be available on reasonable terms or at all 
failure to obtain a necessary license on commercially reasonable terms would materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
network general could decide  in the alternative  to resort to litigation to challenge such claims 
such litigation could be expensive and time consuming and could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
for certain critical components of its products  network general relies on a limited number of suppliers 
in addition  some of the company s products are designed around specific computer platforms which are only available from certain manufacturers 
as a result of product transitions by these computer platform manufacturers  the company has found it increasingly necessary to purchase and inventory computer platforms for resale to its customers 
any significant shortage of computer platforms or other critical components for the company s products could lead to cancellations or delays of purchases of the company s products which would materially adversely affect the company s operating results 
if purchases of computer platforms or other components exceed demand  the company would incur expenses for disposing of the excess inventory  which would also adversely affect the company s operating results
