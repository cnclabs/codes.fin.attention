the joint venture must relinquish a further percent of the psc area by august   percent by december   percent by december  and percent by december  however  the joint venture is not required to relinquish any of the psc area in which oil or gas is held for production 
additionally  pursuant to the terms of the psc  the joint venture  having produced million barrels of oil  paid pertamina a million non cost recoverable bonus in march under the psc  the joint venture participants are entitled to recover cumulative operating and certain capital costs out of the crude oil  condensate and gas produced each year  and to receive a share of the remaining crude oil and condensate production and a share of the remaining revenues from the sale of gas on an after indonesian tax basis 
the method of recovery of capital costs is a system of depreciation and amortization that is similar to us tax accounting methods 
the share of revenues from the sale of gas after cost recovery through august  will remain at percent to the joint venture after indonesian income taxes and percent to pertamina 
the split after august  will be percent to the joint venture after indonesian income taxes and percent to pertamina for gas sales under the lng sales contract  the lng sales contract and extension  korean carryover quantities and the seven liquefied petroleum gas lpg sales contracts to the extent that the gas to fulfill these contracts is supplied from the badak or nilam fields 
for the gas used to fulfill the eleven year extension to the lng sales contract that is supplied from the badak or nilam fields  percent of such gas shall be split percent to the joint venture after indonesian income taxes and percent to pertamina with the remaining gas supplying this extension to be split percent to the joint venture after indonesian income taxes and percent to pertamina 
all other lng sales contract revenues after august  will be split percent after indonesian income taxes to the joint venture and percent to pertamina 
based on current and projected oil production  the revenue split from oil sales after cost recovery through august  will remain at percent to the joint venture after indonesian income taxes and percent to pertamina 
these revenue splits are based on indonesian income tax rates of percent through august  and percent thereafter 
in addition  the joint venture is required to sell percent percent after august  of the total oil and condensate production from the contract area for indonesian domestic consumption 
the sales price for the domestic market consumption is per barrel with respect to fields commencing production prior to february  for fields commencing production after that date  domestic market consumption is priced at percent of the weighted average price of crude oil sold from such fields 
however  for the first sixty consecutive months of production from new fields  domestic market consumption is priced at the official indonesian crude price icp 
the participants remaining oil and condensate production is generally sold in world markets 
the joint venture has no ownership interest in the oil and gas reserves 
the joint venture has long term supply agreements with pertamina for the supply of gas and petroleum gas to be liquefied at a liquefaction plant owned by pertamina at bontang bay the lng plant and sold to certain buyers pursuant to sales contracts 
the joint venture  other participating production sharing contractors and pertamina together market the lng and the lpg produced at the lng plant and lpg facilities and  as to the amounts allocable to the psc  the joint venture and pertamina divide the net proceeds in accordance with the percentages set out above

bank as trustee for pertamina  the joint venture  other participating production sharing contractors and lenders that have provided funds to build the lng plant and the lpg facilities 
the lng plant s processing costs  principal and interest payable on borrowings from such lenders  transportation costs  and certain other miscellaneous costs are deducted from the gross lng and lpg sales proceeds 
the remaining amount represents the net proceeds for gas delivered to the lng plant and is divided among pertamina  the joint venture  and the other production sharing contractors in accordance with the terms of their respective agreements 
exploration and development from inception in up to and including december   the following wells were drilled in the east kalimantan contract area total completed field wells productive dry suspended location drilled wells holes wells badak nilam semberah mutiara pamaguan wailawi other totals there are four significant fields in the east kalimantan contract area  namely  badak  nilam  semberah  and mutiara 
the badak field is in the northeast portion of the east kalimantan contract area  and the nilam field is located immediately south of the badak field 
total indonesie and indonesia petroleum  ltd 
the total group  who are not parties to the joint venture but have interests in the nilam and badak fields  are parties to unitization agreements with the joint venture in both fields 
all gas and condensate from the badak and nilam fields and all oil from the nilam field  as well as all allowable costs incurred in connection therewith  are deemed attributable to the joint venture and the total group in the ratio of their respective participating interests under the badak and nilam unitization agreements 
vico acts as operator for the joint venture and the total group in both fields 
the joint venture has a full interest in the semberah and mutiara fields  and vico acts as operator for these fields as well 
see business the joint venture 
the joint venture is also producing from other fields in the east kalimantan contract area including pamaguan  and wailawi 
the tables below summarize completed exploratory and development drilling from through for the east kalimantan contract area 
exploratory drilling wells dry year drilled discoveries holes totals development or field extension drilling completed wells for for for dual dry year drilled gas oil oil gas holes totals of completed productive wells in the east kalimantan contract area  approximately contain more than one completion in the same bore hole 
two wells were in progress as of december  these include wells that were drilled but not completed at the end of none of the suspended or in progress wells are included in the tables above 
the company s share of the costs of the above wells ranged from percent to percent 
lng sales the following table sets forth total gas liquefied and sold as lng  the company s net share of such production calculated on a million cubic feet equivalency basis as described in note a below  average sales prices excluding transportation costs and production lifting costs of such production for the years through years ended december  gross lng sales mmcf a    company s share of lng sales mmcf    average sales price per mcf b average production lifting cost per mcf a represents the volumes of lng delivered and sold to purchasers which is measured by its british thermal unit btu content and  for purposes of this table  has been converted to mmcf equivalents based on a ratio of approximately billion btus per mmcf of gas 
the gas production for lng includes production attributable to unocal indonesia company  the total group and pertamina 
the term mmcf refers to  cubic feet of gas measured at degrees fahrenheit and pounds per square inch of pressure 
b the sales price is based on the average sales price excluding transportation per mmbtu of lng received by pertamina 
the term mmbtu refers to  british thermal units 
the sales price per mmbtu has been converted to a price per mcf based on the conversion ratio referred to in note a above 
the term mcf refers to  cubic feet of gas measured at degrees fahrenheit and pounds per square inch of pressure 
the company s production costs are small in relation to its revenues because the joint venture s revenues under the lng contracts are net of costs associated with transporting and converting the gas to lng and shipping the lng to the purchasers 
costs incurred to operate and maintain wells and related equipment and field facilities are considered to be production costs 
during  the company s share of the joint venture s expenditures was approximately million  including million of development expenditures 
in  the company s share of the joint venture s expenditures is expected to total million  including million of exploration expenditures and million of development expenditures 
the budgeted expenditures primarily reflect continued development drilling required to maintain adequate gas deliverability and to maximize cash flow 
reserves the company files no reports which include estimates of oil or gas reserves with any federal agency other than the securities and exchange commission 
the estimated proved reserves of gas and of oil and condensate as of december    and attributable to the joint venture s interest in the psc in east kalimantan were prepared by petroleum engineers employed by lasmo  an affiliate of ustar 
gross proved field reserves are as follows crude oil and condensate gas total proved reserves s barrels dry mmcfs dec

   equivalent to approximately  trillion btus 
the joint venture  and thus the company  has no ownership interest in oil and gas reserves but rather has the right to receive production and revenues from the sale of oil  condensate  gas  lng and lpg in accordance with the psc and other agreements 
lng plant gas produced from the joint venture s interest in the psc reserves is liquefied at the lng plant  which is owned by pertamina and operated on a cost reimbursement basis by a corporation in which the joint venture owns a percent interest 
the lng plant currently consists of six processing units trains having a combined input capacity of approximately billion cubic feet of gas per operating day and a peak production capacity of approximately  barrels or  cubic meters of lng and  barrels of condensate per day 
the five storage tanks at the lng plant have a total capacity of million barrels of lng 
gas is supplied to the plant through three pipelines two inch and one inch which are connected to the central gas facilities at the badak field  miles south of the lng plant 
the six train plant is one of the largest lng processing facilities in the world and has the capacity to deliver cargoes per year 
since the first shipment in  the lng plant has delivered  cargoes 
the lng plant has been developed in four phases 
the original facility  which consisted of two trains trains a and b and a dock  was constructed with financing arranged by pertamina with the central bank of the republic of indonesia  a consortium of japanese banks and a corporation owned substantially by the japanese lng purchasers  and became fully operational in august final payment on the loans was made in the first quarter of expansion of the lng plant from two to four trains trains c and d was completed in funding was arranged by pertamina with japan indonesia lng co  ltd 
jilco 
final payment on this financing arrangement was made in the third quarter of a fifth processing train train e was completed in and supplies lng required for the taiwan lng sales contract with the chinese petroleum corporation cpc  the state petroleum enterprise of the republic of china taiwan 
project financing was arranged through a trustee borrowing with a consortium of japanese banks and is supported by revenues from such sales contract  as well as in certain limited circumstances by portions of other revenue streams 
the financing contains two tranches  with tranche a totalling million at a fixed interest rate of percent  and tranche b totalling million at a floating interest rate initially of libor plus percent  at december  the floating interest rate was percent 
the financing is repayable in graduated quarterly payments over ten years that began in the fourth quarter of the sixth processing train train f was completed in november and supplies the lng required for the lng sales contract with osaka gas  tokyo gas and toho gas for the sale of  trillion btus over a twenty year period which commenced in in august  pertamina and an international consortium of commercial banks completed project financing of million of which million was required to fund the construction of train f and related support facilities at an interest rate of libor plus percent  at december  the floating interest rate was percent 
financial support for the financing is limited to revenues from such sales contract 
the financing is repayable over ten years in graduated quarterly payments which commenced in december as a result of the production performance of train e  pertamina made modifications to trains a through d known as debottlenecking 
trains c and d were modified in during regularly scheduled maintenance shutdowns 
likewise  trains a and b were modified in during regularly scheduled maintenance shutdowns 
capacity tests on all four trains exceeded design rates such that trains a through d are each now capable of lng production rates comparable to train f  an increase of percent  or cargoes per year in total 
the total cost of the trains a through d debottlenecking project amounted to million 
these costs were funded through package iv revenues 
see description of package iv beginning on page 
a seventh processing train train g is being constructed at the lng plant to produce the lng required for package v lng sales contracts such as the sales contract extension  the korean medium term sales contract and the taiwan medium term sales contract 
completion of train g is expected in late in july of  pertamina completed project financing through japanese sources for train g  a third lng lpg dock  an additional lpg storage tank and other support facilities at the lng plant at a floating interest rate based on libor 
project financing of up to million has been arranged  of which million was drawn down as at december  the financing is repayable over ten years in graduated quarterly payments commencing in the fourth quarter of at december   the overall progress of the train g project engineering  procurement and construction was percent 
pertamina  the joint venture and other production sharing contractors are awaiting indonesian government approval for the financing and construction of an eighth train train h  which could come on stream early in  to primarily support the quantities of lng required by the new badak v sales contract and badak vi sales contract 
lpg and marine facilities the lpg processing facilities at the lng plant were constructed concurrently with the fifth processing train 
the lpg facilities were completed in  at a cost of approximately million 
financing was made available to pertamina through a consortium of japanese banks 
a significant portion of the lpg sales proceeds is dedicated to the financing  which is repayable through a second dock facility at the lng plant is used for both lng and lpg deliveries 
the portion of the second dock costs attributable to the lpg trade was financed through the same consortium of japanese banks that financed the lpg processing facilities at the lng plant 
financing for the lng portion of the second dock was provided by a trustee borrowing from japanese banks 
final payment on this financing arrangement was made in the second quarter of included in the scope of the train g project is a third dock to be used for both lng and lpg deliveries  as well as an additional lpg storage tank

marketing and distribution of lng certain information regarding deliveries of lng from the lng plant is set forth below btus average number of lng in trillions price per tanker liftings approximate mmbtu as a result of variations in lng tanker capacity among the various sales contracts  the measure of a net equivalent cargo has been established 
one net equivalent cargo equates to the quantity of lng delivered for the joint venture s interest in a sales contract shipment  or approximately  bbtus 
the joint venture and other gas producers in indonesia have the opportunity to participate in each sales package 
the joint venture s equity interest in a sales package is based on its share of gas reserves available for commitment to the package 
the joint venture s allocation in the lng sales contracts has declined over time since the initial sales contract  when the joint venture was virtually the only supplier to the lng plant  to the present when there are two other major production sharing contractors supplying gas to the lng plant and sharing in the allocation of volumes 
absent the discovery of significant additional gas reserves in the joint venture s psc  the joint venture s participation in future sales packages will continue to decline

lng is primarily sold under five long term sales contracts between pertamina and buyers in japan  taiwan and korea 
these contracts are the sales contract  the sales contract  the taiwan sales contract  the train f sales contract and the korea ii sales contract 
the gas processed by the lng plant is supplied from the joint venture s contract area as well as other fields in which the joint venture has no interest 
lng sales contracts and amendments thereto are executed between pertamina and the buyers for the sale and delivery of a fixed quantity of btus of lng at a price that reflects an lng element derived from a basket of indonesian crude oil prices that is recalculated monthly 
a transportation charge is added to the lng element under all contracts except for the sales contract and extension  the train f sales contract  the korea ii sales contract and the badak v sales contract  where the buyers bear the risk of loss and the transportation costs 
in those instances where the seller bears the risk of loss during shipment  the cargoes are insured 
the lng to be delivered under the sales contracts is supplied from the lng plant and from a separate facility at arun in sumatra arun plant 
the joint venture does not supply gas to the arun plant or have any interest in revenues from the sale of its product 
the allocation of contract quantities between the lng plant and the arun plant is determined by pertamina 
all deliveries under the sales contract and extension  the taiwan sales contract  the train f sales contract  the sales contract extension  the badak v sales contract and the badak vi sales contract are or will be exclusively supplied by the lng plant

in  cargoes  totaling  metric tons of lpg were shipped from the lng plant to japan at an average invoice price of per metric ton 
the joint venture was allocated a package iiib sharing percentage for revenues from the first  metric tons sold  a package iv sharing percentage for revenues from the next  metric tons sold  and a package v sharing percentage for revenues from the remaining  metric tons sold during  after deducting lpg related operating costs and debt service 
marketing of oil and condensate each party to the joint venture and pertamina are entitled to take their respective shares of oil and condensate in kind and to market such shares separately 
the company  through affiliates of ustar and unistar  markets its share of oil and condensate fob santan terminal  in east kalimantan  independently of pertamina and the other joint venture participants 
the santan terminal operated by unocal indonesia ltd 
is used for storing and loading oil produced by the joint venture 
prior to july   the price for export sales of crude and condensate reflected world market conditions at the time of sale 
since that date  the company s share of the joint venture s oil and condensate  except for that sold to pertamina for indonesian domestic consumption  has been sold at the applicable icp for the grade of oil exported 
effective august   the company has marketed for export two segregated streams of crude oil  badak crude and bontang mix 
in  approximately of the company s export sales were bontang mix  the balance of approximately being badak 
these crudes have individual icps 
since the inception of segregated marketing in  the icps have more closely mirrored world market crude oil prices for each grade of crude oil sold 
the sales price for the domestic market consumption is per barrel with respect to fields commencing production prior to february  for fields commencing production after that date  domestic market consumption is priced at percent of the weighted average price of crude oil sold from such fields 
however  for the first sixty consecutive months of production from new fields  domestic market consumption is priced at icp
