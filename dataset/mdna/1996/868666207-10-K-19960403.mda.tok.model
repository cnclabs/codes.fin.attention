factors contributing to the increase in earnings in compared with include an increase in net interest income  loan growth in the company s specialized lending products  and the growth of noninterest income mainly as a result of the acquisition of the kennard and whitesboro branches 
net earnings were  for per share  compared with net earnings of  for per share and  for per share 
the earnings per share for were affected by additional shares issued in december in connection with the acquisition of first national bank  whitesboro  texas 
the increase and  increase in earnings for and respectively  were attributable to an increase in net interest income resulting from improved asset quality  loan growth in the company s specialized lending products and acquisitions of community banks 
earnings before income taxes earnings before income taxes were  for the year ended december   compared with  for the year ended december   a increase 
as previously mentioned  the company returned to paying federal income taxes at the effective rate of during  compared with a nominal effective tax rate for as a result of the return to paying federal taxes  the net income for the year ended december  may be more indicative of operating trends in the future 
conversely  earnings before income taxes in the period may be more useful when comparing results with prior periods 
earnings before income taxes were  in  compared with  in  an increase of  or 
earnings before income taxes were  in the improvement in earnings before income taxes for compared with was primarily attributable to an increase in net interest income resulting from an increase in net interest margin 
the increase in net interest income in  as compared with  was the result of loan growth within the company s specialized lending products 
the average balance of insurance premium finance loans grew by to a balance of million from million for and  respectively 
the  growth in earnings before income taxes in as compared with was attributable to an increase in net interest income as a result of loan growth 
in  the company also realized a gain on the sale of investment securities of approximately net interest income net interest income is the difference between income earned on interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
the net yield on total interest earning assets  also referred to as interest rate margin or net interest margin  represents net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
the company s principal interest earning assets are loans  investment securities  medical receivables factoring and federal funds sold 
net interest income was million for the year ended december   an increase of million or compared with the year ended december   resulting principally from an increase in average interest earning assets from million to million  a significant portion of which was comprised of loans typically the highest yielding asset 
the increase in average interest earning assets was offset by an increase in average interest bearing liabilities from million to million 
in addition  the company experienced a decrease in the net interest spread of basis points from to for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the foregoing decrease resulted principally from the fact that the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased more than the yield on interest earning assets 
the yield on interest earning assets increased basis points from to  while the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased basis points from to for the year ended december  and  respectively 
net interest income was million for  an increase of million or compared with net interest income of million for  which represented an increase of  or compared with net interest income of million for the company s average total interest earning assets increased from approximately million for to million for  representing a increase resulting principally from an increase in loans 
the net interest margin of for increased basis points from for the company s average total interest earning assets increased from million for to million for  representing a increase resulting principally from an increase in loans and investment securities 
the company s net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  referred to as a volume change 
it is also affected by changes in yields earned on interest earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing deposits and other borrowed funds  referred to as a rate change 
the decline in the net yield on total interest earning assets from through the first nine months of resulted principally from an increase in investment securities as a percentage of total interest earning assets  which produced a lower average rate of return for the company than loans  and the addition of the consumer  commercial and real estate loans through the acquisition of first national bank  whitesboro  texas 
the yield on consumer  commercial and real estate loans declined to for the year ended december  from for the twelve months ended december  the following table sets forth for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities the average amounts outstanding  the interest earned or paid on such amounts and the average rate paid for the three years ended december   and the table also sets forth the average rate earned on all interest earning assets  the average rate paid on all interest bearing liabilities  and the net yield on average interest earning assets for the same periods

provision for credit losses the amount of the provision for credit losses is based on periodic not less than quarterly evaluations of the loan portfolio  with particular attention directed toward nonperforming and other potential problem loans 
during these evaluations  consideration is given to such factors as management s evaluation of specific loans  the level and composition of nonperforming loans  historical loss experience  results of examinations by regulatory agencies  an internal asset review process  the market value of collateral  the strength and availability of guaranties  concentrations of credits  and other judgmental factors 
the company determines separate general allowances for insurance premium finance and non insurance premium finance loans 
the company s loss experience on insurance premium finance lending was adversely affected during the second half of by the failure of a non best s rated insurance company 
the company has implemented certain changes in its lending policies and procedures with respect to insurance premium finance lending which have reduced the maximum concentration by insurance carrier except as approved by the board of directors and also reduced the amount of loans secured by unearned premiums of insurance policies written by non rated carriers 
see item business insurance premium financing 
as a result of these changes in loan policy and recoveries of previously charged off insurance premium finance loans  the company s historical loss factor on insurance premium finance loans has improved from in to in and as of december  the company recorded a  provision for credit losses during the year ended december  compared with  during the year ended december  as the company s ratio of net charge offs to average loans improved for these periods  the company provided amounts to compensate for growth in the loan portfolio in order to maintain the allowance for credit losses at an adequate level 
the provision for credit losses was  compared with  in and  in the increase in the provision for credit losses when compared with is a result of the growth in average loans outstanding 
the reduction in the provision for compared with was a result of successful collection efforts in both the insurance premium finance portfolio and the general loan portfolio 
noninterest income noninterest income is generated primarily from fees associated with noninterest and interest bearing accounts as well as fees associated with loans eg  late fees 
noninterest income for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or compared with noninterest income of  for the year ended december  the increase in noninterest income is attributed to the acquisition of the kennard and whitesboro branches during  and the waxahachie branch during  as well as an increase in loans outstanding 
the acquisition of the three banks increased the number and balance of loans outstanding and increased the number and balance of noninterest and interest bearing accounts  which resulted in increased noninterest income 
noninterest income was  for  a decrease of  or compared with noninterest income of  for  which represented an increase of  or over while service charges and exchange fees increased from to  loan fees and other income decreased 
the decrease in loan fees was attributable to a decision by management to discontinue servicing outside loan portfolios 
the decrease in other income from to is the result of a gain realized on the sale of investment securities during in the amount of approximately  noninterest income increased from to in all categories  primarily as a result of the acquisition of banks in wells and chester  texas

the amortization of intangibles increased in as a result of the addition of goodwill and costs associated with the acquisition of the kennard branch in the amount of  the addition of goodwill and costs associated with the acquisition of the whitesboro branch  and the addition of goodwill and costs associated with the acquisition of the waxahachie branch in the amount of deposits held by the bank are insured by the bank insurance fund bif of the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
the fdic assessment is calculated on the level of deposits held by the bank 
the increase in the fdic assessment in over was tied to the increased deposits added through the two acquisitions completed in the bif assessment rate is determined by the fdic for categories of banks based upon the risk to the insurance fund 
on august   the fdic s board of directors voted to significantly reduce the deposit insurance premiums paid by most banks but to keep existing assessment rates intact for savings associations 
under the new rate structure  the best rated institutions insured by the bif pay per of domestic deposits  down from the rate of per the new bif assessment rates apply from the first day of the month after the bif was recapitalized  which occurred in early september the fdic has issued refunds to the best rated institutions for assessments which exceeded the recapitalization of the bif 
the bank received a refund from the fdic of approximately  the change in assessment rate is expected to significantly reduce the cost of deposit insurance for the bank 
in connection with the new rate schedule  the fdic established a process for quickly raising or lowering all rates for bif insured institutions up to twice a year without seeking public comment

noninterest expense was  for  an increase of  or compared with noninterest expense of  for  which represented an increase of  or compared with noninterest expense of  for the increase in noninterest expense for from was attributable to a increase in salaries and employee benefits and a increase in general and administrative expenses 
the increase in salaries and benefits for the same period was due primarily to additional staffing associated with the acquisition of the two banks and the bank s loan and deposit growth 
noninterest expense increased in from primarily as a result of a increase in salaries and employee benefits and a increase in general and administrative expenses

the company and the bank will file a consolidated tax return for the company estimates that its effective tax rate for will be approximately and has recognized income tax expense of  on income before taxes of  for the year ended december  as compared with income tax expense of  on income before taxes of  for the year ended december  interest rate sensitivity management the operating income and net income of the bank depend  to a substantial extent  on rate differentials  ie  the differences between the income the bank receives from loans  securities and other earning assets  and the interest expense it pays to obtain deposits and other liabilities 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors which are beyond the control of the bank  including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities 
the objective of monitoring and managing the interest rate risk position of the balance sheet is to contribute to earnings and to minimize the adverse changes in net interest income 
the potential for earnings to be affected by changes in interest rates is inherent in a financial institution 
interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and changes in net interest income due to the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities 
an asset sensitive position in a given period will result in more assets being subject to repricing  therefore  as interest rates rise  such a position will have a positive effect on net interest income 
conversely  in a liability sensitive position  where liabilities reprice more quickly than assets in a given period  a rise in interest rates will have an adverse effect on net interest income 
one way to analyze interest rate risk is to evaluate the balance of the interest rate sensitivity position 
a mix of assets and liabilities that are roughly equal in volume and term and repricing represents a matched interest rate sensitivity position 
any excess of assets or liabilities in a particular period results in an interest rate sensitivity gap 
the following table presents the interest rate sensitivity for the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  months months year months to to to over or less months year years years total interest earning assets interest earning deposits in financial institutions     investment securities       federal funds sold   loans       interest earning assets       interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand deposits   savings deposits   time deposits      notes payable   interest bearing liabilities      period interest sensitivity gap       cumulative interest sensitivity gap       cumulative gap as a percent of total assets cumulative interest sensitive assets as percent of cumulative interest sensitive liabilities the cumulative rate sensitive gap position at one year was a liability sensitive position of million  or negative 
a closer examination of the investment securities reveals that the call options on securities within the portfolio that are expected to be exercised will change the cumulative rate sensitive gap position at one year to a liability sensitive position of million  or negative  which indicates that the company is currently in a closely matched interest rate sensitive position 
accordingly the company believes it will not experience a significant impact from changes in interest rates 
the company undertakes this interest rate sensitivity analysis to monitor the potential risk to future earnings from the impact of possible future changes in interest rates on currently existing net assets or net liability positions 
however  this type of analysis is as of a point in time  when in fact the company s interest rate sensitivity can quickly change as market conditions  customer needs  and management strategies change 
thus  interest rate changes do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or at the same time 
the company s investment policy does not permit the purchase of derivative financial instruments or structured notes 
the preceding table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the company s net interest income because the repricing of certain assets and liabilities is discretionary and is subject to competitive and other pressures 
currently  the bank is holding  in mortgage backed securities 
although the mortgage backed securities have a stated maturity greater than five years  it is not uncommon for mortgage backed securities to fully pay down well ahead of stated maturities 
as a result  assets and liabilities indicated as repricing within the same period may  in fact  reprice at different times and at different rate levels 
analysis of financial condition loans and asset quality the company s loans are diversified by borrower and industry group 
loan growth has occurred every year over the past five years can be attributed to acquisitions  increased loan demand and the addition of new lending products 
the following table describes the composition of loans by major categories outstanding at december     and december  aggregate principal amount loans  net of unearned interest insurance premium financing      commercial loans      installment loans      real estate loans      medical claims receivable      total loans      less allowance for credit losses      total net loans      percentage of loan portfolio loans  net of unearned interest insurance premium financing commercial loans installment loans real estate loans medical claims receivable total the concentration of insurance premium finance loans may expose the bank to greater risk of loss than would a more diversified loan portfolio

    variable rate    nonaccrual 
  total 
    the maturities presented above are based upon contractual maturities 
many of these loans are made on a short term basis with the possibility of renewal at time of maturity 
all loans  however  are reviewed on a continuous basis for creditworthiness 
nonperforming assets the company s financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting  including the recognition of interest income on its loan portfolio  unless a loan is placed on a nonaccrual basis 
loans are placed on a nonaccrual basis when there are serious doubts regarding the complete collectibility of principal and interest 
amounts received on nonaccrual loans generally are applied first to principal and then to interest after all principal has been collected 
troubled debt restructurings are those for which concessions  including reduction of interest rates or deferral of interest or principal  have been granted  due to a borrower s weakened financial condition 
interest on restructured loans is accrued at the restructured rates when it is anticipated that no loss of original principal will occur 
it is the policy of the bank not to renegotiate the terms of a loan simply because of a delinquent status 
rather  a loan is generally transferred to a nonaccrual status if it is not in the process of collection and is delinquent in payment of either principal or interest beyond days 
loans which are days delinquent but are well secured and in the process of collection are not included in nonperforming assets 
other nonperforming assets consist of real estate acquired through loan foreclosures or other workout situations and other assets acquired through repossessions

a determination as to collectibility is made by the bank on a case by case basis 
the bank considers both the adequacy of the collateral and the other resources of the borrower in determining the steps to be taken to collect nonaccrual loans 
the final determination as to these steps is made on a case by case basis 
alternatives that are considered are foreclosure  collecting on guarantees  restructuring the loan or collection lawsuits 
the following table sets forth a summary of other real estate owned and other collateral acquired as of december  number of net book carrying description parcels autos value developed property vacant land or unsold lots  repossessed automobiles 
 allowance for credit losses in originating loans  the company recognizes that credit losses will be experienced and the risk of loss will vary with  among other things  general economic conditions  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan and  in the case of a collaterialized loan  the quality of the collateral for such loan 
the allowance for credit losses represents the company s estimate of the allowance necessary to provide for losses incurred in the loan portfolio 
in making this determination  the company analyzes the ultimate collectibility of the company s loan portfolio  incorporating feedback provided by the internal loan review staff and provided by examinations performed by regulatory agencies 
the company makes an ongoing evaluation as to the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
to establish the appropriate level of the allowance  all loans including nonperforming loans  commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are reviewed and classified as to potential loss exposure 
specific allowances are then established for those loans  commitments to extend credit or standby letters of credit with identified loss exposure and an additional allowance is maintained based upon the size  quality  and concentration characteristics of the remaining loan portfolio using both historical quantitative trends and the company s evaluation of qualitative factors including future economic and industry outlooks 
the determination by the company of the appropriate level of allowance amount was  at december  the allowance for credit losses is based on estimates  and ultimate losses will vary from current estimates 
these estimates are reviewed monthly and as adjustments  either positive or negative  become necessary they are reported in earnings in the periods in which they become known 
the following table presents a detailed analysis of the company s allowance for credit losses for the year ended december  and for the years ended december     and december  beginning balance      charge offs commercial loans      installment loans      real estate loans  insurance premium finance     total charge offs      recoveries commercial loans      installment loans      real estate loans   insurance premium finance     total recoveries      net charge offs      bank acquisition    provision for credit losses      ending balance      period end total loans  net of unearned interest      average loans      ratio of net charge offs to average loans ratio of provision for credit losses to average loans ratio of allowance for credit losses to ending total loans ratio of allowance for credit losses to total nonperforming loans ratio of allowance for credit losses to total nonperforming assets 
the following table sets forth an allocation of the allowance for credit losses among categories as of december  and the company believes that any allocation of the allowance for credit losses into categories lends an appearance of precision which does not exist 
the allowance is utilized as a single unallocated allowance available for all loans 
the following allocation table should not be interpreted as an indication of the specific amounts or the relative proportion of future charges to the allowance 
such a table is merely a convenient device for assessing the adequacy of the allowance as a whole 
the following allocation table has been derived by applying a general allowance to the portfolio as a whole  in addition to specific allowance amounts for internally classified loans 
in retrospect  the specific allocation in any particular category may prove excessive or inadequate and consequently may be reallocated in the future to reflect the then current condition 
accordingly  the entire allowance is available to absorb losses in any category

on december   the bank s investment portfolio increased by million as a result of the acquisition of the bank in whitesboro 
the securities added to the investment portfolio through the acquisition increased the size of the investment portfolio by approximately

at december   of the bank s interest bearing liabilities were in the form of time deposits of  and over 
substantially all of such large deposits were obtained from the bank s market area  and none were obtained through brokers 
management believes these deposits to be a stable source of funds 
however  if a large number of these time deposits matured at approximately the same time and were not renewed  the bank s liquidity could be adversely affected 
currently  the maturities of the bank s large time deposits are spread throughout the year  with maturing in the first quarter of  maturing in the second quarter of  maturing in the second half of  and the remaining maturing thereafter 
the bank monitors those maturities in an effort to minimize any adverse effect on liquidity 
the bank is limited through regulatory commitments from using brokered funds without prior approval 
the company raised million during  million during   during  and  during through the sale  in registered offerings  private offerings and incentive stock option exercises  of the company s common stock 
management anticipates that future registered and private offerings of the company s common stock may be used to raise additional capital  in connection with acquisitions or if the regulatory capital requirements with which the bank must comply necessitate the injection of additional capital by the company into the bank 
failure to raise such additional capital could adversely impact the growth of the bank or result in its failure to comply with applicable regulatory capital requirements  which could necessitate a reduction in the volume of assets and deposits of the bank 
such reductions could adversely affect the bank s earnings and liquidity

the board of governors of the federal reserve system frb has announced a policy sometimes known as the source of strength doctrine that requires a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks 
the frb has interpreted this requirement to require that a bank holding company  such as the company  stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity 
the frb has stated that it would generally view a failure to assist a troubled or failing subsidiary bank in these circumstances as an unsound or unsafe banking practice or a violation of regulation y or both  justifying a cease and desist order or other enforcement action  particularly if appropriate resources are available to the bank holding company on a reasonable basis

impact of inflation  changing prices and monetary policies the financial statements and related financial data have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary effect of inflation on the operations of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates have a more significant effect on the performance of a financial institution than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and changes in prices 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors which are beyond the control of the bank  including the influence of domestic and foreign economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government and federal agencies  particularly the frb 
the frb implements national monetary policy such as seeking to curb inflation and combat recession by its open market operations in united states government securities  control of the discount rate applicable to borrowing by banks and establishment of reserve requirements against bank deposits 
the actions of the frb in these areas influence the growth of bank loans  investments and deposits  and affect the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
the nature  timing and impact of any future changes in federal monetary and fiscal policies on the bank and its results of operations are not predictable
