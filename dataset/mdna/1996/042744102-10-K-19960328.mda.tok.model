this adjustment was offset by a similar amount of losses in the same period on the sale of real estate acquired through foreclosures oreo  which was reflected as other operating expense 
the increase in core earnings from to is attributable to an increase in net interest income  increases in all areas of noninterest income and a decrease in operating expenses 
nonperforming assets  which include nonaccrual loans  loans past due days or more and still accruing interest  restructured loans in compliance with modified terms and oreo  amounted to million at december   down from million at december  the reduction was primarily attributable to sales of oreo 
the allowance for loan losses was million at december   which represented of the amount of nonperforming loans at that date 
this position was substantially unchanged from the prior year end

b 
results of operations the following analysis of net interest income  the provision and allowance for loan losses  noninterest income  other expense and income taxes  presents the factors that are primarily responsible for the company s results of operations for and the prior two years 
i 
net interest income fully taxable basis net interest income represents the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and other sources of funds 
changes in net interest income result from i changes in the level and mix of earning assets and sources of funds volume ii changes in the yields earned and costs paid rate  and iii the relative volume of nonperforming assets 
net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets 
net interest income may also be described as the product of earning assets and net interest margin 
comparison of net interest income dollars in thousands fully taxable basis years ended december  change from prior year amount percent amount percent interest income     interest expense      net interest income      on a tax equivalent basis  net interest income was million in  an increase of million or from million in net interest income  for both and  was favorably impacted by both the changing interest rate environment and an increase in average earning assets 
in addition to general changes in rates and volume  net interest income was enhanced by the reduction of nonaccrual loans  both in absolute amounts and as a ratio to earning assets 
the company also benefitted from retained earnings as a source of funds and from the investment of the proceeds from oreo sales into earning assets 
in  under the influence of the federal reserve board  interest rates began a steady decline  and for a two year period beginning in the spring of  the prime rate was unchanged 
during that period  the company experienced a benefit from a change in the mix of deposits from higher cost time deposits to lower cost now and money market deposit accounts 
during  the prolonged period of falling interest rates came to an end as the federal reserve board began a series of interest rate increases which extended into as a result  the mix of average deposits in was virtually the same as for  but in  depositors began to move a portion of their deposits back to higher cost time deposits 
analysis of changes in net interest income the following table presents net interest income components on a tax equivalent basis and reflects changes between periods attributable to movement in either the average daily balance or average rates for both earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
changes attributable to both volume and rate have been allocated proportionately between the categories

in  the change in net interest income attributable to changes in interest rates had an thousand positive impact on net interest income 
during the first half of the year  the company was still experiencing the effect from rising interest rates which had begun in the second half of various loan and deposit products react to interest rate changes with different speeds and for some products not to the full extent of changes in the prime rate 
during  assets in general repriced more quickly than time deposits 
repricing of short term deposit products also tended to lag behind prime rate changes and did not change to the full extent of prime rate changes 
consequently  the spread between the yield on earning assets and the cost of interest paying liabilities increased from to by basis points  while decreasing by basis points from to notwithstanding the decrease in the net interest spread  the company experienced a beneficial impact from generally rising interest rates due to the fact that the increase in average interest bearing assets exceeded the increase in interest paying liabilities as discussed more fully in the following section on changes in net interest income due to volume 
as a result  the net interest margin increased from to  albeit by only one basis point 
in  the change in net interest income attributable to changes in interest rates had a thousand positive impact on net interest income 
during the first half of the year  the company was still experiencing the effect from falling interest rates in prior periods  as higher yielding fixed rate loan and time deposit maturities repriced at current rates 
during the second half of the year the federal reserve board began a series of interest rate increases and the company  as well as many financial institutions  benefitted from a more rapid repricing of earning assets than paying liabilities 
the effect of the downward repricing of fixed rate loan and time deposit maturities in the first half of the year was more pronounced than the effect of rising interest rates at the end of the year  as both the yield on earnings assets and the cost of paying liabilities fell from to the company also experienced the benefit of reduced levels of nonaccrual loans  both in absolute amounts and as a ratio to earning assets  and was able to apply the proceeds from oreo sales to earning assets 
nonaccrual loans amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively  and the proceeds from oreo sales amounted to million in changes in net interest income due to volume average balances dollars in thousands change change earning assets      interest bearing liabilities

in general  changes in volume will result in corresponding changes in net interest income 
however  changes due to volume can be enhanced or restricted by shifts in the relative mix between instruments of different rates 
in  the change in volume had an thousand positive impact on net interest income 
of the million increase in average earning assets from to  average loan balances accounted for million 
the company used the remaining funds to increase its liquid assets 
only million of the million increase in average earning assets was funded by paying liabilities 
the primary sources of funds for the remainder came from retained earnings million and proceeds from the sale of oreo million 
in  the change in volume had a thousand positive impact on net interest income

the company used the remaining funds as well as million from decreased average federal funds balances to increase both the held to maturity and available for sale securities portfolios 
only million of the million increase in average earning assets was funded by paying liabilities 
the primary sources of funds for the remainder came from retained earnings million and proceeds from the sale of oreo million 
ii 
provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses through the provision for loan losses  an allowance reserve is established for estimated future loan losses 
actual loan losses are charged against this allowance when they occur 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management considers various risk factors influencing asset quality 
this analysis is based on judgments and estimates and may change in response to economic developments or other conditions that may influence borrowers economic outlook 
on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
sfas no 
 as amended  requires that impaired loans  except for large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans  be measured based on i the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  ii the loan s observable market price or iii the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the company applies the provisions of sfas no 
to all impaired commercial and commercial real estate loans over  and to all loans restructured subsequent to adoption 
reserves for losses for the remaining smaller balance loans are evaluated under sfas no 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 the company determines impairment for collateralized loans based on fair value of the collateral less estimated cost to sell 
for other loans  impairment is determined by comparing the recorded value of the loan to the present value of the expected cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
the company determines the interest income recognition method on a loan by loan basis 
based upon the borrowers payment histories and cash flow projections  interest recognition methods include full accrual  cash basis and cost recovery 
during  nonperforming assets continued the steady decline begun in the primary portion of the decrease in nonperforming assets in came from the sale of oreo 
nonaccrual loans increased thousand or from the year end balance 
the increase in nonaccrual loans represents the aggregate borrowing of one large commercial borrower  which was placed on nonaccrual status in that loan was accounted for under sfas no 
and was being carried at its estimated fair value 
loans reported as troubled debt restructures at december   were classified as performing in net charge offs for of million  or 
of average loans for the year  was typical of the company s historical experience with the exception of and the provision for loan losses of million  or 
of average loans  remained below the company s historical average 
the provision  however  was deemed adequate in consideration of the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans  which amounted to at december  the provision for loan losses in was actually a credit to the provision and a reduction in the allowance for loan losses 
during the second quarter of  with nonperforming assets at significantly reduced levels and a substantial sale of oreo having been completed  the company reduced the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses by million 
this reduction was effected by means of a credit to the provision for loan losses 
as a result  for the twelve month period ended december   the company s net provision for loan losses was a negative thousand  compared to a provision of thousand in and million in as a ratio of average loans  the provisions were 
in and 
and 
for and  respectively 
while the absolute balance of the allowance for loan losses has decreased in each of the past four years  the ratio of the allowance to nonperforming loans has increased or remained steady  with the ratio at the end of virtually unchanged from the year end level 
the balance of the allowance for loan losses was million  million  million and million at december    and  respectively 
the ratio of the allowance to nonperforming loans was   and at the end of the same respective periods 
net loan losses for were million 
these losses compare to net loan losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as a ratio to average loans  the net loan losses were

iii 
other income the majority of other ie  noninterest income is derived from fees and commissions from fiduciary services  deposit account service charges  computer processing fees to correspondents and other core or recurring sources 
additionally  other income is influenced by transactions involving the sale of investment securities 
analysis of other income dollars in thousands change december  amount percent income from fiduciary activities    
fees for other services    net securities gains losses other operating income    total other income     total other income for amounted to million

other operating income includes  as a primary component  fees earned on servicing credit card portfolios for correspondent banks 
this category of noninterest income also includes gains on the sale of loans  other real estate owned and other assets 
without regard to the bond recovery  other operating income in was virtually unchanged from total other income for  was million  or less than the million recorded in exclusive of securities transactions  other income for was essentially unchanged from the prior year  with a small shift from fees for other services to customers to other operating income 
as a percentage of average assets  noninterest income was and for and  respectively 
without regard to securities transactions the ratios were and for the same respective periods 
income from fiduciary activities in was virtually unchanged from the prior year  as was the average dollar amount of assets under administration 
fees for other services to customers amounted to million in  a decrease of from the prior year 
the decrease was primarily attributable to a slight reduction in the average balance of the serviced loan portfolio and the corresponding reduction in related servicing fees

an increase in salaries and benefits was offset by reduced expenses for occupancy  equipment and other operating expenses 
total salaries of million for decreased thousand from the level 
as in the prior year analysis  the effect of fewer employees was only partially offset by general salary increases 
of the thousand increase in employee benefits from to  severance benefits of thousand paid in accounted for most of the increase 
otherwise  slight decreases in payroll taxes and profit sharing expenses were offset by increased expenses for pension plans and health insurance 
occupancy and equipment expenses both decreased from to by thousand and thousand  respectively 
both decreases were primarily attributable to reduced depreciation expenses 
other operating expense was million for  a decrease of million or from the decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in fdic deposit insurance premiums and other insurance  as well as to a large reduction in losses on the sale of oreo

all of the company s banks are well capitalized 
other expense amounted to million for  a decrease of thousand or from the million reported for except for a slight increase in salaries and benefits  all areas in were below levels 
total salaries of million for decreased thousand or from  with the effect of fewer employees being only partially offset by selective salary increases 
a thousand increase in employee benefits was attributable to nearly all areas of employee benefits  including pension  postretirement  profit sharing and health insurance costs 
occupancy expenses and furniture and equipment expenses for decreased by and  respectively from the decreases were attributable to the closing of four small branches in vermont in the last two quarters of and also to general decreases in depreciation expenses

financial condition i 
investment portfolio the company adopted sfas no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities at december  under sfas no 
 securities held to maturity are debt securities which the company has both the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity  such securities are stated at amortized cost 
debt and equity securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 
debt and equity securities not classified as either held to maturity or trading securities are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported net of taxes in a separate component of shareholders equity 
at december   the company held no trading securities 
in november  the fasb issued a guide to implementation of statement on accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
the guide allowed a one time reclassification of held to maturity securities before december  acting under this provision of the guide  the company reclassified million of held to maturity securities to available for sale in december of the company took advantage of this one time provision as a means to improve liquidity and to gain some flexibility in the management of the company s interest rate risk

pass through securities provide to the investor monthly portions of principal and interest pursuant to the contractual obligations of the underlying mortgages 
collateralized mortgage obligations cmo s separate the repayments into two or more components tranches  where each tranche has a separate estimated life and yield 
the company s practice is to purchase pass through securities guaranteed by federal agencies and tranches of cmo s with the shorter maturities 
regulatory agencies have devised a high risk test for mortgage backed securities 
the test evaluates the following i average life test the product has an average life of less than years  ii average life sensitivity test an immediate and sustained change in interest rates of basis points will not extend the expected life by more than four years  and iii price sensitivity test an immediate and sustained change in interest rates of basis points will not change the price by more than 
the company evaluates each mortgage backed security at the time of purchase and quarterly thereafter 
although none of the company s investments have failed to pass the high risk test subsequent to acquisition  it is the company s policy to analyze the appropriateness of divesting high risk securities 
included in corporate and other debt securities are highly rated corporate bonds

dividend earnings derived from equity securities were adjusted to reflect applicable federal income tax exclusions 
during the last quarter of  the company recognized net gains of thousand on sales of million from the available for sale portfolio 
the proceeds were used to fund the sale of eight branches of green mountain bank to mascoma savings bank in january at december   the weighted average maturity was years for debt securities in the available for sale portfolio 
during the last quarter of  the company recognized net losses of thousand on sales of million from the available for sale portfolio 
the proceeds were reinvested in higher yielding securities

at december   unrealized gains on securities available for sale amounted to million  net of tax 
unrealized gains or losses are reflected as a separate component of shareholders equity 
these securities  to a great extent  match fixed rate time deposits of similar maturities 
consequently  the company did not recognize the gains during securities held to maturity the following table sets forth the book value of the company s portfolio of securities held to maturity for each of the last three years

since  the company has de emphasized commercial  commercial real estate and construction and land development loans 
consequently  balances for these three classifications continued to decrease  while the overall portfolio increased million  or  from to and million or from to within the installment loan portfolio  the company has focused on growth in its indirect lending program 
indirect loans are loans to consumers financed through local dealerships where  by prior arrangement  the company acquires the dealer paper 
at year end  indirect loans amounted to million or of installment loans 
by december   indirect loans amounted to million  or of installment loans 
the following table indicates the changing mix in the loan portfolio by presenting the quarterly average balance for the company s significant loan products for the past five quarters

the payments  which were recorded as interest income  have not been included in the yields in the table above 
while the yields on the consumer portfolios are less than on the commercial portfolios  the company has historically experienced fewer loan losses in consumer loans than commercial loans 
during  the loan portfolio increased million  or  from the prior year end balance 
the balances in all categories of commercial loans  including commercial real estate and construction and land development loans  decreased during the year  while balances of loans to consumers and residential real estate loans increased during the year 
during  the loan portfolio decreased million or 
in part  this reflected the company s exercise of prudent lending standards as well as a decision to reduce total assets and improve capital ratios 
during this period  the various loan categories maintained the same relative proportions  vis a vis one another 
during  certain commercial loans were reclassified as commercial real estate loans on a prospective basis 
had the reclassification been made on a retroactive basis  the balances of commercial  financial and agricultural loan balances and real estate commercial loan balances as a percent of total loans and leases for would have approximated the respective proportions of these categories in the decrease in real estate construction loans was due to loan charge offs and transfers to oreo 
the decrease in of installment loans to individuals came as a result of a slow down in consumer credit demand  particularly automobile financing 
the following table indicates the respective maturities and repricing structure of the company s commercial  financial and agricultural loans and its real estate construction loans at december  scheduled repayments are reported in the maturity category  based upon the contractual terms  in which the payment is due

there were no material commitments to lend additional funds on outstanding nonaccrual loans at december  loans and leases past due days or more and still accruing interest  as identified in the table below  are those loans and leases which were contractually past due days or more but because of expected repayments were still accruing interest 
for years prior to  loans were classified as restructured in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by debtors and creditors for troubled debt restructurings 
on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
sfas no 
 as amended  requires that impaired loans  except for large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans  be measured based on i the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  ii the loan s observable market price or iii the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the company applies the provisions of sfas no 
to all impaired commercial and commercial real estate loans over  and to all loans restructured subsequent to adoption 
reserves for possible losses for the remaining smaller balance loans are evaluated under sfas no 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 the company determines impairment for collateralized loans based on fair value of the collateral less estimated cost to sell 
for other loans  impairment is determined by comparing the recorded value of the loan to the present value of the expected cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
the company determines the interest income recognition method on a loan by loan basis 
based upon the borrowers payment histories and cash flow projections  interest recognition methods include full accrual  cash basis and cost recovery 
loans accounted for under sfas no 
may be reported as either nonaccrual  restructured or performing 
those loans recognizing interest income on a cash or cost recovery basis are reported as nonaccrual 
loans restructured under sfas no 
are reported as restructured if the loan is in compliance with the modified terms 
under sfas no 
 as amended  loans bearing a market rate and in compliance with modified terms are not subject to the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
in years subsequent to restructure  and thus would be included in performing loans 
at december   million of nonaccrual loans were accounted for under sfas no 
there were no performing loans at december  for which the provisions of sfas no 
were first applied in the company s nonaccrual  past due and restructured loans and leases were as follows schedule of nonperforming loans dollars in thousands december  nonaccrual loans construction and land development    commercial real estate      commercial loans      other     total nonaccrual loans      loans past due days or more and still accruing interest  restructured loans in compliance with modified terms    total nonperforming loans      total nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans 

nonperforming loans amounted to million at december   thousand below the balance at year end the increase in nonaccrual commercial loans from to is primarily attributable to the aggregate borrowing of one commercial borrower  which was placed on nonaccrual status during otherwise  nonaccrual loans at december  would have decreased from the prior year end balance 
loans reported as restructured and in compliance with modified terms at december  were classified as performing in during  income recognized on year end balances of nonaccrual loans was thousand 
income that would have been recognized during that period on nonaccrual loans if such had been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the period or since origination if held for part of the period was thousand 
nonperforming loans amounted to million at december   a decrease of million or from the prior year end 
of the million in nonperforming loans at december   million was transferred to oreo  million of loans restructured in was returned to performing status in accordance with sfas no 
 and another million was charged against the allowance for loan losses 
the small remaining difference represents the improvement in nonaccrual loans  net of loans newly classified as nonperforming 
nonperforming loans decreased million or during during the year million of nonaccrual loans and leases was acquired through foreclosure and transferred to oreo 
much of the million of loan charge offs during the year was also attributable to prior year end nonaccrual loans 
the remaining difference represented a net improvement in the amount of nonaccrual loans and included the return to performing status of certain nonaccrual loans 
the balance of million of restructured loans in compliance with modified terms as of december  represented three commercial loans restructured during the year 
potential problem loans while levels of nonperforming loans and delinquency trends have fallen since  the company expects that there will be continued exposure in the commercial real estate portfolio in forthcoming periods and until the regional economy shows substantial strengthening

there are no concentrations of credit that exceed of the portfolio  other than the general categories reported in the previous section of this report

summary of loan loss experience the company monitors credit quality through a continuous review of the entire loan portfolio 
all significant loans primarily commercial and commercial real estate and leases are reviewed at least semi annually  and those under special supervision are reviewed at least quarterly 
the boards of directors of the company s individual subsidiary banks  upon recommendations from management  determine the extent of charge offs and have the final decision making responsibility in authorizing charge offs 
additionally  regulatory examiners perform periodic examinations of the banks loan and lease portfolios and report on these examinations to the boards of directors 
provisions for loan losses are determined by the managements of the subsidiary banks  in consultation with the company s management  and are based upon an overall evaluation of the appropriate levels of the allowances for loan losses 
factors incorporated in such determination include the existing risk characteristics of the portfolio  prevailing national and local economic conditions  historical loss experience and expected performance within a range of anticipated future economic conditions 
the company s management believes that the banks allowances for loan losses are adequate to absorb reasonably foreseeable loan losses 
the table in part ii  item bii 
provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses presents a summary of the activity in the company s allowance for loan losses 
allocation of the allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan losses is a general allowance applicable to estimated future losses 
for internal operating purposes  the allowance is not allocated among loan categories 
in the following table  the allowance has been distributed for purposes of complying with disclosure requirements of the securities and exchange commission 
however  this allocation should not be interpreted as a projection of i likely sources of future losses  ii likely proportional distribution of future losses among loan categories or iii likely amounts of future losses 
since management regards the allowance as a general balance and has assigned an unallocated value to the schedule  the amounts presented do not represent the total balance available to absorb future losses that might occur within the principal categories 
subject to the qualifications noted above  an allocation of the allowance for loan losses by principal classification and the proportion of the related loan balance is presented below as of december for each of the years indicated 
allocation of the allowance for loan and lease losses dollars in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural      real estate commercial      real estate construction     real estate residential mortgage      installment loans to individuals      lease financing receivables unallocated      total loans and leases      percent of loans in each category to total loans commercial  financial and agricultural real estate commercial real estate construction real estate residential mortgage installment loans to individuals lease financing receivables total loans and leases at december   the allocated reserve for each indicated classification of loans exceeded of the dollar amount of loans in such classification that were then reported as nonperforming

deposits the following table sets forth the average balances of and average rates paid on deposits for the periods indicated 
average deposit balances years ended december  dollars in thousands average average average balance rate balance rate balance rate demand deposits    now super now    savings mmda    time certificates of  or more    other time deposits    total deposits    during the last half of and into the first part of  rates on deposit accounts increased  mirroring  although with some time lag  the rise in the prime rate that took place over this period 
changing interest rates also have an impact on the mix of deposits within the deposit portfolio for the company  as well as financial institutions in general 
beginning in the late s until the middle of  rates declined in small but steady increments  and then remained stable for the next two years 
during that period  as the price differential between time deposits and short term interest bearing deposits narrowed  depositors transferred a significant portion of maturing time deposits to savings  now and money market accounts  and some funds left the company entirely for competing investment products not offered by financial institutions 
during the recent period of rising interest rates  the company experienced a shift in the mix of deposits from short term back to time deposits 
as interest rates leveled off and even fell during the latter part of  the increase in the percentage of time deposits to total deposits also stabilized 
for the third and fourth quarters of  time deposits averaged of total deposits

time certificates of  or more the maturities of time certificates of  or more at december  are presented below 
in thousands maturing in under to to over months months months months total d 
liquidity the objective of liquidity management is to satisfy cash flow requirements  principally the needs of depositors and borrowers to access funds 
liquidity is provided through assumption or purchase of liabilities  the maturity of asset balances and the sale of assets 
liability liquidity arises primarily from the significant base of core and other deposits gathered through a branch network operating over a dispersed geographical area 
these core balances consist of demand deposits  savings  now and money market account balances and small denomination time deposits 
core deposits are considered to be less volatile in their movement into and out of financial institutions  as compared to large denomination time deposits  brokered time deposits and repurchase agreements  which are perceived as more sensitive to changes in interest rates than core deposits 
core deposits represented a substantial proportion of the company s total assets 
at year end  core deposits represented more than of the company s total assets and stockholders equity contributed as a source of funds 
large denomination time deposits  repurchase agreements and other borrowed funds represented of total assets at december federal funds sold are overnight sales of the company s surplus funds to correspondent banks  while federal funds purchased represent overnight borrowings 
the company s practice is to be a net seller of federal funds on average  and to avoid extended periods of purchasing federal funds 
during  average federal funds sold amounted to million and average federal funds purchased amounted to thousand 
on december   the company  upon adoption of sfas no 
 segregated its investment portfolio into securities available for sale and those held to maturity 
in november  the fasb issued a guide to implementation of statement on accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
the guide allowed a one time reclassification of held to maturity securities before december  acting under those provisions  in december the company reclassified million of held to maturity securities into its available for sale portfolio 
apart from federal funds  securities available for sale represent the company s primary source of liquidity 
this liquidity arises both from an ability to quickly sell the securities  as well as from the ability to use the securities as collateral for borrowing 
after completion of the company s sale of eight branches of green mountain bank to mascoma savings bank on january   the company had million of securities in its available for sale portfolio 
other sources of funds include term federal funds arrangements with correspondent banks and a borrowing arrangement with the federal home loan bank 
the company is not aware of any known trends  events or uncertainties that will have or that are reasonably likely to have a material effect or make material demands on the company s liquidity  capital resources or results of operations 
e 
interest rate risk while managing liquidity  the company must monitor and control interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the exposure of the company s net interest income to changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk is directly related to the different maturities and repricing characteristics of interest bearing assets and liabilities  as well as to prepayment risks for mortgage backed assets  early withdrawal of time deposits  and the fact that the speed and magnitude of responses to interest rate changes varies by product 
while many of the company s loan products are indexed to independent rates  such as prime or treasury notes  the rates on most deposit products are set by management pricing committees 
the company s primary short term measure of interest rate risk projects net interest income for the ensuing twelve month period based on the maturity  prepayment assumption and repricing characteristic of each individual interest bearing asset and liability under a variety of interest rate projections 
the company obtains interest rate projections from a third party provider of economic data 
these projections are applied to existing interest sensitive assets and liabilities and to expected new and rollover amounts 
as a base  the company projects net interest income for the ensuing twelve months for the most likely projection and for a no change scenario 
exposure to rising or falling rates are calculated to cover a high distribution of the perceived probable interest rate scenarios 
at december   the company expected interest rates to fall early in and then again later in the year 
for a long term measure of interest rate risk  the company measures the economic value of equity for immediate and sustained changes in interest rates 
at december   the company was operating within established internal policy limits for both the short term and long term measures of interest rate risk 
the company is able to reduce interest rate risk by adjusting the mix of loan products as well as the balance of fixed and variable rate products within the various loan categories 
to a lesser extent  the company manages interest rate risk through selection of investments for the securities portfolios 
the company does not  and in the foreseeable future  will not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk 
the company prepares an interest rate gap analysis to identify the repricing pattern of interest bearing assets and liabilities 
the interest rate sensitive gap is the difference between interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities 
the interest rate sensitive gap ratio is the ratio of interest rate sensitive assets to interest rate sensitive liabilities 
when the interest rate sensitive gap ratio exceeds the balanced position of  the company is susceptible to falling interest rates over the time horizon indicated  as assets may reprice downward more rapidly than liabilities 
conversely  the company is susceptible to rising rates when the gap ratio for a particular time horizon falls below the balanced position of while the static gap analysis will reveal mismatches in the repricing patterns of assets and liabilities  the dynamic modeling of projected net interest income  as described above  provides a much more reliable tool for assessing the company s net interest income exposure to changes in interest rates 
the following table interest rate sensitive gap analysis presents the company s interest rate sensitive position at december  for purposes of the table  an asset or liability is considered rate sensitive within a specified period when it matures or could be repriced within such period in accordance with its contractual terms except for certain deposit balances without specific maturities 
these deposit balances have been allocated to various time horizons to reflect the fact that these deposits do not reprice to the full extent of prime rate changes  and tend to lag behind changes to the prime rate 
certain other assets and liabilities lacking specific maturities are classified in the over five years category 
nonaccrual loans are excluded 
securities available for sale are presented at amortized cost 
various assets and liabilities that reprice before maturity demonstrate different repricing patterns 
nearly three fourths of the company s commercial loans are prime based  and consequently  reprice immediately  or in some cases monthly  upon changes in the prime rate 
the greater portion of variable rate residential real estate loans reprice annually and are often tied to an average short term treasury rate  with the repricing date lagging behind changes in the indexed rate 
rates on credit card lines are largely variable at management s discretion and in general reprice more slowly than prime based loans 
the cumulative gap ratio at december  was and for the ensuing six month and twelve month repricing periods  respectively 
these ratios are within the range of ratios the company seeks to maintain  although the twelve month ratio is at the upper threshold of the established range 
since the company has more interest bearing assets than liabilities  the twelve month ratio of should be considered vis a vis the total ratio of  which is what the ratio would have been for each period if all interest bearing assets and liabilities were spread evenly throughout the time periods 
nearly all of the company s time deposits are fixed rate  and therefore  reprice upon maturity 
money market deposit accounts are immediately repriceable and often fluctuate with the frequency of prime rate changes  but rarely to the magnitude of changes in the prime rate 
now accounts are also subject to immediate rate changes  but again  rates tend to move more slowly than prime rate changes and to a smaller degree 
savings accounts  which remained stable for an extended period of time after deregulation  have been the least sensitive of deposit balances to interest rate changes 
in response to the fdic improvement act of  regulators have proposed an interest rate risk analysis that distributes savings  now and money market accounts among the earlier repricing periods 
such a distribution of the company s savings  now and money market accounts could have a material impact on the company s gap analysis at year end if distribution of these deposits are limited to the first three repricing periods  as presented in the table below

capital resources and dividends shareholders equity was million at december   as compared to million at december  the increase was primarily attributable to retained earnings 
during  in accordance with a program previously approved by the board of directors  the company repurchased at market prices  shares of common stock  at an aggregate purchase price of million 
at year end the total treasury stock was  shares with a cost basis of million 
on february   the company announced that the board of directors had approved an expanded stock repurchase program 
under the program  the company s management is authorized to repurchase from time to time during the next two years  at its discretion  up to million of the company s outstanding common stock in the open market or privately negotiated transactions 
based upon the average of the closing bid and asked prices for the company s common stock as reported by nasdaq on march   completion of this repurchase program would represent over  shares  or of the total number of shares then outstanding 
the maintenance of appropriate capital levels is a management priority 
overall capital adequacy is monitored on an ongoing basis by management and reviewed regularly by the board of directors 
the company s principal capital planning goals are to provide an adequate return to shareholders while retaining a sufficient base to provide for future expansion and compliance with all regulatory standards 
under regulatory capital guidelines  the company and the subsidiary banks are required to satisfy certain risk based capital measures 
the minimum ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets is and the minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets is 
for the company  tier capital is comprised of shareholders equity less intangible assets 
total capital includes a portion of the allowance for loan losses 
in addition to the risk based capital measures  the federal bank regulatory agencies require banks and bank holding companies to satisfy another capital guideline  the tier leverage ratio tier capital to total assets less goodwill 
the minimum tier leverage ratio is for the most highly rated institutions 
the guidelines provide that other institutions should maintain a tier leverage ratio that is at least to higher than the minimum level for top rated institutions

as of december   only the company s principal bank subsidiary  the glens falls national bank and trust company gfnb was in a position to pay any material amount of dividends without prior regulatory approval 
at that time  the maximum amount that could have been paid by gfnb to the company was approximately million 
payments of dividends by green mountain bank gmb to the company were restricted during as a matter of law by the negative undivided profits account of gmb  despite the very high capital ratios maintained by gmb which became even higher after the sale by gmb of eight branches to mascoma savings bank on january
