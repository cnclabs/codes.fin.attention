item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction hickok has had a long established reputation as a leader in the development and manufacture of high technology precision indicating instruments for aircraft  locomotive and general industrial applications 
the company has also been recognized as an authority in the design and implementation of electronics circuitry 
in addition  the company has considerable experience in technical training and vocational education  developing training courses and manuals for instruction of technical skills 
in recent years these areas of expertise have combined to make the company one of the leaders in automotive electronics diagnostic technology 
hickok designs and manufactures diagnostic tools which enable automotive service technicians to identify problems in the rapidly increasing number of electronics systems in automobiles 
furthermore  hickok develops diagnostic strategies and assists in supporting the overall diagnostic system for ford motor company 
these services are provided by hickok personnel housed in a ford facility in allen park  michigan  a detroit suburb 
in addition  hickok develops instructional programs for ford and trains automotive technicians in the use of electronic diagnostic tools and systems 
the training and program development functions are generated both out of the cleveland  ohio headquarters and out of a leased facility in farmington hills  michigan 
in january  the company completed its second acquisition in three years with the purchase of the beacon gage division of maradyne corporation 
beacon gage manufactures specialty pressure gauges for railroads and transit cars 
the purchase added new products and customers within hickok s instrumentation market 
the gauge business was fully integrated into hickok s operations by may  in february  the company added a new product for the automotive market by acquiring the fastening systems business from allen bradley company  inc this was part of a strategic program to expand both the company s customer base and its product line using existing expertise 
the new business provides computerized equipment to control tools that tighten threaded fasteners in an automotive assembly plant to provide high quality threading applications 
the fastening systems business was fully integrated into hickok s operations by june  and made a positive contribution to the company s operations in the past three fiscal years 
this product class has become a major part of the company s total business 
the timing of order releases in the company s automotive diagnostic test equipment business often creates wide fluctuations in the company s operating results  particularly on a quarter to quarter basis 
the same situation applies to the company s recently acquired fastening systems products 
orders for such equipment frequently are relatively large and subject to customer release 
the result can be substantial variations in quarterly sales and earnings 
for example  fiscal first quarter net income of  or 
per share  represented of the year s total net income 
in fiscal fourth quarter net income of  or 
per share  represented of the year s total net income 
more dramatic results occurred in fiscal when fourth quarter net income of  or 
per share  represented of the year s total net income 
the company s contracts are subject to customer release  and although historically the fourth quarter has accounted for a larger portion of sales and net income  there can be no assurance that the company s customers will continue to authorize release of contracts during the fourth quarter of future fiscal years 
the company is not aware of any seasonal factors which lead to its customers release of orders 
short term earnings also can be affected by increases in expenditures for product development  which has become increasingly significant to the company s operations in the last two fiscal years 
the company s order backlog as of september  totaled  as compared to  as of september  and  as of september  the decrease in fiscal relative to fiscal is due to lower orders for fastening systems products and to the loss of a contract to provide technical training to ford dealer technicians 
the decrease in fiscal relative to fiscal is largely due to orders for fastening systems products 
this business was acquired in mid fiscal and an extraordinarily large order for million was booked late in the year 
at the end of fiscal backlog for fastening products was million 
results of operations sales for the fiscal year ended september  declined to  a decrease of approximately from fiscal sales 
this decrease in sales is almost totally volume driven and is attributable to lower sales in both the product and service categories 
in the product category  sales of fastening systems products dropped  or which was partially offset by a  or increase in automotive diagnostic instrument sales and by a  or increase in indicator sales 
despite the drop in fastening systems revenue  current sales of  in fiscal reflect a more typical sales level for this product as compared with sales in fiscal of  which were a record that was caused in part by an extraordinarily large million order booked in late fiscal sales of automotive diagnostic instruments increased in fiscal due to sales of ngs units to mazda dealers outside of north america and to ford dealers throughout the world  exclusive of europe 
the increase in indicator sales resulted from the beacon gage acquisition in january  in the service category  the decrease of  or was due primarily to the loss of a contract to provide technical training to ford dealer service technicians 
the contract was lost because ford consolidated suppliers in this area 
this contract had a negative effect on the company s service sales beginning in the middle of the company s second fiscal quarter 
sales for the fiscal year ended september  rose to  an increase of approximately from fiscal sales 
this increase in sales is almost totally volume driven and is attributable to significantly higher sales of fastening systems products 
sales of fastening systems products increased  which more than offset both a volume decrease in product sales other than fastening products and an decrease in service sales  almost all of which was volume related 
the level of automotive diagnostic instrument sales experienced in fiscal should continue into fiscal based on continuing development of existing and new products and the continued expansion into international markets 
fastening system sales are expected to increase slightly in fiscal due to the introduction of a new single channel control product called the pro spec initial indications are that the product is well positioned in the market 
the sales increase experienced in fiscal by indicators is expected to continue into due to a full year of beacon gage sales 
the level of service sales experienced in fiscal may decline approximately in fiscal since the loss of a training contract in fiscal will not be completely replaced by new sources of service revenue 
cost of products sold during fiscal amounted to  or of net product sales 
for fiscal the cost of products sold amounted to  or approximately of net product sales and for fiscal the cost of products sold amounted to  or approximately of net product sales 
the slight increase in the percentage of cost of products sold relative to product sales between fiscal and fiscal was due to product mix 
the increase in cost of products sold as a percentage of net product sales between fiscal and fiscal was due to higher costs of fastening product sales relative to other product sales 
cost of services sold during fiscal amounted to  or of net service sales 
in fiscal the figure was  or and in fiscal the figure was  or 
the increase in cost of services sold as a percentage of net service sales between fiscal and fiscal resulted primarily from a significant amount of large quantity contracts involving significant price competition 
the increase in cost of services sold as a percentage of net service sales between fiscal and fiscal was caused primarily by the inability to reduce costs of services sold to the same extent as service sales volume decreased 
the percentage of cost of products sold relative to net product sales in fiscal is expected to improve slightly based on cost control measures already implemented and on projected product mix 
the percentage of cost of services sold relative to net service sales is expected to stabilize at the figures experienced in fiscal based on cost control measures already implemented 
fiscal net income amounted to  or 
per share  a decrease of  or from fiscal net income of  or per share 
the decrease in net income was due primarily to a decrease in sales and  to a lesser extent  to an increase of  in product development expenditures and to a  or 
increase in the cost of products and services sold on an combined basis 
fiscal net income increased by  or over fiscal net income of  or per share  due to an increase in sales and  to a lesser extent  to a reduction in the effective tax rate compared to the prior year 
during fiscal new product development expenditures amounted to  which represented a increase over fiscal expenditures of  the increase is attributable to engineering and development of two new products  the pro spec and a portable secondary ignition analyzer 
the pro spec is a fastening systems new single spindle control product to be introduced in early the portable version of the watchdog is for use by large  non automotive internal combustion engine users and initial sales are expected in fiscal product development expenditures in fiscal of  were higher than the  spent in fiscal approximately of the increase was attributable to engineering and development of existing fastening systems products 
the balance was spent in developing new products across the company s other product classes 
it is anticipated that the amount spent on product development in fiscal will remain at that level in fiscal marketing and administrative expense amounted to  or approximately of net sales in fiscal   or approximately of net sales in fiscal  and  or approximately of net sales in fiscal expenditures in fiscal represented a decrease from fiscal  as compared with a increase in fiscal over the prior fiscal year 
the absolute decrease in the amount of marketing and administrative expenses between and was entirely related to lower sales in the fastening systems product class 
the absolute increase between fiscal and was due to higher sales in the fastening systems business 
in fiscal income taxes were  and represented an effective tax rate of 
fiscal income taxes were  and represented an effective tax rate of 
the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal was caused by recognizing research and development tax credits in an amount greater than what was estimated at the end of the prior year 
in fiscal income taxes were  and represented an effective tax rate of 
the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal related to differences in the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial reporting purposes 
it is anticipated that the effective tax rate in fiscal will be approximately the same as the current year 
interest charges were  in fiscal  compared with  in fiscal and  in fiscal the increase in interest charges in fiscal compared to fiscal was caused primarily by higher borrowing by the company under its revolving line of credit to finance increased working capital levels during the first half of the fiscal year 
the increase in interest charges in fiscal compared to fiscal resulted primarily from increased borrowing by the company under its revolving line of credit to finance increased working capital levels resulting from a increase in sales 
fiscal and results include other income of  and  respectively primarily due to rental income of excess space at the company s former lincoln park  michigan location 
fiscal and fiscal other income also includes approximately  and  respectively of purchased discounts 
fiscal other income of  almost totally consists of rental income of excess space 
liquidity and capital resources during the fiscal year the company s business may require relatively large inventories of both work in process and finished goods in order to meet anticipated delivery schedules 
this was the situation at the end of fiscal when inventory was up  over the prior year in anticipation of significant orders for automotive product which were received and shipped in the first quarter of fiscal at the end of fiscal there was no need to build inventory resulting in a drop in inventory to  from  at the end of fiscal nevertheless  whenever there may be a requirement to increase inventory in fiscal there will be a negative but temporary impact on liquidity 
the company believes that internally generated funds and a  revolving line of credit provide sufficient liquidity to meet ongoing working capital requirements 
current assets of  at september  were times current liabilities and the total of cash and receivables was times current liabilities 
these ratios compare to and respectively at the end of fiscal total current assets decreased  from the previous year end primarily as a result of the above mentioned  drop in inventory plus a  reduction in accounts receivable due to lower fourth quarter billings in fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal total current liabilities dropped  from the previous year due primarily to a reduction in short term financing and  to a lesser extent  to reductions in trade payables and accruals 
working capital at september  was  as compared to  a year earlier 
the increase between the two years was due to retention of earnings and the proceeds were used to reduce short term borrowings 
internally generated funds in fiscal were a positive  and were more than adequate to fund the company s primary non operating cash requirement consisting of capital expenditures which amounted to  the company has no long term debt 
the primary reason for the positive cash flow from operations was a  decrease in inventory 
in fiscal internally generated funds were a negative  which was not adequate to fund the company s primary non operating cash requirement consisting of capital expenditures which amounted to  the primary reason for the negative operating cash flow was a  increase in inventory with the shortfall made up by a  increase in short term borrowing 
in fiscal internally generated funds paid for capital expenditures 
the company does not anticipate that inventory will decrease in fiscal to the same extent as occurred in fiscal nevertheless it expects internally generated funds in fiscal from other operating activities  primarily net income  to be adequate to fund approximately  of capital expenditures in fiscal included in the  is approximately  to be spent on the expansion of the company s cleveland  ohio administrative headquarters to accommodate further growth 
the balance will be spent to upgrade engineering and manufacturing equipment 
in february  the company amended an existing credit agreement with its financial lender 
the agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of  with interest at the prime commercial rate with a libor option and is unsecured 
at september   the company had an outstanding balance of  under this loan facility 
the revolving credit facility is subject to annual review by the company s financial lender 
although no determination has been made to seek renewal of the credit agreement  the company believes that  given its current financial condition  renewal at the existing amount may be obtained on acceptable terms 
in august  the company entered into a section stock redemption agreement the stock redemption agreement with robert d 
hickok 
the stock redemption agreement provided that  upon mr 
hickok s death  his estate will have the right to require the company to purchase from the estate class a shares and class b shares having a value equal to the estate  inheritance  legacy and succession taxes including any interest collected as part of such taxes imposed because of the death of mr

hickok s estate will be the then market value of such shares 
the estate of robert d 
hickok sold to the company  class b shares on january  and  class b shares on march  no future redemption requests are anticipated from the estate 
impact of inflation in recent years  inflation has had a minimal effect on the company because of low rates of inflation and the company s policy prohibiting the acceptance of long term fixed rate contracts without provisions permitting adjustment for inflation
