the carrying value of excess cost over net asset value of purchased facilities and other intangible assets will be evaluated if the facts and circumstances suggest that it has been impaired 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the asset will not be recoverable  as determined based on the undiscounted cash flows of the entity acquired over the remaining amortization period  an impairment loss is calculated based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over the asset s fair value
