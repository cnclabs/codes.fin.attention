item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
item business the company medicis is the leading independent pharmaceutical company in the united states that offers prescription and non prescription over the counter products exclusively to treat dermatological conditions 
emphasizing the clinical effectiveness  quality  affordability and cosmetic elegance of its products  the company has achieved a leading position in the treatment of acne and acne related conditions using prescription pharmaceuticals  while also offering the leading domestic over the counter otc fade cream product 
the company has built its business through the successful introduction of dynacin and triaz products for the treatment of acne and the acquisition of the esoterica fade cream product line 
principal products and product lines medicis currently offers products in the following areas of dermatology acne  hyperpigmentation  inflammatory skin diseases  dry skin and cosmetic dermatology

prescription pharmaceuticals prescription pharmaceuticals accounted for of the company s net sales in the fiscal year ended june  fiscal 
medicis currently focuses its prescription pharmaceutical efforts primarily on treating acne and related conditions 
the company s principal branded pharmaceuticals are as follows dynacin is an oral  systemic antibiotic prescribed for the treatment of moderate to severe acne vulgaris  the most common form of acne  a condition that resulted in over million visits to dermatologists in the most commonly prescribed systemic acne treatments are tetracycline and its derivatives  doxycycline and minocycline 
minocycline  the active ingredient in dynacin products  is widely prescribed for the treatment of acne for several reasons 
it has a more convenient schedule of one or two doses per day as compared to other forms of tetracycline  which can require up to four doses per day 
other forms of tetracycline require ingestion on an empty stomach and often increase patient sensitivity to sunlight  creating a greater risk of sunburn 
moreover  the other forms of tetracycline  including doxycycline  often cause gastric irritation 
in addition  resistance to several commonly used antibiotics  including erythromycin  clindamycin  doxycycline and tetracycline  by the primary bacterial organism responsible for acne has been documented 
studies suggest that bacterial resistance to erythromycin exceeds  and resistance to doxycycline and tetracycline exceeds  while the bacteria showed virtually no resistance to minocycline 
thus  although more expensive than other forms of branded tetracycline and many times more expensive than generic tetracycline  minocycline is documented to have clinical performance that is superior to other forms of tetracycline  while avoiding many of its disadvantages 
however  dynacin s retail price is approximately lower than the average reported retail price of the other leading branded minocycline product  minocin  while selling at approximately to higher than the average reported retail price of generic minocycline 
dynacin is at least comparable in performance to minocin and is believed by the company to enjoy certain performance characteristics that favorably distinguish it from generic minocycline 
dynacin was launched in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended june  fiscal 
at june   dynacin products held approximately of total branded minocycline market sales and was the leading brand of branded minocycline in the united states 
there can be no assurance that dynacin will not lose significant market share in the future  that it will remain a competitive product  or that the company will be able to compete successfully in the acne treatment market through the sale of dynacin or any other product 
the company has entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement with schein pharmaceuticals  inc schein for the supply of dynacin products

triaz is a topical therapy prescribed for the treatment of all forms and varying degrees of acne  and is available as a gel available in two concentrations and as a cleanser 
the combined domestic sales of topically applied prescription acne products were in excess of million in the most frequently prescribed topical acne treatments include cleocin t  generic topical clindamycin  and benzamycin 
while these therapies are generally effective  triaz offers advantages over each product  including improved stability  greater convenience of use  reduced cost and fewer side effects 
benzamycin requires refrigeration and mixing by a pharmacist and has a relatively short shelf life of three months 
triaz comes in a ready mixed gel that does not require refrigeration and has a two year shelf life 
in addition  triaz is aesthetically pleasing and minimizes the extreme drying and scaling of skin often caused by competing brands 
the average reported retail price of triaz is less than that of either cleocin t or benzamycin 
in addition  bacterial resistance has been demonstrated with both cleocin t and erythromycin  an active ingredient in benzamycin 
triaz products are manufactured using the active ingredient benzoyl peroxide in a vehicle containing glycolic acid and zinc lactate 
benzoyl peroxide is the most efficacious agent available for clearing the bacteria that cause acne 
glycolic acid enhances the effectiveness of benzoyl peroxide by exfoliating the outer layer of the skin thereby providing direct access to the bacteria  and zinc lactate acts to reduce the appearance of inflammation and irritation often associated with acne 
triaz was developed internally by the company s formulation scientists and introduced in the second quarter of fiscal there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully market the triaz product line or that the triaz product line will achieve or retain market acceptance

the company believes that benzashave products are the only prescription shaving products available for treatment of pfb and acne associated with shaving 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully market benzashave products or that benzashave will achieve or maintain market acceptance 
the company entered into an exclusive worldwide license to market benzashave with ivax in the fiscal year ended june  fiscal  which includes a license of patent rights relating to the use of benzoyl peroxide in the treatment of pfb

medicis strategy involves the rapid evaluation and formulation of new therapeutics by obtaining preclinical safety and efficacy data when possible  followed by rapid safety and efficacy testing in humans 
while development periods may vary  the company generally selects products for development with the objective of proceeding from formulation to product launch within a two year period 
medicis directs the efforts of contract laboratory research facilities to perform formulation and research work on active ingredients as well as direct the third party conduct of preclinical studies and clinical trials 
all products and technologies under development will require significant commitments of personnel and financial resources 
several products will require extensive clinical evaluation and premarketing clearance by the united states food and drug administrative fda and comparable agencies in other countries prior to commercial sale 
certain of the products and technologies under development have been licensed from third parties 
the failure of the company to meet its obligations under one or more of these agreements could result in the termination of the company s rights under such agreements 
in addition  the company regularly reevaluates its product development efforts 
on the basis of these reevaluations  the company has in the past  and may in the future  abandon development efforts for particular products 
no assurance can be given that any product or technology under development will result in the successful introduction of any new product 
failure of the company to introduce and market new products  whether internally developed or acquired from third parties  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operation

for fiscal  mckesson and bergen brunswig accounted for approximately and  respectively  of the company s sales 
the distribution network for pharmaceutical products has  in recent years  been subject to increasing consolidation 
as a result  a few large wholesale distributors control a significant share of the market 
in addition  the number of independent drug stores and small chains has decreased as retail consolidation has occurred 
further consolidation among wholesale distributors or retailers could result in the combination or elimination of warehouses which may stimulate products returns to the company  cause a reduction in their inventory levels  or otherwise result in reductions in purchases of the company s products  any of which could result in a material adverse impact upon the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
manufacturing the company currently contracts for all of its manufacturing needs and is permitted to contract only with manufacturers that comply with fda current good manufacturing practices cgmp regulations and other applicable laws and regulations 
the company typically does not enter into long term manufacturing contracts with third party manufacturers 
whether or not such contracts exist  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain adequate supplies of such products in a timely fashion  or at all 
the company s dynacin products are manufactured by schein in compliance with the company s stringent  internally developed specifications and quality standards pursuant to a supply agreement that expires in december under the agreement  schein manufactures minocycline for sale in the branded market exclusively for the company  but may manufacture and sell minocycline for itself or others as a generic product 
schein currently manufactures minocycline for the generic market under its own label 
the schein supply agreement is subject to automatic renewal for successive two year periods if neither party gives timely notice of termination and may also be canceled without cause upon months notice 
schein may also terminate the exclusivity portion of the agreement if its profit margin on sales of dynacin products fall below a specified level 
schein may terminate the agreement upon a material breach by the company  in the event that the company becomes insolvent  or if any lawsuit is commenced alleging a patent or a proprietary rights violation 
the agreement also provides that the company will purchase all of its requirements for minocycline from schein but may purchase some of its requirements from another manufacturer if schein fails to meet certain cost standards or fails to provide the company with all of its requirements for two of four consecutive calendar quarters 
in addition  the company may use alternative sources if schein terminates the company s exclusive rights to purchase branded minocycline based upon the company s failure to meet the specified profit margins  as defined 
either party may terminate the agreement in the event that one party cannot perform under the agreement for a period of three months or longer for certain reasons beyond its control  such as war  strike  fire  lockout or acts of god 
the company believes that it has alternative sources of supply and that it would be able to use these alternative sources to preserve an adequate supply of dynacin 
however  the inability of schein to fulfill the company s supply requirements for dynacin  the company s largest selling product  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company s esoterica line of products are manufactured by smithkline pursuant to a manufacturing and supply agreement which expires in march smithkline may terminate its agreement in the event of a material breach by the company upon days written notice

there can be no assurance that the above manufacturers will continue to meet the fda s regulations or the company s product specifications and standards for the indicated products or that they can continue to meet product demand on a consistent and timely basis 
schein  ivax and vifor are currently the sole manufacturers of dynacin products  theramycin z and benzashave products  and theraplex emollient products  respectively 
the company believes that alternative sources of manufacturing are available for all of its products 
because of the fda requirement for cgmp validation of manufacturing facilities for particular products  validation of a new facility to serve as a replacement source of manufacturing requires a substantial period of time 
any loss of a manufacturer or other manufacturing difficulties could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company has obtained business interruption insurance to insure against the loss of income for up to months due to the interruption of manufacturing of the company s three principal products due to certain causes 
while the company believes that the policy provides substantial protection against the covered events  there can be no assurance that the policy will cover all manufacturing interruptions or that the amount of such insurance will be adequate to fully protect the company for losses associated with such interruptions 
the company s third party manufacturers rely on certain suppliers of key raw materials 
certain of those materials are purchased from single sources and others may be purchased from single sources in the future 
although the company has no reason to believe that it will be unable to procure adequate supplies of such raw materials on a timely basis  disruptions in supplies  including delays due to the inability of the company or its manufacturers to procure raw materials  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
any interruptions in the supply of any of the company s products due to shortages in raw materials  changes in manufacturing sources  regulatory changes or other causes could delay or eliminate the company s ability to supply such products 
in addition  the company faces the risk that  upon expiration of the term of any third party manufacturing agreement  it may not be able to renew or extend the agreement with the third party manufacturer  to obtain an alternative manufacturing source from other third parties or to develop internal manufacturing capabilities on commercially viable terms  if at all 
to manage its resources effectively  the company attempts to retain inventory levels that are no greater than necessary to meet the currently projected needs of its customers 
manufacture of the company s theramycin z and benzashave products was suspended in fiscal following the acquisition by ivax of certain assets of syosset  the original manufacturer of those products under the agreement  in syosset s bankruptcy proceeding 
manufacture of the benzashave products was subsequently resumed  and the company resumed shipping these products during fiscal year ended june  fiscal 
during the second quarter of fiscal  manufacturing of the theramycin z product also resumed 
this suspension did not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will not suffer future supply insufficiencies or interruptions or that it will be able to obtain adequate supplies of its products in a timely fashion  or at all 
while the company believes that its inventory levels are generally adequate  the loss of a manufacturer  the failure to obtain a replacement manufacturer on a timely basis  other manufacturing problems or any interruption of supply could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
certain license and royalty agreements in july  the company entered into two separate license agreements with ivax  as successor to syosset laboratories  inc syosset  under which the company acquired a year exclusive  worldwide license to market and sublicense the products erythromycin  which medicis markets as theramycin z  benzashave and and certain other products 
ivax also manufactures the licensed products for the company pursuant to a manufacturing agreement

gars and dr 
suess of certain patent rights relating to the company s theraplex hydrolotion products 
there can be no assurance that the company will fulfill its obligations under any of the foregoing agreements 
the failure to satisfy the requirements of any agreement could result in the loss of the company s rights under the agreements and in other related agreements which could have a material adverse affect upon the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
trademarks the company believes that trademark protection is significant in establishing product recognition 
the company owns federally registered trademarks 
the company has filed united states applications for registration of seven additional trademarks and servicemarks 
united states federal registrations for trademarks remain in force for years and may be renewed every years after issuance provided the mark is still being used in commerce 
there can be no assurance that any such trademarks or servicemarks will afford the company adequate protection  or that the company will have the financial resources to enforce its rights under any such trademarks and servicemarks 
the inability of the company to protect its trademarks or servicemarks from infringement could result in injury to any goodwill which may be developed in such trademarks or servicemarks 
moreover  the company s inability to use one or more of its trademarks or servicemarks because of successful third party claims to such marks could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
an opposition to registration of the mark theramycin z has been filed and is currently pending in the united states patent and trademark office 
while there can be no assurance as to the outcome of this matter  the company does not currently foresee any significant costs or loss of sales associated with the reintroduction of theramycin z under a different trade name 
from time to time  the company receives communications from parties who allege that their trademark interests may be damaged either by the company s use of a particular trademark or its registration of such trademark 
in general  the company seeks to resolve such conflicts before an actual opposition to registration or suit for infringement is filed 
there can  however  be no assurance that such oppositions will not be filed or that  if filed  they will not have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
patents and proprietary rights the company has licensed rights to products covered by certain united states patents directed to aspects of the theraplex and benzashave compounds formulations  and the company has obtained patents directed to aspects of several other compounds 
the company is also pursuing several united states patent applications 
no assurance can be given that patents will be issued with respect to any of these applications 
the company has acquired rights under certain patents and patent applications from third party licensors 
the company has also acquired from certain of its consultants and principals an assignment of their rights to certain united states patents or patent applications 
certain of such patents and patent applications may be subject to claims of rights by third parties by reason of existing relationships with the party who filed such patents or patent applications 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to obtain any rights under such patents or patent applications  as a result of such conflicting claims  or that any rights which the company may obtain will be sufficient for the company to market products which may be the subject of such patents or patent applications 
the company may be required to obtain licenses and or pay royalties to obtain the rights it acquires under such patents or patent applications and no assurance can be given that the company will be able to obtain rights under such patents or patent applications on terms acceptable to the company  or at all 
the company believes that its success will depend in part on its ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for its own inventions  and to obtain and maintain licenses for the use of patents licensed or sublicensed by third parties 
no assurance can be given that any patent issued to  or licensed by  the company will provide protection that has commercial significance 
in this regard  the patent position of pharmaceutical compounds is particularly uncertain 
there can be no assurance that challenges will be not be instituted against the validity or enforceability of any patent owned by or licensed to the company or  if instituted  that such challenges will not be successful 
the company only conducts complete searches to determine whether its products infringe upon any existing patents as it deems appropriate 
the cost of litigation to uphold the validity and prevent infringement of patents can be substantial and require a significant commitment of management time 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar technologies or duplicate the technology owned by or licensed to the company or design around the patented aspects of such technology 
there can be no assurance that the products and technologies the company currently markets  or may seek to market in the future  will not infringe patents or other rights owned by others 
in the event of an adverse outcome of any dispute with respect to patents or other rights  the company may be required to license such disputed rights to or cease using such disputed rights 
there can be no assurance that a license would be on terms acceptable to the company  or at all 
the company believes that obtaining foreign patents may be more difficult than obtaining domestic patents because of differences in patent laws  and recognizes that its patent position therefore may be stronger in the united states than in europe 
in addition  the protection provided by foreign patents once they are obtained may be weaker than that provided by domestic patents 
the company relies and expects to continue to rely upon unpatented proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation in the development and manufacture of many of its principal products 
the company s policy is to require all its employees  consultants and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements with the company 
there can be no assurance  however  that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for the company s trade secrets or proprietary know how in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure of such know how 
in addition  there can be no assurance that others will not obtain access to or independently develop these trade secrets or know how 
competition competition is intense among manufacturers of prescription pharmaceuticals for the treatment of dermatological diseases  such as the dynacin  triaz  theramycin z  and benzashave products  and in the otc market for dermatological products such as the esoterica and theraplex product lines  as well as other products which the company may develop and market in the future 
most of the company s competitors are large  well established pharmaceutical  chemical  cosmetic or health care companies with considerably greater financial  marketing  sales and technical resources than available to the company 
additionally  many of the company s present and potential competitors have research and development capabilities that may allow such competitors to develop new or improved products that may compete with the company s product lines 
the pharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense competition and rapid product development and technological change 
the company s pharmaceuticals could be rendered obsolete or made uneconomical by the development of new pharmaceuticals to treat the conditions addressed by the company s products  technological advances affecting the cost of production  or marketing or pricing actions by one or more of the company s competitors 
the company s business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any one or more of such developments 
each of the company s products is in competition for a share of the existing market with numerous products which have become standard treatments recommended or prescribed by dermatologists 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dynacin competes with minocin  a branded minocycline product marketed by american home products corporation ahp  and generic minocycline products marketed by schein  biocraft laboratories  inc biocraft  and warner chilcott laboratories  inc warner chilcott 
other oral antibiotics utilized for the treatment of acne include erythromycin  doxycycline and tetracycline marketed in branded and generic form by a variety of companies 
the company believes that triaz competes with cleocin t and a generic topical clindamycin  manufactured by pharmacia upjohn  benzac  manufactured by galderma  inc  and benzamycin  manufactured by rhone poulenc rorer 
esoterica primarily competes with porcelana  marketed by dep corp 
and ambi  marketed by kiwi brands  a division of sara lee corporation kiwi 
several of the company s products compete with generic non branded pharmaceuticals which claim to offer equivalent therapeutic benefits at a lower cost 
in some cases  insurers and other third party payors seek to encourage the use of generic products by paying or reimbursing a user or supplier of a branded prescription product a lower portion of the purchase price then would be paid or reimbursed for a generic product  making branded products less attractive  from a cost perspective  to buyers 
the aggressive pricing activities of the company s generic competitors and the payment and reimbursement policies of third party payors could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
government regulation drug and cosmetic regulation the manufacture and sale of cosmetics and drugs are subject to regulation principally by the fda and state and local authorities in the united states  and by comparable agencies in certain foreign countries 
the federal trade commission ftc and state and local authorities regulate the advertising of otc drugs and cosmetics 
the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  the regulations promulgated thereunder  and other federal and state statutes and regulations  govern  among other things  the testing  manufacture  safety  effectiveness  labeling  storage  record keeping  approval  advertising and promotion of the company s products 
in general  products falling within the fda s definition of new drugs require premarketing clearance by the fda 
products falling within the fda s definition of cosmetics or of drugs that are not new drugs and that are generally recognized as safe and effective do not require premarketing clearance 
the steps required before a pharmaceutical compound may be marketed in the united states include i preclinical laboratory and animal testing  ii submission to the fda of an investigatory new drug ind application  which must become effective before clinical trials may commence  iii adequate and well controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug  iv submission to the fda of an nda and v fda approval of the nda prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the drug 
in addition to obtaining fda approval for each product  each domestic drug manufacturing establishment must be registered with  and approved by  the fda 
drug product manufacturing establishments located in california also must be licensed by the state of california in compliance with separate regulatory requirements 
preclinical testing is generally conducted in laboratory animals to evaluate the potential safety and the efficacy of a drug 
the results of these studies are submitted to the fda as a part of an ind  which must be approved before clinical trials in humans can begin 
typically  clinical evaluation involves a time consuming and costly three phase process 
in phase i  clinical trials are conducted with a small number of subjects to determine the early safety profile  the pattern of drug distribution and metabolism 
in phase ii  clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy  optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety 
in phase iii  large scale  multi center  comparative trials are conducted with patients afflicted with a target disease in order to provide enough data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety required by the fda 
the fda closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical trials and may  at its discretion  re evaluate  alter  suspend or terminate the testing based upon the data which have been accumulated to that point and its assessment of the risk benefit ratio to the patient 
in general  fda approval is required before a new drug product may be marketed in the united states 
however  most otc drugs are exempt from the fda s premarketing approval requirements 
in  the fda instituted the ongoing otc drug review to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of otc drugs then in the market 
through this process  the fda issues monographs that set forth the specific active ingredients  dosages  indications and labeling statements for otc drugs that the fda will consider generally recognized as safe and effective and therefore not subject to premarket approval 
otc drug products are classified by the fda in one or more categories category i products  which are deemed safe and effective for otc use  category ii products  which are deemed not generally recognized as safe and effective for otc use  and category iii products  which are deemed possibly safe and effective with studies ongoing 
for certain categories of otc drugs not yet subject to a final monograph  the fda usually will not take regulatory action against such a product unless failure to do so will pose a potential health hazard to customers 
drugs subject to final monographs  however  are subject to various fda regulations concerning for example  cgmp  general and specific otc labeling requirements including warning statements  prohibitions against promotion for conditions other than those stated in the labeling  and requirement that otc drugs contain only suitable inactive ingredients 
otc drug manufacturing facilities are subject to fda inspection  and failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may lead to administrative or judicially imposed penalties 
the active ingredient in dynacin products  minocycline  has been approved by the fda 
the active ingredient in triaz and benzashave products has been classified as a category iii product under a tentative final fda monograph for over the counter distribution for use in treatment of labeled conditions 
the fda has requested  and a task force of the non prescription drug manufacturers association has undertaken  further studies to confirm that benzoyl peroxide  an active ingredient in triaz and benzashave products  is not a tumor promoter when tested in conjunction with uv light exposure 
triaz and benzashave products  which the company also sells on a prescription basis  have the same ingredients at the same dosage levels as the over the counter products 
in the company s opinion  triaz and benzashave products would also be considered to be generally recognized as safe and effective for their intended uses under the food and drug act 
there can be no assurance these tests will confirm the status of benzoyl peroxide as generally recognized as safe and effective or that adverse test results would not result in withdrawal of triaz and benzashave from marketing 
an adverse decision by the fda with respect to the safety of benzoyl peroxide could result in the assertion of product liability claims against the company and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operation 
certain esoterica products contain the active ingredient hydroquinone  currently a category i product 
independent expert dermatologists have formally expressed the view that hydroquinone at a concentration is generally recognized as safe and effective for its intended use 
however  in  with the concurrence of the fda  the industry initiated dermatological metabolism and toxicity studies to fully support hydroquinone s continued category i status 
notwithstanding the pendency or results of these tests  which may take up to three years to complete  the fda may elect to classify hydroquinone as a category iii otc drug 
the company  in conjunction with the non prescription drug manufacturers association and other manufacturers  is responsible for of the costs associated with these studies 
an adverse decision by the fda on the safety of hydroquinone could result in the assertions of product liability claims against the company 
moreover  if hydroquinone is not maintained as a category i or category iii drug  the company would be required to cease marketing esoterica products containing hydroquinone  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the esoterica  triaz and benzashave products must meet the composition and labeling requirements established by the fda for products containing their respective basic ingredients 
the company believes that compliance with those established standards avoids the requirement for premarketing clearance of these products 
there can be no assurance that the fda will not take a contrary position 
the company believes its three theraplex moisturizers  as they are promoted and intended by the company for use  fall within the fda s definition of cosmetics and therefore do not require premarketing clearance 
there can be no assurance that the fda will not take a contrary position in the future or that an adverse determination by the fda would not result in withdrawal of the theraplex moisturizers from marketing 
the company believes that such products are subject to regulations governing product safety  use of ingredients  labeling and promotion and methods of manufacture 
certain factors affecting the company s products the company believes that certain of its products as they are promoted and intended by the company for use  are exempt from registration based on the date of introduction of their active ingredients and therefore do not require premarketing clearance 
there can be no assurance that the fda will not take a contrary position 
the company believes that such products are subject to regulations governing product safety  use of ingredients  advertising  labeling and promotion and methods of manufacture 
clinical trials and the marketing and manufacturing of pharmaceutical products are subject to the rigorous testing and approval processes of the fda and foreign regulatory authorities 
the process of obtaining fda and other required regulatory approvals is lengthy and expensive 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain the necessary approvals to conduct clinical trials or for the manufacturing and marketing of products  that all necessary clearances will be granted to the company or its licensors for future products on a timely basis or at all or that fda review or other actions will not involve delays adversely affecting the marketing and sale of the company s products 
in addition  the testing and approval process with respect to certain new products which the company may develop or seek to introduce is likely to take a substantial number of years and involve the expenditure of substantial resources 
there can be no assurance that pharmaceutical products currently in development  or those products acquired or licensed by the company  will be cleared for marketing by the fda 
failure to obtain any necessary approvals or failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
further  future government regulation could prevent or delay regulatory approval of the company s products 
there can be no assurance that any approval will be granted on a timely basis  or at all  that the fda will not require post marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the record of the product and continued compliance with regulatory requirements  that the fda will not require the submission of any lot of any product for inspection and will not restrict the release of any lot that does not comply with fda standards  that the fda will not otherwise order the suspension of manufacturing  recall or seizure of products  or that the fda will not withdraw its marketing clearance of any product if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product are discovered following approval 
from time to time  the fda has issued correspondence to pharmaceutical companies  including the company  alleging that their advertising or promotional practices are false  misleading or deceptive 
the company has resolved all such complaints without any adverse findings by the fda and without incurring substantial expense 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will not receive such correspondence from the fda in the future  or that  if such notices are received  they will not result in substantial cost  disruption or expense including fines and penalties  in material changes to the manner in which the company promotes its products  or in loss of sales of the company s products or other material adverse effects on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
for both currently marketed and future products  failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements could  among other things  result in fines  suspensions of regulatory approvals  product recalls  operating restrictions  criminal prosecution  relabeling costs  delays in product distribution  marketing and sales or seizure or cessation of manufacture of the products and the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions 
there can be no assurance that the fda will not change its position with regard to the safety or effectiveness of the company s current or future products or that the fda will agree with the company s position regarding the regulatory status of its products 
in the event that the fda takes a contrary position regarding any of the company s current or future products  the company may be required to change its labeling or formulation or possibly cease manufacture and marketing of such products 
in addition  even prior to any formal regulatory action  the company could decide voluntarily to cease distribution and sale  or to recall  any of its products if concern about the safety or efficacy of any of its products were to develop 
any such action could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company also will be subject to foreign regulatory authorities governing clinical trials and pharmaceutical sales if it seeks to market its products outside the united states 
whether or not fda approval has been obtained  approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing of the product in those countries 
the approval process varies from country to country and the time required may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval 
there can be no assurance that any foreign regulatory agency will approve any product submitted for review by the company 
third party reimbursement the operating results of the company will depend in part on the availability of adequate reimbursement for the company s products from third party payors  such as government entities  private health insurers and managed care organizations 
third party payors are increasingly seeking to negotiate the pricing of medical services and products and to promote the use of non branded generic pharmaceuticals through payor based reimbursement policies designed to encourage their use 
in some cases  third party payors will pay or reimburse a user or supplier of a prescription drug product only a portion of the purchase price of the product 
in the case of the company s prescription products  payment or reimbursement by third party payors of only a portion of the cost of such products could make such products less attractive  from a cost perspective  to users  suppliers and prescribing physicians 
there can be no assurance that reimbursement  if available  will be adequate 
moreover  certain of the company s products are not of a type generally eligible for third party reimbursement 
if adequate reimbursement levels are not provided by government entities or other third party payors for the company s products  or if those reimbursement policies increasingly favor the use of generic products  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
in addition  managed care initiatives to control costs have influenced primary care physicians to refer fewer patients to dermatologists  resulting in a declining target market for the company 
further reductions in referrals to dermatologists could have a material adverse impact upon the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  a number of legislative and regulatory proposals aimed at changing the nation s health care system have been proposed in recent years 
while the company cannot predict whether any such proposals will be adopted  or the effect that any such proposal may have on its business  such proposals  if enacted  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
product liability insurance the company faces an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of its products is alleged to have resulted in adverse effects 
such risk exists even with respect to those products that are manufactured in licensed and regulated facilities or that otherwise possess regulatory approval for commercial sale 
there can be no assurance that the company will avoid significant product liability exposure 
the company currently has product liability insurance in the amount of million per claim and million in the aggregate on a claims made basis 
many of the company s customers require the company to maintain product liability insurance coverage as a condition to their conducting business with the company 
as the loss of such insurance coverage could result in a loss of such customers  the company intends to take all reasonable steps necessary to maintain such insurance coverage  although there can be no assurance that adequate insurance coverage will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  or that such insurance will be adequate to cover potential product liability claims  or that the loss of insurance coverage or the assertion of a product liability claim or claims would not materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

the company intends to hire personnel as needed during the next months 
item properties the company presently leases approximately  square feet of office space for its headquarters in phoenix  arizona  under a lease agreement which expires in may the company believes that these facilities will be adequate to meet its needs for the foreseeable future 
item legal proceedings the company and certain of its subsidiaries are parties to certain actions and proceedings incident to their business 
liability in the event of final adverse determinations in any of these matters is either covered by insurance and or established reserves  or  the company believes  will not  in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on the business  financial position or results of operations of the company

other matters inflation did not have a significant impact upon the results of the company during the fiscal  or certain factors affecting forward looking statements safe harbor statement this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the actual results of medicis could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors discussed elsewhere in this report  as well as the following dependence on sales of dynacin products the company derives a majority of its revenue from sales of dynacin products 
the company believes that sales of dynacin products will continue to constitute the majority of net sales for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  any factor adversely affecting the sale of dynacin products would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

there can be no assurance that the company maintain or increase revenues profitability or avoid losses in any future period 
intense competition  uncertainty of technological change the manufacture and sale of pharmaceuticals is highly competitive 
most of the company s competitors are large  well established pharmaceutical  chemical  cosmetic or health care companies with considerably greater financial  marketing  sales and technical resources than those available to the company
