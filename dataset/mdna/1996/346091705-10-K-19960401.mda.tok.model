item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
sales and markets forest s us production is generally sold at the wellhead to oil and natural gas purchasing companies in the areas where it is produced 
crude oil and condensate are typically sold at prices which are based upon posted field prices 
for the month of march  approximately of the company s us natural gas was committed to both interstate and intrastate natural gas pipeline companies  primarily under volumetric production payment agreements and long term contracts 
the remainder of the company s us natural gas was sold at the wellhead at spot market prices 
the term spot market as used herein refers to contracts with a term of six months or less or contracts which call for a redetermination of sales prices every six months or earlier 
in canada  canadian forest s production is sold primarily through the promark netback pool 
the netback pool matches major end users with providers of gas supply through arranged transportation channels and uses a netback pricing mechanism to establish the wellhead price paid to producers 
the netback pool gas sales in averaged mmcf per day  of which canadian forest supplied approximately mmcf per day or approximately of its current natural gas production 
in addition to operating the netback pool  promark provides two other marketing services for producers and purchasers of natural gas 
promark manages long term gas supply contracts for its industrial customers by providing full service purchasing  accounting and gas nomination services for these customers on a fee for services basis 
promark also buys and sells gas in its trading operation for terms as short as one day and as long as one to two years 
profits generated by trading are derived from the spread between the prices of gas purchased and sold 
for much of the past decade  the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile 
the company anticipates that such markets will continue to be volatile over the next year 
price fluctuations in the natural gas spot market have a significant impact on the company s business because most of the company s reserves are attributable to natural gas  most of its current production consists of natural gas and a large portion of its natural gas production is sold in the spot market 
at december   approximately of forest s estimated proved reserves in the us  including volumes attributable to volumetric production payments  consisted of natural gas on an mcfe basis 
during  of the company s total us production on the same basis consisted of natural gas 
approximately of such natural gas production was sold in the spot market 
on a pro forma basis at december   approximately of forest s estimated proved reserves in canada consisted of natural gas on an mcfe basis 
during  of forest s pro forma canadian production consisted of natural gas 
in order to attempt to minimize the product price volatility to which the company is subject  the company  from time to time  enters into energy swap agreements and other financial arrangements with third parties to attempt to reduce the company s exposure to anticipated fluctuations in future oil and natural gas prices 
the volumetric production payments that the company has entered into further minimize the price volatility to which the company is subject 
for further information concerning market conditions  production payments and energy swap agreements  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
demand for natural gas is highly seasonal  with demand generally higher in the colder winter months and in hot summer months 
as a result  the price received for spot market natural gas may vary significantly between seasonal periods 
to date  the company generally has been able to sell all of its available spot market natural gas at prevailing spot market prices  thus  the volumes sold by the company have not fluctuated materially with seasonality 
there is no assurance  however  that the company will be able to continue to achieve this result 
the company believes that the loss of one or more of its current natural gas spot purchasers should not have a material adverse effect on the company s business in the united states because any individual spot purchaser could be readily replaced by another spot purchaser who would pay approximately the same sales price 
in canada  the majority of canadian forest s natural gas production is sold under the promark netback pool to long term buyers 
the loss of one or more of such long term buyers could have an adverse effect on canadian forest and promark 
substantially all of forest s oil is sold under short term contracts at prices which are based upon posted field prices 
for information concerning sales to major customers  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
competition the oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive 
competition is particularly intense in the acquisition of prospective oil and natural gas properties and oil and gas reserves 
forest s competitive position depends on its geological  geophysical and engineering expertise  on its financial resources  its ability to develop its properties and its ability to select  acquire and develop proved reserves 
forest competes with a substantial number of other companies having larger technical staffs and greater financial and operational resources 
many such companies not only engage in the acquisition  exploration  development and production of oil and natural gas reserves  but also carry on refining operations  generate electricity and market refined products 
the company also competes with major and independent oil and gas companies in the marketing and sale of oil and gas to transporters  distributers and end users 
there is also competition between the oil and natural gas industry and other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial  commercial and individual consumers 
forest also competes with other oil and natural gas companies in attempting to secure drilling rigs and other equipment necessary for drilling and completion of wells 
such equipment may be in short supply from time to time  although there is no current shortage of such equipment 
finally  companies not previously investing in oil and natural gas may choose to acquire reserves to establish a firm supply or simply as an investment 
such companies will also provide competition for forest 
forest s business is affected not only by such competition  but also by general economic developments  governmental regulations and other factors that affect its ability to market its oil and natural gas production 
the prices of oil and natural gas realized by forest are highly volatile 
the price of oil is generally dependent on world supply and demand  while the price forest receives for its natural gas is tied to the specific markets in which such gas is sold 
declines in crude oil prices or natural gas prices adversely impact forest s activities 
the company s financial position and resources may also adversely affect the company s competitive position 
lack of available funds or financing alternatives will prevent the company from executing its operating strategy and from deriving the expected benefits therefrom 
for further information concerning the company s financial position  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
promark also faces significant competition from other gas marketers  some of whom are significantly larger in size and have greater financial resources than promark  canadian forest or the company 
regulation united states various aspects of the company s oil and natural gas operations are regulated by administrative agencies under statutory provisions of the states where such operations are conducted and by certain agencies of the federal government for operations on federal leases 
the federal energy regulatory commission ferc regulates the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce pursuant to the natural gas act of nga and the natural gas policy act of ngpa 
in the past  the federal government has regulated the prices at which oil and gas could be sold 
while sales by producers of natural gas  and all sales of crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids can currently be made at uncontrolled market prices  congress could reenact price controls in the future 
deregulation of wellhead sales in the natural gas industry began with the enactment of the ngpa in in  congress enacted the natural gas wellhead decontrol act the decontrol act 
the decontrol act removed all nga and ngpa price and nonprice controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective january  commencing in april  the ferc issued order nos 
 a  and b order no 
 which require interstate pipelines to provide transportation separate  or unbundled  from the pipelines sales of gas 
also  order no 
requires pipelines to provide open access transportation on a basis that is equal for all gas supplies 
although order no 
does not directly regulate the company s activities  the ferc has stated that it intends for order no 
to foster increased competition within all phases of the natural gas industry 
it is unclear what impact  if any  increased competition within the natural gas industry under order no 
will have on the company s activities 
although order no 
 assuming it is upheld in its entirety  could provide the company with additional market access and more fairly applied transportation service rates  order no 
could also subject the company to more restrictive pipeline imbalance tolerances and greater penalties for violation of those tolerances 
numerous parties have filed petitions for review of order no 
 as well as orders in individual pipeline restructuring proceedings 
upon such judicial review  these orders may be remanded or reversed in whole or in part 
with order no 
subject to court review  it is difficult to predict with precision its ultimate effects 
the ferc has announced its intention to re examine certain of its transportation related policies  including the appropriate manner in which interstate pipelines release transportation capacity under order no 
 and the use of market based rates for interstate gas transmission 
while any resulting ferc action would affect the company only indirectly  the ferc s current rules and policy statement may have the effect of enhancing competition in natural gas markets by  among other things  encouraging non producer natural gas marketers to engage in certain purchase and sale transactions 
the company cannot predict what action the ferc will take on these matters  nor can it accurately predict whether the ferc s actions will achieve the goal of increasing competition in markets in which the company s natural gas is sold 
however  the company does not believe that it will be treated materially differently than other natural gas producers and marketers with which it competes 
recently  the ferc issued a policy statement on how interstate natural gas pipelines can recover the costs of new pipeline facilities 
while this policy statement affects the company only indirectly  in its present form  the new policy should enhance competition in natural gas markets and facilitate construction of gas supply laterals 
however  requests for rehearing of this policy statement are currently pending 
the company cannot predict what action the ferc will take on these requests 
commencing in october  the ferc issued a series of rules order nos 
and a establishing an indexing system under which oil pipelines will be able to change their transportation rates  subject to prescribed ceiling levels 
the indexing system  which allows or may require pipelines to make rate changes to track changes in the producer price index for finished goods  minus one percent  became effective january  the ferc s decision in this matter is currently the subject of various petitions for judicial review 
the company is not able at this time to predict the effects of order nos 
and a  if any  on the transportation costs associated with oil production from the company s oil producing operations 
the outer continental shelf lands act ocsla requires that all pipelines operating on or across the outer continental shelf the ocs provide open access  non discriminatory service 
although the ferc has opted not to impose the regulations of order no 
 in which the ferc implemented the ocsla  on gatherers and other non jurisdictional entities  the ferc has retained the authority to exercise jurisdiction over those entities if necessary to permit non discriminatory access to service or the ocs 
certain operations the company conducts are on federal oil and gas leases  which the minerals management service mms administers 
the mms issues such leases through competitive bidding 
these leases contain relatively standardized terms and require compliance with detailed mms regulations and orders pursuant to the ocsla which are subject to change by the mms 
for offshore operations  lessees must obtain mms approval for exploration plans and development and production plans prior to the commencement of such operations 
in addition to permits required from other agencies such as the coast guard  the army corps of engineers and the environmental protection agency  lessees must obtain a permit from the mms prior to the commencement of drilling 
the mms has promulgated regulations requiring offshore production facilities located on the ocs to meet stringent engineering and construction specifications 
the mms proposed additional safety related regulations concerning the design and operating procedures for ocs production platforms and pipelines 
these proposed regulations were withdrawn pending further discussions among interested federal agencies 
the mms also has regulations restricting the flaring or venting of natural gas  and has recently proposed to amend such regulations to prohibit the flaring of liquid hydrocarbons and oil without prior authorization 
similarly  the mms has promulgated other regulations governing the plugging and abandonment of wells located offshore and the removal of all production facilities 
to cover the various obligations of lessees on the ocs  the mms generally requires that lessees post substantial bonds or other acceptable assurances that such obligations will be met 
the cost of such bonds or other surety can be substantial and there is no assurance that the company can continue to obtain bonds or other surety in all cases 
in addition  the mms is conducting an inquiry into certain contract agreements from which producers on mms leases have received settlement proceeds that are royalty bearing and the extent to which producers have paid the appropriate royalties on those proceeds 
the company believes that this inquiry will not have a material impact on its financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
the mms has recently issued a notice of proposed rulemaking in which it proposes to amend its regulations governing the calculation of royalties and the valuation of natural gas produced from federal leases 
the principal feature in the amendments  as proposed  would establish an alternative market index based method to calculate royalties on certain natural gas production sold to affiliates or pursuant to non arm s length sales contracts 
the mms has proposed this rulemaking to facilitate royalty valuation in light of changes in the gas marketing environment 
the company cannot predict what action the mms will take on these matters  nor can it predict at this stage of the rulemaking proceeding how the company might be affected by amendments to the regulations 
additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the oil and gas industry are pending before the ferc and the courts 
the company cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective 
in the past  the natural gas industry has been heavily regulated 
there is no assurance that the regulatory approach currently pursued by the ferc will continue indefinitely 
notwithstanding the foregoing  the company does not anticipate that compliance with existing federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations will have a material or significantly adverse effect upon the capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position of the company or its subsidiaries 
no material portion of forest s business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the federal government 
oil spill financial responsibility requirements united states in august  the mms published an advance notice of its intention to adopt a rule under the oil pollution act of opa that would require owners and operations of oil and gas facilities located on or adjacent to waters of the united states to establish  in financial responsibility to cover oil spill related liabilities 
compliance with the proposed rule could be financially burdensome for many small oil and gas companies  and in june  the us house of representatives approved a bill that would amend opa to reduce the level of financial responsibility to  the clinton administration has expressed its support for the pending legislation  but the us senate has not yet taken any action on the bill approved by the house of representatives 
the company cannot predict whether congress will reduce the level of financial responsibility required under opa nor can it predict the final form of any financial responsibility rule that might be adopted  but any such action has the potential to result in the imposition of substantial additional annual costs on the company or otherwise materially adversely affect the company 
the impact of the rule should not be any more adverse to the company than it will be to other similarly situated or less capitalized owners or operators in the gulf of mexico and other affected regions 
the mms has indicated that it will not move forward with the adoption of the rule until the united states congress has had an opportunity to act on the pending amendments to opa regulation canada the oil and natural gas industry in canada is subject to extensive controls and regulations imposed by various levels of government 
it is not expected that any of these controls or regulations will affect the operations of the company in a manner materially different than they would affect other oil and gas companies of similar size 
in canada  producers of oil negotiate sales contracts directly with oil purchasers  with the result that the market determines the price of oil 
the price depends in part on oil quality  prices of competing fuels  distance to market and the value of refined products 
oil exports may be made pursuant to export contracts with terms not exceeding one year in the case of light crude  and not exceeding two years in the case of heavy crude  provided that an order approving any such export has been obtained from the national energy board neb 
any oil export to be made pursuant to a contract of longer duration requires an exporter to obtain an export license from the neb and the issue of such a license requires the approval of the canadian federal government 
in canada  the price of natural gas sold in interprovincial and international trade is determined by negotiation between buyers and sellers 
natural gas exported from canada is subject to regulation by the government of canada through the neb 
producers and exporters are free to negotiate prices and other terms with purchasers  provided that the export contracts must continue to meet certain criteria prescribed by the neb 
as is the case with oil  natural gas exports for a term of less than two years must be made pursuant to an neb order  or  in the case of exports for a longer duration  pursuant to an neb license and canadian federal government approval 
the provincial governments of alberta  british columbia and saskatchewan also regulate the volume of natural gas which may be removed from those provinces for consumption elsewhere based on such factors as reserve availability  transportation arrangements and market considerations 
on january  the north american free trade agreement nafta among the governments of canada  the united states and mexico became effective 
nafta carries forward most of the material energy terms contained in the canada us free trade agreement 
in the context of energy resources  canada continues to remain free to determine whether exports to the united states or mexico will be allowed provided that any export restrictions do not i reduce the proportion of energy resource exported relative to domestic use  ii impose an export price higher than the domestic price  and iii disrupt normal channels of supply 
all three countries are prohibited from imposing minimum export or import price requirements 
nafta contemplates clearer disciplines on regulators to ensure fair implementation of any regulatory changes and to minimize disruption of contractual arrangements  which is important for canadian natural gas exports 
in addition to federal regulation  each province has legislation and regulations which govern land tenure  royalties  production rates  environmental protection and other matters 
the royalty regime is a significant factor in the profitability of oil and natural gas production 
royalties payable on production from lands other than crown lands are determined by negotiations between the mineral owner and the lessee 
crown royalties are determined by government regulation and are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production  and the rate of royalties payable generally depends in part on prescribed reference prices  well productivity  geographical location  field discovery date and the type or quality of the petroleum product produced 
from time to time the governments of canada  alberta  british columbia and saskatchewan have established incentive programs which have included royalty rate deductions  royalty holidays and tax credits for the purpose of encouraging oil and natural gas exploration or enhanced recovery projects 
in alberta  a producer of oil or natural gas is entitled to a credit against the royalties payable to the crown by virtue of the artc alberta royalty tax credit program 
the artc program is based on a price sensitive formula  and the artc rate varies between  at prices for oil below per cubic meter  and  at prices above per cubic meter 
the artc rate is applied to a maximum of  of alberta crown royalties payable for each producer or associated group of producers 
crown royalties on production from producing properties acquired from corporations claiming maximum entitlement to artc will generally not be eligible for artc 
the rate is established quarterly based on the average par price  as determined by the alberta department of energy for the previous quarterly period 
canadian forest is not eligible for any artc credits on its existing properties 
oil and natural gas royalty holidays and reductions for specific wells reduce the amount of crown royalties paid by the company to the provincial governments 
the artc program provides a rebate on crown royalties paid in respect of eligible producing properties 
operating hazards and environmental matters the oil and gas business involves a variety of operating risks  including the risk of fire  explosions  blow outs  pipe failure  casing collapse  abnormally pressured formations and environmental hazards such as oil spills  gas leaks  ruptures and discharges of toxic gases  the occurrence of any of which could result in substantial losses to the company due to injury or loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution or other environmental damage  clean up responsibilities  regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations 
in addition  the company currently operates offshore and is subject to the additional hazards of marine operations  such as capsizing  collision and adverse weather and sea conditions 
such hazards may hinder or delay drilling  development and on line production operations 
extensive federal  state  provincial and local laws govern oil and natural gas operations regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
numerous governmental departments issue rules and regulations to implement and enforce such laws which are often difficult and costly to comply with and which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply 
some laws  rules and regulations relating to protection of the environment may  in certain circumstances  impose strict liability for environmental contamination  rendering a person liable for environmental damages and cleanup costs without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person 
other laws  rules and regulations may restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise exist 
the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases its cost of doing business and consequently affects its profitability 
these laws  rules and regulations affect the operations of the company 
compliance with environmental requirements generally could have a material adverse effect upon the capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position of forest and its subsidiaries 
the company believes that it is in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on the company 
nevertheless  changes in environmental law have the potential to adversely affect the company s operations 
for instance  at least two separate courts have recently ruled that certain wastes associated with the production of crude oil may be classified as hazardous substances under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act commonly called superfund and thus the company could become subject to the burdensome cleanup and liability standards established under the federal superfund program if significant concentrations of such wastes were determined to be present at the company s properties or to have been produced as a result of the company s operations 
alternately  pending amendments to superfund presently under consideration by the us congress could relax many of the burdensome cleanup and liability standards established under the statute 
in canada  the oil and natural gas industry is currently subject to environmental regulation pursuant to provincial and federal legislation 
environmental legislation provides for restrictions and prohibitions on releases or emissions of various substances produced or utilized in association with certain oil and gas industry operations 
in addition  legislation requires that well and facility sites be abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of provincial authorities 
a breach of such legislation may result in the imposition of fines and penalties 
although the company maintains insurance against some  but not all  of the risks described above  including insuring the costs of clean up operations  public liability and physical damage  there is no assurance that such insurance will be adequate to cover all such costs or that such insurance will continue to be available in the future or that such insurance will be available at premium levels that justify its purchase 
the occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and operations 
the company has established guidelines to be followed to comply with environmental laws  rules and regulations 
the company has designated a compliance officer whose responsibility is to monitor regulatory requirements and their impacts on the company and to implement appropriate compliance procedures 
the company also employs an environmental manager whose responsibilities include causing forest s operations to be carried out in accordance with applicable environmental guidelines and implementing adequate safety precautions 
although the company maintains pollution insurance against the costs of clean up operations  public liability and physical damage  there is no assurance that such insurance will be adequate to cover all such costs or that such insurance will continue to be available in the future 
other foreign operations in  the company sold substantially all of its former canadian operations to caneagle resources corporation caneagle 
in june  caneagle sold a significant portion of its oil and gas properties in canada to a third party 
in conjunction with this transaction  the company exchanged its investment in caneagle for shares of preferred stock of a newly formed entity  archean energy  ltd 
archean 
in connection with the saxon transaction  the company transferred its archean preferred stock to saxon 
forest considers  from time to time  certain oil and gas opportunities in other foreign countries

item legal proceedings royalty owners have filed two separate class action lawsuits against the company in the state district court of caddo county  oklahoma 
in each case the plaintiff has alleged unjust enrichment  breach of fiduciary duty  constructive fraud and breach of contract 
the claims in both suits are based on the allegation that the company underpaid royalties on the consideration received pursuant to settlement agreements with oneok  inc in and in modrall v 
forest oil corporation  case no 
cj  filed on march   the court  on september   certified a class comprised of the royalty and overriding royalty owners in the three wells involved in the oneok  inc settlement 
no class has been certified as yet in merco of oklahoma  inc 
v 
forest oil corporation  case no 
cj  which suit was filed on september  this suit involves the oneok  inc settlement 
the plaintiffs in both suits seek actual damages in excess of  punitive damages in excess of  an accounting  interest and costs 
there has been no specific determination of the amount in controversy in either case 
the plaintiffs allege in both cases that they are entitled to share in all value received by the company under the aforesaid settlements  including proceeds not attributable to actual gas production 
the company believes that it was not required to pay a royalty on such proceeds  and therefore intends to vigorously resist these claims 
the company entered into a settlement agreement and release with el paso natural gas company el paso  effective may   which was later modified by a partial termination of settlement agreement and release and gas purchase agreement  effective january  these agreements settled the parties disputes concerning take or pay deficiencies under eight gas purchase contracts covering wells located in washita county  oklahoma 
the company received a demand letter dated november   from the same attorney who represents modrall and merco  on behalf of a royalty owner in one of the wells covered by the el paso settlements 
a class action petition was filed january  in wright v 
forest oil corporation  et al  case no

the average sales price for natural gas in decreased compared to  exclusive of the effects of the income associated with the resolution of the bankruptcy claim  which increased the average sales price for natural gas by 
per mcf 
the average sales price for oil in increased compared to oil and gas sales increased to  from  or by approximately  in compared to due primarily to increased natural gas production from properties acquired throughout and the effects of the change in method of accounting for oil and gas sales  partially offset by normal production declines 
the change in method of accounting increased earnings from operations oil and gas sales less oil and gas production expenses by  in in  natural gas production volumes increased compared to while oil production volumes were higher 
the increase in revenue attributable to increased production was partially offset by a decrease in the average sales price for oil

oil and gas production expense 
oil and gas production expense increased slightly to  in from  in on an mcfe basis  production expense increased to 
per mcfe in from 
per mcfe in the increased cost per mcfe is directly attributable to fixed components of oil and gas production expense being allocated over a smaller production base 
the company expects production expense to decrease in  on a per unit basis  as a result of the saxon and canadian forest acquisitions and increased levels of capital investment 
oil and gas production expense increased to  in compared to  in due primarily to increased natural gas production as a result of property acquisitions throughout  partially offset by a decrease in workover expenses and a general decrease in expenses due to the sale of properties 
in and  production expense was approximately

interest expense of  in increased  or compared to due to higher loan balances as a result of borrowings for capital expenditures 
depreciation and depletion expense 
depreciation and depletion expense decreased to  in from  in due to the decrease in production  as well as a decrease in the depletion rate per unit of production 
the depletion rate decreased to per mcfe for us production in compared to for us production in due to writedowns of the company s oil and gas properties taken in the third and fourth quarters of depreciation and depletion expense increased to  in from  in due to increased production in the period as a result of property acquisitions 
the depletion rate was for us production in at december   the company had undeveloped properties with a cost basis of approximately  which were excluded from depletion compared to  at december  and  at december  the decrease from to and is attributable to exploration and development work  as well as lease expirations and property sales 
impairment of oil and gas properties 
the company was not required to record a writedown of the carrying value of its oil and gas properties in or the company recorded a writedown of its oil and gas properties of  in due primarily to a decrease in spot market prices for natural gas 
additional writedowns of the full cost pool may be required if prices decrease  undeveloped property values decrease  estimated proved reserve volumes are revised downward or costs incurred in exploration  development  or acquisition activities exceed the discounted future net cash flows from the additional reserves  if any 
the average gulf coast spot price received by the company for natural gas increased from per mcf at december  to per mcf at march  the west texas intermediate price for crude oil was per barrel at both december  and march  accounting policies 
the company changed its method of accounting for oil and gas sales from the sales method to the entitlements method effective january  under the sales method previously used by the company  all proceeds from production credited to the company were recorded as revenue until such time as the company had produced its share of related reserves 
under the entitlements method  revenue is recorded based upon the company s share of volumes sold  regardless of whether the company has taken its proportionate share of volumes produced 
under the entitlements method  the company records a receivable or payable to the extent it receives less or more than its proportionate share of the related revenue 
the company believes that the entitlements method is preferable because it allows for recognition of revenue based on the company s actual share of jointly owned production and provides a better matching of revenue and related expenses

liquidity and capital resources during  the company took various steps and committed to various actions to improve its liquidity and capital resources 
in early  in response to market conditions  the company reduced its general and administrative expenditures through a workforce reduction effective march  as a result  total overhead for decreased by approximately  compared to or by approximately 
in addition  the company reduced its budgeted capital expenditures during the first six months of to those required to maintain its producing oil and gas properties as well as certain essential development  drilling and other activities 
in july  the company received  of equity capital from anschutz and restructured the jedi loan 
as a result  the company was able to resume its capital expenditure program and to increase its levels of capital spending during the last six months of the company completed two acquisitions of canadian oil and gas companies  saxon in december and canadian forest in january for a description of these transactions  see item business operating strategy 
the saxon acquisition was financed using forest common stock  cash and the transfer to saxon of shares of preferred stock of archean energy ltd 
the canadian forest acquisition was financed through a public offering of common stock and borrowings under the company s credit facility 
the company has historically addressed its long term liquidity needs through the issuance of debt and equity securities  when market conditions permit  and through the use of nonrecourse production based financing 
on january   the company issued  shares of common stock for per share in a public offering 
of this amount   shares were sold by saxon and  were sold by forest 
the net proceeds to forest from the issuance of the shares totalled approximately  after deducting issuance costs and underwriting fees and were used  along with an additional approximately  drawn from the company s credit facility  to complete the purchase of canadian forest 
the pro forma effect of the acquisitions and the public offering was to increase total assets to  compared to  at december   to increase shareholders equity to  compared to  at december   and to reduce the company s debt to capitalization ratio to compared to at december  as a result of the above  forest s financial position and liquidity have improved considerably 
the company expects to be able to meet its capital expenditure financing requirements using cash flows generated by operations and borrowings under existing lines of credit 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will have access to sufficient capital to meet its capital requirements 
the planned levels of capital expenditures could be reduced if the company experiences lower than anticipated net cash provided by operations or other liquidity needs or could be increased if the company experiences increased cash flow 
the prices the company receives for its future oil and natural gas production will significantly impact future operating cash flows 
no prediction can be made as to the prices the company will receive for its future oil and gas production 
many of the factors which may affect the company s future operating performance and long term liquidity are beyond the company s control  including  but not limited to  oil and natural gas prices  governmental actions and taxes  the availability and attractiveness of properties for acquisition  the adequacy and attractiveness of financing and operational results 
the company continues to examine alternative sources of long term capital  including bank borrowings or the issuance of debt instruments  the sale of production payments or other nonrecourse financing  the sale of common stock  preferred stock or other equity securities of the company  the issuance of net profits interests  sales of non strategic properties  prospects and technical information  or joint venture financing 
availability of these sources of capital and  therefore  the company s ability to execute its operating strategy will depend upon a number of factors  some of which are beyond the control of the company 
cash flow 
historically  one of the company s primary sources of capital has been funds provided by operations 
during  the company s operating cash flows and working capital were adversely affected by a significant decline in production 
the following summary table reflects comparative cash flows for the company for the periods ended december   and funds provided by operations consists of net cash provided used by operating activities exclusive of adjustments for working capital items  proceeds from volumetric production payments and amortization of deferred revenue 
this information is being presented in accordance with industry practice and is not intended to be a substitute for cash provided by operating activities  a measure of performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and should not be relied upon as such 
years ended december  in thousands funds provided by operations    net cash provided used by operating activities    net cash used by investing activities    net cash provided used by financing activities    lower production volumes coupled with decreased prices for natural gas resulted in a decrease in funds provided by operations to  in from  in the company experienced a net use of cash for operating activities of  in compared to  of net cash provided by operating activities in the corresponding prior year  also attributable to the lower production volumes and decreased prices 
the company used  for investing activities in compared to  in the prior year due to lower direct capital expenditures  offset in part by lower proceeds from property sales 
cash provided by financing activities of  in included the net proceeds from the issuance of stock and warrants to anschutz  partially offset by repayments of the company s credit facility and a decrease in other liabilities 
in  the company used cash for financing activities of  primarily consisting of the redemption of subordinated debentures and a decrease in other liabilities  offset by borrowings under the company s credit facility 
hedging program 
in addition to the volumes of natural gas and oil dedicated to volumetric production payments  the company has also used energy swaps and other financial agreements to hedge against the effects of fluctuations in the sales prices for oil and natural gas 
in a typical swap agreement  the company receives the difference between a fixed price per unit of production and a price based on an agreed upon third party index if the index price is lower 
if the index price is higher  the company pays the difference 
the company s current swaps are settled on a monthly basis 
at december   the company had natural gas swaps and collars including those of saxon for an aggregate of approximately bbtu billion british thermal units per day of natural gas during at fixed prices and floors ranging from per mmbtu million british thermal units on an alberta energy company c aeco c basis to per mmbtu on a new york mercantile exchange nymex basis and an aggregate of approximately bbtu per day of natural gas during at fixed prices and floors ranging from aeco c basis to nymex basis per mmbtu 
at december  the company had oil swaps for an aggregate of barrels per day of oil during at fixed prices ranging from to nymex basis 
the company currently has no material oil swaps in place for for further information on the company s outstanding energy swaps  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
capital expenditures 
the company s expenditures for property acquisition  exploration and development for the past three years  were as follows years ended december  in thousands property acquisition costs proved properties    undeveloped properties  exploration costs direct costs    overhead capitalized  development costs direct costs    overhead capitalized    amounts consist primarily of the allocation of purchase price to the oil and gas properties acquired in the purchase of saxon 
in  the company s property acquisition expenditures of  resulted in proved reserve additions of an estimated bcf of natural gas and  barrels of oil  as measured at the closing dates of the acquisitions for financial accounting purposes 
in  the company s property acquisition expenditures of  resulted in proved reserve additions of an estimated bcf of natural gas and  barrels of oil  as measured at the closing dates of the acquisitions for financial accounting purposes 
in  the company s property acquisition expenditures of  resulted in proved reserve additions of an estimated bcf of natural gas and million barrels of oil  as measured at the closing dates  as well as eight exploitation prospects and three exploratory offshore blocks 
the company s budgeted expenditures for exploration and development are approximately  and  respectively  including capitalized overhead of  during  the company intends to continue a strategy of acquiring reserves that meet its investment criteria  however  no assurance can be given that the company can locate or finance any property acquisitions 
if adequate sources of capital are not available to the company in  the amount invested in exploration  development and reserve acquisitions will be required to be reduced significantly 
bank credit facilities

the initial borrowing base under the canadian credit facility is  cdn 
the borrowing base is subject to formal redeterminations semi annually  but may be changed by the bank at its discretion at any time 
the canadian credit facility has a three year term and is indirectly secured by substantially all the assets of canadian forest 
funds drawn under the canadian credit facility can be used for general corporate purposes 
under the terms of the canadian credit facility  the three canadian subsidiaries are subject to certain covenants and financial tests  including restrictions or requirements with respect to working capital  cash flow  additional debt  liens  asset sales  investments  mergers  cash dividends and reporting responsibilities 
in addition to the credit facilities described above  saxon has a demand revolving operating loan and a demand revolving production loan with borrowing bases of  cdn and  cdn  respectively 
the loans are subject to semi annual review and have demand features  however  repayments are not required provided that borrowings are not in excess of the borrowing base and saxon complies with other existing covenants 
at december  there were outstanding borrowings of  cdn and  cdn under the operating loan and the production loan  respectively 
saxon also had an outstanding bridge loan at this date which was repaid in full using the proceeds of the sale of the forest common stock held by saxon 
at february   the amount outstanding under the credit facility was  the amount outstanding under the canadian credit facility was  cdn  and the amounts outstanding under the saxon operating loan and production loan were  cdn and  cdn  respectively

other financing 
under the terms of volumetric production payments  the company is required to deliver the scheduled volumes from the subject properties or to make a cash payment for volumes produced but not delivered  in combination not to exceed a specified percentage of monthly production 
if production levels are not sufficient to meet scheduled delivery commitments  the company must account for and make up such shortages  at market based prices  from future production 
amounts received for volumetric production payments are recorded as deferred revenue  which is amortized as sales are recorded based upon the scheduled deliveries under the production payment agreements 
as of december   the volumes remaining to be delivered were approximately bcf of natural gas and  barrels of oil  and the related deferred revenue was  under the terms of a nonrecourse secured loan from jedi  the company is required to make payments based on the net proceeds  as defined  from certain subject properties
