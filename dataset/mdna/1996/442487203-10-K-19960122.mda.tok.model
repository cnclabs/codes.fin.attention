housing revenues   homes delivered california housing revenues  homes delivered other housing revenues   homes delivered totals housing revenues   homes delivered   the increase in housing revenues was primarily the result of increases in average sales prices 
the increased average sales prices are primarily the result of diversifying the company s product mix in the northeast region to include more detached single family homes and larger townhouses with garages designed for the move up buyer 
in florida  average sales prices are increasing as a result of the addition of new higher priced single family developments 
in north carolina  average sales prices increased primarily due to the addition of higher priced communities 
in metro washington  dc average sales prices increased because there was a higher percentage of single family detached homes delivered

in california the increase was the result of the prior year being a startup period 
the northeast region backlog decreased from october  to october  this decrease was primarily the result of higher fiscal fourth quarter deliveries compared to the same period last year and unusually high net contracts in october causing a sharp increase in backlog at that time 
in metro washington  d 
c 
a decrease in backlog of was due to a reduced number of communities offered for sale 
the company has cut back its operations in metro washington  d 
c 
due to slow sales and stiff competition 
the company has written down certain residential inventories million during the year ended october  to their estimated fair value 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note for additional explanation

the writedowns of residential inventories during the year ended october  were primarily attributable to one community in new york  one in new jersey and three communities in metro washington  dc the reserves established during the year ended october  are primarily attributable to three communities  one each in new york  new hampshire  and pennsylvania 
in the new york community  the writedown is an addition to and prior years reserves due to reduced sales prices  buyers concessions  and an extended sellout period 
in new jersey the writedown was due to the termination of home sales in a community and the offering of the remaining owned lots for sale 
in metro washington  dc the writedown was also due to the termination of home sales in two communities and the offering of the remaining owned lots for sale 
also in metro washington  dc a reserve was taken against a parcel of land which the company is attempting to liquidate through lot sales 
in new hampshire  the reserve was an addition to prior years reserves due to reduced sales prices in one community in anticipation of a bulk sale of the remaining homes

during the year ended october  gross margins improved in all the company s markets except metro washington  dc compared to the year ended october  these increases were slightly offset by a change in geographic and product mix with an additional of home deliveries coming from outside the northeast region where gross margins are traditionally lower 
although material costs increased  the company was able to improve margins primarily due to the company s cost reduction efforts 
such efforts include more standardized designs  and national purchase contracts 
selling and general administrative expenses increased million during the year ended october  compared to the prior year 
as a percentage of homebuilding revenues such expenses increased to for the year ended october  from for the prior year 
the dollar increase is due primarily to increased home sales and delivery activities

housing revenues    homes delivered california housing revenues homes delivered other housing revenues    homes delivered totals housing revenues    homes delivered    excludes suspended operations in new york which are included with new hampshire in other 
the increase in housing revenue was the result of an increase in home deliveries and average sales prices 
increased deliveries are primarily the result of opening up more communities for sale during this period and expanding into eastern pennsylvania and metro washington  d 
c 
the increased average sales prices are primarily the result of diversifying the company s product mix in the northeast region to include more detached single family homes and larger townhouses with garages designed for the move up buyer 
also  average sales prices have increased in florida because all its new communities offer detached single family homes

the established reserves are reduced for carrying costs ie  property taxes  interest  etc 
incurred or losses incurred upon property sale 
during the eight months ended october  and the year ended february   the company established additional reserves of million and million  respectively 
the october  reserve is primarily attributable to the same reasons noted in the previous homebuilding section 
the february  reserve was substantially attributable to two florida developments where sales prices were reduced to accelerate their sellout 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note for an additional explanation of reserves

excluding this item the gross margin for the eight months ended october  is 
for the eight months ended october  the gross margin was 
the decline in gross margin for the company occurred for the following reasons 
the percentage of housing revenues coming from the northeast region where margins are greater have decreased 
at february   when the margins were highest  the northeast region revenues were of the total 
the percentage dropped to for the eight months ended october  
increase in such costs as a percentage of north carolina and florida housing revenues 
the north carolina and florida markets are very competitive which keeps prices and margins down 
also in florida  the increase was caused by higher developed lot costs 

material costs have increased sharply during the above periods as demand increased for such materials 

the company has added value to its homes while not obtaining equivalent increases in its home sale price because of competitive pressures 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million during the eight months ended october  and million during the year ended february   respectively  compared to the similar prior period 
the increase during the eight months ended october  is due primarily to increased home sales and delivery activities 
as a percentage of housing revenues  such expenses decreased to for the eight months ended october  from for the similar prior period 
the increase for the year ended february  was primarily due to increased selling expenses resulting from increased new sales contracts and home deliveries 
as a percentage of housing revenues  such expenses decreased to for the year ended february  from for the year ended february  the eight months ended october  increase as a percentage of housing revenues from the year ended february  was primarily attributable to a increase in homebuilding associates 
this was due to anticipated growth and the expensing of such costs over fewer average monthly home deliveries during the eight month transition period ended october  compared to the average monthly home deliveries over twelve months

as a percentage of total revenues such expenses were and for the eight months ended october  and  respectively  and  and for the years ended february  and  respectively

comments on income taxes in the previous total taxes section also apply here 
extraordinary loss in july  the company redeemed all of its outstanding subordinated notes due at a price of of par 
the principal amount redeemed was  and the redemption resulted in an extraordinary loss of  net of income taxes of  inflation inflation has a long term effect on the company because increasing costs of land  materials and labor result in increasing sales prices of its homes 
in general  these price increases have been commensurate with the general rate of inflation in the company s housing markets and have not had a significant adverse effect on the sale of the company s homes 
a significant inflationary risk faced by the housing industry generally is that rising housing costs  including land and interest costs  will substantially outpace increases in the income of potential purchasers 
in recent years  in the price ranges in which it sells homes  the company has not found this risk to be a significant problem 
inflation has a lesser short term effect on the company because the company generally negotiates fixed price contracts with its subcontractors and material suppliers for the construction of its homes 
these prices usually are applicable for a specified number of residential buildings or for a time period of between four to twelve months 
construction costs for residential buildings represent approximately of the company s total costs and expenses
