item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following comments should be read in conjunction with accompanying consolidated financial statements 
productivity of assets and working capital 
a assets 
utmd maintained total asset turns ratio of sales to total assets in consistent with  despite an increase in cash and investments of million  resulting from profitable operations 
consequently  non cash assets were more productive in generating revenues than the previous year 
by reinvesting cash from profitable operations in the development or acquisition of new products and expanded manufacturing capabilities  utmd will strive to maintain total asset productivity consistent with the turn rate 
net after accumulated depreciation property  plant and equipment assets pp e decreased in after subtracting the  initial investment made in ireland real estate and architectural planning assets 
pp e asset turns excluding new ireland assets not yet placed in service were  an excellent ratio for a vertically integrated manufacturing company 
total pp e asset turns were and will continue to decline in the near term as the investment in ireland continues  and until the facility becomes fully operational 
will only be a partial year of operation for the new ireland facility 
inventory turns improved in due to better materials management  faster manufacturing cycle times and conservative inventory valuations 
average inventory balances in declined  and year ending inventory balances declined  from the year ending accounts receivable a r balance grew a modest  in  allowing an improvement in days in receivables to  based on fourth quarter shipments volume  and meeting management s objective of maintaining a r in the days target range 
at the end of  aged a r over days from invoice date were down to less than of total accounts receivable from the prior year s balance of less than of total receivables 
in dollar value  working capital increased about million in  primarily because of the increase in cash 
accounts receivable were up only despite the increase in sales 
inventories were down substantially 
current liabilities were up slightly  due to increased year end accruals of commissions  bonuses and other short term obligations as a result of the higher sales activity in relative to the previous year 
the cash and investments increase in improved utmd s current ratio to an exceptionally strong through its excellent profitability  the company will continue to internally finance its non cash working capital growth  as well as fixed asset increases  that are needed to support new sales growth 
in  operations should continue to generate after tax cash at a rate in excess of  per month 
b liabilities 
utmd has no long term debt obligations 
current liabilities are growing in conjunction with the increase in expenses associated with higher sales 
the total debt ratio which is made up almost entirely of current liabilities declined to less than 
results of operations 
a revenues 
revenues were up from on a quarter to previous year s quarter basis  revenues were up  respectively    and 
utmd divides revenues into three product line categories critical care  which is comprised primarily of components used in invasive blood pressure monitoring  but also includes components for other types of pressure monitoring  as well as disposable respiratory products used in hospitals  obstetrics  which is comprised mainly of devices for monitoring intrauterine pressure during labor and delivery  although to a lesser extent electrodes for fetal heart rate monitoring as well as other labor and delivery supplies  and a new product which unifies  and improves clinician safety in  the multiple step procedure of cutting  clamping and drawing blood samples from the umbilical cord immediately following childbirth  and gynecology  which is comprised of an electrosurgery system used in a procedure called letz r  tools used in other minimally invasive surgical procedures including diagnostic laparoscopies  and a device for the conservative treatment of urinary incontinence 
in these three areas  utmd s primary revenue contributors generally are the accepted standard of care  enjoy a number one or number two market share  and have important product features protected by patents 
in  utmd will look to expand sales of its new products cordguard r  liberty and lumin which were launched in  as well as introduce other products in its areas of focus including fetal monitoring  electrosurgery and incontinence therapy 
critical care revenues represented of total sales  and declined from in the us  critical care blood pressure monitoring is a mature business dominated by two large suppliers  baxter and abbott 
about a third of the blood pressure monitoring market is for disposable pressure transducers dpt and accessories  and the other two thirds is for catheters 
utmd participates only in the dpt and accessories niche 
overseas  the market is much more fragmented with dpt s still growing in acceptance 
baxter purchased million dpt s from utmd in utmd s baxter oem revenues all of which are included in utmd s critical care category represented of critical care revenues or of total revenues  and declined by in over sales of critical care products in were  compared to  in and  in revenues from baxter in were  compared to  in and  in in and  baxter revenues included no marketing rights  compared to  included in revenues 
the obstetrics revenue category grew in and represented of total sales 
market acceptance for sensor tipped electronic intrauterine pressure iup monitoring dominated by intran r continues to expand  and sales of cordguard began in december 
sales of obstetrics products in were  compared to  in and  in beginning in the third category  gynecology products  includes liberty  a system for conservatively treating urinary incontinence  and lumin  a unique tool used in laparoscopic procedures to manipulate the uterus  in addition to utmd s product line of electrosurgery equipment and disposable electrodes required to perform a cervical neoplasia excision procedure called letz 
gynecology revenues grew in  and represented of total revenues 
gynecology product sales in were  compared to  in and  in utmd s past successes with its gynecology products resulted from providing physician training along with the equipment and tools designed for specific procedures 
other applications for utmd s electrosurgery capabilities offer additional future business opportunities 
effective marketing of the new products launched in represent significant challenges for utmd s marketing resources  and will require innovative distribution approaches 
utmd divides its sales channels into direct and oem channels 
direct sales are sales of utmd s products by its own employed sales representatives  by independent commissioned representatives  or by stocking distributors in a particular geographic region 
oem sales are sales of utmd products by other medical device manufacturers either as a component of a kit  or as a stand alone product into markets not served by utmd s own direct sales resources 
in  direct sales represented about of global sales compared to about in the previous two years 
in the us  direct sales represented of sales compared to in and in dividing global sales into the two channels of direct sales and oem sales for the respective product categories of critical care products  obstetrics products and gynecology products  yields the following split direct sales represented  and  respectively  in compared to   and in and   and in foreign sales were  compared to  in and  in practically all international sales have been critical care products  for which sales the company has relied heavily on the efforts of other medical device companies oem sales channel 
critical care products represented of international sales in compared to in and in sales through baxter represented of international sales in compared to in and in sales through other than baxter oem companies represented of total international sales in compared to in and in utmd believes it has substantial sales potential for its existing products in international markets  and therefore plans to continue to commit its resources to international business expansion 
b gross profit 
gross profit margins profit after subtracting costs of manufacturing products from revenues in were compared to in and in the improvement in average gross profit margin was achieved because of a increase in sales of utmd s ob gyn products  combined with a decrease in sales of utmd s least profitable product  the baxter summit dpt 
the company expects these trends to accelerate in utmd has improved its gross margins as a percentage of sales every year for the last ten years 
in recent years  the improvement has come from improved manufacturing efficiencies and increased direct sales through utmd s own employed representatives in favor of distributors 
because of anticipated faster sales growth in the obstetrics and gynecology product lines which have higher margins relative to utmd s other products  and because of declining business with baxter  the company foresees continued gross margin improvements 
c operating profit 
operating profits  or income from operations  are the profits achieved after subtracting operating expenses from gross profits 
operating expenses are subdivided into sales  general and administrative sg a expenses and research and development r d expenses 
utmd further divides sg a into the two categories of sales and marketing s m expenses and general and administrative g a expenses 
in  operating profits increased to  from  in  and compared to  in operating expenses declined to of sales in compared to in and in the reason for the improvement in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was the fact that sg a expenses declined from of revenues to of revenues 
the g a expenses portion declined from million in to million in due to the company s internal cost control programs  and continued tight management of legal costs 
in g a expenses as a percentage of sales are expected to increase as a result of starting up new ireland operations 
utmd s s m expenses pertain primarily to the direct sales portion of its business see previous page 
global direct sales increased in while s m expenses increased only  producing financial leverage in the use of s m resources 
during  the company shut down its independent sales office in holland  anticipating integrating the direct international sales and sales support effort into its new ireland operations in because of anticipated sales growth coming mainly from direct sales  and anticipating continued declining oem sales through baxter  s m expenses as a percentage of sales are expected to increase 
r d expenses were of sales compared to and in and  respectively 
r d expenses increased over  which had increased over as a measure of its product development activity  utmd made eleven new product approval k premarketing submissions to the fda in and  in contrast to only one in the previous three years 
the company employs its r d resources not only to internally develop its own new product ideas  but also  through joint development agreements  licensing of technology  acquisitions and other arrangements  to enhance and complete to commercialization projects initiated by others 
growth of r d expenses as a percentage of sales will not continue in as utmd expects to realize the benefit of its recent investment in r d in the form of new product sales 
d non operating income 
non operating income for utmd includes principally royalties from licensing utmd s technology to other companies  interest and capital gains from investing the company s cash  and gains losses from the sale of other assets 
non operating income increased  in from the increase was due to increased investment income from higher average cash balances in royalties remained about the same as the prior year 
non operating income in was substantially higher than either or because of two major one time items in sale of the paragraph product line to vital signs  inc for a net gain of about  and about  in capital gains realized from shifting cash investments from longer term to shorter term securities 
assuming interest rates remain about the same as  and given that no extraordinary investment opportunities arise that are presently unknown  investment income on cash balances should be about the same as since planned investments in new facilities  equipment and tooling  intangible assets  and share repurchases will be funded from cash generated from operations 
royalties received vary from period to period depending on the desire and or success of other companies in selling products licensed by utmd 
royalties in should remain about the same as  except for an extraordinary payment in the first quarter related to the use of utmd s pressure monitoring technology 
e earnings before income taxes 
earnings before income taxes ebit result from adding utmd s non operating income to its operating profits 
in  ebit  as a percentage of sales  were compared to and in and  respectively 
gross margin improvements  lower operating expenses as a percentage of sales  and higher non operating income as a percentage of sales all contributed to the improved ebit ratio 
f net income and earnings per share 
net after tax income is ebit less income taxes 
utmd s net income ranks in the top tier of all us publicly traded companies at  and of revenues for  and  respectively 
shareholder value is improved by increasing eps 
eps is net income divided by the number of shares of stock outstanding fully diluted to include stock options awarded which have exercise prices below the current market value 
future eps can be increased by investing current net income to increase future net profits through expanded marketable new product offerings and profitable business operations  or also by repurchasing stock from the marketplace  thereby reducing the number of outstanding shares 
return on shareholders equity roe is the portion of net income retained by utmd to internally finance its eps growth  divided by average accumulated shareholders equity during the period 
the roe ratio determines how fast the company can grow without any external financing 
for example  a roe would support growth in revenues 
achieving growth in revenues and eps without diluting shareholder interests maximizes shareholders value 
roe in was almost  and has averaged over for the last years 
it is management s objective to retain roe in excess of the per annum eps growth target 
external equity financing would only be considered if an exceptional business growth opportunity presents itself that would allow long term increased eps at the same time that the number of shares are also expanded 
after income taxes  net income was  a new record for the company  compared to  in and  in the effective income tax rate in was compared to in and in year to year fluctuations in the tax rate have resulted from the use of a foreign sales corporation  differing balances in tax exempt securities investments  and differing numbers of exercised employee options which result in a tax benefit to the company 
fully diluted eps were up to 
compared to 
in eps were up from 
in year ending weighted average number of common shares assuming full dilution the number used to calculate fully diluted eps were  shares compared to  and  in and  respectively 
actual outstanding common shares as of december  were  primary diluted eps were 
compared to 
in and 
in the difference in primary diluted versus fully diluted eps occurred as a result of the rapid increase in market price per share of utmd s stock in  ending at a price of per share  a new year end high in the history of the company  and an increase of from the ending price of per share 
in contrast  the dow jones industrial average increased  the s p index increased  the nasdaq composite index increased  and the mddi index of medical device companies increased in cash flows and capital resources 
cash and investment balances were million at the end of  an increase of million from december   primarily due to accumulation of cash from profitable operations 
cash provided by operating activities  including adjustments for depreciation and other non cash operating expenses  along with changes in working capital  totaled  in  up from  in  and  in depreciation and amortization in increased by about  to more than million  due to recent investments in facilities and improved manufacturing capabilities  as well as amortization of acquired patents and licensing rights 
cash of  was used for capital expenditures in property and equipment 
 was used for the purchase of intangible assets  principally new patent filings 
remaining investing activities were the purchases and sales of investments which reduced cash by a net  in capital expenditures that occurred during will help the company maintain its competitive position and provide the cost effectiveness needed to support growth in new markets 
projects included i the first  investment  principally in land  for the new ireland manufacturing facility  ii the completion of phase i of assembly automation of deltran r  the company s dpt product which enjoys a dominant worldwide market share  in the amount of  in addition to amounts previously invested in  iii enhancements to the computer system  new in  of about  which has begun to enhance utmd s ability to responsively communicate with customers  provide timely and accurate manufacturing information  and streamline distribution capabilities  and iv about  to maintain and continuously upgrade pre existing facilities  equipment and tooling 
in  capital expenditures for property and equipment are planned in the following areas completion of the  square foot facility shell and first phase  square foot fit out of the ireland manufacturing facility  continued automation of key assembly operations  investment in tooling and equipment for manufacturing new products  and continued maintenance and upgrading of existing assets 
financing activities used cash of  compared to  in  and  in stock repurchases continued to comprise by far the largest use of cash from all categories 
after paying out  during for cash dividends to shareholders  in january the board of directors discontinued the dividend in favor of continued stock repurchases 
the company repurchased its own common stock during in the amount of  compared to  and  in and  respectively 
in the three years of through  utmd has invested  in repurchasing  of its common shares 
in  utmd received  from the issuance of  shares of stock due to exercises of employee options 
in the three years of through  the company has issued  new shares previously awarded under option plans  for which it has received  utmd did not enter into any long term debt agreements in management believes that current cash balances plus future income from operations will provide the liquidity needed to finance growth plans 
in addition to the capital expenditures outlined above  utmd plans to use cash in for continued share repurchases and for selective infusions of technological  marketing or product manufacturing rights to broaden the company s product offerings 
management s outlook 
the trends in utmd s business which became more apparent to outside investors during  namely  rapid growth in ob gyn product sales through direct sales channels  and decline in blood pressure monitoring component sales through baxter and other oems  should both accelerate in as a result  management expects total sales will grow modestly or may remain about the same  depending the impact of lower sales to baxter  while gross profit margins  net profits and eps should continue to grow  similar to the performance demonstrated in despite the baxter negative sales trend  with the soundness of utmd s market position in critical care applications for disposable pressure transducers  management believes its critical care product offerings will remain an important contributor to the company s overall profitability  especially internationally with the start up of a new manufacturing facility in ireland 
revenues from fetal monitoring fm should continue to grow at a good rate  especially if utmd s product enhancements and clinical outcomes programs successfully identify important driving influences for the use of proprietary fm products 
the addition of new products  such as cordguard  using existing sales resources will provide significant distribution leverage 
utmd s growing number of gynecology practice tools will leverage its sales opportunities to physicians outside of the hospital 
for example  liberty  which addresses a massively prevalent and under diagnosed disease state in women  is just a beginning in a potentially broad incontinence product line family 
in addition  the company s competence in electrosurgery should lead to new market opportunities in other clinical areas where a specialized approach will provide excellent benefits 
clearly  the global healthcare market s recognition  adoption and ultimate purchase at a reasonable price of utmd s new ob gyn product solutions are the most important factors in management s growth projections 
utmd will continue to position itself in specialized high value added market niches and license its product ideas in recognized commodity product markets to larger marketing companies 
the value of utmd s technology to other medical device companies should continue to enhance shareholder returns 
a number of the forward looking factors discussed in this filing are subject to a high degree of uncertainty  particularly in light of the company s high growth objectives and a rapidly changing healthcare environment 
investors are encouraged to consider all of these factors in that actual results may differ materially from those projected by management 
accounting policy changes in october  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
encourages  but does not require  companies to adopt the fair value method defined by this standard for fiscal years beginning after december  companies are permitted to continue to account for such transactions under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb no 
 but must  in future years  disclose in a note to the financial statements proforma net income and earnings per share as if sfas no 
had been applied 
the company has determined it will not adopt the fair value method  and therefore will continue to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb no 
effective january  the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
under sfas no 
 the company s investments are classified as available for sale which results in an adjustment to stockholders equity for unrealized gains and losses
