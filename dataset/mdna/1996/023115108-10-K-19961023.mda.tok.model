these include  among others  successful and timely development and acceptance of new products  the availability of sufficient funding to complete development of new products and other factors described below 
in addition  such risks and uncertainties also include the matters identified under the heading risk factors below 
overview on november   icot corporation  based in san jose  california  and amati communications corporation old amati  a privately held mountain view  california based company  completed a merger by which old amati became a wholly owned subsidiary of icot corporation 
effective as of the merger  the name of the surviving company was changed to amati communications corporation the company and its common stock began trading on the nasdaq national market under the symbol amtx on november  under the terms of the merger agreement with old amati  the shareholders  warrant holders and option holders of old amati acquired  newly issued shares of the company s stock  representing approximately of the fully diluted shares of the company 
as of the merger date  old amati employed twenty four full time employees  including four in manufacturing  two in sales and customer support  fifteen in engineering and three in finance and administration 
old amati was a development stage company that developed and marketed advanced transmission systems utilizing discrete multi tone dmt technology to provide high speed transmission over copper and cable media 
old amati s dmt technology has been selected as the ansi and etsi standard for asymmetric digital subscriber line adsl products 
the company is a leading developer of advanced transmission equipment utilizing discrete multi tone dmt technology for the adsl  very high speed digital subscriber line vdsl and cable modem markets 
the company is the holder of adsl dmt patents and has licensed the technology to companies such as nortel  motorola and nec 
the company is also a provider of network connectivity systems for the internetworking and oem marketplaces highlights of the fiscal year announced key strategic technology development partnerships with motorola and nec for the next generation xdsl technologies 
delivered a new family of overture adsl dmt modems for field testing  further increasing the company s leadership position in the technology 
these new modems are the first to provide data transmission rates as high as mbps downstream and kbps upstream 
introduced an mbps adsl modem which provides direct ethernet connectivity 
selected to participate in a significant number of new adsl market trials including the gte microsoft adsl trial in redmond  wa  the gte internet access trial in dallas  tx  the bezeq israel telecom video on demand vod trial in israel  the swiss telecom ptt interactive video trial in switzerland and the telstra broadcast quality video trial in australia 
results of operations fiscal year vs fiscal year total net sales in fiscal rose slightly to  from sales in the previous fiscal year of  sales to ibm accounted for of the company s revenue in fiscal compared with in fiscal royalty revenues during fiscal year of  continue to be derived from a product developed by the company for ibm in fiscal although dependence on one dominant customer has been reduced since the merger  the company expects that ibm will continue to account for a substantial portion of the company s revenues until the company completes development and commercialization of its adsl products 
ibm is not obligated to purchase any specified amounts of products or to provide binding forecasts of product purchases for any period 
since ibm considers product sales and market data confidential  the company has very little ability to forecast future demand 
furthermore  since ibm has the exclusive responsibility for marketing and selling the products that the company develops  results of operations can be significantly affected by ibm s success in the marketplace 
since november  the company began shipping its overture series of transceivers 
the overture is a prototype that does not have a low enough cost or power consumption for mass deployment and its components are entirely discrete off the shelf 
this product is to be phased out in favor of the next series of transceiver  called overture in the third quarter of fiscal  the company delivered the overture  which is characterized by a high bandwidth as defined by the ansi standards 
this product is currently installed in its first field trial of broadcast video in australia 
sales in fiscal of overture and overture series field trials were  and  respectively 
in addition  contract revenues of  from customization of products were also realized in fiscal the company anticipates that the overture series of products will continue to be represented at international field trials in fiscal pc to mainframe connectivity sales of  in fiscal represents a decline of when compared with the same period of the prior fiscal year due to a general decline in the company s connectivity market share 
the pc to mainframe connectivity market is highly competitive and is characterized by rapid advances in technology which frequently result in the introduction of new products with improved performance characteristics  thereby subjecting the company s products to risk of technological obsolescence 
the company competes directly or indirectly with a broad range of companies  many of whom have significantly greater resources 
in addition  the company is competing for a limited and declining segment of the market 
gross margins as a percent of sales were in fiscal compared with for the same period of fiscal the decline in margin was primarily attributable to product mix resulting from shipment of new products to ibm and costs to complete test trials of the overture series of transceivers 
amortization of capitalized software costs charged to cost of sales were  in fiscal and  in fiscal net research and development expenses increased to  in fiscal when compared to the same period of fiscal largely because of the addition as a result of the merger of fifteen old amati engineers and the hiring of new employees 
higher costs in fiscal are primarily due to the introduction of the company s new family of overture adsl dmt modems and overture access system shelf products 
from the technology acquired in the merger  the company believes it has a technological leadership position in dmt modulation 
maintaining this position is largely dependent on the company s ability to develop new products that meet a wide range of customer needs 
research and development efforts for the dmt technology are grouped into three areas the microelectronics group which is primarily focused on adsl and vdsl markets  the software group  which is primarily focused on the development of firmware for the overture series  and the hardware group  which is primarily focused on analog and digital design activities 
all research and development expenses related to this technology are charged to operations as incurred 
expenses are net of funded development costs from ibm 
funded development costs for fiscal were  compared to  in fiscal there was no capitalization of software development costs in either fiscal year 
the company considers research and development a key element in its ability to compete and will continue to make investments in product development and support for ibm 
marketing and sales expenses rose to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal due to an increase in overseas travel in conjunction with overture series participation in field trials internationally 
sales  marketing and customer support operations of the acquired business  which cover both domestic and international markets  is handled by five individuals 
the company s strategy is to sell to telephone companies worldwide through large telecommunication suppliers who will integrate the company s products into larger systems for their customers 
this type of oem selling does not require a large sales force 
general and administrative expenses increased to  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal this is primarily due to patent expenses  additional corporate staffing  and occupancy costs associated with the merger 
interest income decreased to  in fiscal compared to  in the same period of fiscal due to maturities of held to maturity investments 
the provision for income taxes in fiscal was  compared to  in fiscal tax provisions were required for federal alternative minimum tax and california state taxes due to limitations on the use of california s loss carryforwards 
the company had provided a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset attributable to the net operating losses due to uncertainties regarding the realization of these assets 
fiscal year vs 
fiscal year total net sales in fiscal increased to  compared to sales of  in fiscal the increase is a result of shipments to the company s largest oem customer  ibm  of products introduced into the market in fiscal in addition  royalty revenues of  were recognized in fiscal from another new product developed by the company and released by ibm in july revenues from ibm accounted for of the company s revenue in fiscal  compared with in fiscal  due to royalties and the introduction of new products 
sales to ibm are uncertain due to its transition to new products 
shipments to ibm are determined only by ibm and can result in revenue fluctuations 
ibm can cancel its agreement with the company at any time without penalty upon days notice 
ibm continues to account for a substantial portion of the company s revenues and  consequently  the company s business continues to be volatile due to its dependence on a dominant customer 
because ibm has the exclusive responsibility for marketing and selling of the products that the company develops for ibm  its profitability can be significantly affected by ibm s success in the marketplace 
pc to mainframe connectivity sales of  in fiscal represent a decline of from  for the prior fiscal due to decreased royalties received from an oem customer and to a general decline in the company s connectivity market share 
gross margins as a percent of sales were for fiscal compared with for the same period of fiscal the decrease in margins was primarily attributable to product mix resulting from shipment of new products with lower margins in the current fiscal year 
amortization of capitalized software costs charged to cost of sales were  in fiscal there was no amortization expense in the comparable period of the prior fiscal year 
net research and development expenses increased to  of sales in fiscal compared to  of sales in fiscal research and development expenses are net of software development costs capitalized in accordance with sfas no 
and of funded development costs 
during fiscal there was no capitalization of software development costs  resulting in higher expenses for the year 
software development costs capitalized in the prior fiscal year were  funded development costs for fiscal were  compared with  in the comparable period of fiscal the company believes that research and development is a key element in its ability to compete and will continue to make investments in product development and support 
marketing and sales expenses decreased to  of sales in fiscal compared to  of sales in fiscal  due to a reduction in sales staff and related office expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to  of sales in fiscal as compared to  of sales in fiscal  with the addition of corporate planning and development personnel 
interest income increased to  in fiscal compared to  in the same period of fiscal this increase is primarily due to higher interest yields on short term investments and likewise includes interest of  on secured promissory notes receivable from old amati 
the provision for income taxes in fiscal was  compared to  in fiscal this provision was a result of net operating profit after benefit of federal net operating loss carryforwards 
fiscal and tax provisions were required for federal alternative minimum tax and california state taxes due to limitations on the use of california s loss carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources the company had cash and short term investments of  as of july   compared to  as of july  cash used for operating activities of  resulted primarily from the company s net loss after adjusting for the write off of acquired in process research and development 
cash used for investing activities of  was primarily for advances to old amati and acquisition costs of  as offset by the proceeds from sale of held to maturity investments of  cash provided by financing activities of  was derived primarily from the proceeds of stock options exercised 
during fiscal  the company secured a bank line of credit for  and a capital lease line of  in october  the company entered into an investment agreement with certain investors the investors which provides to the company up to million in equity financing 
in a related transaction  the company borrowed  from the investors  which is secured by all of the company s intellectual property 
the company intends to repay this loan upon completion of the financing 
the company s ability to meet its future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including sales levels  progress in research and development programs  the establishment of collaborative agreements  and costs of manufacturing facilities and commercialization activities 
while the company anticipates that the funding available under the line of credit  capital lease line and investment agreement will be sufficient to meet its capital requirements for the foreseeable future  the company may require funding in addition to that available under these agreements  and may seek additional funding through collaborative agreements or through public or private sale of securities prior to the commercialization of old amati products 
the company had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of july  risk factors the information about the company included or incorporated by reference herein contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  including the risks detailed below 
the shares of common stock offered hereby involve a high degree of risk and prospective purchasers should carefully consider the following factors 
history of losses 
the company had net income in the fiscal year ended july  of approximately  and had a net loss in the fiscal year ended july  of approximately  including a charge related to the merger of approximately 
due in part to the merger  the company is not expected to operate profitably in the foreseeable future as the company continues research  development  production and marketing activities 
there can be no assurance that the company will ever attain profitability 
any long term viability  profitability and growth from the company technology will depend upon successful commercialization of products resulting from its research and product development activities 
extensive additional research and development will be required prior to commercialization of certain products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to develop commercially viable products from its technology  generate significant revenues and or achieve profitability 
need for additional capital 
during  the company secured a line of credit for  and a capital lease line of  and entered into an investment agreement with the investors  which provides to the company up to million in equity financing 
in a related transaction  the company borrowed  from the investors  which is secured by all of the company s intellectual property 
the company intends to repay this loan upon completion of the financing 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including sales levels  progress in research and development programs  the establishment of collaborative agreements  and costs of manufacturing facilities and commercialization activities 
the company may require funding in addition to that available under its line of credit  capital lease line and the investment agreement 
there can be no assurance that such additional funding will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if additional funds are required and not available  the company could be required to curtail significantly or defer  temporarily or permanently  one or more of its research ad development programs or to obtain funds through arrangements that may require the company to relinquish certain technology or product rights 
market for adsl products still under development  principal adsl market outside of the united states 
adsl was developed to transmit digital video over copper wire and also has application in providing access to the internet over copper wire 
although the current infrastructure in the local distribution networks of telephone companies is based on copper wire  there can be no assurance that telephone companies will pursue the deployment of adsl systems or  if deployment occurs  as to the volume and timing of such deployment 
significant deployment may be prevented or delayed by a number of factors  including cost  regulatory barriers  lack of programming content  lack of consumer demand and the availability of alternative technologies 
access systems with high performance broadband capability  such as the adsl system  may be attractive to telephone companies only to the extent that the telephone companies plan to offer broadcast video  video on demand or internet access services which utilize the full features of a high performance local distribution network 
substantial amounts of time  effort and money will be required to develop such high performance services 
there can be no assurance that sufficient programming content for video services will be developed to justify deploying digital video transmission systems  or that programming content will be both attractive to consumers and offered at prices that will create a mass market 
if such high performances services are offered  and there is demand for them  there can be no assurance that telephone companies will select adsl over competing technologies  such as fiber to the curb  hybrid fiber coaxial hfc  and wireless communications 
fiber to the curb  hfc and wireless systems have greater bandwidth than the adsl products being developed by the company 
although internet access services may provide a market for adsl in the united states  because foreign telephone companies currently face less competition from cable companies than telephone companies face in the united states  the company believes that its principal markets for adsl video applications will be outside the united states 
price competitiveness of adsl products 
the company believes that in order to design and manufacture commercially acceptable adsl products  cost improvements beyond those available with current technology will be necessary 
the future success of the company will depend  in part  on it ability to develop adsl products that compete effectively on the basis of price and performance 
current prices are significantly higher than those that the company believes would be necessary for mass deployment of adsl products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing adsl products that can be sold at prices which are viable in the market 
rapid technological change  competition in the telecommunication transmission business 
competition from existing companies  including major communications companies  is expected to increase 
most of the company s competitors in the communications industry are more established  benefit from greater market recognition and have greater financial  technical  production and marketing resources than the company 
some competitors are developing alternate access technologies  such as hfc  fiber to curb and wireless systems  that may prove technologically superior or more cost effective than the company s technology 
there can be no assurance that developments by others will not render the company s products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive or that the company will be able to keep pace with new technological developments 
competition in the pc to mainframe connectivity business 
the pc to mainframe connectivity market is highly competitive and is characterized by rapid advances in technology which frequently result in the introduction of new products with improved performance characteristics  thereby subjecting the company s products to the risk of technological obsolescence 
the company s ability to compete is dependent on several factors  including reliability  product performance  quality  features  distribution channels  name awareness  customer support  product development capabilities  and the ability to meet delivery schedules 
the company competes  directly or indirectly  with a broad range of companies in the pc connectivity business  many of whom have significantly greater financial and other resources 
in addition  the company is only competing for a limited and declining segment of the pc connectivity market  which is itself declining and expected to continue to decline 
the company expects revenues from its pc connectivity business to continue to decline 
competition for vdsl standards 
the company expects to apply its dmt technology to the development of vdsl products for the transmission of digital video service in connection with a fiber optic backbone to cover the distance from this platform or node to subscribers homes over copper wire or coaxial cable 
ansi has not yet awarded the standard for vdsl technology  and the competition for the american national standards institute ansi standard for vdsl is expected to be intense 
at t  as well as other companies with greater resources than the company  are expected to compete for these standards 
there is no assurance that the company s dmt technology will be successful in obtaining the ansi vdsl standard 
dependence on complementary products 
widespread use of adsl and vdsl products for digital video service will depend on the commercial availability of other products and components  including the video content  digital switches  video servers  encode decode equipment  and set top boxes in subscribers homes 
there can be no assurance that other suppliers will develop and market these complementary components effectively or that these components  when combined with the company s adsl and vdsl products  will be a cost effective means of transmitting video on demand or video dialtone 
dependence on large customers and system integrators 
the company expects to sell many of its telecommunication transmission products to large telecommunications service companies which serve as integrators for the various component systems that make up a video on demand or multimedia system 
these systems integrators in turn sell the systems to telephone companies for distribution to their subscribers 
the company is largely dependent on these systems integrators for the introduction of its products to field trials 
there can be no assurance that systems integrators will select the company s products for field trials or  if they do initially select the company s products  that they will continue to use them 
in addition  telephone companies are generally reluctant to deploy new technologies available only from a single source  especially when the supplier is as relatively small as the company  and often require the availability of alternative sources before deploying a new technology 
this reluctance may put the company at a competitive disadvantage relative to some of its competitors 
further  acceptance of the company s products by these customers may require the company to relinquish rights to its technology or products 
there can be no assurance  however  that even if the company were to relinquish such rights to its technology or products  telephone companies would deploy the company s adsl or vdsl products 
customer concentration  reliance on sales to ibm 
sales to ibm for pc to mainframe connectivity and related products accounted for approximately  and of the company s net sales in fiscal  and  respectively and for the nine months ended april  since ibm considers product sales and market data confidential  the company has very little ability to anticipate future demands and ibm is not obligated to purchase any specified amount of products 
for its pc connectivity products  the company is highly dependent on sales to ibm and expects that quarterly and annual results could be volatile due to its dependence on this dominant customer 
in addition  there can be no assurance that ibm will continue to distribute and support the company s products 
the company s principal contract with ibm expires in december further  ibm may terminate its agreements with the company upon days notice without a significant penalty 
international business 
the company expects that sales outside of the united states will represent a significant portion of its future sales  especially of the company s adsl products 
operations outside of the united states are subject to various risks  including exposure to currency fluctuations  the imposition of governmental controls  the need to comply with a wide variety of foreign and united states export laws  political and economic instability  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs and taxes  and longer payment cycles typically associated with international sales 
the inability of the company to design products to comply with foreign standards or any significant or prolonged delay in the company s international sales could have a material adverse effect on the company s future business and results of operations 
regulatory matters 
telephone companies  which constitute the initial primary market for the company s telecommunication transmission products  and cable television companies  which may become a future market for such products  are subject to extensive regulation by both the federal and state governments in the united states and by foreign governments 
many of these regulations have the effect of limiting the economic incentive of telephone companies to deploy new technologies 
restrictions on telephone companies and cable television companies may materially and adversely affect demand for the products of the company 
recent legislation passed by congress will significantly alter the regulations on telephone companies and cable companies in the united states  and there can be no assurance that such legislation will not adversely affect the commercialization of the company s products 
in addition  both in the united states and abroad  rates for telecommunications services are governed by tariffs or licensed carriers that are subject to regulatory approval 
these tariffs also could have a material adverse affect on the demand for the company s products 
dependence on suppliers and third party manufacturers 
certain key components in the company s products  such as integrated circuits  are currently available only from single sources 
the company does not have any long term supply contracts with its sole source vendors and purchases these components on a purchase order basis 
in addition  certain components and subassemblies for the company s products have long lead times 
while the company seeks to accurately forecast its requirements  inaccuracies in its forecast could result in shortages or oversupplies of these components 
the inability to obtain sufficient quantities of sole source components or subassemblies as required  or to develop alternative sources as required in the future  or inaccuracies in forecasts for long lead time components or subassemblies could result in delays or reductions in product shipments or product redesigns which would materially and adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  increases in the prices of components for which the company does not have alternate sources could materially and adversely affect the company s operating results 
the company intends to outsource a portion of its manufacturing operations to independent third party manufacturers 
there are risks associated with the use of independent manufacturers  including unavailability of or delays in obtaining adequate supplies of products and reduced control of manufacturing quality and production costs 
there can be no assurance that the company s third party manufacturers will provide adequate supplies of quality products on a timely basis 
the inability to obtain such products on a timely basis would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
patents and trade secrets 
there can be no assurance that any patents owned or controlled by the company will provide commercially significant protection of the company s technology or ensure that the company may not be determined to infringe valid patents of others 
the company s patents have not been tested in court  and the validity and scope of the company s proprietary rights could be challenged 
the company has also received foreign patents  but since the patent laws of foreign countries differ from those of the united states  the degree of protection afforded by any foreign patents may be different from that available under us patent laws 
the company also relies on trade secrets and proprietary know how which it seeks to protect by confidentiality agreements with its collaborators  employees and consultants 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that the company will have adequate remedies for any breach or that the company s trade secrets and proprietary know how will not otherwise become known or be discovered by competitors 
the company s rsi lawsuit 
the company is a defendant in a suit brought in november alleging repetitive stress injuries rsi resulting from the use of the company s products claiming million in compensatory and million in punitive damages 
the company has tendered defense of the suit to its insurance carriers  but there can be no assurance that the suit will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of the company 
possible volatility of stock price  shares eligible for future sale 
the market price of the company s common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile 
future events  many of which will be beyond the control of the company  as well as announcements related to technology and product development and collaborative arrangements and expected quarterly fluctuations in revenues and financial results  may have a significant impact on the market price of the company s common stock 
future sales of shares by the investors which is a party for the investment agreement or by other current stockholders and by option holders and warrant holders who exercise the company stock options or warrants could have a depressive effect on the market price of the company s common stock
