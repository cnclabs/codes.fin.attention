item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere in the form k 
overview the company posted net income of  one cent per share on sales of  in compared to net income of  cents per share on sales of  in the decline in net income in from the prior year was primarily due to the continued difficulty in turning around the company s uniflow unit see segment review below 
although uniflow was able to secure various long term sales orders during that are scheduled to ramp up in and  overall sales declined in from although sales decreased  operating expenses increased as a percentage of sales  resulting in a loss in at uniflow 
the company s tooling segment sales were lower primarily related to the downsizing of triple tool  which was absorbed into form flow s operation in late fiscal the tooling segment posted another profitable year  although net income was slightly lower than effective november   the company acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of the varitykelsey hayes vkh milford  michigan machining operation and its continuing business 
assets acquired were machinery and equipment  with an estimated fair market value of million  real estate and building  with an estimated fair market value of million  and inventories valued at approximately million  as well as various environmental indemnifications and supply commitments with values yet undetermined 
in exchange for the assets acquired  the company paid approximately million in consideration  as follows million cash at closing  the assumption of certain employee pension and retiree health care obligations  preliminarily estimated at million and  approximately  for additional inventories and equipment added to the location before the transaction closing 
the milford operation was renamed milford manufacturing corporation mmc and constitutes a third secom business segment production machining 
the company anticipates the unit to be profitable in fiscal with sales expected to exceed million 
the company s other two business segments are metal parts forming uniflow and tooling form flow  l h and micanol 
results of operations metal parts forming segment chart of three year comparative operating results in thousands amount amount amount net sales    gross profit    operating expense    operating profit loss the metal parts forming segment is comprised of the company s uniflow unit 
uniflow currently manufactures suspension ball joint housings  truck wheel fasteners  transmission shaft parts and a variety of oem cold formed and forged parts 
customers are primarily automotive and trucking related original equipment manufacturers oem and service part manufacturers after market 
net sales decreased in from  and increased in from the sales decrease in from primarily reflects lower order volume for uniflow s after market truck wheel studs and suspension ball joint housings and  additional sales in the prior year from deliveries made on a significant past due sales backlog of approximately million 
the decrease in uniflow s after market component parts business is attributable to an overall slowness in the trucking after market business  the loss of certain business by uniflow s customers and the resourcing of various parts to competitors 
management does not anticipate further deterioration in after market related sales 
to replace the lower sales  management has been seeking new business for its cold forging press and cold forming header production capacity 
through those efforts  uniflow secured an order to supply starter motor shafts for six years  shipments of  are expected in fiscal  million in and approximately million annually for the remainder of this six year contract 
the parts will be formed on uniflow s national fx parts former and machined at the company s newly acquired mmc unit 
uniflow also has tentatively received an order to manufacture transmission shaft parts  with shipments anticipated to start in early  sales over million are expected in fiscal and could exceed million in sales of airbag housings  for which first shipments were made in august  are expected to exceed million in gross profit on sales was in  in and in the decline in gross profit reflects the lower sales volume and less efficient production 
management is in the process of implementing various operating techniques designed to improve uniflow s manufacturing efficiency and gross profit 
in particular  management is emphasizing improvements in production planning and preparation to reduce production costs 
management is also in the early stages of implementing a quality system in compliance with qs and a computerized information system that will provide on line shop floor production and financial data 
incremental sales increases that are expected to commence throughout fiscal should improve the gross profit 
operating expense as a percentage of sales was in  in and in the percentage fluctuation was largely due to the varying sales level 
actual operating overhead expense in was million  down from million in in  operating expense increased from level of million  due primarily to increased engineering  product quality expense and the direct allocation of certain administrative expenses previously shown as unallocated corporate expense 
management does not expect its operating expense level to change significantly in from uniflow s profit loss from operations was  of sales in   of sales in and  of sales in the profit decrease in from reflects the lower sales volume and higher costs of production 
the profit increase in from primarily reflects the higher sales level 
management expects uniflow s operating profit to improve with sales increases and with the implementation of production efficiencies 
tooling segment chart of three year comparable operating results in thousands amount amount amount net sales    gross profit    operating expense    operating profit loss    before elimination of intercompany sales 
the tooling segment is comprised of the form flow  l h and micanol units 
the triple unit was downsized and absorbed into form flow s operation in june the tooling units sell tools and dies for use in the production of hot and cold formed metal parts 
net sales decreased in compared to and increased in compared to the sales decrease from is primarily due to the downsizing of triple tool  which posted sales of million in  and lower sales at micanol in  resulting from lower order demand from some of its customers 
the sales increase over was the result of higher sales at form flow  l h and micanol  although triple recorded lower sales 
gross profit on sales was in  in and in the gross profit percentage was comparable with  while the decline in percentage in from primarily reflected unfavorable operating results at the triple unit 
operating expense as a percentage of sales was in  in and in the increases in and reflect higher personnel expense and the direct allocation of certain expenses previously unallocated at the corporate level 
the tooling segment s operating profit was  of sales in   of sales in and  of sales in the decline in operating profit in from principally resulted from lower profits at form flow  l h and micanol  offset by the reduction of triple s operating loss 
in the previous year  form flow realized higher profits on various special tooling development projects from certain customers 
the decline in operating profit in from was principally related to lower sales volume from various higher margin customer accounts 
management is seeking to maintain higher machine utilization and higher value added tooling orders to improve its gross margin and operating profit 
corporate expenses unallocated corporate overhead was  in   in and  in the reductions in unallocated corporate expense in and from reflect the direct allocation of certain expenses that relate to the respective operating units  as well as lower insurance and other administrative costs 
interest expense  miscellaneous income and income taxes interest expense was  in   in and  in the decline in interest expense in from resulted from lower average borrowing and lower average interest rates for the year 
lower borrowings resulted in part from the exercise of stock warrants that provided million of equity to the company and refinancing certain of its debt agreements 
interest expense increased in from primarily due to increased borrowing for the additions of capital equipment 
other income expense was  in   in and  in the income in reflected settlement of debts at less than recorded values associated with tri tec 
income tax expense benefit was  in   in and  in the income tax benefit in was the result of the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards against taxable income and the reversal of portions of the valuation allowance in anticipation of future use of net operating loss carryforwards 
financial condition the company s working capital position   at september   improved significantly during from  at september  the working capital increase primarily resulted from a refinancing of long term debt  as excess proceeds of approximately million from new long term debt were used to reduce short term borrowings and the exercise of stock purchase warrants that provided million in additional equity  proceeds of which were also used to reduce short term borrowings 
scheduled debt payments due in fiscal total approximately million and management believes that internally generated cash from operations and amounts available on bank lines of credit will provide sufficient cash flow to cover the scheduled debt payments as well as fund continuing working capital requirements 
cash flows for  and are summarized as follows cash flows from operating activities    cash flows used in investing activities    cash flows from used in financing activities    cash flows from operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities were  in before changes in working capital items and discontinued operations  compared to  in and  in working capital items used  in  as inventories rose million  partially offset by lower accounts receivable and higher accrued liabilities 
inventories in rose principally at uniflow  largely in connection with the timing of customer orders 
in  working capital items used  primarily the result of higher accounts receivable and prepaid items  along with lower accounts payable 
in  working capital items used  primarily associated with higher tooling inventories and reduced trade payables 
cash flows used in investing activities in  the company made capital expenditures that totaled  primarily for machinery at uniflow associated with the manufacture of starter motor shaft parts 
in this regard  the company has committed to the acquisition of approximately million of capital equipment 
the equipment is scheduled for delivery and installation in mid in  capital expenditures were  principally for a refurbished hydraulic press dedicated for airbag housing production and form flow s expansion of its die repair business  which included the acquisition of a new facility and additional grinding equipment 
in  capital expenditures of  were primarily for production tooling at uniflow and miscellaneous equipment at the other units 
the company received  in   in and  in  from the disposals of machinery and equipment 
the disposals for all three years principally relate to the reduction of equipment base at the triple unit 
cash flows from financing activities cash flows provided by used in financing activities were  in   in and  in in  the company completed a major debt refinancing of its existing assets and secured million in industrial development bond financing to fund new equipment purchases associated with new sales orders 
the refinancing included a million note with a bank finance company due in six years  a real estate mortgage of million due in years  and a million collateralized bank line of credit  of which million is a committed revolver that expires in the refinancing provided excess cash of approximately million  which was used to reduce borrowings on the bank line of credit
