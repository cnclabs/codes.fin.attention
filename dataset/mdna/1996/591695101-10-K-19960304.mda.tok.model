the acquisition of actava and sterling has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition 
as a result of the reverse acquisition  the historical financial statements of the company for periods prior to the november mergers are the combined financial statements of orion and miti  rather than actava s 
the operations of actava and sterling have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements from november   the date of acquisition

the company intends to dispose its investment in roadmaster during snapper and roadmaster are included in the consolidated financial statements of the company as assets held for sale 
the company is presently evaluating new opportunities and strategies for enhancing stockholder value 
as discussed above  the company has entered into definitive agreements to acquire alliance and goldwyn and has signed a letter of intent to acquire mpca 
see item business recent developments 
the acquisition of alliance will enable mig to expand its entertainment group by entering the music distribution business and providing mig with proprietary music product which it owns or otherwise controls through license or distribution agreements 
the acquisition of goldwyn will provide mig with a valuable library of over film and television titles  including numerous hollywood classics and more critically acclaimed recent films 
goldwyn also owns a leading specialized theatre circuit of theatres with screens 
the acquisition of mpca will enhance the entertainment group s ability to produce and acquire new film product 
the acquisitions of alliance  goldwyn and mpca are important steps in mig s plan to enhance its role as a leading global entertainment  media and communications company 
consummation of the alliance and goldwyn mergers and the mpca acquisition are each subject to various conditions described above in item business recent developments 
in addition  the company intends to pursue a strategy of making selective acquisitions of attractive entertainment and communications assets that complement its existing business groups 
in particular  the company is interested in expanding its library of proprietary motion picture and music rights and in expanding the network through which it distributes various entertainment and communication products and services 
the business activities of the company consist of two business segments i filmed entertainment  which includes the development  production  acquisition  exploitation and worldwide distribution in all media of motion pictures  television programming and other filmed entertainment product  and ii communications  which includes wireless cable television  paging services  radio broadcasting  and various types of telephone services 
filmed entertainment the company operates its filmed entertainment operations through orion 
until november   orion operated under the terms of the plan  which severely limited orion s ability to finance and produce additional theatrical motion pictures 
see notes and to the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item therefore  orion s primary activity prior to the november mergers was the ongoing distribution of its library of theatrical motion pictures and television programming 
orion believes the lack of a continuing flow of newly produced theatrical product while operating under the plan adversely affected its results of operations 
theatrical motion pictures are produced initially for exhibition in theatres 
initial theatrical release generally occurs in the united states and canada 
foreign theatrical exhibition generally begins within the first year after initial release 
home video distribution in all territories usually begins six to twelve months after theatrical release in that territory  with pay television exploitation beginning generally six months after initial home video release 
exhibition of the company s product on network and on other free television outlets begins generally three to five years from the initial theatrical release date in each territory 
communications the company  through miti and its subsidiaries  is the owner of various interests in joint ventures that are currently in operation or planning to commence operations in certain republics of the former soviet union and in certain other eastern european countries 
during  the company began to pursue opportunities to extend its communications businesses into emerging markets in the pacific rim 
the joint ventures currently offer wireless cable television  radio paging systems  radio broadcasting  trunked mobile radio services and various types of telephone services 
joint ventures are principally entered into with governmental agencies or ministries under the existing laws of the respective countries 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts and results of operations of miti  its majority owned and controlled joint ventures  cnm paging and radio juventas  and their subsidiaries 
investments in other companies and joint ventures which are not majority owned  or in which the company does not control  but exercises significant influence  have been accounted for using the equity method

theatrical revenues for calendar were  a decrease of  or from the previous year 
while operating under the plan  orion s ability to produce or acquire additional theatrical product was limited 
this lack of product has negatively impacted theatrical revenues and will continue to do so until orion produces or acquires significant new product for theatrical distribution 
domestic home video revenues for calendar were  a decrease of  or from the previous year 
the decrease in domestic home video revenue was due primarily to orion s reduced theatrical release schedule in calendar orion had available only one of its theatrical releases for sale to the domestic home video rental market in calendar compared to six such titles in fiscal orion s reduced theatrical release schedule in both calendar and fiscal have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on home video annual revenues until new product is available for distribution 
home video subdistribution revenues for calendar were  a decrease of  or from fiscal these revenues are primarily generated in the foreign marketplace through a subdistribution agreement with sony pictures entertainment  inc all pictures covered by this agreement have been released theatrically 
orion s reduced theatrical release schedule in calendar and fiscal has negatively impacted home video subdistribution revenues and will continue to do so in the future until orion produces or acquires significant new product for theatrical distribution 
pay television revenues were  in calendar  a decrease of  or from the previous year 
the decrease in pay television revenues was due to the availability of six titles during calendar in the pay cable market compared to eleven titles during fiscal orion s reduced theatrical release schedule in calendar and fiscal will continue to have an adverse effect on future pay television revenues 
free television revenues for calendar were  a decrease of  or from the previous year 
in both the domestic and international marketplaces  orion derives significant revenue from the licensing of free television rights 
major international contracts in calendar that contributed to revenues were with tv de catalunya for rights in spain  rtl plus for rights in germany and principal network for rights in italy 
in fiscal  the most significant licensees were tv de catalunya  principal network and mitsubishi for rights in japan 
orion s reduced theatrical release schedule while operating under the plan has had and will continue to have an adverse effect on free television revenues 
selling  general administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased  to  during calendar from  during fiscal operating loss operating loss increased  in calendar to  from an operating loss of  in fiscal the most significant contributions to orion s fiscal operating results  which was absent in calendar  came from the recognition of significant domestic pay television license fees pursuant to a settlement of certain litigation with orion s pay television licensee  showtime networks  inc the showtime settlement 
the calendar and fiscal results were adversely affected by writedowns to estimated net realizable value of the carrying amounts on certain film product totaling approximately  for calendar compared to writedowns for fiscal totaling approximately  in addition  approximately two thirds of orion s film inventories are stated at estimated realizable value and do not generate gross profit upon recognition of revenues 
interest expense interest expense decreased by  or to  for calendar  primarily due to a decrease in the average amount of debt outstanding 
extraordinary loss the extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt in calendar resulted from the repayment and termination of substantially all of orion s indebtedness outstanding prior to the november mergers the plan debt  which indebtedness was refinanced with the proceeds of the orion credit facility as defined below and with an interest bearing promissory note from mig  together with the charge off of the unamortized discount associated with such obligations 
fiscal year ended february  versus fiscal year ended february  revenues total revenues for fiscal were  an increase of  or from the fiscal year ended february  fiscal theatrical revenues for fiscal were  a decrease of  or from the previous year 
the decrease was due to the poor performance of the five theatrical feature films released in the domestic marketplace in fiscal while operating under the plan  the company s ability to produce or acquire additional theatrical product was limited 
therefore  the company released in the domestic theatrical marketplace only those pictures that were fully or substantially financed by the company prior to the filing date 
this lack of product has negatively impacted theatrical revenues and will continue to do so until the company produces or acquires new product for theatrical distribution 
domestic home video revenues for fiscal were  an increase of  or over the previous year 
the increase in domestic home video revenue was due primarily to the availability of six of the company s theatrical releases in the domestic home video rental market in fiscal compared to only three releases in fiscal the company s reduced theatrical release schedule in fiscal and fiscal is likely to have an adverse effect on future home video annual revenues 
home video subdistribution revenues for fiscal were  a decrease of  or from the previous year 
these revenues were primarily generated in the foreign marketplace through a subdistribution agreement with sony pictures entertainment  inc all pictures covered by this agreement have been released theatrically 
the company s reduced theatrical release schedule in fiscal and have begun to have and will continue to have an adverse effect on future home video subdistribution revenues 
pay television revenues were  in fiscal  an increase of  from the previous year due to the availability of eleven titles in the pay cable market pursuant to the showtime settlement during fiscal pay television revenues for fiscal included approximately  from the recognition of revenues relating to these eleven titles  including license fees on seven titles that had been deferred from prior years 
revenues expected to be recognized in future periods for the last five released titles under the showtime settlement approximate  free television revenues for fiscal were  a decrease of  or from the previous year 
the decrease was primarily due to significant license fees from major networks in the united states that were recognized in fiscal upon the availability of dances with wolves and silence of the lambs and  to a lesser extent  two other pictures 
no network license fees were recognized in fiscal and it is anticipated that little or no additional network license fees will be generated until new product is produced or acquired 
in both the domestic and international marketplaces the company derives significant revenues from the licensing of free television rights 
major international contracts in fiscal that contributed to revenues were with tv de catalunya for rights in spain  mitsubishi for rights in japan and principal network for rights in italy

selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were  during fiscal  an increase of  from fiscal operating loss operating loss decreased  in fiscal to  from an operating loss of  in fiscal the most significant contributions to the company s fiscal operating results came from the recognition of significant domestic pay television license fees pursuant to the showtime settlement 
the company s fiscal and fiscal results were both adversely affected by writedowns to estimated net realizable value of the carrying amounts on certain film product 
such writedowns totaled approximately  for fiscal compared to approximately  for fiscal for fiscal  the writedowns included an aggregate  attributed to reduced license fees as a result of the showtime settlement  disappointing results of four pictures released that year  and additional provisions on the five then unreleased pictures 
in addition  approximately two thirds of the company s film inventories are stated at estimated realizable value and do not generate gross profit upon recognition of revenues 
interest expense interest expense fell by  or to  for fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in the average amount of debt outstanding  though this decrease was partially offset by increased interest rates 
communications segment results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  and to year ended december  separate comparisons of the results of operations of the communications segment i for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  and ii for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  are not included as miti s results of operations during the year ended december  were not material 
revenues revenues increased to  in from  in and  in this growth in revenue from to resulted primarily from an increase in radio operations in hungary and paging operations in romania 
however  in the company changed its policy of consolidating these operations by recording the related accounts and results of operations based on a three month lag 
as a result  the december  consolidated balance sheet includes the accounts for these operations at september  as compared to the december  balances included in  and the statement of operations reflects nine months of these operations as compared to twelve months for had the company applied this method from october   revenues would have increased over the revenues reported but the net effect on the results of operations would not have been material 
future years will reflect twelve months of operations based upon a september th year end for operations that are consolidated 
the increase in revenues from to was generated primarily from the acquisition of miti s radio operations in hungary and the commencement of operations of radio paging services in romania in revenue from radio operations during was  as compared to  in radio paging services during generated revenues amounting to  as compared to  in miti did not generate significant revenue during since none of the joint ventures or subsidiaries which are consolidated had then commenced operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  or in fiscal as compared to fiscal and by  or in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increases relate principally to the hiring of additional staff and expenses associated with the increase in the number of joint ventures and the need for miti to support and assist the operations of the joint ventures 
during  miti completed the staffing of its vienna office and opened an office in hong kong 
during  miti completed the staffing of its moscow office and opened its vienna office 
furthermore  the commencement of radio paging services in romania and the acquisition of radio station operations in hungary accounted for  of the increase 
in addition  included in selling  general and administrative expenses for is  of non cash compensation expense relating to the granting of stock options to miti s chief executive officer 
interest income in  miti began to charge interest to the joint ventures for credit facilities granted by miti 
the interest was charged at rates ranging from the prime rate to the prime rate plus four percent 
as a result of increasing advances to the joint ventures for their operating and investing cash requirements  interest income earned under credit lines increased to  for as compared to  for no interest was charged to the joint ventures in interest expense interest expense increased to  in from  in and  in  largely due to increased borrowings from affiliates and others in order to finance the operations and investment activities of miti during these periods 
equity in losses of affiliated joint ventures miti accounts for the majority of its joint ventures under the equity method of accounting since it generally does not exercise control of these ventures 
under the equity method of accounting  miti reflects the cost of its investments  adjusted for its share of the income or losses of the joint ventures  on its balance sheet and reflects only its proportionate share of income or losses of the joint ventures in its statement of operations 
additionally  miti changed its policy of accounting for the joint ventures in by recording the results of operations based on a three month lag 
as a result  the consolidated statement of operations reflects nine months of operations for the joint ventures compared to twelve months for the statement of operations for the joint ventures includes a full twelve months of activity based on a september reporting period  as will all future years 
miti recognized equity in losses of its joint ventures of approximately  in   in and  for equity in the losses of the joint ventures are generally reflected according to the level of ownership of the joint venture by miti until such joint venture s contributed capital has been fully depleted 
subsequently  miti recognizes the full amount of losses generated by the joint venture since miti is generally the sole funding source of the joint ventures 
the increase in losses of the joint ventures of  from to is primarily attributable to losses of  incurred as part of the expansion of its cable tv operations  and the opening of a radio station in moscow which resulted in a loss of  as of september  there were six cable tv joint ventures in operation as compared to four in the prior year 
miti s cable tv joint ventures in moscow and riga were responsible for  and  respectively  of this increased loss 
these losses were due to one time write downs of older equipment and additional expenses incurred for programming and marketing related to expanding the services provided and ultimately increasing the number of subscribers 
all other cable tv operations  including two new ventures and the expansion of two others that were in their second year of operations  increased losses by  the increased loss experienced by the radio station in moscow was attributable to a substantial revision in its programming format and the establishment of sales and related support staff needed to effectively compete in the moscow market 
losses from miti s other operations  including five paging entities  three of which were started up in  and one telephony operation  increased by  in the increase in losses of its joint ventures of  from to was principally due to increased losses from cable tv operations of  and of  from all other operations 
the cable tv losses were primarily attributable to  in additional losses in moscow  and  as a result of the first full year of operations of two other joint ventures 
the remainder of  from all other entities is related to the first year of operations for new entities  including the start up of one paging entity  one telephony operation and the moscow radio station 
as a result of the start up nature of many of the joint ventures  additional losses are expected 
the losses recorded for represent miti s equity in the losses of the joint ventures for the twelve months ended september  on january   miti changed its policy of accounting for the joint ventures by recording its equity in their losses based upon a three month lag 
accordingly  results of operations for the year ended december  reflect equity in losses of the joint ventures for the period from october  to september  results of operations for the year ended december  reflect equity in losses of the joint ventures for the period from january  to september  had miti applied this method from october   the effect on reported operating results for the year ended december  would not have been material 
foreign currency miti presently has limited foreign currency exposure as virtually all revenues are billed and collected in united states dollars or an equivalent local currency amount adjusted on a monthly basis for currency fluctuation 
miti s joint ventures are generally permitted to maintain us dollar accounts to service their dollar denominated credit lines  thereby significantly reducing foreign currency exposure 
as miti and its joint ventures grow and become more dependent on transactions based in local currencies  miti expects its foreign currency risk and exposure to increase 
miti currently does not hedge against foreign currency exchange rate risks 
mig consolidated results of operations during calendar  the company reported a loss from continuing operations of  a loss from discontinued operations of  and a loss on extinguishment of debt of  resulting in a net loss of  this compares to a net loss of  for fiscal  all of which came from continuing operations 
the loss from continuing operations increased by  from calendar as compared to fiscal  primarily a result of an increase in miti s operating loss in calendar see communications group results of operations 
the fiscal net loss of  was from continuing operations 
the calendar loss from discontinued operations represents the writedown of the portion of the purchase price of the company allocated to the snapper power equipment company on the merger date to its net realizable value 
the extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt in calendar was due to the repayment and termination of the plan debt  which was refinanced with funds provided under the orion credit facility and a noninterest bearing promissory note from mig  and to the charge off of the unamortized discount associated with such obligations 
liquidity and capital resources orion the financing  production and distribution of motion pictures requires the expenditure of significant amounts of capital 
prior to the consummation of the november mergers  orion s ability to produce or acquire new theatrical product was severely limited by the agreements entered into in connection with the plan 
at the filing date  all new motion picture production was halted  leaving orion with only largely completed but unreleased motion pictures 
accordingly  orion released five  four and three theatrical motion pictures in the domestic marketplace in fiscal   and  respectively 
in calendar  there were no theatrical releases that were fully or substantially financed by orion 
this reduced release schedule has had and will continue to have an adverse impact on results of operations for the immediately foreseeable future 
furthermore  as described in note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item  approximately two thirds of orion s film inventories at december  are stated at amounts approximating their estimated net realizable value and will not result in the recording of gross profit upon the recognition of related revenues in future periods 
accordingly  selling  general and administrative costs and interest expense in future periods are likely to exceed gross profit recognized in each period  which will result in the reporting of net losses by orion for financial reporting purposes for the foreseeable future 
in connection with the consummation of the november mergers  the restrictions imposed by the agreements entered into in connection with the plan on orion s ability to produce and acquire new motion picture product were eliminated 
as a result  orion has begun the process of producing  acquiring and financing theatrical films consistent with the covenants set forth in the orion credit agreement 
the principal sources of funds for orion s motion picture production  acquisition and distribution activities will be cash generated from operations  proceeds from the presale of subdistribution and exhibition rights  primarily in foreign markets  and borrowings under orion s revolving credit agreement 
orion s operating plan involves the production or acquisition and release of lower budget films  the distribution of films for third parties and the continued distribution of its film library 
orion generally plans to release approximately to films per year  including two or three films to be produced by orion or in conjunction with others 
the cost of producing a theatrical film varies depending on the type of film produced  casting of stars or established actors  and many other factors 
the industry wide trend over recent years has been an increase in the average cost of producing and releasing films 
the revenues derived from the production and distribution of a motion picture depend primarily upon its acceptance by the public  which cannot be predicted and does not necessarily bear a direct correlation to the production or distribution costs incurred 
the company will attempt to reduce the risks inherent in its motion picture production activities by closely monitoring the production and distribution costs of individual films and limiting orion s investment in any single film 
on november   in connection with the consummation of the november mergers  orion received contributions of approximately million of new assets from mig 
orion also issued a non interest bearing promissory note of approximately million to mig 
the proceeds from the promissory note as well as the orion term loan described below were used directly or indirectly to repay and terminate the plan debt 
on november   orion entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders led by chemical bank  as agent the orion credit agreement 
the orion credit agreement consists of a million term loan orion term loan with quarterly payments of million commencing march and a maturity date of december   and a million revolver orion revolver with a final maturity of december  the amount outstanding under the orion term loan as of february  was million 
the amount available under the orion revolver as of february  was million of which million is reserved for an outstanding letter of credit 
interest is charged on the orion term loan at the agent bank s prime rate plus or at above the libor rate  at orion s option  and for the orion revolver at the agent bank s prime rate plus or at above the libor rate  also at orion s option 
indebtedness under the orion credit agreement is secured by all of orion s assets  including the common stock of orion and its subsidiaries 
in addition to the quarterly amortization schedule  the orion credit agreement provides that in the event that the ratio of the value of the eligible accounts receivable in orion s borrowing base to the amount outstanding under the orion term loan the borrowing base ratio does not exceed a designated threshold  all cash received by orion must be used to prepay principal and interest on the orion term loan until such borrowing base ratio exceeds such designated threshold 
all prepayments may be applied against scheduled quarterly repayments 
as a result of prepayments  orion has satisfied its scheduled amortization payments through december  to the extent the borrowing base ratio exceeds the threshold set forth in the orion credit agreement  and is not needed to amortize the orion term loan  orion may use any excess cash to pay its operating expenses  including the costs of acquiring new film product or new production 
the borrowing base ratio currently exceeds the designated threshold 
in addition  orion has established a system of lockbox accounts and collection accounts to maintain chemical s security interest in the cash proceeds of orion s accounts receivable 
amounts outstanding under the orion revolver are guaranteed jointly and severally by metromedia and by john w 
kluge 
the orion credit agreement also contains customary covenants  including limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and guarantees  the creation of new liens and on the number of films orion may produce  restrictions on the development costs and budgets for such films  limitations on the aggregate amount of unrecouped print and advertising costs orion may incur  limitations on the amount of orion s leases  capital and overhead expenses  prohibitions on the declaration of dividends or distributions by orion to mig  limitations on the merger or consolidation of orion or the sale by orion of any substantial portion of its assets or stock and restrictions on orion s line of business  other than activities relating to the production and distribution of entertainment product 
the orion credit agreement also contains several financial covenants  including the requirement that orion maintain the ratio of orion s free cash flow as defined in the orion credit agreement to its cumulative investment in film product above certain specified levels at the end of each fiscal quarter  and that orion s cumulative investment in film product not exceed free cash flow by more than  in addition  the orion credit agreement contains a covenant which would be triggered if the amount of orion s net losses exceeds certain levels for each fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ended december  the orion revolver contains the following events of default nonpayment of principal or interest on the facility  the occurrence of a change of control as defined below and an assertion by the guarantors of such facility that the guarantee of such facility is unenforceable 
the term loan portion of the orion credit agreement also contains a number of customary events of default  including the non payment of principal or interest  the occurrence of a change of control of mig defined to include a reduction in the stock ownership of the metromedia holders below of the outstanding common stock or if a third party controls more common stock than the metromedia holders or if a third party is entitled to designate a majority of the members of mig s board of directors  the termination of employment of orion s chief executive officer  head of production or other specified officers and the objection to such person s replacement by the required lenders within a designated period  the violation of covenants  falsity of representations and warranties in any material respect  certain cross default and cross acceleration provisions  and bankruptcy or insolvency of orion or mig 
management believes that the orion revolver together with cash generated from operations will provide orion with sufficient resources to finance anticipated levels of production and distribution activities and to meet debt obligations as they become due during calendar miti miti has invested significantly through capital contributions  loans and management assistance and training in its joint ventures 
miti has also incurred significant expenses in identifying  negotiating and pursuing new wireless telecommunications opportunities in emerging markets 
miti and primarily all of its joint ventures are experiencing continuing losses and negative operating cash flow since the businesses are in the development and start up phase of operations 
the wireless cable television  paging  fixed wireless loop telephony  and international toll calling businesses can be capital intensive 
miti generally provides the primary source of funding for its joint ventures  both for working capital and capital expenditures 
miti s joint venture agreements generally provide for an initial contribution of assets and or cash by the joint venture partners  and for the provision of a line of credit from miti to the joint venture 
under a typical arrangement  miti s joint venture partner contributes the necessary licenses or permits under which the joint venture will conduct its business  studio or office space  transmitting tower rights and other equipment 
miti s contribution is generally cash and equipment  but may consist of other specific assets as required by the joint venture agreement 
miti s credit agreements with the joint ventures are intended to provide the joint ventures with sufficient funds for operations and equipment purchases 
the credit agreements generally provide for interest to be accrued at miti s current cost of borrowing in the united states and for payment of principal and interest from of the joint venture s available cash flow  as defined in the credit agreement  prior to any distributions of dividends to miti or its partners 
the credit agreements also often give miti the right to appoint the general director of the joint venture and the right to approve the annual business plan of the joint venture 
advances under the credit agreements are made to the joint ventures in the form of cash or equipment purchases 
cash advances are used for working capital purposes or as direct payment of expenses or expenditures 
if advances are in the form of equipment purchases  the joint venture is charged under its line of credit  at the cost of the equipment plus cost of shipping 
as of december   and december   miti was committed to provide funding under the various credit lines in an aggregate amount of approximately  and  respectively  of which  and  remains unfunded  respectively 
miti s funding commitments under a credit agreement are contingent upon its approval of the joint venture s business plan and the attainment of certain benchmarks set forth in such business plans 
miti reviews the actual results compared to the approved business plan on a periodic basis 
if the review indicates a material variance from the approved business plan  miti may terminate or revise its commitment to fund the joint venture under its credit agreement 
miti s consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures ability to generate positive operating results is dependent upon the ability to attract subscribers to their systems  their ability to control operating expenses and the sale of commercial advertising time 
management s current plans with respect to the joint ventures are to increase subscribers and advertisers and thereby their operating revenues by developing a broader band of programming packages for wireless cable and radio broadcasting and offering additional services and options for paging and telephony services 
by offering the large local populations of the countries in which the joint ventures operate desired services at attractive prices  management believes that the joint ventures can increase their subscriber and advertiser bases and generate positive operating cash flow  reducing their dependence on miti for funding of working capital 
additionally  advances in wireless subscriber equipment technology are expected to reduce capital requirements per subscriber 
further initiatives to develop and establish profitable operations include reducing operating costs as a percentage of revenue and developing management information systems and automated customer care and service systems 
miti s investments in the joint ventures are not expected to become profitable or generate significant cash flow in the near future 
even if the joint ventures do become profitable and generate sufficient cash flows in the future  there can be no assurances that the joint ventures will pay dividends or return capital and pay advances under credit agreements at any time 
the ability of miti and its consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures to establish profitable operations is also subject to political  economic and social risks inherent in doing business in emerging markets such as eastern europe  the former soviet republics and the pacific rim 
these include matters arising out of government policies  economic conditions  imposition of  or changes to  taxes or other similar charges by governmental bodies  foreign exchange fluctuations and controls  civil disturbances  deprivation or unenforceability of contractual rights  and taking of property without fair compensation 
prior to the november mergers  miti had relied on certain shareholders for capital  in the form of both debt and equity  to fund its operating and capital requirements 
during and  miti s primary sources of funds were from the issuance of notes payable and from equity contributions 
during  miti received equity contributions of approximately  from mig or its affiliates  representing notes payable to metromedia or its affiliates that were converted into equity of miti at the time of the november mergers 
during  miti received equity contributions of approximately  approximately  of this amount was a result of common stock issued to certain related parties  affiliates and others in a private offering 
as part of this issuance   of notes payable were converted to common stock 
the remaining  of equity contributions was the result of the issuance of common stock to an affiliate 
during  miti received financing of  through the issuance of notes payable 
proceeds of miti s borrowings and equity issuance were used  in part  to purchase and provide equipment to its joint ventures under credit lines  to fund initial equity contributions to its joint ventures and for miti s operating activities 
cash utilized by operating activities during the twelve months ended december  and was primarily for selling  general and administrative expenses 
cash used for investing activities in includes  paid to complete miti s acquisition of east news channel trading and service radio juventas  kft  in addition to the approximately  paid in the remaining funds invested in joint ventures during and were capital contributions required by the respective joint venture agreements and to provide equipment and working capital under lines of credit 
these capital requirements amounted to approximately  and  for and  respectively 
capital expenditures in and were primarily the result of expanding miti s operations and establishing offices in moscow  russia  vienna  austria  budapest  hungary and hong kong 
miti s capital commitments for calendar year were comprised of four primary categories i subscriber equipment  ii working capital advances  iii expansion of existing facilities and iv new construction 
most of miti s joint ventures  once operational  require subscriber equipment and working capital infusions for a significant period until funds generated by operations are sufficient to cover operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements 
in some cases  the joint venture and miti agree to expand the existing facilities to increase or enhance existing services 
in those cases  when the joint venture cannot provide these funds from operations  miti provides the funding 
during the construction phase of the joint venture  miti normally provides the funds required to build out the project 
during  miti expended  for capital expenditures on behalf of its joint ventures  including  for cable tv   for paging   for radio and  for all others 
miti also provided  of initial capital contributions to its joint ventures  consisting of  for cable tv   for paging operations   for radio   for telephony and  for all other 
in addition  miti supported certain joint ventures with working capital funds against the joint venture s credit lines totaling  of which  was for cable tv operations   for paging   for radio operations and  for all other 
during  miti will continue to fund its joint ventures in a similar manner 
miti anticipates funding  in capital requirements for its joint ventures  consisting of  for cable tv   for paging joint ventures   for telephony and  for radio 
in addition  miti anticipates approximately  in working capital funding requirements for joint ventures  consisting of  for cable tv   for paging   for telephony and  for radio 
in addition to the foregoing  miti anticipates that it will require approximately an additional  in financing to fund its corporate operations during miti continues to seek out and enter into arrangements whereby it can offer communications services through joint venture arrangements 
additional joint ventures are being planned in countries in which miti currently has investments  as well as in emerging markets in the pacific rim 
in december  miti and protocall ventures ltd 
protocall executed a letter of intent together with a loan agreement 
the letter of intent calls for miti to loan up to  to protocall and to purchase of protocall for  as of december   had been loaned to protocall against the  loan

there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in refinancing its indebtedness or that such refinancing can be accomplished on favorable terms 
in the event the company is unable to successfully complete such a refinancing  the company  in addition to disposing of snapper and its investment in roadmaster  may be required to i attempt to obtain additional financing through public or private sale of debt or equity securities of the company or one of its subsidiaries  ii otherwise restructure its capitalization or iii seek a waiver or waivers under one or more of its subsidiaries credit facilities to permit the payment of dividends to the company 
there can be no assurance that any of the foregoing can be accomplished by the company on reasonably acceptable terms  if at all
