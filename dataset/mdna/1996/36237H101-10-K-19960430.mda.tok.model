net income loss general as part of the company s efforts to reduce operating costs  and as a result of its increasing use of customer letter of credit transactions where finished goods are shipped directly to the customer  the company carried lower levels of inventory during fiscal carrying lower levels of inventory reduced the company s inventory exposure as retailers remained cautious in their ordering patterns and resulted in reduced bank borrowings and lower interest expense during fiscal the ability to operate with lower inventory levels enabled the company to sublet one of its distribution facilities in march  which will reduce warehouse and distribution expenses 
the weak retail environment adversely impacted the company s sales volume in fiscal and in addition  a significant portion of the decrease in net sales was attributable to the recognition by the company of only commission income on certain types of sales customer letter of credit transactions where the company s customer provided a letter of credit which was transferred by the company directly to the overseas manufacturer or where the company s customer provided a letter of credit directly to the overseas manufacturer

the company reduced personnel levels  implemented a salary reduction for mid level and senior executives and discontinued or consolidated several merchandise divisions

prospective financial standards in march  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas no 

sfas no 
requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles held and used by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized 
measurement of that loss would be based on the fair value of the asset 
sfas no 
also generally requires long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be disposed of to be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less cost to sell 
sfas no 
is effective for the company s fiscal year end 
the company has made no assessment of the potential impact of adopting sfas no 
at this time 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
defines a fair value based method of accounting for an employee stock option 
fair value of the stock option is determined considering factors such as the exercise price  the expected life of the option  the current price of the underlying stock and its volatility  expected dividends on the stock  and the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the option 
under the fair value based method  compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the service period 
a company may elect to adopt sfas no 
or elect to continue accounting for its stock option or similar equity awards using the intrinsic method  where compensation cost is measured at the date of grant based on the excess of the market value of the underlying stock over the exercise price 
if a company elects not to adopt sfas no 
 then it must provide pro forma disclosure of net income and earnings per share  as if the fair value based method has been applied 
sfas no 
is effective for transactions entered into for fiscal years that begin after december  pro forma disclosures for entities that elect to continue to measure compensation cost under the old method must include the effects of all awards granted in fiscal years that begin after december  it is currently anticipated that the company will continue to account for stock based compensation plans under the intrinsic method and pro forma disclosures will be made 
therefore  sfas no 
is not expected to have any effect on the company s consolidated financial statements
