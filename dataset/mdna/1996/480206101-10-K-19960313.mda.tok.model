item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
within the past several years  and at an increasing pace recently  the cable television industry has seen much change 
with recent alliances between cable television companies and telephone  computer and software companies  the company believes that the nature of the cable television business is evolving from a traditional coaxial network delivering only video entertainment to a more sophisticated  digital platform environment where cable systems may be capable of delivering traditional programming as well as other services  including data  telephone and expanded educational and entertainment services on an interactive basis 
as this convergence of various technologies progresses  cable television companies will have to reevaluate their system architecture  upgrade their cable plants in order to take advantage of new opportunities and consider clustering their systems in geographic areas where they can achieve economies of scale and reasonable returns on the investments made 
the company is also directly affected by the entry into the marketplace of local telephone companies that  as a result of the passage of recent legislation  now have the ability to provide telephone and video services in direct competition with the company 
see item  regulation and legislation 
this direct competition with local telephone companies is an additional consideration in the ongoing evaluation by the company of its position in this changing marketplace 
the company intends  where possible  to pursue these new technological opportunities as they evolve 
the ability of the company to do so  however  will be dependent in large part on the availability of debt and equity financing 
the company is involved in analyzing and testing new technologies used in the telecommunications area  including combined telephone and video services to multiple dwelling units 
the company is utilizing the experience of bci to provide expertise in the telecommunications area 
bci  through its parent company and its affiliates  is engaged in many areas of the telecommunications business 
bce inc  the parent of bci  is the largest telecommunications company in canada 
bce inc is also the parent company of bell canada  the largest provider of telecommunications services in canada 
bell northern research  an affiliate of bci  is canada s largest research and development organization and is engaged in developing and analyzing new technologies used in the telecommunications area 
northern telecom  a subsidiary of bce inc  is a leading global manufacturer of telecommunications equipment 
as cable television systems in the united states evolve and change into more sophisticated digital networks providing traditional television entertainment  but also telephone and data services  and as competition between cable television operators  telephone companies and others develops  the relationship between bci and the company may provide the company with access to expertise and experience that it would not otherwise have available 
with respect to the systems owned by the company and its subsidiaries  the company earns revenues through monthly service rates and related charges to cable television subscribers 
the company s subscribers have the option to choose a limited basic service consisting generally of broadcast stations and a few cable networks basic service or a package of services consisting of basic service and tier services basic plus service 
the basic plus service generally consists of most of the cable networks  including espn  usa network  cnn  discovery  lifetime and others 
see item  the cable television industry  programming 
monthly service rates include fees for basic service  basic plus service and premium services 
at december   monthly basic service rates ranged from to for residential subscribers  monthly basic plus service rates ranged from to for residential subscribers  and monthly premium services ranged from to per premium service 
in addition  the company earns revenues from pay per view programs and advertising fees 
pay per view programs  which usually are either unique sporting events or recently released movies  are available on many of the company s cable television systems 
subscribers are permitted to choose individual movies for a set fee ranging from to per movie and individual special events for a set fee ranging from to per event 
related charges may include a nonrecurring installation fee that ranges from to  however  from time to time the company has followed the common industry practice of reducing the installation fee during promotional periods 
commercial subscribers such as hotels  motels and hospitals are charged a nonrecurring connection fee that usually covers the cost of installation 
except under the terms of certain contracts with commercial subscribers and residential apartment and condominium complexes  subscribers are free to discontinue the service at any time without penalty  and most terminations occur because a subscriber moves to another home or to another city 
for the year ended december   of the total subscriber fees received by company owned systems  basic and basic plus service fees accounted for approximately of total revenues  premium service fees accounted for approximately of total revenues  pay per view fees were approximately of total revenues  advertising fees were approximately of total revenues and the remaining of total revenues came from equipment rentals  installation fees and program guide charges 
the company is dependent upon timely receipt of service fees to provide for maintenance and replacement of plant and equipment  current operating expenses and other costs 
as the general partner of its managed limited partnerships  the company earns management fees which are generally of the gross revenues of the partnership  not including revenues from the sale of cable television systems or franchises 
the company also receives reimbursement from the partnerships for certain allocated overhead and administrative expenses incurred by the company in its management activities 
from time to time  the company has made advances to certain of its managed limited partnerships and has deferred collection of management fees and expense reimbursements owed by certain of its managed limited partnerships to allow for expansion of a cable television system or other cash needs of such a partnership 
upon dissolution of a company managed partnership or the sale or refinancing of its cable television systems  the company is generally entitled to receive percent of the net remaining assets of such partnership  after payment of partnership debts and after investors have received an amount equal to their capital contributions plus  in most cases  a stated preferential return on their investment 
pursuant to the terms of the various limited partnership agreements  the company has full operational control of the management and day to day business of the partnerships 
the company historically has found that the cash flow of a particular cable television system and the long term value of that system can be increased as a result of i the addition of new subscribers through increased market penetration  ii the building of extensions to reach new potential subscribers in the franchise area  iii the addition of new programming services or products  and iv periodic rate adjustments 
increases in subscribers usually result from specific marketing efforts undertaken by a cable system operator within the community  which may include telephone solicitation  particular program promotions  direct mailings  increased advertising or other means 
a cable operator also can build extensions to systems  which increase the number of homes passed by the cable system and the number of potential subscribers  and thereby increase the potential revenue from additional subscriber fees 
the building of extensions to cable television systems usually occurs due to the development within the system s franchise area of a new housing area adjacent to areas then served by the system or the availability of a franchise for an area adjacent to the current franchise area 
in addition  increased revenues may be generated from the offering of additional services to subscribers 
new cable services have been developed and introduced since the inception of the cable television industry  and new cable services are expected to continue to develop 
these services could include new services which offer movies or other entertainment on demand or nearly on demand by a subscriber known as near video on demand  interactive services including both games and entertainment  as well as information and consumer services 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to increase the cash flow of any particular cable television system or the value of that system by any of the methods described above  the rate regulations promulgated by the fcc under the cable act may limit the amount of any rate increases with respect to regulated services the company will be able to implement in the future 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company s business consists of providing cable television services to a large number of customers  the loss of any one or more of which would have no material effect on the company s business 
each of the cable television systems owned or operated by the company has had some subscribers who later terminated the service 
terminations occur primarily because people move to another home or to another city 
in other cases  people terminate on a seasonal basis or because they no longer can afford or are dissatisfied with the service 
the amount of past due accounts in systems owned or operated by the company is not significant 
the company s policy with regard to these accounts is basically one of disconnecting service before a past due account becomes material 
the company does not depend to any material extent on the availability of raw materials  it carries no significant amounts of inventory and it has no material backlog of customer orders 
the company has engaged in research and development activities relating to the provision of new services 
compliance with federal  state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment has had no material effect upon the capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position of the company 
the company s other businesses the company operates a number of non cable television businesses through subsidiaries the jones group  ltd  a cable television brokerage company  jones futurex  inc which manufactures and markets data encryption products and provides contract manufacturing services  jones satellite networks  inc  a second tier subsidiary of the company that delivers radio programming to radio stations throughout the united states via satellite  and superaudio  a joint venture between a subsidiary of the company  jones galactic radio  inc  and an unaffiliated party that offers fm stereo audio service programming to cable television system subscribers 
the company also has an interest in the cable telephony business in the united kingdom through its approximate equity ownership of bell cablemedia plc  the united kingdom s third largest cable communications operator 
the company also owns direct and indirect minority interests in mind extension university and jones computer network  affiliated programming services

cable television franchises the cable television systems owned or managed by the company are constructed and operated under fixed term franchises or other types of operating authorities referred to collectively herein as franchises that are generally non exclusive and are granted by state and or local governmental authorities 
these franchises typically contain many conditions  such as time limitations on commencement and completion of construction  conditions of service  including the number of channels  types of programming and the provision of free service to schools and certain other public institutions  and the maintenance of insurance and indemnity bonds 
the provisions of local franchises are subject to federal regulation 
the company holds approximately franchises 
these franchises provide for the payment of fees to the issuing authorities and range from to of gross revenues 
the cable act prohibits franchising authorities from imposing annual franchise fees in excess of of gross revenues and also permits the cable television system operator to seek renegotiation and modification of franchise requirements if warranted by changed circumstances 
the company has never had a franchise revoked 
the company s franchises initially had terms of approximately to years 
the duration of the company s outstanding franchises presently varies from a period of months to an indefinite period of time 
the company is currently negotiating the renewal of six franchises that are either operating under extensions or will expire prior to december  during the next three to five years  the renewal process must commence for a significant number of the franchises for cable television systems owned or managed by the company and its affiliates 
the company recently has experienced lengthy negotiations with some franchising authorities for the granting of franchise renewals 
some of the issues involved in recent renewal negotiations include rate regulation  customer service standards  cable plant upgrade or replacement and shorter terms of franchise agreements 
competition cable television systems currently experience competition from several sources 
high powered direct to home satellites have made possible the wide scale delivery of programming by several companies to individuals throughout the united states using small roof top or wall mounted antennas 
companies offering direct broadcast satellite dbs services use video compression technology to increase channel capacity of their systems and to provide packages of movies  network and other program services which are competitive to those of cable television systems 
however  dbs cannot offer its subscribers local video services or programming 
two companies offering dbs services began operations in and together offer more than channels of service using video compression technology 
two other companies offering dbs service recently began operations 
in addition  a joint venture comprised of mci telecommunications  inc and the news corporation limited won the rights to provide a dbs service through a fcc spectrum auction 
other companies have proposed providing similar dbs program packages 
a medium powered satellite distribution also offers channels of service 
the fcc has initiated a new interactive television service which will permit non video transmission of information between an individual s home and entertainment and information service providers 
this service will provide an alternative means for dbs systems and other video programming distributors  including television stations  to initiate new interactive television services 
this service may also be used by the cable television industry 
although the cable television industry does not generally provide two way interactive service from its subscribers homes to cable television offices  such services may be provided on a wider basis in the future 
not all subscribers terminate cable television service upon acquiring a dbs system 
the company has observed that a number of dbs subscribers also elect to subscribe to cable television service in order to obtain the greatest variety of programming on multiple television sets  including local video services or programming not available through dbs service 
the ability of dbs service providers to compete successfully with the cable television industry will depend on  among other factors  the availability of equipment at reasonable prices 
although the company has not yet encountered competition from a telephone company providing video services as a cable operator or video dialtone provider  it is anticipated that the company s cable television systems will face such competition in the near future 
federal cross ownership restrictions have historically limited entry into the cable television business by potentially strong competitors such as telephone companies 
legislation recently enacted into law will result in the elimination of such restrictions  making it possible for companies with considerable resources  and consequently a potentially greater willingness or ability to overbuild  to enter the business 
several telephone companies have begun seeking cable television franchises from local governmental authorities as a consequence of litigation that successfully challenged the constitutionality of the cable television telephone company cross ownership restrictions 
see item  regulation and legislation  ownership and market structure for a description of the potential participation of the telephone industry in the delivery of cable television services 
the company cannot predict at this time when and to what extent telephone companies will provide cable television services within service areas in competition with company owned or managed cable television systems 
the company is aware of the following imminent competition from telephone companies ameritech  one of the seven regional bell operating companies  which provides telephone service in a multi state region including illinois  has just obtained a franchise that will allow it to provide cable television service in naperville  illinois  a community currently served by a cable system owned by one of the company s managed partnerships 
chesapeake and potomac telephone company of virginia and bell atlantic video service company  both subsidiaries of bell atlantic  another of the regional bell operating companies  have announced their intention to build a cable television system in alexandria  virginia in competition with a company owned cable television system 
bell atlantic is preparing for the construction and operation of a cable telecommunications business in northern virginia  including the alexandria metropolitan area 
the fcc has granted gte virginia s application for authority to construct  operate  own and maintain video dialtone facilities in northern virginia  including in the dale city system s service area 
to date  gte has not begun construction of a video distribution system 
the entry of telephone companies as direct competitors could adversely affect the profitability and market value of the company s owned and managed systems 
additional competition is present from private cable television systems known as master antenna television matv and satellite master antenna television smatv serving multi unit dwellings such as condominiums  apartment complexes  and private residential communities 
these private cable systems may enter into exclusive agreements with apartment owners  condominium associations  and homeowners associations  which may preclude operators of franchised systems from serving residents of such private complexes 
in  the fcc made available a microwave service to smatv systems which will facilitate the ability of private cable television systems to distribute video entertainment programming among several smatv systems within a local area 
private cable systems that do not cross public rights of way or interconnect separately owned and managed buildings are free from the federal regulatory requirements imposed on franchised cable television operators 
the telecommunications bill which congress recently passed exempts any facilities that do not use public rights of way such as smatvs serving multiple buildings not under common ownership from classification as a cable system and from franchise and other requirements applicable to cable operators 
a number of states have enacted laws to afford operators of franchised cable television systems access to multi unit dwellings  although some of these statutes have been successfully challenged in the courts 
recently  companies that install and operate private cable television systems have been installing telephone systems as well as providing cable television services in some areas in which the company s cable television systems provide cable television service to multi unit dwellings and similar complexes 
in some cases  the company has been unable to provide cable television service in buildings in which these private operators have secured exclusive contracts to provide video and telephony services 
the company expects that the market to install and provide these services in multi unit buildings will continue to be highly competitive 
in november  the company launched in its alexandria system a telephone service in selected apartments and condominium units 
cable television franchises are not exclusive  so that more than one cable television system may be built in the same area known as an overbuild  with potential loss of revenues to the operator of the original cable television system 
the company has experienced overbuilds in connection with certain systems that it has owned or managed for limited partnerships  and currently there are several overbuilds in the company s systems 
constructing and developing a cable television system is a capital intensive process and  because most cable television systems provide essentially the same programming  it is often difficult for a new cable system operator to create a marketing edge over the existing system 
generally  an overbuilder also would be required to obtain franchises from the local governmental authorities  although in some instances  the overbuilder could be the local government  such as a city or town  and in some such cases  no franchise would be required 
in any case  an overbuilder would be required to obtain programming contracts from entertainment programmers and  in most cases  would have to build a complete cable system  including headends  trunk lines and drops to individual subscribers homes  throughout the franchise areas 
the panama city beach system has lost basic subscribers and commercial units to an overbuilder 
this overbuild continues to provide significant competition and has had an adverse effect on this system s operations 
cable television systems also may compete with wireless program distribution services such as multichannel  multipoint distribution service mmds systems  commonly called wireless cable which are licensed to serve specific areas 
mmds uses low power microwave frequencies to transmit television programming over the air to subscribers 
mmds systems have generally focused on providing service to residents of rural areas that are not served by cable television systems  but providers of programming via wireless cable systems will generally have the potential to compete directly with cable television systems in urban areas as well 
wireless cable systems are now in direct competition with cable television systems in several areas of the country 
telephone companies have recently invested in wireless systems located in california and maryland as well as other states 
these wireless systems could be used on an interim or permanent basis by telephone companies to provide video services within their service areas in lieu of the video dialtone or other wired delivery systems which have been proposed 
the mmds industry is less capital intensive than the cable television industry  and it is therefore more practical to construct mmds systems in areas of lower subscriber penetration  but the previous unavailability of frequency spectrum  programming services and the regulatory delays encountered by mmds systems in obtaining licenses have delayed the growth of the mmds industry 
to date  the company has not lost a significant number of subscribers  nor a significant amount of revenue  to mmds operators competing with the company s cable television systems 
a series of actions taken by the fcc  including reallocating certain frequencies to the wireless services  are intended to facilitate the development of wireless cable television systems as an alternative means of distributing video programming 
the fcc recently held auctions for spectrum that will be used by wireless operators to provide additional channels of programming over larger distances 
an emerging technology  local multipoint distribution services lmds  could also pose a significant threat to the cable television industry  if and when it becomes established 
lmds  sometimes referred to as cellular television  could have the capability of delivering approximately channels  or if two systems were combined channels  of video programming to a subscriber s home  and this capacity could be increased by using video compression technology 
the potential impact  however  of lmds is difficult to assess due to the newness of the technology and the absence of any current fully operational lmds systems 
the fcc has established a new wireless telecommunications service known as personal communications service pcs 
it is envisioned that pcs would provide portable non vehicular mobile communications services similar to that available from cellular telephone companies  but at a lower cost 
pcs is delivered by placing numerous microcells in a particular area to be covered  accessible to both residential and business customers 
because of the need to link the many microcells necessary to deliver this service economically  many parties are investigating integration of pcs with cable television operations 
several cable television multiple system operators hold or have requested experimental licenses from the fcc to test pcs technology  and the fcc has allocated spectrum to pcs licensees which is being awarded through an auction process 
in addition to competing with one another  cable television systems compete with broadcast television  which consists of television signals that the viewer is able to receive directly on his television using his antenna off air 
the extent of such competition is dependent in part upon the quality and quantity of signals available by such antenna reception as compared to the services provided by the available cable systems 
accordingly  it has generally been less difficult to obtain higher penetration rates in areas where there is signal interference from surrounding mountains or where signals available off air are limited  than in metropolitan areas where higher quality off air signals are often available without the aid of cable television systems 
cable television systems also compete with translator and low power television stations 
translators receive broadcast signals and rebroadcast them on different frequencies at low power pursuant to an fcc license 
low power television stations increase the number of television signals in many areas of the country  and provide off air television programs  either pay or advertiser supported  to limited local areas 
cable television systems are also in competition  in various degrees  with other communications and entertainment media including motion pictures and home video cassette recorders  and are dependent upon the continued popularity of television itself 
the construction of more powerful transmission facilities near a cable television system or an increase in the number of television signals in such an area also could have an adverse effect on revenues 
regulation and legislation the cable industry is regulated under the telecommunications act of the cable act  the cable television consumer protection and competition act of the cable act and the cable communications policy act of the cable act and the regulations implementing these statutes 
the federal communications commission the fcc has promulgated regulations covering such areas as the registration of cable television systems  cross ownership between cable television and other communications businesses  carriage of television broadcast programming  consumer protection and customer service standards and lockbox enforcement  origination cablecasting and sponsorship identification  limitations on commercial advertising in children s programming  the regulation of basic cable and cable programming service rates in areas where cable television systems are not subject to effective competition  signal leakage and frequency use  technical performance  maintenance of various records  equal employment opportunity  and antenna structure notification  marking and lighting 
in addition  cable operators periodically are required to file various informational reports with the fcc 
the fcc has the authority to enforce these regulations through the imposition of substantial fines  the issuance of cease and desist orders and or the imposition of administrative sanctions  such as the revocation of fcc licenses needed to operate certain transmission facilities often used in connection with cable operations 
state or local franchising authorities  as applicable  also have the right to enforce various regulations  impose fines or sanctions  issue orders or seek revocation subject to the limitations imposed upon such franchising authorities by federal  state and local laws and regulations 
several states have assumed regulatory jurisdiction of the cable television industry  and it is anticipated that other states will do so in the future 
to the extent the cable television industry begins providing telephone service  additional state and federal regulations will be applied to the cable television industry 
cable television operations are subject to local regulation insofar as systems operate under franchises granted by local authorities 
the following is a summary of federal laws and regulations materially affecting the cable television industry  and a description of state and local laws with which the cable industry must comply 
telecommunications act of the cable act  which became law on february   substantially revised the communications act of  as amended  including the cable act and cable act  and has been described as one of the most significant changes in communications regulation since the original communications act of the cable act is intended  in part  to promote substantial competition in the telephone local exchange and in the delivery of video and other services 
as a result of the cable act  local telephone companies also known as local exchange carriers or lecs and other service providers are permitted to provide video programming  and cable television operators are permitted entry into the telephone local exchange market 
the fcc is required to conduct rulemaking proceedings over the next several months to implement various provisions of the cable act 
among other provisions  the cable act modifies various rate regulation provisions of the cable act 
generally  under the cable act  cable programming service tier rates are deregulated on march  upon enactment  the cable programming service rates charged by small cable operators are deregulated in systems serving  or fewer subscribers 
subscribers are no longer permitted to file programming service complaints with the fcc  and complaints may only be brought by a franchising authority if  within days after a rate increase becomes effective  it receives subscriber complaints 
the fcc is required to act on such complaints within days 
in addition to the existing definition of effective competition  a new effective competition test permits deregulation of both the basic and programming service tier rates where a telephone company offers cable service by any means other than direct to home satellite services  provided that such service is comparable to the services provided by the unaffiliated cable operator 
the uniform rate provision of the cable act was amended to exempt bulk discounts to multiple dwelling units so long as a cable operator that is not subject to effective competition does not charge predatory prices to a multiple dwelling unit 
the most far reaching changes in the communications business will result from the telephony provisions of the cable act 
the statute expressly preempts any legal barriers to competition in the local telephone business that previously existed in state and local laws and regulations 
many of these barriers had been lifted by state actions over the last few years  but the cable act completed the task 
the cable act also establishes new requirements for maintaining and enhancing universal telephone service and new obligations for telecommunications providers to maintain privacy of customer information 
the cable act establishes uniform requirements and standards for entry  competitive carrier interconnection and unbundling of lec monopoly services 
depending on the degree and form of regulatory flexibility afforded the lecs  the company s ability to competitively offer telephone services may be adversely affected 
in addition  the company s ability to effectively compete and provide telephone services will depend upon the outcome of various fcc rulemakings  including the proceeding dealing with interconnection obligations of telecommunications carriers 
the cable act repealed the cable television telephone cross ownership ban adopted in the cable act 
the federal cross ownership ban was particularly important to the cable industry because telephone companies already own certain facilities such as poles  ducts and associated rights of way 
while this ban had been overturned by several courts  formal removal of the ban ended the last legal constraints on telephone company plans to enter the cable market 
under the cable act  telephone companies in their capacity as common carriers now may lease capacity to others to provide cable television service 
telephone companies have the option of providing video service as cable operators or through open video systems ovs  a regulatory regime that may provide more flexibility than traditional cable service 
the cable act exempts ovs operators from many of the regulatory obligations that currently apply to cable operators  such as rate regulation and franchise fees  although other requirements are still applicable 
ovs operators  although not subject to franchise fees as defined by the cable act  are subject to fees charged by local franchising authorities or other governmental entities in lieu of franchise fees 
under certain circumstances  cable operators also will be able to offer service through open video systems 
in addition  the cable act eliminated the requirement that telephone companies file section applications with the fcc before providing video service 
this limits the opportunity of cable operators to mount challenges at the fcc regarding telephone company entry into the video market 
the cable act also contains restrictions on buying out incumbent cable operators in a telephone company s service area  especially in suburban and urban markets 
other parts of the cable act also will affect cable operators 
under the cable act  the fcc is required to revise the current pole attachment rate formula 
this revision will result in an increase in the rates paid by entities  including cable operators  that provide telecommunication services 
the rates will be phased in after a five year period 
cable operators that provide only cable services are unaffected 
under the v chip provisions of the cable act  cable operators and other video providers are required to pass along any program rating information that programmers include in video signals 
cable operators also are subject to new scrambling requirements for sexually explicit programming  and cable operators that provide internet access or other online services are subject to the new indecency limitations for computer services 
these provisions already have been challenged  and the courts have preliminarily enjoined the enforcement of these content based provisions 
under the cable act  a franchising authority may not require a cable operator to provide telecommunications services or facilities  other than an institutional network  as a condition to a grant  renewal or transfer of a cable franchise  and franchising authorities are preempted from regulating telecommunications services provided by cable operators and from requiring cable operators to obtain a franchise to provide such services 
the cable act also repealed the cable act s anti trafficking provision  which generally required the holding of cable television systems for three years 
it is premature to predict the specific effects of the cable act on the cable industry in general or the company in particular 
the fcc shortly will be undertaking numerous rulemaking proceedings to interpret and implement the cable act 
it is not possible at this time to predict the outcome of those proceedings or their effect on the company 
cable television consumer protection and competition act of the cable act effected significant changes to the legislative and regulatory environment in which the cable television industry operated 
the cable act generally mandated a greater degree of regulation of the cable television industry 
pursuant to the fcc s definition of effective competition adopted following enactment of the cable act  and under the fcc s rules and regulations  substantially all of the company s systems were rate deregulated in the mid s 
under the cable act s definition of effective competition  nearly all cable systems in the united states  including those owned and managed by the company  were again subjected to rate regulation of basic cable services 
the cable act also allowed the fcc to regulate rates for non basic service tiers other than premium services in response to complaints filed by franchising authorities and or cable subscribers 
as discussed above  the cable act will over time again allow for rate deregulation of cable service programming 
in  the fcc adopted a benchmark regulatory scheme for the regulation of basic and cable programming service rates 
rather than relying on the benchmark scheme  however  operators may submit cost of service showings to justify rates above the applicable benchmarks 
a cable operator that can demonstrate through a cost of service showing that rates for basic and non basic services are justified will not be required to reduce rates or be regulated under the benchmark and price cap system 
franchising authorities may not elect cost of service as their primary form of rate regulation but must apply the fcc benchmark system 
except for those operators that filed cost of service showings  cable operators whose rates are subject to regulation and that were above the benchmark levels generally reduced those rates to the benchmark level  or by  whichever was less  adjusted forward for inflation 
operators who did not adjust rates pursuant to the fcc s regulations  or whose cost of service showings fail to justify current rates  could be subject to refund liability and interest 
in  the fcc revised its benchmark regulations 
effective may  cable television systems not seeking to justify rates with a cost of service showing were required to reduce rates up to of the rates in effect on september   adjusted for inflation  channel modifications  equipment costs and certain increases in programming costs 
under certain conditions  systems were permitted to defer these rate adjustments until july further rate reductions for cable systems whose rates are below the revised benchmark levels  as well as reductions that would require operators to reduce rates below benchmark levels in order to achieve a rate reduction  were held in abeyance pending completion of cable system cost studies 
the fcc recently requested some of these low price systems to complete cost study questionnaires 
after review of these questionnaires  the fcc could decide to permanently defer any further rate reductions  or require the additional rate roll back for some or all of these systems 
the fcc has instituted a streamlined upgrade methodology by which operators may recover the costs of upgrading their plant 
the fcc also regulates the manner in which cable operators may charge subscribers for new channels added to cable programming services tiers 
the fcc instituted a three year flat fee mark up plan 
commencing on january   operators may charge subscribers up to 
per channel for any channels added after may   but may not make adjustments to monthly rates totaling more than plus an additional 
to cover programming license fees for those channels over the first two years of the three year period 
in year three  an additional channel may be added with another 
increase in rates 
rates may also increase in the third year to cover any additional costs for the programming for any of the channels added during the entire three year period 
cable operators electing to use the 
per channel adjustment may not also take a mark up on programming cost increases  which is otherwise permitted under the fcc s regulations 
the fcc has requested further comment on whether cable operators should continue to receive the mark up on increases in license fees on existing programming services 
the fcc will permit cable operators to exercise their discretion in setting rates for new product tiers so long as  among other conditions  the channels that are subject to rate regulation are priced in conformity with applicable regulations and cable operators do not remove programming services from existing rate regulated service tiers and offer them on the new product tiers 
in september  the fcc authorized a new  alternative method of implementing rate adjustments which will allow cable operators to increase rates for programming annually on the basis of projected increases in external costs inflation  costs for programming  franchise related obligations and changes in the number of regulated channels rather than on the basis of cost increases incurred in a preceding quarter 
operators that elect not to recover all of their accrued external costs and inflation pass throughs each year may recover them with interest in subsequent years 
in december  the fcc adopted final cost of service rate regulations requiring  among other things  cable operators to exclude of system acquisition costs related to intangible and tangible assets used to provide regulated services 
the fcc also reaffirmed the industry wide after tax rate of return on an operator s allowable rate base  but initiated a further rulemaking in which it proposes to use an operator s actual debt  cost and capital structure to determine an operator s cost of capital or rate of return 
after a rate has been set pursuant to a cost of service showing  rate increases for regulated services are indexed for inflation  and operators are permitted to increase rates in response to increases in costs beyond their control  such as taxes and increased programming costs 
new a la carte services that are offered by cable operators in a package will be subject to rate regulation by the fcc  although only if the fcc deems it necessary to do so 
the fcc has indicated that it could not envision circumstances in which any price for a collective offering of premium channels that had traditionally been offered on a per channel basis would be found to be unreasonable 
the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia recently upheld the fcc s rate regulations implemented pursuant to the cable act  but ruled that the fcc impermissibly failed to permit cable operators to adjust rates for certain cost increases incurred during the period between the cable act s passage and the initial date of rate regulation 
the fcc has not yet implemented the court s ruling 
the cable act encouraged competition by allowing municipalities  which are otherwise legally qualified  to own and operate their own cable systems without having to obtain a franchise by preventing franchising authorities from granting exclusive franchises or unreasonably refusing to award additional franchises covering an existing cable system s service area 
the cable act also made several procedural changes to the process under which a cable operator may seek to enforce renewal rights  which could make it easier in some cases for a franchising authority to deny renewal 
the cable act also precluded video programmers affiliated with cable companies from favoring cable operators over competitors and required such programmers to sell their programs to other multichannel video distributors 
this provision may limit the ability of cable program suppliers to offer exclusive programming arrangements with cable companies and could affect the volume discounts that program suppliers currently offer to the company as a multiple system operator 
the cable act prohibits the common ownership of cable systems and co located mmds or smatv systems  however  the cable act repealed the ban on cable mmds cross ownership where a cable system is subject to effective competition 
the cable act contained new signal carriage requirements 
the fcc adopted rules implementing the must carry provisions for non commercial and commercial stations and retransmission consent for commercial stations in march these rules allow commercial television broadcast stations that are local to a cable system  ie  the system is located in the station s area of dominant influence adi  to elect every three years whether to require the cable system to carry the station  subject to certain exceptions  or whether to require the cable system to negotiate for retransmission consent to carry the station 
the first such election was made in june and thus the company will go through the process again in cable systems must obtain retransmission consent for the carriage of all distant commercial broadcast stations  except for certain superstations ie  commercial satellite delivered independent stations such as wtbs 
all commercial stations entitled to carriage were to have been carried by june  and any non must carry stations other than superstations for which retransmission consent had not been obtained could no longer be carried after october  local non commercial television stations are also given mandatory carriage rights  subject to certain exceptions  within the larger of i a mile radius from the station s city of license  or ii the station s grade b contour a measure of signal strength 
unlike commercial stations  non commercial stations are not given the option to negotiate retransmission consent for the carriage of their signal 
the must carry provisions for non commercial stations became effective in december in  a federal district court upheld the constitutional validity of the must carry signal carriage requirements 
this decision was vacated by the united states supreme court in and remanded for further development of a factual record 
the supreme court s majority determined that the must carry rules were content neutral  but that it was not yet proven that the rules were needed to preserve the economic health of the broadcasting industry 
in  the federal district court again upheld the must carry rules validity 
the united states supreme court is currently reviewing this decision 
in  a federal district court upheld provisions of the cable act concerning rate regulation  retransmission consent  restrictions on vertically integrated cable television operators and programmers  mandatory carriage of programming on commercial leased channels and public  educational and governmental access channels and the exemption for municipalities from civil damage liability arising out of local regulation of cable services 
the cable act s provisions providing for multiple ownership limits for cable operators and advance notice of free previews for certain programming services have been found unconstitutional  and these decisions have been appealed 
the fcc s regulations relating to the carriage of indecent programming  which were recently upheld by the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia  have been appealed to the united states supreme court 
the cable act required the fcc to establish national customer service standards and the fcc adopted regulations governing office hours  telephone availability  installations  outages  service calls  and billing and refund policies 
state or municipal authorities may enact laws or regulations which impose stricter or different customer service standards than those set by the fcc 
cable communications policy act of the cable act was the first federal legislation to impose comprehensive and uniform national regulations on cable television systems and franchising authorities 
among other things  the legislation regulated the provision of cable television service pursuant to a franchise  specified those circumstances under which a cable television operator may obtain modification of its franchise  established criteria under which a franchise shall be renewed and established maximum fees payable by cable television operators to franchising authorities 
the law prescribes a standard of privacy protection for cable subscribers  and imposes equal employment opportunity requirements on the cable television industry 
it restricts the amount of fees paid by a cable television operator to a franchising authority to a maximum of of gross revenues during the term of the franchise 
franchising authorities are granted authority to establish requirements in new franchises and renewal of existing franchises for the designation and use of public educational and governmental access channels 
franchising authorities are empowered to establish requirements for cable related facilities and equipment  which may include requirements that relate to channel capacity  system configuration and other facility or equipment requirements related to the establishment and operation of a cable television system 
many of the other provisions of the cable act have been superseded by the cable act and the cable act 
franchising 
the responsibility for franchising or other authorization of cable television systems is left to state and local authorities 
there are  however  several provisions in the cable act that govern the terms and conditions under which cable television systems provide service 
these include uniform standards and policies that are applicable to cable television operators seeking renewal of a cable television franchise 
the procedures established provide for a formal renewal process should the franchising authority and the cable television operator decline to use an informal procedure 
a franchising authority unable to make a preliminary determination to renew a franchise is required to hold a hearing in which the operator has the right to participate 
in the event a determination is made not to renew the franchise at the conclusion of the hearing  the franchising authority must provide the operator with a written decision stating the specific reasons for non renewal 
generally  the franchising authority can finally decide not to renew a franchise only if it finds that the cable operator has not substantially complied with the material terms of the present franchise  has not provided reasonable service in light of the community s needs  does not have the financial  legal or technical ability to provide the services being proposed for the future  or has not presented a reasonable proposal for future service 
a final decision of non renewal by the franchising authority is appealable in court 
the cable act preempts franchising authorities from regulating telecommunications services provided by cable operators and from requiring cable operators to obtain a franchise to provide such services 
a franchising authority may not require a cable operator to provide telecommunications services or facilities  other than an institutional network  as a condition to a grant  renewal or transfer of a cable franchise 
ownership and market structure 
fcc rules generally prohibit the direct or indirect common ownership  operation  control or interest in a cable television system  on the one hand  and a local television broadcast station whose television signal predicted grade b contour as defined under fcc regulations reaches any portion of the community served by the cable television system  on the other hand 
for purposes of the cross ownership rules  control of licensee companies is attributed to all or greater stockholders  except for mutual funds  banks and insurance companies which may own less than without attribution of control 
the fcc has requested comment as to whether to raise the attribution criteria from to and for passive investors from to  and whether it should exempt from attribution certain widely held limited partnership interests where each individual interest represents an insignificant percentage of total partnership equity 
the cable act eliminated the statutory ban on the cross ownership of a cable system and a television station  and permits the fcc to amend or revise its own regulations regarding the cross ownership ban 
the fcc recently lifted its ban on the cross ownership of cable television systems by broadcast networks and revised its regulations to permit broadcast networks to acquire cable television systems serving up to of the homes passed in the nation  and up to of the homes passed in a local market 
the local limit would not apply in cases where the network owned cable system competes with another cable operator 
the cable act generally restricts common carriers from holding greater than a financial interest or any management interest in cable operators that provide cable service within the carrier s telephone exchange service area or from entering joint ventures or partnerships with cable operators in the same market subject to four general exceptions  which include population density and competitive market tests 
the fcc may waive the buyout restrictions if it determines that  because of the nature of the market served by the cable system or the telephone exchange facilities  the cable operator or lec would be subject to undue economic distress by enforcement of the restrictions  the system or lec facilities would not be economically viable if the provisions were enforced  the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction clearly would be outweighed by the public interest in serving the community  and the local franchising authority approves the waiver 
the fcc has imposed limits on the number of cable systems that a single cable operator may own 
in general  no cable operator may hold an attributable interest in cable systems that pass more than of all homes nationwide 
attributable interests for these purposes include voting interests of or more unless there is another single holder of more than of the voting stock  officerships  directorships and general partnership interests 
the fcc has stayed the effectiveness of these rules pending the outcome of the appeal of the united states district court decision holding the multiple ownership limit restrictions of the cable act unconstitutional 
foreign ownership restriction 
the communications act restricts the extent to which non us citizens may have ownership or control rights in certain categories of licenses issued by the fcc 
licenses subject to these restrictions the restricted licenses include broadcast licenses  common carrier radio licenses such as common carrier point to point microwave licenses  and commercial mobile radio service cmrs licenses such as cellular telephone  paging and personal communications service pcs licenses 
section b of the communications act provides that  absent a specific public interest determination by the fcc  a corporation may not control the licensee of any of these restricted licenses if non us citizens hold more than of the ownership or voting rights of the corporation 
different and more restrictive standards apply if non us entities hold interests directly in the licensee of a restrictive license 
section b precludes the company from controlling any restricted licenses unless the company obtains a public interest determination by the fcc that it may hold restricted licenses even though non us participation in the company  including levels of non us ownership and voting rights  exceed the benchmarks under section b 
the fcc licenses commonly employed in cable television operations do not fall within the category of restricted licenses subject to the foreign ownership restrictions in section b of the communications act 
the category of restricted licenses  however  includes licenses commonly used in the provision of conventional and mobile telephone service  such as common carrier point to point microwave licenses  common carrier transmit satellite earth station licenses  cellular telephone licenses and pcs licenses 
although section b restricts the control of restricted licenses by the company due to bci s investment in the company  the company may acquire carriage services from existing us carriers holding these licenses to the extent that it finds a need for these communications links in the conduct of its business 
in november  the fcc issued its report and order in ib docket no 
 in which  among other things  the fcc adopted a new policy of considering the competitive opportunities provided to us carriers in foreign markets as a basis for permitting corporations with foreign participation above the benchmarks of section b to control restricted licenses other than broadcast licenses 
this policy may expand the opportunities for corporations with foreign participation above the section b benchmarks to obtain fcc approval allowing them to hold non broadcast restricted licenses  provided that the home country of the non us participants provides effective competitive opportunities for us carriers 
program origination and exclusivity obligations 
cable television systems may originate programs and may present advertising subject to compliance with the fcc s regulations governing political broadcasts  political advertisements and sponsorship identification  and prohibitions on lotteries and obscene programming 
fcc regulations currently require cable television systems located within miles of a television market to delete syndicated programs on distant broadcast signals upon request of the copyright owner or the local station holding the exclusive rights to broadcast the same program within its television market 
similar blackout regulations also are applicable to network programming in which local network affiliates hold exclusive rights 
copyright matters 
the copyright act of grants cable television systems a compulsory license to carry distant television signals authorized by the fcc 
in consideration for the compulsory license  cable television systems are required to pay royalties to the owners of the copyrighted material which is carried 
these copyright royalty payments are based upon a percentage of a cable television system s gross revenues from basic subscriber service 
every cable television system must submit statements of account and royalty payments to the copyright office 
the copyright act contains specific formulas for calculating the amount of the royalty fee 
in general  under these formulas  the larger the system and the greater the number of distant signals carried  the greater will be the royalty fees 
failure to comply constitutes copyright infringement and may result in the imposition of fines and other penalties 
the distribution of royalties is administered by the library or congress which will use arbitration panels to resolve royalty distribution disputes 
the possible simplification  modification or elimination of the compulsory license is the subject of continuing legislative review 
consequently  the nature or amount of future royalty payments for broadcast signal carriage cannot presently be predicted 
the elimination or substantial modification of the cable compulsory license could adversely affect the company s ability to obtain suitable programming and could substantially increase the cost of programming that would remain available for distribution to the company s cable subscribers 
copyrighted music performed in programming supplied to cable television systems by pay cable networks such as hbo and cable programming networks such as usa network has generally been licensed by the networks through private agreements with the american society of composers and publishers ascap and bmi  inc bmi  the two major performing rights organizations in the united states 
ascap and bmi offer through to the viewer licenses to the cable networks which cover the retransmission of the cable networks programming by cable television systems to their customers 
the cable industry has just concluded negotiations on licensing fees with bmi for the use of music performed in programs locally originated by cable television systems  although no actual agreements are in place  negotiations with ascap are ongoing 
ascap has filed an infringement suit against several cable operators as representatives of cable systems using its music in the pay programming and cable programming networks provided to subscribers 
state regulation 
several states have subjected cable television systems to the jurisdiction of state governmental agencies  some of which have exercised jurisdiction over transfers of control of cable systems  customer service standards and franchising requirements 
attempts in other states to so regulate cable television systems are continuing and can be expected to increase 
local regulation 
a cable television system is generally operated pursuant to a non exclusive franchise or permit granted by the local governing body of the area to be served 
franchises are granted for a stated term  generally to years  and in many cases are cancelable for failure to comply with various conditions and limitations  including compliance with national  state and local safety and electrical codes  required rates of construction and conditions of service 
franchises usually call for the payment of fees to the granting authority 
some state and local regulations governing cable television systems may be subject to requirements imposed by the fcc and are also subject to the requirements imposed by federal law 
the fcc has generally preempted local regulation of the technical standards with which cable television systems must comply  and has recently implemented uniform standards for the industry 
technical and reporting requirements 
the fcc licenses radio  microwave and satellite facilities used by cable television systems 
the fcc rules include technical standards for cable television systems with which all systems must comply 
the fcc requires cable television systems to file annual reports pertaining to frequency usage  subscriber information and equal employment opportunity practices 
the fcc has recently adopted new technical standards  and franchising authorities may not require cable television systems to adhere to standards that are stricter than those of the fcc 
regulatory fees and other matters 
pursuant to the dictates of the communications act  the fcc has adopted requirements for payment of annual regulatory fees by the various industries it regulates  including the cable television industry 
currently  cable television systems are required to pay regulatory fees which may be passed on to subscribers as external cost adjustments to rates for basic cable service 
effective september   the per subscriber fee increased from per subscriber per year to 
fees for other fcc licenses increased as well  including licenses for business radio  cable television relay systems cars and earth stations 
those fees however  may not be collected directly from subscribers 
in addition  the fcc has adopted regulations pursuant to the cable act which require cable systems to permit customers to purchase video programming on a per channel or a per event basis without the necessity of subscribing to any tier of service  other than the basic service tier  unless the cable system is technically incapable of doing so 
generally cable systems must become technically capable of complying with the statutory obligation by december consistent with its statutory obligations the fcc also has adopted a number of measures for improving compatibility between existing cable systems and consumer electronics equipment  including a prohibition from scrambling program signals carried on the basic tier  absent a waiver 
the fcc also is considering whether to extend this prohibition to cover all regulated tiers of programming 
miscellaneous provisions 
the communications act specifically empowers the fcc to impose fines upon cable television system operators for willful or repeated violation of the fcc s rules and regulations 
the fcc has adjudicatory authority over pole attachment disputes where a state has not asserted jurisdiction 
the cable act extends the regulation of rates  terms and conditions of pole attachments to telecommunications service providers and requires the fcc to prescribe regulations to govern the charges for pole attachments used by telecommunications carriers to provide telecommunications services when the parties fail to resolve the dispute over such charges 
the cable act  among other provisions  increases significantly future pole attachment rates for cable systems which used pole attachments in connection with the provision of telecommunications services as a result of a new rate formula charged to telecommunication carriers for the non usable space of each pole 
these rates are to be phased in after a five year period 
the cable act requires the fcc  in consultation with industry standard setting organizations  to adopt regulations which would encourage commercial availability to consumers of all services offered by multichannel video programming distributors 
the regulations adopted may not prohibit programming distributors from offering consumer equipment  so long as the cable operator s rates for such equipment are not subsidized by charges for the services offered 
the rules also may not compromise the security of the services offered  or the efforts of service providers from preventing theft of service 
the fcc may waive these rules so as not to hinder the development of advanced services and equipment 
the cable act requires the fcc to examine the market for closed captioned programming and prescribe regulations which ensure that video programming  with certain exceptions  is fully accessible through closed captioning 
in december  the fcc announced that its long standing emergency broadcast system rules were to be replaced 
the new rules establish cable television and technical standards to support a new emergency alert system 
cable operators must install and activate equipment necessary for the new system by july  the fcc has initiated a rulemaking to consider  among other issues  whether to adopt uniform regulations governing telephone and cable inside wiring 
the regulations ultimately adopted by the fcc could affect the company s ownership interests and access to inside wiring used to provide telephony and video programming services 
in a related rulemaking proceeding  the fcc will consider the appropriate treatment of cable inside wiring in multiple dwelling unit buildings 
the outcome of that rulemaking could affect cable operators access to inside wiring in mdus

cable television systems owned by the company the following sets forth i the monthly basic plus service rates charged to subscribers and ii the number of basic subscribers and pay units for the cable television systems owned by the company 
the monthly basic plus service rates set forth herein represent  with respect to systems with multiple headends  the basic plus service rate charged to the majority of the subscribers within the system 
in cable television systems  basic subscribers can subscribe to more than one pay tv service 
thus  the total number of pay services subscribed to by basic subscribers are called pay units 
as of december   the company owned cable television systems passed approximately  homes  representing an approximate penetration rate

on january   congress passed the telecommunications competition and deregulation act of the act which substantially revised the federal laws regulating the company s cable television business

telephone companies offering stand alone cable television service or cable television service in connection with an open video system could provide substantial competition to the company s owned and managed systems 
the act also permits entities to provide local telecommunications services in competition with the lecs 
the act establishes local exchange competition as a national policy by preempting laws that prohibit competition in the local exchange and establishes uniform requirements and standards for entry  competitive carrier interconnection and unbundling of lec monopoly services 
one premise of the act is that additional regulatory flexibility for lecs is necessary to allow them to respond to competition
