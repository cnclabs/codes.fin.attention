item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the purpose of this discussion is to focus on significant changes in the financial condition and results of operations of the company and its subsidiaries during the past three years 
the discussion and analysis is intended to supplement and highlight information contained in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report 
prior year information has been restated to reflect acquisitions accounted for using the pooling of interests accounting method 
financial institutions acquired by the company during the past three years and accounted for as purchases are reflected in the financial position and results of operations of the company since the date of their acquisition 
summary net income for was million  a percent increase over the company s previous high of million in net income for was percent higher than net income of million 
the increases in net income per common share for and were percent and percent  respectively 
net income per common share increased percent during pretax income for was up million or percent over while income tax expense increased percent over the same period due to an increase in the effective tax rate in from percent to percent 
one significant factor in the growth of the company has been the company s acquisitions in texas  specifically the houston and dallas areas  since early the texas expansion continued in and is expected to continue in on october   the company completed its largest acquisition to date with the purchase of branches of first heights bank  fsb first heights of houston  texas with total deposits of million 
with the acquisition of southwest bankers  inc  in march   the size of the company s texas operations has grown to billion at december  in addition  the company has been able to expand its operations in florida and will seek to continue to increase its presence in that market in for additional information  see acquisitions and pending acquisitions in part i of this report and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements  note  mergers and acquisitions 
earning assets average earning assets in increased percent over due to increases in both average loans and total investment securities 
the average earning asset mix continued to change during with loans at percent  investment securities and investment securities available for sale at percent and other earning assets at percent of total earning assets 
in  loans were percent  investment securities and investment securities available for sale were percent and other earning assets were percent of average earning assets  changing modestly from percent  percent  and percent  respectively  in the shift in the mix of average earning assets during and is to a large extent due to the first heights acquisition in which the assets acquired  principally cash  were initially invested in investment securities and federal funds sold which more than offset the positive impact of the growth in loans discussed below 
management remains committed to returning the portion of earning assets represented by loans to desired levels while maintaining the company s standards of acceptable credit risk 
the mix of earning assets is monitored on a continuous basis in order to place the company in a position to react to interest rate movements and to maximize the return on earning assets 
loans average loans increased percent in with much of the increase concentrated in residential mortgage  real estate construction  and commercial  financial and agricultural loans 
total loans outstanding at year end increased nine percent over previous year end levels 
the growth in the loan portfolio resulted from the company s ongoing efforts to increase the loan portfolio through the origination of loans  especially one to four family real estate mortgages 
real estate construction loans increased percent  residential mortgage loans increased percent  consumer installment loans increased percent and commercial mortgage loans increased percent from year end to year end commercial  financial and agricultural loans  which were percent of total loans in  increased percent compared to the previous year 
the percent increase in the company s loan portfolio from to occurred primarily in residential mortgage loans which increased percent 
the company s loan portfolio continues to reflect the diversity of the markets served by the subsidiary banks 
the condition of the economy in states in which the subsidiary banks lend money is further reflected in the loan portfolio mix 
the volume of commercial  financial and agricultural loans  as a percentage of total loans outstanding  increased slightly during reversing the declining trend of the prior five years  reflective of the stabilization of the economy in the markets served 
residential real estate loans represented percent of the total portfolio at december   unchanged from the prior year  as the mortgage refinancing boom of and subsided 
additionally  the company experienced a percent increase in its indirect auto loan portfolio from to at december   the company s indirect loan portfolio  consisting primarily of indirect automobile loans  represented percent of total loans outstanding 
the company has not invested in loans that would be considered highly leveraged transactions hlt as defined by the federal reserve board and other regulatory agencies 
the company had no foreign loans or loans to lesser developed countries as of december  the loan portfolio table shows the classifications of loans by major category at december   and for each of the preceding four years

 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities fas which requires that a company s debt and equity securities be classified based on management s intent to hold the securities into one of three categories i trading account securities  ii held to maturity securities  or iii securities available for sale 
securities held in a trading account are required to be reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 
securities designated to be held to maturity are reported at amortized cost 
securities classified as available for sale are required to be reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  excluded from earnings and shown separately as a component of shareholders equity 
on december   the company adopted the financial accounting standards board s special report  a guide to implementation of statement on accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities special report 
the special report allowed a company the one time opportunity to reassess the appropriateness of its investment securities classifications and to transfer securities from the held to maturity portfolio to the available for sale portfolio without calling into question the company s intent to hold other debt securities to maturity 
upon adoption  the company transferred held to maturity investment securities totaling million to its available for sale portfolio  and million of available for sale securities to its held to maturity portfolio 
generally  individual holdings with greater than million par value were transferred to the available for sale portfolio in order to increase liquidity and portfolio management capabilities  with smaller positions transferred to the held to maturity portfolio 
at december   unrealized gains  net of unrealized losses  in the company s available for sale portfolio totaled million as opposed to net unrealized losses of million at december  under the requirements of fas  shareholders equity at december   has been increased by million to reflect the tax effected unrealized gain associated with the available for sale portfolio 
at december   the tax effected unrealized loss of million was reflected as a reduction of shareholders equity 
the composition of the company s total investment securities portfolio reflects the company s investment strategy of maximizing portfolio yields commensurate with risk and liquidity considerations 
the primary objectives of the company s investment strategy are to maintain an appropriate level of liquidity and provide a tool to assist in controlling the company s interest rate position while at the same time producing adequate levels of interest income 
for securities classified as held to maturity  the company has the ability  and it is management s intention  to hold such securities to maturity 
management of the maturity of the portfolio is necessary to provide liquidity and control interest rate risk 
certain securities that may be sold prior to maturity are reflected as investment securities available for sale on the company s balance sheet 
the company transferred approximately million of investment securities from its held to maturity portfolio to the available for sale classification in and  with the adoption of fas on december   transferred an additional million of investment securities to its available for sale portfolio 
the transfer primarily involved fixed rate collateralized mortgage obligations cmos that could have been required  based on the wording of a regulatory policy of the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec in place at the time  to be transferred to the available for sale portfolio in the future if sufficiently reduced prepayment speeds were experienced on the underlying mortgages 
during  the ffiec clarified its policy language and intent  which enabled cmos to be carried in the held to maturity portfolio under fas as a result  the company transferred approximately million of cmos from its available for sale portfolio to investment securities held to maturity during as discussed earlier  the company transferred securities  primarily cmos and us government agencies  between its held to maturity and available for sale portfolios at december   upon adoption of the special report 
there were no sales of held to maturity securities during while sales of held to maturity securities in totaled less than million 
maturities of held to maturity securities in and were million and million  respectively 
during  gross gains of million were realized on million of mortgage backed securities in the held to maturity portfolio  which were classified as maturities in accordance with fas sales and maturities of securities available for sale totaled million and million  respectively  in while sales and maturities in the category in were million and million 
net gains realized during the year accounted for percent and percent of noninterest income in and  respectively 
gross unrealized gains in the company s held to maturity portfolio at year end totaled million and gross unrealized losses totaled million 
in recent years  the trend of the company has been to invest in taxable securities due to the lack of preferential treatment afforded tax exempt securities under the tax laws 
because of their liquidity  credit quality and yield characteristics  the majority of the purchases of taxable securities have been in mortgage backed pass through securities mbs and cmos 
total average investment securities  including those available for sale  increased percent during after increasing percent in the following table contains the carrying amount of the investment securities portfolio at the end of each of the last three years investment securities and investment securities available for sale december in thousands investment securities us us   us government agencies and us   mortgage backed pass through securities    collateralized mortgage obligations agency    corporate    states and political subdivisions    corporate bonds    other    investment securities available for sale us us    us government agencies and us    mortgage backed pass through securities    collateralized mortgage obligations agency    corporate   corporate bonds  other    net unrealized gain loss    total    the maturities and weighted average yields of the investment securities and investment securities available for sale at the end of are presented in the following table using primarily the average expected lives including the effects of prepayments

during a period of rising rates  prepayment speeds generally slow on mbs and cmos with a resulting extension in average life  and vice versa 
given a basis point immediate and permanent parallel increase in rates  the expected average lives for mbs and cmos would be and years  respectively 
by the same token  a basis point immediate and permanent parallel decrease in rates  the expected average lives for mbs and cmos would be and years  respectively 
the weighted average market prices as a percentage of par value for mbs and cmos at december   were percent and percent  respectively 
the market prices for mbs and cmos generally decline in a rising rate environment due to the resulting increase in average life as well as the i decreased market yield on fixed rate securities and ii impact of annual and life rate caps on adjustable rate securities 
the opposite is generally true during a period of falling rates 
at december   fixed rate mbs and cmos totaled million and  million  respectively  with corresponding weighted average expected lives of and years 
adjustable rate mbs and cmos totaled million and million  respectively  with corresponding weighted average expected lives of and years 
substantially all adjustable rate mbs and cmos are subject to life rate caps  and mbs are also generally subject to a two percent annual cap 
the weighted average life caps at year end were percent and percent for mbs and cmos  respectively  and the corresponding weighted average coupon rates at year end were percent and percent 
given a basis point immediate and permanent parallel increase in rates  the estimated market prices for mbs and cmos would be and  respectively 
given a basis point immediate and permanent parallel decrease in rates  the estimated market prices for mbs and cmos would be and  respectively 
trading account securities and other earning assets securities carried in the trading account  while interest bearing  are primarily held for sale 
the volume of activity is directly related to general market conditions and reactions to the changing interest rate environment 
the average balance in the trading account portfolio for decreased by percent following a percent decrease in the composition of the company s trading account at december  and  is detailed below trading account composition december  december  in thousands us treasury and govern ment agency   states and political sub divisions   mortgage backed pass through securities   other debt securities derivative securities collateralized mortgage obligations   interest rate floors and caps   other options the balance in the trading account at december   increased from year end due to the need to carry more securities in inventory in order to support increased customer demand 
the overall level of the trading account decreased from december   as a result of the company s decisions during the second quarter of to sell its position in collateralized mortgage obligation inverse floaters inverse floaters and to substantially limit its proprietary trading efforts as distinguished from the retail trading necessary to facilitate customer transactions in response to the rising interest rate environment 
average federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell decreased percent in compared to a percent increase in the average balance of interest bearing deposits in other banks decreased percent during from levels after decreasing percent from to there were no foreign time deposits as of december  or deposits and borrowed funds the company s growth in assets during was funded primarily by deposit growth  representing percent of the million increase in total liabilities and shareholders equity at december  a nine percent increase in interest bearing deposits accounted for all of this increase as noninterest bearing deposits remained unchanged 
growth in other liabilities and in shareholders equity represented percent and percent  respectively  of the increase in total liabilities and shareholders equity 
the million increase in other liabilities consisted principally of a million  or percent  increase in federal funds purchased and a million  or percent  increase in fhlb and other borrowings  partially offset by a percent decrease in securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
during  percent of the increase in total liabilities and shareholders equity was due to deposit growth as total deposits grew by billion  the majority of which was attributable to the million in deposits acquired in the first heights transaction 
noninterest bearing deposits increased by million  or percent  while interest bearing deposits increased by billion  or percent 
a million increase in securities sold under agreements to repurchase along with a million increase in fhlb and other borrowings accounted for the majority of the million  or percent  increase in liabilities other than deposits 
changes in the company s markets and the economy in general  as well as the first heights acquisition  continued to impact the company s liability mix during while the portion of average interest bearing liabilities represented by interest bearing deposits  the primary source of funding for the company  declined slightly from percent in to percent in  the average balance of certificates of deposits less than  and other time deposits increased from percent to percent of total interest bearing liabilities 
certificates of deposits less than  and other time deposits represented percent of average total deposits in  up from percent in for the year  the average balance of certificates of deposit less than  and other time deposits increased percent while certificates of deposit of  or more grew by percent 
interest bearing demand deposits and savings accounts experienced only modest increases of two percent and six percent  respectively 
the portion of average interest bearing liabilities represented by interest bearing deposits increased from percent in to percent in due to the fact that interest bearing deposits were the only interest bearing liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition of first heights 
falling interest rates during and allowed the company to restructure the mix of deposits toward more consumer oriented  lower cost sources of funds 
conversely  the rise in the general level of interest rates during resulted in a shift toward higher cost time deposits 
this factor  coupled with the fact that time deposits represented percent of total deposits assumed in the first heights acquisition  resulted in an increase in the percentage of average total deposits represented by average time deposits from percent in to percent in during  the average balance of demand deposits  savings accounts and noninterest bearing deposits represented percent of average total deposits  down from percent in this decline was a function of a percent increase in the average balance of certificates of deposit less than  and other time deposits and a percent increase in the average balance of certificates of deposits of  or more 
this shift in the mix of deposits was due principally to the acquisition of branches of first heights in which time deposits constituted percent of the million of total deposits assumed 
the maturities of certificates of deposit of  or more and other time deposits of  or more outstanding at december   are summarized in the following table maturities of time deposits certificates other time of deposit deposits over over   total in thousands three months or less    over three through six months    over six through twelve months   over twelve months   borrowed funds consist of fhlb and other borrowings as well as short term borrowings  primarily in the form of federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short term borrowings 
average federal funds purchased increased percent during and average securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased percent 
average other short term borrowings  which include parent company commercial paper and trading account short sales  decreased percent 
during  the average balance of fhlb and other borrowings increased million  or percent  as a result of additional fhlb advances of million incurred in the third quarter  partially offset by fourth quarter repayments of million 
the average balance of fhlb and other borrowings increased percent during due to additional borrowings of million in subordinated debentures and million in fhlb advances 
for a discussion of interest rates and maturities of fhlb and other borrowings  refer to note  fhlb and other borrowings  in the notes to consolidated financial statements

   liquidity management liquidity is the ability of the company to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities 
liquidity management involves maintaining the company s ability to meet the day to day cash flow requirements of the subsidiary banks customers  whether they are depositors wishing to withdraw funds or borrowers requiring funds to meet their credit needs 
without proper liquidity management  the subsidiary banks would not be able to perform the primary function of a financial intermediary and would  therefore  not be able to meet the needs of the communities they serve 
additionally  the parent holding company requires cash for various operating needs including dividends to shareholders  business combinations  capital injections to the subsidiary banks  the servicing of debt and the payment of general corporate expenses 
the primary source of liquidity for the parent holding company is dividends from the subsidiary banks 
at december   the company s subsidiary banks could have paid additional dividends to the parent holding company in the amount of million while continuing to meet the capital requirements for well capitalized banks 
also  the parent holding company has access to various capital markets as evidenced by the issuance of subordinated debentures in and and the issuance of common stock in a private placement in the parent holding company does not anticipate any liquidity requirements that it cannot meet in the near future 
asset and liability management functions not only to assure adequate liquidity in order for the subsidiary banks to meet the needs of their customers  but also to maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities so that the company can also meet the investment requirements of its shareholders 
daily monitoring of the sources and uses of funds is necessary to maintain an acceptable cash position that meets both requirements 
in a banking environment  both assets and liabilities are considered sources of liquidity funding and both are  therefore  monitored on a daily basis 
the asset portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through loan principal repayments  maturities of investment securities and  to a lesser extent  sales of investment securities available for sale and trading account securities 
real estate construction and commercial  financial and agricultural loans that mature in one year or less amounted to billion  or percent  of the total loan portfolio at december  other short term investments such as federal funds sold  securities purchased under agreements to resell and maturing interest bearing deposits with other banks are additional sources of liquidity funding 
the liability portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity through various customers interest bearing and noninterest bearing deposit accounts 
federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short term borrowings are additional sources of liquidity and basically represent the company s incremental borrowing capacity 
these sources of liquidity are short term in nature and are used as necessary to fund asset growth and meet short term liquidity needs 
as disclosed in the company s consolidated statements of cash flows  net cash provided by operating activities decreased to million primarily due to the increase in trading account securities 
net cash used in investing activities of million consisted primarily of net loans originated of million and available for sale securities purchased of billion  largely funded by maturities of investment securities held to maturity of million  as well as sales and maturities of investment securities available for sale of million and million  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities provided the remainder of funding sources for the million of net cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of a million increase in deposits  a net increase of million in fhlb and other borrowings  and a million increase in federal funds purchased offset partially by a reduction of million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
the increase in fhlb and other borrowings in consisted of additional fhlb advances of million and repayments of million 
interest rate sensitivity management interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of the company s portfolio of assets and liabilities 
these repricing characteristics are the time frames within which the interest bearing assets and liabilities are subject to change in interest rates either at replacement  repricing or maturity during the life of the instruments 
interest rate sensitivity management focuses on repricing relationships of assets and liabilities during periods of changes in market interest rates 
effective interest rate sensitivity management seeks to ensure that both assets and liabilities respond to changes in interest rates within an acceptable time frame  thereby minimizing the effect of interest rate movements on net interest income 
the company measures interest rate sensitivity as the difference between the volumes of assets and liabilities in the company s current portfolio that are subject to repricing at various time horizons immediate  to months  to months  to years and over years 
the differences are known as interest sensitivity gaps 
the following table shows interest sensitivity gaps for these different intervals as of december  and  including the effect of interest rate swaps  interest rate floors  futures and other hedging instruments interest rate sensitivity analysis december one four one over three twelve five five immediate months months years years total in thousands earning assets loans  net of unearned income       taxable investment se curities      tax exempt investment securities    investment securities available for sale      trading account securi ties   federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell   interest bearing depos its with other banks

fixed rate assets and liabilities have been allocated to various time intervals based on contractual repayment and or maturity 
as seen in the preceding table as of december   for the first year  percent of earning asset funding sources will reprice compared to percent of all interest earning assets 
changes in the mix of earning assets or supporting liabilities can either increase or decrease the net interest margin without affecting interest rate sensitivity 
in addition  the interest rate spread between an asset and its supporting liability can vary significantly while the timing of repricing for both the asset and the liability remains the same  thus impacting net interest income 
this characteristic is referred to as basis risk and relates to the possibility that the repricing characteristics of assets tied to the company s prime lending rate are different from those of funding sources such as certificates of deposit 
varying interest rate environments can create unexpected changes in the prepayments of assets and repricing of liabilities which are not reflected in the interest rate sensitivity analysis 
these changing prepayments may have significant effects on the company s net interest margin 
because of these factors  an interest sensitivity gap report will not provide a comprehensive assessment of the company s exposure to changes in interest rates 
management utilizes computerized interest rate simulation analysis to determine the company s expected sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
unique cash flows for various interest rate environments can be used in the simulation model to provide a better quality of predictive information to manage net interest margin 
the ability to change cash flows in the simulation model allows management to see the impact that a variety of cash flow and interest rate scenarios have on the net interest margin 
the simulation model is used to develop a better understanding of risks other than prepayment and repricing of liabilities that may exist in the structure of the balance sheet 
the simulation model allows the company to test a variety of magnitudes to examine the impact of basis risk on interest rate margin 
using a simulation model provides insight into how a change in the slope of the yield curve will impact the interest margin 
a change in the shape of the yield curve impacts the dynamics of repricings and cash flows and therefore the net interest margin 
the model simulation tests the impact that the timing of a change in interest rates may have on net interest margin 
rates falling at different relativity over a time horizon will impact net interest margin differently in each scenario 
interest rate simulation modeling assists management in identifying risks to net interest margin thus allowing management to reduce the volatility of the net interest margin as appropriate 
the company s current simulation model  which includes december  balances and projected growth  indicated a decrease in net interest income of less than two percent with an immediate and permanent basis point increase or decrease in the general level of interest rates 
in addition to the ongoing monitoring of interest sensitive assets and liabilities  the company enters into various interest rate contracts not held in the trading account interest rate protection contracts to help manage the company s interest sensitivity 
such contracts generally have a fixed notional principal amount and include i interest rate swaps where the company typically receives or pays a fixed rate and a counterparty pays or receives a floating rate based on a specified index  generally the prime rate or the london interbank offered rate libor  ii interest rate caps and floors purchased or written where the company receives or pays  respectively  interest if the specified index falls below the floor rate or rises above the cap rate  and iii interest rate futures where the company agrees to deliver or receive securities or money market instruments at a designated future date and at a specified price or yield 
the interest rate risk factor in these contracts is considered in the overall interest management strategy and the company s interest risk management program 
the income or expense associated with interest rate swaps  caps and floors and gains or losses in futures contracts classified as hedges are ultimately reflected as adjustments to interest income or expense 
changes in the estimated fair value of interest rate protection contracts are not reflected in the financial statements until realized 
a discussion of interest rate risks  credit risks and concentrations in off balance sheet financial instruments is included in note  derivative financial instruments  of notes to consolidated financial statements

weighted average rates received paid are shown only for swaps  caps and floors for which net interest amounts were receivable or payable at december  for caps and floors  the rate shown represents the weighted average net interest differential between the index rate and the cap or floor rate 
the net interest amount received or paid on an interest rate protection contract represents an adjustment of the yield or rate on the respective asset or liability with which such contract is associated 
a gain or loss on a terminated interest rate protection contract is deferred and amortized over the remaining term of the original contract as an adjustment of yield or rate on the asset or liability with which the original contract was associated 
at year end  there were  of deferred gains and  of deferred losses on terminated interest rate protection contracts  which will be recorded as net interest income expense of  in   in and  thereafter

accordingly  the level of notional principal shown cannot be directly compared to the related account balances 
in addition to interest rate protection contracts used to help manage overall interest sensitivity  the company also enters into interest rate contracts for the trading account 
the primary purposes for using interest rate contracts in the trading account are to facilitate customer transactions and to help protect cash market positions in the trading account against interest rate movement 
changes in the estimated fair value of contracts in the trading account are recorded in other noninterest income as trading profits and commissions 
net interest amounts received or paid on interest rate contracts in the trading account are recorded as an adjustment of interest on trading account securities

in addition to the interest rate contracts shown above  the company uses other options and futures in the trading account 
at december   the trading account did not contain any other options  but did contain futures contracts having a notional principal of million 
such futures contracts were used to help reduce the price sensitivity of the trading account 
during  the company implemented financial statement no 
 disclosure about derivative financial instruments fas  which requires expanded disclosures for derivative financial instruments held for both trading and other than trading purposes

as noted above  exclusive of the change in unrealized holding gains losses on securities available for sale  the increase in shareholders equity in and is due almost exclusively to the retention of earnings 
in order to maintain this ratio at appropriate levels with continued growth in total average assets  a corresponding level of capital growth must be achieved 
the table below summarizes these and other key ratios for the company for each of the last three years 
return on equity and assets december return on average assets return on average common equity common stock dividend payout ratio average equity to average assets ratio two important indicators of capital adequacy in the banking industry are the leverage ratio and the tangible leverage ratio 
the leverage ratio is defined as common shareholders equity  minus goodwill and other intangibles disallowed by the subsidiary bank s regulators  divided by total quarterly average assets minus goodwill  other disallowed intangibles  and the unrealized gain loss on available for sale securities 
the tangible leverage ratio is defined as common shareholders equity  minus all intangibles  divided by total quarterly average assets minus all intangibles 
even though core deposit intangibles and goodwill increased from acquisitions during and  the leverage ratio remained well within regulatory guidelines percent at year end  percent at year end  and percent at year end for the same periods  the tangible leverage ratio was percent at year end  percent at year end  and percent at year end the detail for the computation of these ratios is provided in the following table 
other disallowed intangibles represent intangible assets  other than goodwill  recorded after february   that are excluded from regulatory capital 
other intangibles recorded before that date continue to be included in regulatory capital under the grandfather provision of federal reserve regulations 
the million decrease in shareholders equity at december   resulting from the decline in the fair value of the company s available for sale investment securities portfolio is not required to be deducted from the company s equity in the calculation of regulatory capital by the federal regulators 
by the same token  the million increase in shareholders equity at december   has not been included as a component of equity in computing the leverage ratios

under the guidelines  capital strength is measured in two tiers which are used in conjunction with risk adjusted assets to determine the risk based capital ratios 
the company s tier i capital  which consists of common equity less goodwill and other disallowed intangibles  amounted to million at december  tier ii capital components include supplemental capital components such as qualifying allowance for loan losses and qualifying subordinated debt 
tier i capital plus the tier ii capital components is referred to as total qualifying capital and was million at year end the percentage ratios  as calculated under the guidelines  were percent and percent for tier i and total qualifying capital  respectively  at year end the million of subordinated debt issued by the company in the second quarter of and the million of subordinated debt issued by the company in the third quarter of represented tier ii capital and favorably impacted the company s total qualifying capital 
tier i capital increased in as a result of million in earnings  net of dividends retained by the company  million received from the exercise of stock options  and a million decrease in disallowed intangibles 
this increase in tier i capital more than offset the increase in total risk adjusted assets  resulting in the increase in the tier i capital ratio 
however  tier ii capital increased only million during the year and  as a result  the total qualifying capital ratio decreased slightly in the decrease in tier i and total qualifying capital ratios was due to the addition of higher risk weighted assets  primarily loans and investment securities  and goodwill and other intangibles resulting from acquisitions 
december risk based capital ratios tier i capital ratio total qualifying capital ratio the regulatory capital ratios of the company s subsidiary banks currently exceed the minimum ratios of percent leverage capital  percent tier i capital  and percent total qualifying capital required in for well capitalized banks as defined by federal regulators 
the company continually monitors these ratios to assure that the subsidiary banks exceed the guidelines 
results of operations net interest income net interest income is the principal component of a financial institution s income stream and represents the difference or spread between interest and fee income generated from earning assets and the interest expense paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
fluctuations in interest rates as well as volume and mix changes in earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can materially impact net interest income 
the discussion of net interest income is presented on a taxable equivalent basis  unless otherwise noted  to facilitate performance comparisons among various taxable and tax exempt assets 
net interest income for increased four percent over while increasing less than one percent in over a percent increase in the volume of average earning assets  primarily total investment securities and loans  more than offset a basis point decline in net yield 
in  the net yield on average total earning assets decreased basis points while the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased basis points and the net cost of funds increased basis points 
the schedule on pages and provides the detail of changes in interest income  interest expense and net interest income due to changes in volumes and rates 
interest income increased percent in and percent in after decreasing percent in interest income in grew as a result of a percent increase in the volume of average earning assets partially combined with a basis point increase in the average interest rate earned 
a percent increase in the volume of average loans along with a basis point increase in yield accounted for the percent increase in fully taxable equivalent interest income on loans 
the increase in yield on loans resulted from the overall rise in the general level of interest rates and the loan growth generated during the year 
additionally  a significant portion of the company s real estate mortgages are adjustable rate one to four family mortgages which generally have caps which limit the amount by which interest rates can be increased in any one year 
for this reason  the increases in interest rates on many of these mortgages did not parallel the substantial increase in the general level of interest rates that occurred during  but have continued to rise during interest income on investment securities  including securities available for sale  increased percent from to this increase resulted from a percent increase in the average balance of total investment securities coupled with a basis point increase in yield 
interest income on trading securities declined percent as a result of a percent decrease in the average balance 
total interest expense increased by percent in due to a basis point increase in the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities combined with a percent increase in average volume 
interest expense on interest bearing deposits increased percent as the result of a basis point increase in rate and a percent increase in the average volume 
the percent increase in average borrowed funds  which includes interest bearing liabilities that are not classified as deposits  coupled with a basis point increase in rate resulted in a percent increase in interest expense for this category 
the increase in interest expense on average borrowed funds for the year can be attributed to the fact that borrowed funds have variable rates that increased as a function of the increase in the general level of interest rates during from to  interest income increased percent as a result of a percent increase in the volume of average earning assets and a basis point decline in the yield on average earning assets 
fully taxable equivalent interest income on loans rose percent as a percent increase in average volume more than offset a basis point decline in yield 
interest income on investment securities  including securities available for sale  increased percent from to as a result of a percent increase in average volume partially offset by a basis point decrease in the yield on investment securities 
a basis point increase in yield offset by a percent decrease in average balance increased interest income on trading securities by percent in a basis point increase in the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities coupled with a percent increase in average volume resulted in a percent increase in interest expense on interest bearing liabilities in a substantial portion of the increase in total interest expense was due to a percent increase in interest expense on interest bearing deposits  resulting from a basis point increase in rate and a percent increase in the average volume 
a basis point increase in the rate paid on average borrowed funds  along with a percent increase in average volume  resulted in a percent increase in interest expense for this category 
the trend in net interest income is commonly evaluated in terms of average rates using the net yield and the interest rate spread 
the net yield on earning assets is computed by dividing fully taxable equivalent net interest income by average total earning assets 
this ratio represents the difference between the average yield returned on average earning assets and the average rate paid for all funds used to support those earning assets  including both interest bearing and noninterest bearing sources of funds 
the net yield declined basis points to percent in and decreased basis points to percent in the steady decrease in net yield throughout was a function of the issuance of additional borrowings and the repricing of interest bearing liabilities in the increasing interest rate environment at rates that outpaced the increase in yield on loans and investment securities 
this is evidenced by the fact the yield on interest earning assets increased only basis points while the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased by basis points 
at the same time  the portion of interest earning assets funded by interest bearing liabilities increased from percent in to percent in  partially as a result of the acquisition of first heights 
the decline in yield was also impacted by the initial investment of cash received in connection with the first heights acquisition in investment securities and federal funds sold  assets which historically have lower yields than loans 
during  the net yield on interest earning assets was modestly impacted by the company s use of interest rate contracts  primarily interest rate swaps and interest rate floors  increasing the taxable equivalent net yield on interest earning assets by three basis points 
the greatest impact from the use of interest rate contracts was on the yield and interest income on commercial loans where the net yield was increased by two basis points and interest income was increased by million 
at the same time  the impact of interest rate contracts on interest bearing liabilities was less significant  increasing interest expense by  and the net cost of funds by less than one basis point 
the impact of the use of interest rate contracts in was substantially less than in when the positive impact on the net yield on interest earning assets was basis points 
it is the company s intention to continue to use interest rate contracts to manage its exposure to the changing interest rate environment in the future  although there can be no assurance that the impact of interest rate contracts on the earnings of future periods will be positive 
the interest rate spread measures the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the interest rate spread eliminates the impact of noninterest bearing funds and gives a direct perspective on the effect of market interest rate movements 
during  the net interest rate spread decreased basis points to percent from the spread of percent as the cost of interest bearing liabilities rose to a greater extent than the yields earned on earning assets 
the decrease in was basis points from percent in see the accompanying schedules entitled consolidated average balances  interest income expense and yields rates and rate volume variance analysis for more information 
the following table presents certain interest rates without modification for tax equivalency 
the table on pages and contains these same percentages on a taxable equivalent basis 
tax exempt earning assets continue to make up a smaller percentage of total earning assets 
as a result  the difference between these interest rates with and without modification for tax equivalency continues to narrow 
december rate earned on interest earning assets rate paid on interest bearing liabilities interest rate spread net yield on earning assets interest income  as reported in consolidated statements of income  on a nominal yield basis increased in by million while net interest income increased by million 
the basis point decrease in the net yield in was a result of an increase in the yields in the company s interest earning assets and an increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities  as discussed earlier 
the company will continue to focus its attention in on increasing net interest income while at the same time maintaining the current levels in interest rate spreads and net yields

the amount for each year is dependent upon many factors including loan growth  net charge offs  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  delinquencies  management s assessment of loan portfolio quality  the value of collateral and general economic factors 
the economic outlook for the states in which the company does business is guardedly optimistic in the midst of a gradual improvement of the economy overall 
real estate values  affected by the recessionary pressures of prior years  have shown a general stabilization in the subsidiary banks markets 
on a regional basis  however  any additional economic slowdown in these markets could have an effect on most regional bank holding companies and could be reflected by little or no overall asset growth 
such an economic slowdown would probably also have a negative impact on real estate lending as well as the level of net charge offs and delinquencies 
since an economic slowdown could have an adverse effect on property values and  for commercial development projects  cause an increase in vacancy rates  the possibility exists for further writedowns  charge offs and the transfer of currently performing loans to a nonaccrual status in the real estate and commercial loan categories 
the mix of loans in the construction and development portfolios are diversified in areas such as office buildings  retail stores and malls  apartment buildings  health care facilities and industrial warehouses 
in addition  the subsidiary banks specialized real estate lending areas review  approve and monitor large real estate credits on a continuing basis 
loan review procedures  including such techniques as loan grading and on site reviews  are constantly utilized by the company s loan review department in order to ensure that potential problem loans are identified early in order to lessen any potentially negative impact such problem loans may have on the company s earnings 
automated loan reports are prepared and used in conjunction with the identification and monitoring of such loans on a monthly basis 
management s involvement continues throughout the process and includes participation in the work out process and recovery activity 
these formalized procedures are monitored internally by the loan review area whose work is supplemented by regulatory agencies that provide an additional level of review on an annual basis 
such review procedures are quantified in monthly and quarterly reports to senior management and are used in determining whether such loans represent potential loss to the company 
special reports are prepared for consumer installment loans to identify trends unique to that portfolio 
a determination of a potential loss will result in a charge to the provision for loan losses  thereby increasing the allowance for loan losses available for potential risk 
management monitors the entire loan portfolio  including loans acquired in business combinations  in an attempt to identify problem loans so that risks in the portfolio can be timely identified and an appropriate allowance maintained 
net loan charge offs increased percent in after decreasing percent in and percent in increases in net charge offs in commercial  financial and agricultural loans and commercial real estate loans constituted the majority of the total million increase in net loan charge offs in the decrease in was due to decreased net charge offs in all loan categories with the exception of commercial real estate 
the decrease in net charge offs in resulted from decreased net charge offs in commercial  financial and agricultural loans  commercial real estate loans  and consumer installment loans 
during  net charge offs of commercial  financial and agricultural loans increased by million and net charge offs of commercial real estate loans increased  while net charge offs of residential real estate mortgages decreased  with regard to the company s consumer installment loan portfolio  net charge offs for credit card receivables increased as a percentage of average volume from percent in to percent in similarly  net charge offs as a percentage of loans in the company s indirect consumer installment portfolio  consisting primarily of new and used automobile loans  increased from percent in to percent in the following table sets forth information with respect to the company s loans and the allowance for loan losses for the five years ended december  summary of loan loss experience in thousands loans  net of unearned income average outstanding during the year      allowance for loan loss es balance at beginning of year      charge offs commercial  financial and agricultural      real estate con struction  real estate mort gage residential   commercial     consumer installment      total      recoveries commercial  financial and agricultural      real estate con struction real estate mort gage residential commercial consumer installment      total      net charge offs      provision charged to in come      additions due to acqui sitions    balance at end of year

when determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management considers changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio  changes in nonperforming and past due loans  historical loan loss experience  the existing risk of individual loans  concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries and existing and prospective economic conditions 
the amount of the allowance remained unchanged at december  from december   representing percent of outstanding loans compared to percent at december  and percent at december  as shown in the following table  management determined that at december   approximately percent of the allowance for loan losses was related to commercial  financial and agricultural loans  percent was associated with real estate loans and percent was related to consumer installment loans 
approximately percent of the allowance remained unallocated to any specific category due to uncertainties related to loan portfolios acquired in connection with business combinations with regard to underwriting standards and other factors 
in addition  a portion of the unallocated allowance is due to the returning of previously nonperforming loans to performing status 
while additional provision is provided with respect to these loans when identified as nonperforming  the corresponding portion of the allowance remains a component of the total allowance upon a loan s return to performing status 
the amount of the allowance allocated to impaired loans by loan category is presented in the table on page allocation of allowance for loan losses december percent percent percent percent percent amount of total amount of total amount of total amount of total amount of total in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural      real estate con struction      real estate mort gage residential      commercial      consumer installment 
     unallocated      nonperforming assets nonperforming assets include loans classified as nonaccrual or renegotiated and foreclosed real estate 
it is the general policy of the subsidiary banks to stop accruing interest income and place the recognition of interest on a cash basis when any commercial  industrial or real estate loan is days or more past due as to principal or interest and the ultimate collection of either is in doubt  unless the loan is well collateralized and in the process of collection 
accrual of interest income on consumer loans is suspended when any payment of principal or interest  or both  is more than days delinquent 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  any interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current income unless the collateral for the loan is sufficient to cover the accrued interest or a guarantor assures payment of interest 
nonperforming assets at december   were million  an increase of million from year end nonperforming loans increased  from year end to million 
the increase in nonperforming assets in was primarily due to the transfer of a large commercial real estate credit previously on nonaccrual status to other real estate owned 
during  million of loans were transferred to other real estate owned offset by total sales of other real estate owned of million 
of these sales  million were cash sales while million represented loans originated by the subsidiary banks to facilitate the sale of other real estate 
during  loans transferred to other real estate owned totaled million  cash sales were million  and loans to facilitate the sale of other real estate owned were million 
even though the stabilization in the commercial real estate market in the southeastern part of the country continued during  management will continue to monitor the company s real estate and commercial loan portfolio during particular attention will be focused on those credits targeted by the loan monitoring and review process 
management continues to emphasize the need to maintain a low level of nonperforming assets and to return current nonperforming assets to an earning status 
renegotiated loans decreased  from year end while foreclosed real estate increased million for the year 
loans past due days or more increased million compared to the year end level 
other foreclosed or repossessed assets at year end totaled  there were no accruing loans greater than  past due days or more at year end at december   nonperforming assets were percent of loans outstanding and foreclosed real estate held for sale compared to percent at year end nonaccrual loans and renegotiated loans as a percentage of loans outstanding at year end were percent and percent  respectively

fas requires loans to be measured for impairment using one of three methods when it is probable that all amounts  including principal and interest  will not be collected in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the amount of impairment and any subsequent changes are recorded through the provision for loan losses as an adjustment to the allowance for loan losses 
fas applies to all loans  whether collateralized or uncollateralized  except for large groups of smaller balance  homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment  loans that are measured at fair value or at the lower of cost or fair value  leases  and debt securities

trading account profits and commissions on bond sales and trading activities increased by million  from a loss of million in to a profit of million in in  trading account profits and commissions on bond sales and trading activities decreased from income of million in to a loss of million 
this million decrease was due in large part to an million decline during the first two quarters of in the market value of speculative securities held in the company s trading account  primarily inverse floaters 
all inverse floaters held in the trading account were sold prior to the end of the second quarter of for  trading account profits related specifically to derivative securities were approximately  consisting of million of profits related to collateralized mortgage obligations held in the trading account offset by  of losses on non cmo derivative securities  specifically options and interest rate swaps  caps  and floors 
it should be noted that changes in the trading account profits and commissions in future years cannot be predicted accurately because of the uncertainty of changes in market conditions 
there can be no assurance that such amounts will or will not continue at their current levels 
for a discussion of interest rate contracts held in the trading account and the composition of the trading account at december   see page the million loss on purchase of securities from common trust fund in resulted from the purchase of inverse floaters by the company during the second quarter of from a common trust fund managed by the trust division of the company s lead bank 
due to the increase in the general level of interest rates during the first six months of  the common trust fund customers faced significant losses on inverse floaters held in the portfolio 
in evaluating the suitability of these investments for the common trust fund subsequent to the decline in market value  the company determined that it would be in the best interests of the company  its lead bank  and its trust customers to purchase these securities at book value from the common trust fund 
as a result of this decision  the company purchased inverse floaters with a fair value of million from the common trust fund at the fund s cost of million with the difference between purchase price and fair value reflected in the company s consolidated statements of income as a separate component of noninterest income 
at december   these securities were classified as held to maturity in the company s investment securities portfolio at million  which represents its cost of million less subsequent principal payments received 
no other high risk derivatives are held by the company in its held to maturity and available for sale portfolios at december  or  other than these inverse floaters held by the parent company 
credit card service charge and fee income increased eight percent in after increasing six percent in increases in merchants discounts and in the annual credit card fees accounted for the increase 
recurring items of other noninterest income increased million in following a decrease of million in the increase in resulted primarily from the lack of trading account losses experienced in along with increases in service charge income 
nonrecurring items of other noninterest income  excluding the loss on purchase of securities from common trust fund  totaled million in and million for nonrecurring items of noninterest income include gains on sales of investment portfolio securities  gains on the sale of fixed assets and other real estate owned  and gains on loan settlements 
nonrecurring items represented three percent of overall noninterest income in  five percent in  and four percent in the net gains on sales of investment securities in were million compared to million in gains on loan settlements at amounts in excess of the discounted carrying values relating to the company s and acquisitions of certain failed banks in texas accounted for percent of the total nonrecurring income for compared to percent in and percent in noninterest expense noninterest expense for increased eight percent following an increase of two percent in total salaries  benefits and commissions increased percent from with regular incentive bonuses increasing percent and sales commission expense increasing percent 
salaries alone increased eight percent during and five percent in due to normal increases relating to additions to staff and merit increases  while the increase in also reflected the impact of staff additions resulting from the company s acquisition of first heights in october  during  other personnel expense  primarily employee benefits  increased less than one percent after decreasing six percent in the decrease in employee benefits during was due to decreased accruals related to the company s projected contributions to the employee stock ownership plan partially offset by increased pension plan expense

   net occupancy expense increased by percent in following an percent increase in these increases in occupancy expense were due principally to bank acquisitions  opening of new branches  and normal renovation of existing properties 
equipment expense remained unchanged in after increasing percent in due to equipment replacements and upgrades necessary to support increased business growth 
other noninterest expense  as reflected in the consolidated statements of income  increased by percent compared to a decrease of percent in professional service expenses increased percent in as a result of increased acquisition activities and expenses incurred in connection with a proxy contest initiated by three directors of the company during the first quarter of bank travel and entertainment expenses increased five percent in  primarily due to acquisition activity 
the amount the subsidiary banks paid for federal deposit insurance decreased million in after increasing million in the decrease in was due to a substantial decrease in the statutory premium rates effective june   resulting in a million refund of deposit insurance premiums received during the third quarter of the year and a substantial reduction in deposit insurance premiums during the last seven months of the year 
the amount of fdic insurance premiums paid by the subsidiary banks is a function of both the subsidiary banks deposit base and the rate at which insurance premiums are assessed by the fdic  which is based in part on the capital adequacy of each bank 
because each of the subsidiary banks meets the regulatory definition of well capitalized  this expense reflects the lowest possible assessment rate charged by the fdic 
due to the fact that in the future insurance assessment rates will be set as a function of the funding level of the bif  it is not possible to estimate the amount of fdic insurance expense that will be paid by the company in future periods 
during  congress considered various proposals for a one time special assessment to be charged on all saif deposits to fully capitalize the saif at percent of insured deposits 
the proposed amount of the special assessment has been as high as per of saif deposits 
assuming that a special assessment were applied at the rate based upon saif insured deposits at december   the company would incur additional deposit insurance premium expense of approximately million which would be charged against current period income

impact of inflation and changing prices a bank s asset and liability structure is substantially different from that of an industrial company in that virtually all assets and liabilities of a bank are monetary in nature 
management believes the impact of inflation on financial results depends upon the company s ability to react to changes in interest rates and  by such reaction  reduce the inflationary impact on performance 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction  or at the same magnitude  as the prices of other goods and services 
as discussed previously  management seeks to manage the relationship between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations  including those resulting from inflation 
various information shown elsewhere in this annual report will assist in the understanding of how well the company is positioned to react to changing interest rates and inflationary trends 
in particular  the summary of net interest income  the maturity distributions  the compositions of the loan and securities portfolios  the data on the interest sensitivity of loans and deposits  and the information related to off balance sheet hedging activities discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements should be considered
