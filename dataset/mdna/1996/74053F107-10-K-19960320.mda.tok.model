item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is to be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements  presented elsewhere in this report under item the information presented has been restated to reflect the merger of fishkill national corporation with and into community bancorp  inc to become hudson chartered bancorp  inc the merger has been accounted for under the pooling of interests method 
financial condition the following table compares the changes in major categories of the company s balance sheet from december  to december  in thousands changes changes from from amount amount amount cash cash equivalents      securities      loans      allowance for loan losses     premises equipment     other     total assets      deposits non interest bearing      interest bearing      total deposits      other interest bearing liabilities      other liabilities      total liabilities      stockholders equity      total liabilities stockholders equity      total assets grew in by million or from year end  to million compared to an increase from december  to december  of million or 
in  the securities portfolio increased million and cash and cash equivalents increased million 
these increases were principally funded by the million increase in deposits 
of the increase in deposits  million were in noninterest bearing deposits  million were interest bearing time deposits and were in savings accounts  offset by declines of million in money market and now accounts 
the bank ran several bankwide promotions in connection with its new branch openings in newburgh and the town of poughkeepsie 
of the total increase in deposits  million is related to the new branches 
additionally  approximately one half of the declines in money market and now accounts is represented by customers shifting their funds into the savings and time deposit products that were promoted during the branch opening promotions referred to above 
management will continue to invest in securities and cash equivalents such as federal funds sold in the absence of strong loan demand as its core deposit levels remain at higher levels than outstanding loans 
of the bank s total deposits million  or approximately  are time deposits greater than  for additional information regarding deposits  see item business deposits 
in  total loans decreased million or from december  commercial and industrial loans decreased million  principally reflecting a reclassification to real estate mortgage of million and million to real estate construction 
in september  the company conformed the presentations of the separate loan portfolios of the predecessors to the bank 
real estate mortgage loans decreased million reflecting the sale of million of previously originated long term fixed rate mortgages and the reclassification referred to above 
the company sold the fixed rate mortgages to improve its interest rate risk profile 
installment  consumer and other loans increased million reflecting the continued success of the company s indirect automobile financing business 
the increase in assets in was primarily the result of the increase in loans of million over year end of this increase  million were commercial and industrial loans which came both from new loans and from refinancing of existing loans from competitors 
installment  consumer and other loans increased million principally due to the company s resumption of indirect automobile financing business 
real estate mortgage loans accounted for an additional million of the increase as the company retained million of originated adjustable rate mortgages and increased its commercial real estate mortgage loans by million 
the growth in loans in was funded by a decline in cash and cash equivalents of million  a decline in securities of million and an increase in deposits of million 
of this increase in deposits  million was due to acquisitions and the remaining million was due to the general increase in the level of deposits 
in november  the company transferred  at fair value  securities having a fair value of million carrying value of million from its held to maturity securities to its portfolio of available for sale securities 
this was done to enhance the company s ability to manage its interest rate risk 
the securities transferred represent almost all of the readily marketable securities that were previously classified as held to maturity 
this transfer was made in accordance with fasb s a guide to implementation of statement on accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities issued in november concurrent with the adoption of this guidance  corporations were permitted through december   to reclassify their available for sale and held to maturity securities without calling into question the past intent of an entity to hold securities to maturity 
the effect of this transfer  after tax  was a million increase in shareholders equity 
future changes in unrealized gains or losses on these transferred securities also will be reflected in a special component of the company s equity accounts  on an after tax basis 
if any of the transferred securities are sold  the realized gains or losses would be reflected in the company s results of operations 
securities of million remaining in the company s held to maturity portfolio consist principally of holdings of local  unrated municipal issues and certain other holdings 
the allowance for loan losses at million  represents of outstanding loans and of nonperforming loans and restructured troubled debt at december  compared to million or and of nonperforming loans and restructured troubled debt at year end premises and equipment decreased 
million in expenditures for premises and equipment totaled million primarily related to the opening of two new branches and completion of the integration of the former banks 
this was fully offset by depreciation expense recorded of million 
premises and equipment increased million in principally due to the acquisition of a building for million on a site adjacent to the company s lagrangeville executive offices 
furniture and equipment increased by million in  of which million were expenditures necessary for the integration of the former banks 
such expenditures included communications equipment  branch equipment  computer upgrades  and proof and transit equipment 
such increases were somewhat offset by depreciation expense in other assets increased 
million in of which 
million relates to increases in accrued interest income 
other assets increased million in of this increase  approximately million was due to increases in deferred and prepaid income taxes 
approximately 
million was due to the intangibles associated with the amenia and millerton branch office acquisitions  and 
million was due to increases in accrued interest receivable 
other interest bearing liabilities decreased million in as the company repaid its liability associated with securities sold under repurchase agreements 
other interest bearing liabilities increased by million in these increases include a million advance from the federal home loan bank to match fund a fixed rate loan and million in securities sold under a repurchase agreement at year end 
this increase was offset by the repayment of a 
million loan  from another bank  upon consummation of the merger 
other liabilities decreased million in as the expenses accrued in were paid 
other liabilities increased million in  primarily due to increases in staff related accrued expenses of 
million 
of this amount  approximately 
million was related to severances to be paid in and 
million in liabilities related to retirement plan funding 
also  
million was recorded in other liabilities to reflect post merger integration costs 
stockholders equity increased million or to million at december  of this increase  million was due to retentions of earnings  million was from net sales of new shares under the company s stock option and dividend investment and stock purchase plans  and from the increase  after tax  in the net unrealized gain component of stockholders equity 
the company also repurchased 
l million in treasury stock under its common stock repurchase program 
additionally  in december of  the board of directors declared a common stock dividend  payable in january as a result  million of retained earnings was capitalized into common stock and surplus 
stockholders equity declined by million or in  compared to december   due to an unrealized after tax depreciation in the fair market value of the available for sale securities portfolio of million  from year end and the retirement of the series a preferred stock of 
million 
these declines were offset by the issuance of new common stock under various shareholder and employee stock option plans of 
million and earnings retention of 
million 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity management involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of customers who may be depositors wishing to withdraw funds or borrowers who need to draw funds under their available credit facilities 
as detailed in the company s consolidated statement of cash flows included in the financial statements  cash flows are derived from three sources cash flows from operating activities  cash flows from investing activities and cash flows from financing activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in investing activities primarily purchases of securities and the funding of loans used million in as purchases of securities of million exceeded sales  maturities  and prepayment of loans and securities 
financing activities provided million represented by million increases in deposits and new common stock issuances of million offset by stockholders  dividends of million and the repayment of the repurchase agreements of million 
the overall result was an increase in cash and cash equivalents of million to million at december  the company s liquidity ratio defined as cash and cash equivalents plus securities available for sale million to total assets was at year end the average life of the available for sale portfolio  adjusted for rate sensitivity  is approximately years 
these liquid assets  together with maturing loans  are deemed by management to be more than adequate to meet expected liquidity needs 
in addition  the bank is a member of the federal home loan bank and has the ability to borrow substantial funds million under its secured advance program 
the holding company s own liquidity needs are chiefly for paying dividends 
the principal source of income for the company is dividends and rents received from the bank 
dividends from the bank are subject to certain regulatory limitations 
the company has ample cash and investments at the holding company level to meet its reasonably anticipated cash needs in financial institutions assets are monetary in nature and are thus impacted by inflation  interest rate and credit considerations 
this results in the need to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
in addition  the company and the bank are subject to regulatory requirements to maintain minimum capital levels 
these capital requirements and the actual levels maintained by the bank and the company are summarized in note o to the consolidated financial statements 
the capital levels of both the bank and the company exceed all regulatory requirements and the company believes that the levels maintained  as of december   qualify both the company and the bank for well capitalized status under regulatory definitions 
further  the company believes that the capital levels maintained are more than adequate to meet its currently foreseeable needs and that additional capital resources would be required only for exceptional investment opportunities 
stockholders equity includes million of series b cumulative  convertible preferred stock carrying a dividend rate of 
the terms of the series b preferred stock allow for the redemption by the company if the closing bid price for the common stock exceeds for a period of consecutive trading days 
due to the recent trading levels of the company s common stock  if the company called such common stock for redemption  management believes that shareholders owning the series b preferred stock would exercise the conversion privilege associated with the preferred stock and that it would be unlikely that a significant decline in capital would result 
however  if the company did redeem the preferred stock  it believes that the current liquid assets  in addition to the dividends available from the bank  are sufficient to fully redeem the series b preferred stock and still maintain capital levels for which the bank and the company would continue to be considered well capitalized 
under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  the bank s regulator is required to develop risk based capital standards to ensure that those standards take adequate account of interest rate risk  concentration of credit risk  the risk of nontraditional activities and the actual performance and expected risk of loss on multi family mortgages 
such standards may have the effect of increasing the level of regulatory capital that the company and bank are required to maintain 
asset liability management the primary functions of asset liability management are to assure adequate liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and capital resources 
the company s investment committee of the board operating through its treasury division controls the rate sensitivity of the balance sheet while maintaining an appropriate level of net interest income contribution to the operations of the company 
the company s net interest revenue is affected by fluctuations in market interest rates as a result of timing differences in the repricing of its assets and liabilities 
these repricing differences are quantified in specific time intervals and are referred to as interest rate sensitivity gaps 
the company manages the interest rate risk of current and future earnings to a level that is consistent with its mix of businesses and seeks to limit such risk exposure to appropriate percentages of both earnings and the value of stockholders equity 
the objective in managing interest rate risk is to support the achievement of business strategies  while controlling earnings variability and ensuring appropriate liquidity 
management of interest rate risk focuses on both tactical one year or less and structural beyond one year time frames 
the company has established interest rate risk limits based on an earnings at risk ear concept and a market value of portfolio s equity mvpe 
ear measures the potential adverse impact on earnings from a given change in the yield curve  while the market value of portfolio equity risk limit is set in terms of changes in the economic present value of future cash flow streams 
model parameters are determined based on past interest rate movements and are regularly updated 
ear is calculated by multiplying the gap between asset and liability maturities repricings by given changes in the yield curve 
mvpe is calculated by subtracting the net present value of deposits and other interest bearing liabilities from the net present value of interest earning assets using the same yield curve model 
both mvpe and ear are measured assuming a change in market interest rates up basis points and down basis points over both a one year and three year horizon 
compliance with established limits is monitored by the investment committee and the company s interest rate risk profile is presented quarterly to the board of directors 
both mvpe and ear assesses the company s interest rate risk based on the company s current asset and liability mix 
the following chart in thousands provides a quantification of the company s interest rate sensitivity gap as of december   based upon the known repricing dates of certain assets and liabilities and the assumed repricing dates of others 
as shown in the chart below  at december   assuming no management action  the company s near term interest rate risk is to a declining rate environment  that is  net interest revenue would be expected to be adversely affected by a decline in interest rates below the rates embedded in the current yield curve 
over the first three months of  approximately of the company s interest rate sensitivity is related to changes in short term interest rates  particularly the prime rate 
interest rate risk exposure in the one year time frame is to a rising rate scenario  principally due to a high level of fixed rate assets relative to liabilities that would reprice in that time frame 
this chart displays only a static view of the company s interest rate sensitivity gap and does not capture the dynamics of balance sheet  rate and spread movements nor management s actions that may be taken to manage this position

the gaps measure the time weighted dollar equivalent volume of positions fixed for a particular period 
the gap positions reflect a repricing date at which date funds are assumed to mature and reprice to a current market rate for the asset or liability 
the table does not include loans in nonaccrual status or net unrealized gains recorded on available for sale securities as of december variable rate balances are reported based on their repricing formulas 
fixed rate balances are reported based on their scheduled contractual maturity dates  except for certain investment securities and loans secured by family residential properties that are based on anticipated cash flows 
prime priced loans and investments are considered as to month assets 
savings accounts one half of the level of merit savings accounts  which reprice against changes in the federal reserve discount rate  are classified as three months or less maturities 
managements analysis of changes in levels indicate that changes in this rate are approximately half as often as changes in other market rates 
the balance of these accounts and other savings accounts are classified as four months to one year maturities  reflecting the lagging period that historically exists in rates paid on passbook and savings accounts 
other deposits time deposits are classified by contractual maturity or repricing frequency 
now accounts are classified as four months to one year maturities 
the balance of deposits are considered less than three month maturities  including all money market deposit accounts 
the interest rate sensitivity assumptions presented for these deposits are based on historical and current experiences regarding balance retention and interest rate repricing behavior 
non interest bearing deposit liabilities were approximately million at december  mortgage backed and sba securities of us government agencies the company currently invests in mortgage backed securities fhlmc  fnma  and gnma and sba pooled loans in connection with its asset liability management strategy 
as of december   the company had million in fixed rate securities and million in adjustable rate securities of this nature 
these securities are all guaranteed by us government agencies and are  therefore  of the highest investment grade 
these securities are subject to varying monthly payments due to varying early prepayments by the borrowers on the underlying loans 
as a general rule  when interest rates rise  prepayments slow down  extending the maturities of the fixed rate securities 
conversely  when interest rates decline  prepayments rise  as many of the borrowers refinance their loans at lower rate levels 
the company may not be able to reinvest the proceeds of prepayments in securities or other earning assets with comparable yields  which can adversely affect net interest income 
prepayment levels affect the contractual repayment profile of the securities 
these uncertainties cause more volatile market value shifts than do serial or single payment bonds  particularly as interest rates rise 
the company manages this portion of its investment portfolio by only investing in such fixed rate securities with expected average lives of years but not greater than years  or in adjustable rate securities which evidence lower price volatility due to the adjustable rate feature 
the company has no holdings of high risk securities as defined by the federal financial institutions examination council

in vs 
 net interest income was positively impacted by million due to increases in average earning assets  primarily in average loans 
however  the growth in savings and time deposits was greater than the growth in average earning assets 
therefore  the company s increase in interest cost due to higher interest rates paid on deposits offset the increases in income received on securities and loans resulting in a lower net interest margin net interest income as a percentage of earning assets 
although the level of interest rates declined during  the average level of interest rates remained higher during vs 
the average level of interest rates for net interest income was negatively impacted by less than one hundred thousand dollars due to the average effects of the interest rate changes 
in vs 
 net interest income was positively impacted by million due to increases in average balances 
the primary component of this increase was increases in average outstanding loan balances offset somewhat by increases in average savings account balances 
net interest income was negatively impacted by million due to changes in interest rates 
of this amount  average loan interest yields declined million reflecting new business generated at lower yields than the portfolio earned in  as well as increases of 
million in interest expense as interest costs began to rise on interest bearing deposits  primarily savings accounts 
in order to protect net interest margin  the bank emphasized variable rate loans in which generally start with lower interest rates which will increase as interest rates rise 
the rise in variable loan rates in the portfolio  however  is on a lagging basis as loans typically adjust from one to three months after a prime rate change occurs 
the bank has approximately million or of its loan portfolio adjustable with prime rate changes 
asset quality and provisions for loan losses the following table presents details of the company s nonperforming assets and restructured loans 
the accrual of interest income is generally discontinued when a loan becomes days past due as to interest or principal or  with respect to current loans  if management has doubts about the ability of the borrower to regularly pay interest and or principal on a timely basis 
when interest accruals are discontinued  any interest income credited to the current year which has not been collected is reversed  and any interest accrued in the prior year is charged to the allowance for loan losses 
management may elect to continue the accrual of interest when the loan is in the process of collection and the estimated fair value of the collateral is sufficient to cover the principal and accrued interest 
if payments on nonaccrual loans are made  income is recorded when received unless management has reason to doubt the ultimate collectibility of the principal remaining on the loan 
loans are returned to accrual status once the doubt concerning collectibility has been removed and the borrower has demonstrated performance in accordance with the loan terms and conditions 
the table below summarizes the company s nonperforming assets and restructured loans for the years indicated in thousands years ended december  nonaccrual loans      accruing loans past due days or more restructured loans and troubled debt total non performing loans      amount collateralized by real estate      other real estate owned     total non performing assets      nonaccrual status denotes loans on which  in the opinion of management  the collection of interest is unlikely  or loans that meet other nonaccrual criteria as established by regulatory authorities 
payments received on loans classified as nonaccrual are either applied to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income  depending upon management s assessment of the collectibility of the loan

other real estate owned oreo comprised twelve properties at december  of which one was a commercial office building  one commercial business  seven were residences and three were small parcels of vacant land 
during the year  the company disposed of million in oreo properties 
management continues to secure loans with real estate in order to minimize the risks of collectibility of its loan portfolio 
for a discussion of concentrations of credit risk and impaired loans  see notes c and d to the consolidated financial statements under item contained herein

the evaluation considers  in addition to the results of a continuous program of individual loan assessment  factors including  but not limited to  general economic conditions and recent trends  loan portfolio composition  the level of nonperforming assets  prior loan loss experience and trends  growth of the portfolio and management s statistical estimate of losses inherent in the portfolio 
the company has not been involved in any foreign loans or highly leveraged transactions  which are generally considered high risk loans 
the provision for loan losses decreased by  or in compared to a decrease of  or in provisioning policy has led to an increase in the allowance for loan losses in recent years 
the ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans has increased from in to in the ratio of the allowance to nonperforming loans does not reflect collateral values  although the large majority of the bank s nonperforming assets are collateralized by real estate 
net charge offs of loans were million in as compared to million in and million in management is very cognizant of the uncertainties of the local marketplace  due to the employment cutbacks of the region s principal employers  ibm and the state of new york 
although dutchess county s unemployment rate has dropped to  its lowest level in five years  ulster county continues to experience a loss of jobs  with an unemployment rate of at year end while dutchess county appears to be rebounding with slight increases in both manufacturing and service sector jobs  ulster county has yet to show any overall improvement 
manufacturing employment in both counties remains some below its peak 
total home sales were comparable to levels in both dutchess county and ulster county  but with continued decreases in average selling prices of  somewhat reflecting the lower purchasing power associated with retail and trade employment 
management has also considered the direct effect of the ibm cutbacks 
the bank has no credit exposure to ibm  although it provides consumer and residential mortgage loans to ibm employees 
loans to such employees do not represent a material proportion of the bank s portfolio 
commercial office and industrial vacancy rates excluding ibm space remain high 
there has been some take up of space previously rented by ibm or businesses previously connected with ibm  and as ibm appears to have completed its downsizing  its efforts to rent its own space have yielded some significant results to date  particularly in east fishkill 
furthermore  governor pataki plans to move approximately  state related jobs to and occupy over  square feet of ibm space in kingston 
although the proposal has encountered many political problems  if fully implemented in late or early  as planned  this could have a positive effect both on commercial and office property values  as well as residential property values 
despite these positive developments  the local economy continues to perform less favorably in comparison to many other regions of the united states 
management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover credit risk inherent in the portfolio but no assurance can be given that the current apparent stabilization of the local economy will not be unsettled by future events 
such developments would be expected to adversely affect the financial performance of the company
