item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial review dollars in thousands  except per share data and as otherwise noted introduction firstbank provides banking  trust and other financial services through its operating subsidiaries in illinois and missouri 
the following discussion and related financial information is presented to aid in the understanding of firstbank s current financial position and recent results of operations 
this analysis provides a more comprehensive review than the consolidated financial statements alone  but should be read in conjunction with those statements  which are presented elsewhere in this report 
firstbank s recent acquisition activity is important to consider when reviewing the financial information included in this annual report 
in january firstbank completed its acquisition of first highland corp 
highland and its wholly owned subsidiary  the first national bank of highland 
in april the company acquired colonial bancshares  inc colonial and its wholly owned subsidiary  colonial bank 
in november firstbank completed its acquisition of confluence bancshares corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary  duchesne bank duchesne 
each of these transactions has been accounted for as a pooling of interests 
accordingly  financial information for all periods presented in firstbank s consolidated financial statements has been restated to include the historical results of these companies prior to their merger with firstbank 
also in connection with these mergers  certain nonrecurring charges were recorded which had a negative effect on firstbank s restated earnings in the fourth quarter of these nonrecurring charges are important to consider when reviewing the provision for possible loan losses and noninterest expenses in this report 
income statement analysis summary firstbank s net income for was  an increase of over the restated net income of  in on a per share basis  earnings for were  up from in this followed an increase of in net income and a increase in corresponding earnings per share amounts for as compared to net income for included the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the one time gain associated with this accounting change was  or 
on a per share basis 
earnings for represented a return on average assets of and a return on average equity of 
this compares to a and return on average assets and a and return on average equity as restated for and  respectively 
net interest income the largest source of firstbank s income is net interest income 
net interest income is the spread between interest income on earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest expense on liabilities used to fund those assets  such as deposits and funds borrowed 
net interest income is affected by both changes in the level of interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
changes in net interest income are frequently measured by the net interest margin 
the net interest margin is expressed as net interest income divided by average earning assets and reported on a tax equivalent basis 
the company s net interest income in was  a decrease of from  in and from the  in the tax equivalent net interest margin was for as compared to and for the years of and  respectively 
the interest rate environment within which financial institutions have operated during the last three years has caused compression in the interest margins of firstbank and the industry as a whole 
page average earnings assets increased in by  or  to  this slight increase is comprised primarily of higher loan volumes funded by core deposit growth and investment security maturities during while only a slight increase in total  the average earning asset mix shifted from investment securities to loans during average loans increased  while average investments declined  in as compared to similarly  interest bearing liabilities remained flat overall but funding shifted from short term borrowings to interest bearing deposits during average interest bearing deposits  primarily in the time deposit category  increased  and short term borrowings declined  in as compared to the company s efforts to generate more core deposit funding increased overall funding costs slightly which resulted in narrower margins in provision for possible loan losses the provision for possible loan losses charged to earnings during was  compared to  and  in and  respectively 
the provision  which has been restated to reflect the colonial acquisition  included a one time fourth quarter provision to conform colonial s loan valuation policies and practices with those of firstbank 
the declining provision is consistent with the continued low nonperforming loan levels and record low net charge offs reported in the resulting reserve for possible loan losses was of outstanding loans at december  as compared to a year earlier 
although this is a slight decline in the percentage  net charge offs for were at a five year low of 
of average loans and the reserve s coverage of nonperforming loans remained strong at 
noninterest income noninterest income reached  in  up from  in  and  in the increase of was made possible by firstbank s continued focus on trust  agricultural and investment services 
beginning as part of a restructuring in  company efforts have resulted in significant noninterest revenue growth in and combined revenues from these areas were   and  in   and  respectively 
these increases of in and in allowed firstbank to report noninterest income growth during periods when revenues from deposit service charges and small business lending programs showed declines 
firstbank s secondary market mortgage lending and servicing activities  which were flat because of higher interest rates during  rebounded in and added to firstbank s fee income growth 
noninterest expense the company s noninterest expense declined to  in from  in and  in salaries and employee benefits  the largest component of noninterest expense  declined to  in and to  in reductions in salaries and benefits expense in each of the last two years are a result of gradual reduction in the number of employees and continuing efforts to centralize or consolidate certain activities  resulting in improved efficiency 
these activities  which include deposit and item processing  data processing  indirect consumer lending  real estate loan servicing  and consumer loan collections  are performed behind the scenes and result in changes transparent to customers 
approximately  of the  decline in is attributable to one time charges in as a result of the acquisition of colonial 
another significant expense reduction in resulted from the decision by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic to reduce deposit insurance premiums for member banks effective june  approximately million less was expensed in compared to the further premium reduction recently announced by the fdic should provide further reduction in this expense category in income taxes income tax expense for was  as compared to  for and  for firstbank s effective tax rates were  and for the last three years 
the increase in the effective rate in is primarily attributable to lower tax exempt income and higher state tax expense than in the previous two years 
state taxes have increased as the company s interest income on us government securities  which is exempt for state income tax purposes  has declined 
page balance sheet analysis total assets reached  at december   an increase of over the restated  a year earlier 
total deposits increased  or  while firstbank s short term borrowings declined  this shift  combined with the net new funding provided by the deposit growth  allowed firstbank to add  in net new loans during the year 
while the overall balance sheet growth was not significant  these changes in the asset and liability mix should improve the company s interest rate margin 
investment securities the investment securities classified as available for sale were steady at just over million at december  and the held to maturity portfolio  which is comprised almost exclusively of longer term municipal securities  declined  to  at year end market value fluctuations in the available for sale portfolio are reflected in the equity section of the company s balance sheet  whereas securities in the held to maturity category are recorded at amortized cost 
the equity adjustment for the unrealized losses on available for sale securities was at december   which is down from  a year earlier 
loans as mentioned above  firstbank added  or  to the consolidated loan portfolio during with the corresponding growth in deposits during the year  the loan to deposit ratio of at year end was not significantly different from the a year earlier 
the growth during the year was primarily in the commercial and consumer loan categories as the following table indicates december  of of of total total total dollars in millions commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction residential mortgage commercial mortgage agricultural installment  net of unearned discount the company also provides long term variable and fixed rate financing on residential real estate through two of its subsidiary banks 
originated loans are sold into the secondary market without recourse  with   and  sold during  and  respectively 
at december   the company serviced  loans aggregating  which were owned by others 
deposits total deposits increased considerably during the year as firstbank implemented a strategy of reducing its reliance on short term borrowings as a source of funding 
several time deposit promotions during resulted in much of the  growth in interest bearing deposits experienced during page short term borrowings short term borrowings  which funded most of the asset growth in  were reduced  during as a result of the deposit growth 
short term borrowings primarily represent federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
long term borrowings in connection with two acquisitions completed in  firstbank incurred long term borrowings totaling  originally five year term debt  this obligation was repaid in its entirety on june  capital adequacy firstbank believes that a strong capital position is vital to continued profitability and to promote depositor and investor confidence 
firstbank s consolidated capital levels are a result of its capital policy which establishes guidelines for each subsidiary based on industry standards  regulatory requirements  perceived risk of the various businesses  and future growth opportunities 
firstbank s december  equity to asset and tangible equity to asset ratios were and up from and  respectively  at the end of the increase in the equity ratios is attributable to the growth in retained earnings and a reduction of unrealized losses on investment securities available for sale 
the december  equity to asset ratio excluding such unrealized losses is 
at december   firstbank and its banking subsidiaries all exceed their minimum capital requirements for well capitalized institutions 
consolidated firstbank tier  total capital and tier leverage ratios were  and  respectively at december  the minimum capital ratios for well capitalized institutions are  and for tier  total capital and tier leverage ratios  respectively 
shareholders equity represents book value and tangible book value per common share of and  respectively  at december   as compared to and  respectively  at december  risk management management s objective in structuring the consolidated balance sheets is to maximize the return on average assets while minimizing the associated risks 
the major risks with which firstbank is concerned are market  credit  liquidity and interest rate risks 
at the present time  management is not aware of any known trends  events or uncertainties that will have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the company s liquidity  capital resources or results of operations 
management is also unaware of any current recommendations by the regulatory authorities which  if they were to be implemented  would have such an effect 
the following is a discussion concerning firstbank s management of these risks 
market risk management management believes firstbank s loan and investment portfolios are sufficiently diversified so as to minimize the effect of a downturn in any particular industry or geographic region 
the company does not have any particular concentration of credit in any one economic sector 
loans related to agriculture and those secured by commercial real estate do not represent a significant concentration within the consolidated loan portfolio 
real estate mortgage loans are generally made for single family dwellings as primary residences of the borrowers 
installment loans are generally made for direct or indirect auto financing  through automobile dealers located throughout the subsidiary banks markets 
firstbank s asset liability management committee monitors market valuation risk on the investment securities portfolio 
this process involves measurement of the general maturity  interest rate and liquidity risk in the investment securities portfolio 
page the company has approximately of its investment portfolio designated as available for sale 
the unrealized losses  net of tax  on that portfolio were and  at december  and  respectively  and are reflected as a reduction in the equity section of the balance sheet 
the current unrealized loss  which has declined to less than of the total available for sale market value  is an indication that the aggregate yield is very close to year end market rates 
credit risk management management of the risks the company assumes in providing credit products to customers is extremely important 
credit risk management includes defining an acceptable level of risk and return  establishing appropriate policies and procedures to govern the credit process and maintaining a thorough portfolio review process 
credit policies  which are drafted and approved at the individual subsidiary bank level  are ultimately the responsibility of firstbank management and  as such  are also reviewed and approved at the parent company level 
of equal importance in this risk management process are the ongoing monitoring procedures performed by firstbank s internal audit and loan review personnel 
credit policies are examined and underwriting procedures reviewed for compliance each year 
loan review personnel also monitor loans after disbursement in an attempt to recognize any deterioration which may occur  so appropriate corrective action can be initiated on a timely basis 
these programs have resulted in what firstbank believes to be an adequate reserve position and a quality loan portfolio 
firstbank s loan portfolio contains certain risk elements which are defined as nonperforming loans 
this category includes loans on nonaccrual  loans contractually past due ninety days or more as to interest or principal payments  and other loans for which terms have been renegotiated or restructured because of deterioration in the financial condition of the borrowers 
those nonperforming loans represented of total loans at the end of as compared to at the end of the reserve for possible loan losses was  at december   representing of outstanding loans 
net charge offs as a percentage of average loans for were 
these figures compare to a reserve and net charge offs for continued strength in all measures of asset quality is indicative of the priority management has given to maintaining asset quality 
the company adopted revised accounting methods for impaired loans in  as mandated by statement of financial accounting standards no 
as amended by sfas no 

this statement does not apply to smaller balance homogeneous loans which management has assessed to include consumer and home equity loans 
accordingly  the loan classifications affected by the statement are commercial  financial and agricultural  real estate  industrial revenue bonds  and other loans 
the adoption of the statement did not result in a significant change in the company s risk identification process 
this statement requires that a loan be reported as impaired when it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the company s loan policy generally requires that a credit meeting the above criteria be placed on nonaccrual status  however  loans which are past due more than days as to the payment of principal or interest are also considered to be impaired 
these loans are included in the total of nonperforming assets 
loans past due less than days are generally not considered impaired  however  a loan which is current as to payments may be determined by management to demonstrate some of the characteristics of an impaired loan 
in these cases  the loan is classified as impaired while management evaluates the appropriate course of action 
the company s primary basis for measurement of impaired loans is the collateral underlying the identified loan 
because of the similarities between the company s risk identification process before and after the adoption of the statement  management does not believe the comparability of the nonperforming asset table was affected 
in addition  management does not anticipate any changes in the company s charge off policy as a result of the adoption of this statement 
page liquidity and interest rate sensitivity throughout and the first half of  assets were repricing at lower levels while deposit funding had reached somewhat of a pricing floor 
during the last six months of and in  increasing competition for both loan and deposit growth combined with a flat or inverted yield curve further pressured interest margins industry wide 
regardless of the interest rate environment  firstbank s management of rate sensitive earning assets and interest bearing liabilities is a key component of continued profitability 
management s objective is to produce an optimal yield while protecting earnings from significant fluctuations 
an effective asset liability management process is necessary to minimize the effects of fluctuating interest rates on net interest income while maintaining the flexibility to take advantage of changing market conditions 
the following discusses firstbank s liquidity and interest rate risk management 
liquidity risk management the primary source of firstbank s liquidity is short term investments in federal funds sold 
additional liquidity is provided through firstbank s available for sale investment portfolio 
firstbank s liquidity is further enhanced by the availability of funds through its correspondent relationships maintained by one of its largest subsidiary banks 
some central and downstate illinois correspondent banks utilize this subsidiary bank for their daily federal funds investments 
generally  the subsidiary bank will purchase such funds as agent  passing the funds through to other larger correspondent banks 
however  should firstbank face a tight liquidity position on any particular day  the subsidiary bank may retain such funds as principal  rather than passing them to upstream correspondent banks 
each affiliate bank controls its own asset liability mix within the constraints of its individual loan and deposit structure  with overall guidance from firstbank through an asset liability management committee 
firstbank maintains a central investment portfolio management function to maximize the benefits of investment decisions  based on the consolidated tax  liquidity and market concentration positions 
interest rate risk management interest rate sensitivity is closely monitored through firstbank s asset liability management procedures 
at the end of this discussion is a table reflecting firstbank s interest rate gap rate sensitive assets minus rate sensitive liabilities analysis at december   individually and cumulatively  through various time horizons 
at december  and december   the static gap analyses indicated substantial liability sensitivity over a one year time horizon 
generally  such a position indicates that an overall rise in interest rates would result in an unfavorable impact on the company s net interest margin  as liabilities would reprice more quickly than assets 
conversely  the net interest margin would be expected to improve with an overall decline in interest rates 
as savings  now and money market accounts are subject to withdrawal on demand  they are presented in the analysis as immediately repriceable 
based on the company s experience  pricing on such deposits is not expected to change in direct correlation with changes in the general level of short term interest rates 
accordingly  management believes that a gradual increase in the general level of interest rates will not have a material effect on the company s net interest income 
this traditional method of measuring interest rate risk does not  in management s opinion  adequately assess many of the variables that affect the company s net interest margin 
as a result firstbank places more emphasis on the use of simulation analysis 
using this technique  the impact of various interest rate scenarios on firstbank s net interest margin are analyzed and management strategies adjusted to maintain the interest margin within certain tolerance ranges 
the company s simulation analysis evaluates the effect on net interest income of alternative interest rate scenarios against earnings in a stable interest rate environment 
the december  simulation analysis  using the assumptions described above  projected net interest income to decrease by and the net interest margin to contract by basis points if rates increase percentage points in the next months 
if rates fall percentage points  the net interest income was projected to increase and the net interest margin projected page to expand basis points 
at december   the analysis projected net interest income to decrease and the net interest margin to contract basis points if the general level of interest rates increased by percentage points over the next months 
each quarter 
conversely  the analysis projected net interest income to increase and the net interest margin to expand by basis points if the general level of interest rates fell by percentage points over the next months 
each quarter 
the asset liability management process  which involves structuring the consolidated balance sheet to allow approximately equal amounts of assets and liabilities to reprice at the same time  is a process essential to minimize the effect of fluctuating interest rates on net interest income 
the following table reflects firstbank s interest rate gap rate sensitive assets minus rate sensitive liabilities analysis as of december   individually and cumulatively  through various time horizons 
loans scheduled to reprice are reported in the earliest possible repricing interval for this analysis 
remaining maturity if fixed rate  earliest possible repricing interval if floating rate over over over months months months year or through through through over less months months years years interest earning assets loans      investment securities      other interest earning assets  total interest earning assets      interest bearing liabilities savings  now  and money market accounts  time certificates of deposit of or more     all other time deposits      nondeposit interest bearing liabilities  total interest bearing liabilities      gap by period      cumulative gap      as indicated in the preceding table  firstbank operates on a short term basis similar to most other financial institutions  as its liabilities  with savings and now accounts included  could reprice more quickly than its assets 
however  the process of asset liability management in a financial institution is subject to economic events not easily predicted 
firstbank believes its current asset liability management program will allow adequate reaction time for trends in the marketplace as they occur  minimizing the negative impact of such trends on net interest margins 
the stability of firstbank s net interest margin over the past three years has illustrated the success of these efforts 
accounting pronouncements effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures sfas  which amends sfas sfas as amended by sfas defines the recognition criteria for loan impairment and the measurement methods for certain impaired loans and loans for which terms have been modified in troubled debt restructurings a restructured loan 
specifically  a loan is considered impaired when it is probable a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due both principal and interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
page when measuring impairment  the expected future cash flows of an impaired loan are required to be discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
alternatively  impairment can be measured by reference to an observable market price  if one exists  or the fair value of the collateral for a collateral dependent loan 
regardless of the historical measurement method used  sfas requires a creditor to measure impairment based on the fair value of the collateral when the creditor determines foreclosure is probable 
additionally  impairment of a restructured loan is measured by discounting the total expected future cash flows at the loan s effective rate of interest as stated in the original loan agreement 
sfas amends sfas to allow a creditor to use existing methods for recognizing interest income on an impaired loan 
the company has elected to continue to use its existing nonaccrual methods for recognizing interest on impaired loans 
the company continues to apply all payments received on impaired loans to the outstanding balance of the loan until such time as the loan balance is reduced to zero  after which payments are applied to interest income until such time as the forgone interest is recovered  or until such time as an improvement in the condition of the loan has occurred which would warrant resumption of interest accruals 
as of the adoption date of january   the company had impaired loans in the amount of  which is represented by the loans on nonaccrual status at december  no specific reserve was allocated to impaired loans at january  the adoption of sfas and sfas resulted in no prospective adjustment to the provision for possible loan losses 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas provides guidance for recognition and measurement of impairment of long lived assets  certain identifiable intangibles  and goodwill related both to assets to be held and used and assets to be disposed of 
the statement requires entities to perform separate calculations for assets to be held and used to determine whether recognition of an impairment loss is required and  if so  to measure impairment 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the asset s carrying amount  an impairment loss can be recognized 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows is more than the asset s carrying amount  an impairment loss cannot be recognized 
measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset 
sfas also requries long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be disposed of to be reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  the statement is not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements of firstbank 
in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for mortgage servicing rights sfas which requires that a mortgage banking enterprise recognize as separate assets the rights to service mortgage loans for others at the origination or purchase date of the loan  when the enterprise has a definitive plan to sell or securitize the loans and retain the mortgage servicing rights  assuming the fair value of the loans and servicing rights may be practically estimated 
otherwise  servicing rights should be recognized when the underlying loans are sold or securitized  using an allocation of total cost of the loans based on the relative fair values at the date of sale 
sfas also requires an assessment of capitalized mortgage servicing rights for impairment to be based on the current fair value of those rights 
the company adopted sfas as of october  and recorded mortgage servicing assets of during sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas provides guidance for accounting and reporting standards for stock based employee compensation plans 
sfas defines a fair value based method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity instrument and encourages all entities to adopt that method of accounting for all of their employee stock compensation plans 
however  it also allows an entity to continue to measure compensation cost for those plans using the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
entities electing to remain with the accounting in opinion must make pro forma disclosures of net income and  if presented  earnings per share  as if the fair value based method of accounting defined in sfas had been applied 
under the fair value based method  compensation cost is measured at the grant date on the value of the award and is recognized over the service period  which is usually the vesting period 
under the intrinsic value page based method  compensation cost is the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of the stock at grant date or other measurement date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
most fixed stock option plans  including the company s stock option plan  have no intrinsic value at grant date  and under opinion no compensation cost is recognized 
sfas is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  the company has elected to continue to use the intrinsic value based method of accounting 
sfas is not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements of the company 
effects of inflation persistent high rates of inflation can have a significant effect on the reported financial condition and results of operations of all industries 
however  the asset and liability structure of a bank holding company is substantially different from that of an industrial company  in that virtually all assets and liabilities of a bank holding company are monetary in nature 
accordingly  changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on a bank holding company s performance 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction  or in the same magnitude  as the prices of other goods and services 
inflation does have an impact on the growth of total assets in the banking industry  often resulting in a need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
one of the most important effects that inflation could have on the banking industry would be to reduce the proportion of earnings paid out in the form of dividends 
although it is obvious that inflation affects the growth of total assets  it is difficult to measure the impact precisely 
only new assets acquired in each year are directly affected  so a simple adjustment of asset totals by use of an inflation index is not meaningful 
the results of operations also have been affected by inflation  but again there is no simple way to measure the effect on the various categories of income and expense 
interest rates in particular are significantly affected by inflation  but neither the timing nor the magnitude of the changes coincides with changes in standard measurements of inflation such as the consumer price index 
additionally  changes in interest rates on some types of consumer deposits may be delayed 
these factors in turn affect the composition of sources of funds by reducing the growth of deposits that are less interest sensitive and increasing the need for funds that are more interest sensitive
