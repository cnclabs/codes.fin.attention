results of operations in the company reorganized its operations into three divisions programming systems  semiconductor equipment and synario design automation 
the following discusses the company s results of operations by division 
for comparability purposes  the discussions of compared to have been revised from that contained in the company s annual report for fiscal to follow this new divisional structure 
page net sales in thousands change change net sales    vs 
sales increased by in compared to  with us sales increasing and international sales increasing 
sales of the company s programming systems products increased in compared to programming systems products experienced year over year revenue growth due primarily to increased sales of automated programming and handling systems which was partially offset by a decline in sales of the company s non automated programming systems and the company s older software design tools 
sales for the synario design automation division increased in compared to the addition of semiconductor equipment products  obtained as part of the reel tech acquisition in august of  also provided incremental sales growth of approximately  net sales for of the company s non automated programming systems declined by million or over the company experienced decreased sales for the products used primarily in the engineering market 
partially offsetting this decline was an increase in sales of non automated parallel programming systems used in the manufacturing market 
the overall decline reflects the continuing market shift toward lower priced project specific programmers and away from higher priced  full featured universal programmers 
in addition  the company believes that technological improvements in personal computers and design software tools have caused a shift in the demand for ic design tools by engineering teams away from hardware tools in favor of software design tools 
finally  the company believes that advances in semiconductor processing technology have lowered the barriers to entry in the programmer business over the last several years 
this has caused new market entrants to appear regularly  each trying to carve out a niche 
new entrants cause downward price pressure and each cycle of new competitors lowers the acceptable price of a conventional ic programmer in the customer s view 
these industry changes had  and are continuing to have  an adverse effect on the company s non automated programming systems sales and gross margins  especially because the company s products historically have been oriented toward hardware tools and  within hardware tools  toward higher priced universal programming systems 
however  the company believes the trends toward low cost programming systems  eda software tools and automated programming and handling systems will eventually mean increased sales of its newer products chiplab   synario  promaster  promaster  promaster and the tape and reel 
sales of the company s automated programming and handling systems for the manufacturing environment increased by approximately in compared to the company believes this growth is due to a trend toward the expanded use of programmable ics in high volume manufacturing situations 
the company believes this trend is due to a reduction in the cost of programmable ics relative to fixed ics  the desire of manufacturers to improve the time to market for new and improved products  and the increased functionality and miniaturization of programmable ics 
the company believes this trend will continue contributing to further growth and expansion of this market 
the company s participation in this growth depends upon the market s acceptance of its new products  its ability to understand and meet the changing needs of this market  and its response to and development of changes in technology 
the automated programming and handling systems product line accounted for approximately of revenues in compared to in a market shift in the promaster product mix toward higher priced models also contributed to the sales increase 
the company s most recently introduced products  promaster  promaster  promaster and tape and reel  provided this growth during sales of the company s programming systems software products decreased by in compared to the company s older software design tools  including abel and futurenet  declined due to competitive pricing pressures  product aging and the discontinuation of the futurenet product 
sales of the company s semiconductor equipment products  acquired as part of the reel tech acquisition  were approximately  the market for semiconductor equipment has experienced strong growth as semiconductor manufacturers have expanded capacity in response to demand for ics 
the company is in the process of expanding its personnel  space and systems to meet expected demand for its semiconductor equipment 
the company believes that if this strong demand continues and the company executes well in integrating the reel tech acquisition  the company s semiconductor equipment products may provide a significant revenue growth opportunity 
due to the cyclical nature of page demand for ics  the activities of competitors and other factors  there can be no assurance that strong demand for this equipment will continue 
international sales were favorably impacted by foreign currency translation gains which were approximately million higher in compared to  primarily due to rate changes for the german mark and the japanese yen which strengthened relative to the us dollar during when the us dollar is weaker  sales of the company s products in local currency translate into more us dollars 
however  offsetting the revenue translation impact is the translation of local currency costs and expenses 
a strengthening of the us dollar would in general have the opposite economic effect on the company 
currency markets fluctuate and there can be no assurance of continued benefit from currency changes 
sales in the us accounted for approximately of the company s sales in compared to in vs 
sales of the company s programming systems products declined while sales of synario design automation division software products increased by in compared to sales in the us decreased while international sales decreased 
sales in the us accounted for approximately of the company s sales in compared to in the increase as a percentage of total sales in the company s sales to us customers resulted primarily from the continued economic weakness in the japanese and german markets during the company experienced quarterly year over year revenue growth of and for the third and fourth quarters of compared to due primarily to increased sales of automated programming and handling systems 
for the year  decreased sales in the first half of compared to offset the second half sales growth for an overall decline in sales of 
the sales decline was due primarily to a decline in sales of the company s non automated programming systems and older software design tools offset by increased sales of the company s automated programming and handling systems for the manufacturing environment 
net sales for in the company s traditional line of non automated programming systems declined by million or over the company experienced decreased sales for nearly all of the products in this product line  except for the low priced chiplab 
this reflects the continuing market shift toward lower priced  project specific  non automated programming systems  the shift in demand toward software design tools by engineering design teams and the technological advances creating increased competition discussed above 
sales of the company s automated programming and handling systems for the manufacturing environment increased by approximately in compared to the company believes this growth is due to a trend toward the expanded use of programmable ics in high volume manufacturing situations as discussed above 
the automated programming and handling systems product line accounted for approximately of revenues in compared to in a market shift in the promaster product mix toward higher priced models also contributed to the sales increase 
the company s new products  promaster  promaster and tape and reel  provided approximately of this growth during sales of the company s programming systems software products decreased by in compared to the company s abel and futurenet products declined primarily due to competitive pricing pressures  product aging and lower unit sales 
the company believes that the strategic decision in to change its software sales channel to value added resellers  which it believes are more appropriate for windows based software  continued to have a negative transitional impact during early in addition  this change resulted in lower net sales by the company as it received lower wholesaler distributor pricing instead of direct retail sales pricing 
sales growth in the company s synario design automation software products  including synario and ecs  was due to having a full year of sales of the company s synario product line after its introduction in october synario is targeted at the change in the industry demand toward greater usage of software products and at the company s belief in the emerging windows based eda market 
the company believes synario is well positioned to take advantage of the adoption of the windows environment by users of eda software tools 
page gross margin in thousands change change gross margin    percentage of net sales vs 
the gross margin increased in dollars during compared to while staying approximately the same as a percentage of sales 
the increase in gross margin dollars is due primarily to the increase in sales volume 
the company experienced improved gross margins on automated programming and handling system products in due to increased volume and a shift toward higher priced models 
offsetting this improvement is a shift in the mix of sales of the company s non automated programming systems products from higher priced  higher margined products toward lower priced alternatives which has lowered the overall margins for this product line 
the shift in the product mix to a lower overall percentage of software sales  which have higher gross margins  has had an additional offsetting impact 
in addition  the gross margin on the promaster was below that of the company s traditional automated programming and handling systems due to higher material and labor costs 
the company expects the promaster costs to decline in future periods due to the acquisition of reel tech and anticipated improvements in the proficiency of manufacturing and service personnel in building and servicing this system 
finally  gross margin was favorably affected by improvements due to the positive currency effects of a weaker dollar 
as stated above  there is no assurance of continued benefit from currency rate changes 
vs 
the gross margin increased in both dollars and as a percentage of sales during compared to despite the decline in sales 
the company s gross margin in was depressed due to increased reserves for excess and obsolete inventories 
the company s restructuring reduced costs in its manufacturing  service and distribution operations  improving margins in in addition  the company experienced improved gross margins on its automated programming and handling system products in due to increased volume and a shift toward higher priced models 
offsetting a portion of these gross margin improvements are the lower sales volume and a shift from higher priced to lower priced products in the company s non automated programming systems line 
lower sales in japan and germany also unfavorably impacted gross margins as the company generally receives higher gross margins on sales to those countries 
research and development in thousands change change research and development    percentage of net sales vs 
research spending declined slightly both in dollars and as a percentage of sales 
the decline is primarily due to lower personnel costs which relate primarily to open job positions during the year 
the company focused its research and development efforts in on its strategic growth markets  namely automated programming and handling systems  windows based eda software design tools  low priced project specific ic programmers and semiconductor equipment 
the company expects to continue this focus in the future and believes that it is essential to invest in research and development to support its existing products and to create new products as markets develop and technologies change 
the charge for in process research and development acquired as part of the reel tech acquisition is discussed above under the caption business acquisition and is not included in research and development expense 
page vs 
research spending declined slightly both in dollars and as a percentage of sales 
the decline was primarily due to personnel reductions made as a part of the company s restructuring 
the company focused its research and development efforts in on its strategic growth markets  namely automated programming and handling systems  windows based eda software design tools and low priced project specific non automated ic programmers 
selling  general and administrative in thousands change change selling  general and administrative    percentage of net sales vs 
the actual dollar increase in selling  general and administrative expenditures in was due to increased marketing and promotion expenditures  increased commissions resulting from the sales volume increase and increased expenses in the company s foreign offices due to currency rate changes 
partially offsetting this increase were reductions in spending due to the restructuring efforts 
vs 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenditures in was due primarily to the restructure efforts which reduced the number of personnel worldwide and focused on matching cost effective sales channels to our products and markets 
these reductions were partially offset by performance bonuses and incentive compensation which were not incurred in business restructuring during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a pretax charge of million related to the restructure of its sales and distribution channels  downsizing its operations to a level consistent with anticipated lower sales and product margins  and to consolidate and outsource certain manufacturing processes 
the purpose of the restructure was primarily to reduce expenses and significantly lower the company s break even point in reaction to reduced sales and gross margins in additionally  the company made several strategic changes to its sales and distribution channels to better align distribution of the company s current and anticipated future products to their markets and customers 
the general downsizing of operations and restructuring of the sales and distribution system were substantially completed in the company began implementation of the planned changes to its manufacturing processes in for completion in the manufacturing consolidation and relocation project was completed in the first quarter of  and the outsourcing of certain manufacturing processes is scheduled to be completed in of the total restructure charge of million  million related to restructuring the sales and distribution system  including severance for terminated employees  facilities and equipment lease abandonment  facilities relocation costs  the write off of intangible assets associated with the acquisition and setup of direct sales operations in germany and the united kingdom  and costs associated with implementing new accounting and distribution systems and processes  million related to the consolidation and outsourcing of certain portions of the company s manufacturing operations  including the write down of production equipment to net realizable value  severance for terminated employees  facility relocation costs  and costs associated with outsourcing certain manufacturing processes  and the remaining million related to general organizational downsizing  including severance for terminated employees  asset write downs and costs associated with rearrangement of facilities 
of the total million restructuring charge  the company paid approximately million in cash in including approximately  of previously accrued vacation and pension payments  million in including approximately  of previously accrued vacation and pension payments   in and expects to pay approximately  in future periods 
the company expects to fund these cash payments from internally generated page funds and  if necessary  borrowings on its lines of credit 
in addition  the company recorded approximately  in asset write downs related to its restructuring 
the company has continuously reviewed its restructure actions and compared them to its original plan 
accordingly  during the fourth quarter of  asset and accrued liability accounts associated with the plan were adjusted such that the total restructuring costs were lowered by  or of the original plan 
this credit lowered the expected cost of the restructure of the company s manufacturing operations by approximately  and the company s sales and distribution systems by approximately  no other amounts related to the restructuring plan were charged or credited to earnings since inception of the plan 
the restructuring plan changed primarily as the company experienced difficulties in proceeding as planned on outsourcing certain manufacturing processes 
the effect of this has been a delay in accomplishing portions of the outsourcing plan  resulting in continued usage of certain production equipment beyond the time that was originally planned  as well as reductions in originally contemplated costs 
in the aggregate  the restructuring of the company s operations reduced total costs and expenses by a net of million in  with approximately million of the savings attributable to reduced employee costs  approximately  due to reduced facility and equipment lease expense  and approximately  due to reduced depreciation and amortization 
the restructure resulted in an additional million reduction in costs and expenses in compared to  which was attributable primarily to reduced employee costs 
in addition to the actions described above  the company implemented a temporary pay and work week reduction of for all us employees for the period january  through february  the company realized savings of approximately  in salary costs related to this reduction

page income taxes in thousands change change income tax expense benefit n a effective tax benefit rate vs 
the effective income tax rate for differed from the statutory tax rate primarily due to reversal of tax valuation reserves established in the reversal of valuation reserves was due to the utilization of foreign subsidiary loss carryforwards and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards as well as the offset of reversing temporary differences against taxable income 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company had valuation allowances of  at december  compared to  at december  the valuation reserves will continue to reverse in if the company s profitability continues 
in  the criteria that requires the company to maintain its valuation allowance will be less restrictive if the company is profitable 
the company believes this may allow further reductions in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
the potential reversal of these valuation allowances may significantly reduce the company s effective tax rate in vs 
the effective income tax rate for differed from the statutory tax rate primarily due to reversal of tax valuation reserves established in the valuation reserves reversed due to the company utilizing foreign subsidiary loss carryforwards and the ability to offset reversing temporary differences against taxable income 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the effective income tax rate for the loss benefit was reduced primarily due to valuation reserves established for deferred tax assets 
the valuation reserves were increased during due to the loss generated during the year and the increased uncertainty of the company s ability to utilize the benefits from its deferred tax assets  particularly net operating loss carryforwards 
the valuation reserves were set up for net operating loss carryforwards of foreign subsidiaries and as a result of an evaluation of the benefit obtainable for deferred tax assets

the change in the company s profitability was due primarily to the increased sales volume  the reversal of a portion of the restructure accrual  reduced costs and operating expenses resulting from the company s restructure and the reversal of deferred tax valuation reserves 
offsetting a portion of this was the charge of  net of tax for in process research and development related to the reel tech acquisition 
page vs 
the change in the company s profitability before cumulative effect of accounting change was due primarily to the reduced operating expenses and costs of goods sold resulting from the restructure of the company s operations 
inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the past  the company has been able to offset the impact of inflation with efficiency increases and price adjustments 
heightened competition has made the company s products subject to more price competition and has diminished its ability to offset the impacts of inflation 
sales and expenses incurred by foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the subsidiary s local currency and translated into us dollar amounts at average rates of exchange during the year 
to date the foreign currency rate changes have not significantly impacted the company s profitability 
this is because only approximately one third of the company s sales are made by foreign subsidiaries  independent currency fluctuations tend to minimize the effect of any individual currency exchange fluctuations and the effect of individual rate changes on sales and expenses tend to offset each other 
additionally  the company hedges its foreign currency exposure on the sales of inventory and certain loans to its foreign subsidiaries through the use of foreign exchange contracts

the company increased inventory levels by approximately million or during inventory levels were increased primarily to support the growth in automated programming and handling systems as well as provide a level of safety stock during the anaheim factory relocation 
additionally  inventory increased due to the acquisition and expansion of reel tech inventories 
the company reduced its other current assets by approximately  primarily due to collection of former lease deposits 
other long term assets increased by approximately  related to the capitalization of intangible assets purchased from reel tech which are offset by amortization 
the company also reduced its accrued expenses primarily due to payments of approximately  of restructure related accruals 
borrowings on the foreign line of credit were paid down by approximately  the use of million of cash to repurchase  shares of common stock during the fourth quarter was partially offset by stock sale proceeds of  under the company s employee stock benefit plans 
the funding for these changes in was provided primarily by operations and by reducing the company s level of cash by approximately million 
as of december   the company had total debt of million  or approximately of its million in equity 
of this total  approximately  is current debt  consisting entirely of borrowings on its foreign line of credit 
the million of long term debt consists of a note due in for the balance of the purchase price for cad cam see note of notes to consolidated financial statements

page the foreign line of credit of million matures in august historically  this debt and the us line of credit  have been structured as short term and have been continuously renewed on their maturity dates 
the company currently expects to be able to renew these lines of credit on maturity under substantially the same terms as those presently in place 
no assurances can be made  however  in regard to the renewal of these agreements 
the company estimates that capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment during will be approximately million 
such expenditures are currently expected to be funded from internally generated funds and  if necessary  borrowings from the company s existing credit lines 
although the company fully expects that such expenditures will be made  it has commitments for only a small portion of these amounts 
at december   the company s material short term unused sources of liquidity consisted of approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings of million under its us line of credit and approximately million under its foreign line of credit 
the company believes these sources will be sufficient during to fund working capital needs  service existing debt  finance planned capital acquisitions  fund the company s planned repurchase of up to  shares of its common stock  fund the reel tech contingent payment obligations and fund its remaining restructure accrued liabilities 
additional capital will also be provided if the company successfully disposes of its redmond headquarters property see note of notes to consolidated financial statements
