the company attributes the growth in sales over the past three fiscal years primarily to an increase in volume in both comparable stores and new stores 
due to an overall sluggish home furnishings retail environment during fiscal  promotional pricing was utilized to a greater extent than prior years 
however  the company s core pricing structure has remained relatively constant over the past three fiscal years  therefore  the impact of price changes on sales volumes has been immaterial 
continuing operational improvements and the opening of approximately to new stores is expected to result in modest sales increases for the company in fiscal during fiscal  other income decreased to of sales from of sales for fiscal the decrease was primarily the result of lower finance income  the major component of other income  as a percentage of sales 
during fiscal  finance income increased at a lower rate than sales mainly due to a larger pool of securitized accounts receivable compared to the prior year 
interest costs related to securitized receivables  which are based on the dollar value of accounts receivable sold to third parties  are netted against finance income 
the company s puerto rican operations also contributed to the decrease in other income  as a percentage of sales  during fiscal these operations have lower installment sales as a percentage of sales compared to continental us operations 
other income  as a percentage of sales  for fiscal increased to of sales from of sales in fiscal finance income increased in fiscal  as a percentage of sales  due to moderate overall and comparable store sales growth during fiscal years and costs and expenses in fiscal  costs of sales increased  as a percentage of sales  to from in fiscal year promotional pricing  in response to the overall sluggish home furnishings retail environment  was used to a greater extent in fiscal compared to fiscal fixed type cost components within the comparable store base increased at a higher rate than the 
increase in comparable store sales 
fixed type costs included in costs of sales consist primarily of occupancy  depreciation and lease charges related to store and distribution operations 
costs of sales increased to of sales in fiscal year from in fiscal year increased promotional pricing and delivery expenses resulting from higher distribution costs associated with the southwestern stores accounted for the increase to costs of sales as a percentage of sales during fiscal year selling  general and administrative expense increased to of sales in fiscal year from of sales in fiscal advertising expense increased at a rate greater than sales primarily due to increased advertising related to additional promotional activity implemented in response to the sluggish sales experienced during fiscal other cost components such as depreciation and base salaries and related costs  which are primarily fixed type expenses  increased at a higher rate within the comparable store base than the 
comparable store sales increase 
during fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to from of sales in fiscal year this increase was primarily attributable to higher advertising associated with the use of television and radio media for the company s stores located in major metropolitan markets such as chicago and cleveland 
advertising costs also increased as the result of the introduction of the heilig meyers name in the six new states and corresponding markets of the company s west and southwestern stores  which were acquired in january  the increase in advertising was partially offset by decreases  as a percentage of sales  in salaries and related expenses and other selling  general and administrative expenses due to the growing sales volume 
interest expense increased to of sales in fiscal from of sales in fiscal the increase was primarily the result of higher weighted average long term debt levels 
weighted average long term debt levels increased by million while weighted average long term interest rates remained consistent with the prior year at 
weighted average short term debt levels decreased million during fiscal weighted average short term interest rates increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the company continues to focus on structuring its debt portfolio to contain a higher percentage of long term fixed rate debt in order to minimize the company s exposure to future short term interest rate fluctuations

the provision for doubtful accounts increased to of sales in fiscal from of sales in fiscal a rise in the portfolio loss rate and related write offs applied to the growing accounts receivable base prior to the effect of securitizations caused the increase during fiscal the extension of credit is constantly monitored by management to minimize the portfolio loss rate 
the provision for doubtful accounts increased during fiscal to of sales from of sales in total portfolio write offs for fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
of these amounts  million  million and million were for purchased receivables  respectively 
management believes that the allowance for doubtful accounts of million at february   is adequate 
provision for income taxes and net earnings the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to for both fiscal and this decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of higher fixed dollar income tax credits in the current year and the lower effective tax rate on the company s puerto rican earnings compared to the company as a whole 
net earnings for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal as a percentage of sales  profit margin decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the decrease was mostly attributable to the decline in gross margin  the increase in selling  general and administrative expense and the increase in the provision for doubtful accounts 
as a percentage of sales  profit margin decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal similar to fiscal  the decrease was mostly attributable to the decline in gross margin and increase in advertising expense 
liquidity and capital resources the company increased its cash position million to million at february   from million at february  net cash inflow from operating activities was million for fiscal compared to a net cash inflow of million for fiscal the company traditionally produces a deficit in cash flow from operations because it extends credit to its customers 
however  during fiscal  the company received proceeds of million from the sale of accounts receivable that was partially offset by cash outflows for growth in inventories 
inventories increased during fiscal due mainly to the opening of stores 
similar to fiscal  the net cash inflow from operating activities in fiscal was due to the sale of million of accounts receivable during the year 
this cash inflow was partially offset by an increase in inventory levels due to the opening of the fontana  california  distribution center and new stores 
continued extension of credit and related increases in customer accounts receivable  as well as increases in inventory related to expansion  will likely cause negative net cash flows from operations in future periods 
however  as noted above  the company periodically sells accounts receivable  as a source of liquidity  providing additional positive cash flows from operating activities 
investing activities produced negative cash flows of million in fiscal and million in fiscal capital spending  associated with the company s expansion program  remained consistent with fiscal expenditures

during fiscal  the company plans to open approximately to new stores as well as continue its existing store remodeling program 
capital expenditures will continue to be financed by external sources of funds and cash flows from operations
