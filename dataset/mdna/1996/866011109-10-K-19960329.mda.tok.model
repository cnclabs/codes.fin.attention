item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the corporation analyzes the major elements of the corporation s consolidated balance sheets and statements of income 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes  and selected financial data appearing elsewhere in this report 
performance summary net income for was million  an increase of  or  over the million recorded for on a weighted average share basis  net income for was per share as compared to per share for  an increase of 
the major contribution to the improved earnings during was a increase in net interest income 
this increase was partially offset by an increase over the prior year in the provision for loan losses 
in a credit to the provision for loan losses of  was taken compared to a debit of  a comparative increase in expense of  in in non interest expense increased  significantly contributed to by cost related to a new branch office of summit national bank opened in august 
without these branch related costs the increase would have been approximately 
during  the corporation s return on assets was compared to and for and  respectively 
the corporation s return on stockholders equity for was compared to and for the previous two years 
the and measurements consider stockholders equity before adjustment for unrealized gains and losses related to investment securities that are designated available for sale 
see a discussion later in this report for an explanation of this adjustment 
the corporation s strong capital position is reflected in the indicator of average stockholders equity to total average assets which was   and for the years  and  respectively 
at december   this indicator was and reflects the growth in assets in the later part of the year 
net income for was million compared to net income of million for the increase in earnings for was also attributable to increased net interest income and a credit to the provision for loan losses as noted above 
the following table shows selected key performance ratios over the last three years return on average assets return on average stockholders equity stockholders equity to assets average dividend payout ratio per share before adjustment for unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities 
the ratio  return on assets  is calculated by dividing net income by average total assets for the year 
the return on equity ratio is calculated by dividing net income by average shareholders equity for the year 
the equity to assets ratio is calculated by dividing average shareholders equity by average total assets for the year 
net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest earned on earning assets and interest paid for the funds supporting those assets 
the largest category of earning assets consists of loans to businesses and individuals 
the second largest is investment securities 
net interest income is the principal source of the corporation s earnings 
interest rate fluctuations  as well as changes in the amount and type of earning assets and liabilities  effect net interest income 
for analytical purposes  income from tax exempt assets  primarily securities issued by state and local governments  is adjusted by an increment which equates tax exempt income to interest from taxable assets 
net interest income tax equivalent for was million  an increase of  or compared to the prior year 
the net increase reflected a million increase in interest income which was offset by a million increase in interest expense 
the corporation s yield on earning assets increased to in  from for rates paid on the corporation s interest bearing liabilities in  primarily time deposits  increased basis points reflecting the general increase in market interest rates for bank liabilities during the year 
also contributing to the improved net interest income for was the increase in noninterest bearing demand deposits 
in  the average balance of demand deposits increased  with average demand deposits representing of average total deposits as compared to in summary of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities although the year end detail provides satisfactory indicators of general trends  the daily average balance sheets are more meaningful for analysis purposes than year end data because averages reflect the day to day fluctuations that are common to bank balance sheets 
also  average balances for earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can be related directly to the components of interest income and interest expense on the statements of income 
this provides the basis for analysis of rates earned and paid  and sources of increases and decreases in net interest income as derived from changes in volumes and rates

net interest margin  the net return on earning assets which is computed by dividing net interest income by average total earning assets  was for  a thirty basis point increase from the previous year 
this increase in the margin reflected that loans which earn a higher yield were a greater percentage of earning assets  also demand deposits were a greater percentage of funding sources 
in average loans were of earning assets versus in the table below analyzes the increase in net interest income for each of the years ended december  and on a fully tax equivalent basis 
non accruing loans have been included in assets for these computations  thereby reducing yields on total loans

in this same period interest expense increased  as interest rates increased 
in the net interest margin averaged  five basis points lower than the prior year 
non interest income 
non interest income is an important contributor to net earnings 
the major component of the corporation s non interest income is various charges and fees earned on deposit accounts and related services 
the following table summarizes the changes in non interest income during the past three years dollars in thousands amount change amount change amount service charges on deposit accounts    non recurring income gain loss on sale of investment securities other non interest income  total non interest income    service charges on deposits declined in as a result of a decrease in service charge income on demand deposit accounts related to higher credits given on commercial accounts for balances maintained in the bank as interest rates rose 
non recurring income in and is primarily interest recovered on loans charged off in prior years 
the non recurring income reflects a  gain on the sale of land previously held for expansion and interest recovered on loans charged off in previous years 
the increase in other non interest income in is primarily due to fees earned from investment brokerage services 
non interest expense 
non interest expense includes all expenses of the corporation other than interest expense  provision for loan losses and income tax expense 
the following table summarizes the changes in the non interest expenses for the past three years dollars in thousands amount change amount change amount salaries and employee benefits    occupancy expense net furniture and equipment expense other real estate owned expense other expenses business development insurance other legal and professional fees other taxes postage and courier printing and supplies regulatory fees and assessments 
other operating expenses total other expenses    total non interest expense   
 total non interest expense increased in over reflecting increases in salaries and benefits  occupancy expenses  furniture and equipment expenses  legal and professional expenses and other operating expenses 
as a percent of average assets  non interest expenses were in and and resulted in an efficiency ratio non interest expenses divided by total non interest income plus net interest income of for these measures of operating efficiency compare very favorably to other financial institutions in the corporation s peer group 
the increase in salaries and employee benefits for is due to salary merit increases  incentive compensation increases and an increase in pension plan expense 
also  the average number of full time equivalent employees increased by five in to an average full time equivalent of the increases for salaries and number of employees include additions for a branch office opened in mid year of the increase in occupancy expense is primarily due to the additional expense for the new branch office and additional rents at the summit national bank location 
the increase in furniture and equipment expense is primarily a result of increased depreciation for a new communication system installed in  additional furniture acquired in and acceleration of depreciation on certain item processing equipment 
business development expense increased primarily because of expenses related to the promotion and advertising of the new branch office 
legal and professional fees were higher in due to an increase in attorney fees related to loan collections and various consultant fees  primarily marketing 
regulatory fees and assessments declined in because of a decrease in fdic insurance premiums on deposits 
in the fdic insurance premium expense will decline further providing an opportunity for the corporation to reflect lower expense in this category 
other operating expenses increased in due to an increase in various miscellaneous operating costs including telephone service fees related to a new communications system 
federal and state income tax expense

management of the corporation views these trades as an opportunity to increase the earnings capacity of the corporation into the future 
loans 
the following schedule classifies loans according to type as of december for the past five years dollars in thousands december  of of of of of total total total total total commercial      real estate mortgage      real estate construction      loans to individuals  net of unearned discount      total loans net of unearned income      the preceding loan distribution table reflects that total loans increased million between year end and although this increase was significantly above the increase in recent years  the corporation is continuing to apply stringent credit criteria on all loan applications 
at december   loans were of deposits compared to at the previous year end 
primarily  the commercial loan customers of the subsidiary banks are small to medium sized businesses and professionals and executives 
the banks offer a variety of commercial loan products that include revolving lines of credit  letters of credit  working capital loans and loans to finance accounts receivable  inventory and equipment 
generally  these commercial loans have floating rates of interest with terms of maturity of three years or less 
a significant portion of the million real estate mortgage portfolio is loans to finance owner occupied real estate 
at december  approximately million of loans  approximately of the real estate portfolio  had been made for this purpose 
also approximately of the loans in the real estate mortgage portfolio have variable rates of interest with a significant portion of the remaining portfolio having balloon terms and or rate adjustment clauses 
the following table presents commercial and real estate construction loans at december   based on scheduled principal repayments and the total amount of loans due after one year classified according to sensitivity to changes in interest rates in thousands over one year one year through over five or less five years year total commercial    real estate construction    totals    of the loans maturing after one year  have fixed rates of interest and  have variable rates of interest 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses 
loans  or portions thereof  which are considered to be uncollectible are charged against this allowance and subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
the allowance represents the amount which  in management s judgement  will be adequate to absorb future charge offs of existing loans which may become uncollectible 
the adequacy of the allowance is determined by management s continuous evaluation of the loan portfolio and by the employment of third party loan review specialists 
all known problem loans  unknown inherent risks generally associated with bank lending  past loan loss experience  delinquency ratios and current and projected economic conditions are taken into account in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance 
loans are generally placed on non accrual status when principal or interest is past due days or more and the loan is not both well secured and in the process of collection  or immediately  if in the opinion of management  full collection of principal or interest is doubtful 
loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the collectibility of the principal is unlikely 
the following table represents average loans net of unearned income and an analysis of the consolidated allowance for loan losses dollars in thousands years ended december  average loans outstanding      analysis of allowance for loan losses balance  beginning of year      charge offs commercial  real estate mortgage real estate construction loans to individuals total charge offs  recoveries commercial real estate mortgage real estate construction loans to individuals total recoveries net charge offs  provision charged credited to operating expense  balance  end of year      ratio of net charge offs to average loans outstanding 



the following table reflects the allowance for loan losses compared to total loans at the end of each year dollars in thousands december  total loans      allowance for loan losses      allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans allowance for loan losses as a percent of non performing loans net charge offs increased to  in from  in net charge offs on commercial loans were  while real estate mortgages experienced a net recovery of  the increase in provision for loan losses in over recognizes the corporation s loan growth and a modest level of loan charge offs for the year 
the following table illustrates the allocation of the allowance for loan losses to the various loan categories dollars in thousands december  amount total amount total amount total amount total amount total allowance for loan losses commercial  real estate mortgage real estate construction loans to individuals unallocated portion  total      the allocation is determined by providing specific reserves against each criticized loan plus a general allocation against the remaining balance of the portfolio based on experience factors 
management of the corporation believes that the allowance for loan losses at december   is adequate to cover losses inherent in the portfolio 
there can be no assurance that the corporation will not sustain loan losses in future periods which could be substantial in relation to the size of the current allowance 
non performing assets 
non performing assets consist of non accrual loans  renegotiated loans and other real estate 
non accrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest has been suspended and on which the interest is recorded as earned when it is received 
loans are generally placed on non accrual status when principal or interest is past due days or more  and the loan is not both well secured and in the process of collection  or immediately  if in the opinion of management  full collection of principal or interest is doubtful 
at the time a loan is placed on non accrual status  interest previously recorded but not collected is reversed and charged against current interest income 
renegotiated loans are loans on which the interest and or the principal has been reduced due to a deterioration in the borrower s financial condition 
even though these loans are actually performing  they are included in non performing assets because of the loss of revenue related to the reduction of interest and or principal 
other real estate is real estate acquired through foreclosure or through partial settlement of debts which is awaiting sale and disposition 
at the time of acquisition other real estate is recorded at the lower of estimated fair value or the loan balance or settlement agreement with any write down charged to the allowance for loan losses 
any further write downs  expenses related to the property and any gain or loss resulting from the sale of the property are recorded in current operating expenses 
the following table summarizes the non performing assets and loans days past due and still accruing as of december  dollars in thousands december  non accrual loans    renegotiated loans other real estate   total non performing assets      as a percent of total assets 


total loans and other real estate 

loans past due days or more and still accruing  the subsidiary banks are required  by the regulatory authorities  to have other real estate appraised periodically 
in the event the new appraised value is less than the carrying value of the property  the excess is written off to expense 
some properties are written down below their appraised values when management feels the economic value of the property has declined below the appraised value 
in loans past due days or more and still accruing at december    of the balance was represented by one loan 
non accrual loans at december   were comprised of  in commercial loans   in real estate mortgages   in loans to individuals 
the impact on interest income from the above non accrual loans and renegotiated loans for the past five years is provided below in thousands years ended december  gross amount of interest that would have been recorded at original rate interest included in income interest not recorded in income loans of each subsidiary bank are graded on a system similar to that used by the regulators 
the first level of criticized loans is other assets especially mentioned oaem 
these loans are normally fundamentally sound but have potential weaknesses which may  if not corrected  weaken the asset or inadequately protect the bank s credit position at some future date 
the second level is substandard  which are loans inadequately protected by current sound net worth  paying capacity or pledged collateral 
the last level of criticized loans  before they are charged off  is doubtful 
doubtful loans are considered to have inherent weaknesses because collection or liquidation in full is highly questionable 
non accrual loans normally include weaker substandard loans and loans that are considered to be doubtful 
the level of the allowance for loan losses deemed adequate by management and the board of directors of each bank is determined by providing a specific allocation against each criticized loan plus a general allocation against the remaining portfolio which is determined by various experience factors of each subsidiary bank 
the following table summarizes the relationship between non performing loans  criticized loans and the allowance for loan losses dollars in thousands december  non performing loans    criticized loans      allowance for loan losses      allowance for loan losses as a percent of non performing loans criticized loans the increase in criticized loans at december  primarily relates to three credits that are currently paying  but may require an extension of payment terms 
independent third party loan reviews of the subsidiary banks were completed in mid to late based on the findings of these reviews the subsidiary banks appear to be adequately reserved 
management is not aware of any potential loan problems  that have not been disclosed  to which serious doubts exist as to the ability of the borrower to substantially comply with the present repayment terms 
deposits 
the primary source of the corporation s funds is the deposits of the subsidiary banks 
the majority of the corporation s deposits could be considered core deposits  that is  deposits that are not subject to material changes due to customer withdrawal due to market rate changes 
the corporation does not accept brokered deposits 
the deposit types daily average balance and related average rates paid during each of the last three years are as follows dollars in thousands amount rate paid amount rate paid amount rate paid noninterest bearing demand deposits    interest bearing deposits interest bearing transaction accounts    savings    savings certificates time    certificates of deposit greater than     other time deposits total interest bearing deposits    total deposits    the remaining maturity on certificates of deposit of  or more as of december   and is presented below in thousands maturity months or less    to months    to months    over months interest rate sensitivity 
the objectives of monitoring and managing the interest rate risk of the balance sheet are to contribute to earnings by minimizing adverse changes in net interest income as a result of changes in the direction and level of interest rates and to provide liquidity to satisfy cash flow requirements to meet customers fluctuating demands 
interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in the market interest rates and changes in net interest income due to the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities 
an asset sensitive position in a given period will result in more assets than liabilities being subject to repricing  therefore  market interest rate changes will be reflected more quickly in asset rates 
if interest rates decline  such position will have an adverse effect on net interest income 
conversely  in a liability sensitive position  where liabilities reprice more quickly than assets in a given period  a decline in market rates will benefit net interest income 
a mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in which relatively equal volumes reprice each period represents a matched interest sensitivity gap position  any excess of these assets or liabilities results in an interest sensitive gap 
the following table  commonly referred to as a static gap report  indicates the interest rate sensitivity position at december  and may not be reflective of positions in subsequent periods dollars in thousands repriced due in after due in due in due in total year or days days rate non rate or less days days to one year sensitive sensitive total earning assets loans        investment securities        federal funds sold    total earning assets        interest bearing liabilities interest bearing transaction accounts and savings    certificates of deposits        other time deposits        repurchase agreements    total interest bearing liabilities        interest sensitivity gap        cumulative gap     cumulative gap to total earning assets cumulative gap to total assets in the preceding table under the after year category   in investment securities will reprice or mature within one to three years and another  will reprice or mature within three to five years 
the average maturity of the investment portfolio is approximately years 
also  the above table reflects the call dates versus maturity dates and periodic principal amortization of investment securities 
the preceding static gap report reflects a cumulative liability sensitive position during the one year horizon 
an inherent weakness of this report is that it ignores the relative volatility any one category may have in relation to other categories or market rates in general 
for instance  the rate paid on certain interest bearing transaction accounts typically moves slower than the three month t bill 
management attempts to capture this relative volatility by utilizing a simulation model with a beta factor adjustment which estimates the volatility of rate sensitive assets and or liabilities in relation to other market rates 
beta factors are an estimation of the long term  multiple interest rate environment relation between an individual account and market rates in general 
for instance  now  savings and money market accounts  which are repriceable within days will have considerably lower beta factors than variable rate loans and most investment categories 
taking this into consideration  it is quite possible for a bank with a negative cumulative gap to total asset ratio to have a positive beta adjusted gap risk position 
as a result of applying the beta factors established by management to the earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in the static gap report via a simulation model  the cumulative gap to total assets ratio at one year of was reversed to a positive beta adjusted gap position 
management feels that the beta adjusted gap risk technique more accurately reflects the corporation s gap position 
it is anticipated that sudden fluctuations in interest rates will not have a great impact on the spreads and margins of the subsidiary banks and on the corporation as a whole because the corporation is matching its rate sensitive assets with its rate sensitive liabilities in situations where it is most feasible 
the following table reflects the spreads and margins for the past three years yield on earning assets t e cost of funds net interest spread t e net interest margin t e capital resources 
in  the federal reserve board and the office of the comptroller of the currency issued new risk based capital guidelines for us banking organizations 
the objective of these efforts was to provide a more consistent system for comparing capital positions of banking organizations and to reflect the level of risk associated with holding various categories of assets 
the guidelines define tier capital and tier capital 
the only components of tier and tier capital  for the corporation  are equity capital and equity capital plus a portion of the allowance for loan losses  respectively 
the guidelines also stipulate that four categories of risk weights    and percent  primarily based on the relative credit risk of the counterparty  be applied to the different types of balance sheet assets 
risk weights for all off balance sheet exposures are determined by a two step process whereas the face value of the off balance sheet item is converted to a credit equivalent amount and that amount is assigned to the appropriate risk category 
off balance sheet items at december  and included unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit 
the minimum ratio for qualifying total capital is percent  of which percent must be tier capital 
the federal reserve board and the comptroller of the currency also has a capital to total assets leverage guideline and transitional capital standards for banking organizations 
these guidelines establish a minimum level of tier capital to total assets of percent 
a banking organization operating at or near these levels is expected to have well diversified risk  excellent asset quality  high liquidity  good earnings and in general be considered a strong banking organization 
organizations not meeting these characteristics are expected to operate well above these minimum capital standards 
thus  for all but the most highly rated organizations  the minimum tier leverage ratio is to be percent plus minimum additional cushions of at least to basis points 
at the discretion of the regulatory authorities  additional capital may be required

liquidity 
liquidity is defined as the corporation s ability to meet deposit withdrawals  provide for the legitimate credit needs of customers  and take advantage of certain investment opportunities as they arise 
while maintaining adequate liquid assets to fulfill these functions  it must also maintain compatible levels of maturity and rate concentrations between its sources of funds and earning assets 
the liability structure of the corporation is short term in nature and the asset structure is likewise oriented towards short maturities 
the corporation s primary internal source of liquidity is its federal funds sold and its marketable investment securities  particularly those with shorter maturities 
at december   federal funds sold and investment securities maturing within days represented million or of total assets 
additionally  the corporation s ability to sell loan participations and purchase federal funds serve as secondary sources of liquidity 
each of the subsidiary banks have approved federal funds lines at other banks 
the liquidity of the corporation is enhanced by the fact that of total deposits at december   were core deposits 
core deposits for this purpose are defined as total deposits less public funds and certificates of deposit greater than
