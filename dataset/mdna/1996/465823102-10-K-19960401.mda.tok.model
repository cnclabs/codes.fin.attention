item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes to consolidated financial statements 
except for historical information contained herein  the matters discussed below are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to economic  competitive  governmental and technological factors affecting ivax operations  markets  products and prices  and other factors discussed elsewhere in this report and the documents filed by ivax with the securities and exchange commission 
results of operations overview ivax operations are conducted through subsidiaries involved in pharmaceuticals  intravenous products  in vitro diagnostics  personal care products and specialty chemicals 
information regarding the results of operations and financial position of ivax principal business segments is set forth in note  business segment and geographic information  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
historically  ivax revenues and profits have increased primarily as a result of the acquisition of other businesses and the successful development and marketing of generic pharmaceutical products 
ivax future success is largely dependent upon its ability to develop  manufacture and market  in the short term  commercially viable generic pharmaceutical products  and in the long term  commercially viable generic and proprietary pharmaceutical products 
in the short term  ivax revenues and profits from its pharmaceutical operations may vary significantly from period to period  as well as in comparison to corresponding prior periods  as a result of regulatory and competitive factors unique to the generic pharmaceutical industry 
such factors include the timing of new generic drug approvals received by ivax  the number and timing of generic drug approvals for competing products  the timing of ivax initial shipments of newly approved generic drugs  strategies adopted by brand name companies to maintain market share  and the effects of sales promotion programs 
the first company to receive regulatory approval for and to introduce a generic drug is usually able to capture significant market share from the branded drug and to achieve relatively high revenues and gross profits from sales of the drug 
as other generic versions of the same drug enter the market  however  market share  prices  revenues and gross profits decline  sometimes significantly 
in addition  the initial shipments by the first company to introduce a generic drug are often significant as customers fill their initial inventory requirements 
competition in the united states generic pharmaceutical market has continued to intensify as the pharmaceutical industry adjusts to increased pressures to contain health care costs 
as a result  brand name companies are increasingly selling their products into the generic market directly by acquiring or forming strategic alliances with generic pharmaceutical companies 
no regulatory approvals are required for a brand name manufacturer to sell directly or through a third party to the generic market  nor do such manufacturers face any other significant barriers to entry into such market 
in addition  brand name companies are increasingly pursuing strategies to prevent or delay the introduction of generic competition 
these strategies include  among other things  seeking to establish regulatory obstacles to demonstrate the bioequivalence of generic drugs to the brand name products  and instituting legal actions based on process or other patents that allegedly are infringed by the generic products 
ivax pharmaceutical revenues and profits may also be affected by other factors 
certain raw materials and components used in the manufacture of ivax products are available from limited sources  and in some cases  a single source 
furthermore  because raw material sources for pharmaceutical products must generally be approved by regulatory authorities  changes in raw materials suppliers could result in production delays and higher raw material costs 
in addition  fda approval to manufacture a drug is site specific 
in the event an approved manufacturing facility for a particular drug becomes inoperable  obtaining the required fda approval to manufacture such drug at a different manufacturing site could also result in production delays 
political  economic and regulatory influences are resulting in fundamental changes in the health care industry in the united states 
numerous legislative proposals have been introduced or proposed in congress and in some state legislatures that would effect major changes in the united states health care system nationally and at the state level 
proposals have included fundamental changes to the health care delivery and payment systems designed to  among other things  increase access to  and decrease the cost of  health care 
ivax anticipates that congress and state legislatures will continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery systems and payment methods and that public debate of these issues will likely continue in the future 
due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate features of reform initiatives and their enactment and implementation  ivax cannot predict which  if any  reform proposals will be adopted  when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on ivax 
there can be no assurance that such reforms  if enacted  will not have a material adverse effect on ivax 
ivax regularly reviews potential acquisitions and business alliances  some of which could result in material changes to ivax financial condition and results of operations 
historically  ivax has generally acquired other businesses through the issuance of common stock 
as consideration for any future acquisition  ivax may  among other things  pay cash  contribute assets  incur indebtedness or issue debt or equity securities 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  ivax reported net income of million for the year ended december   an increase of million from the million of net income in primary and fully diluted earnings per common share were 
and  respectively  for the year ended december   as compared to 
per common share on both a primary and fully diluted basis reported for net revenues and gross profit by business segment in thousands net gross net gross revenues profit revenues profit pharmaceuticals     intravenous products     other operations     intersegment eliminations  total     net revenues totalled  million for  an increase of million  or  from the  million reported in the prior year 
consolidated gross profit increased million  or  as compared to gross profit totalled million of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million of net revenues for the prior year 
net revenues of ivax pharmaceutical operations  which represented approximately of consolidated net revenues  increased million from net revenues of ivax domestic and international pharmaceutical operations increased million and million  respectively 
the market introduction of and related promotional programs for new generic products manufactured by ivax was the principal factor leading to the rise in the net revenues of ivax domestic pharmaceutical operations from million in to a total of million in during april  ivax received fda approval to market cefaclor  the generic equivalent of eli lilly and company s ceclor r  an antibiotic indicated for the treatment of a variety of infections 
net revenues attributable to sales of cefaclor totalled million in competition in the generic cefaclor market is likely to result in lower cefaclor net revenues and gross profit for ivax in in addition  the principal raw material used in the manufacture of cefaclor is presently available to ivax from only one source 
changes in the availability of or the price charged for the raw material may affect ivax future net revenues or gross profit attributable to cefaclor 
furthermore  ivax sale of cefaclor is the subject of a patent infringement action brought by eli lilly and company  as discussed in note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
during the latter part of the third quarter and throughout the fourth quarter of  ivax commenced domestic sales of nine other recently approved generic products  contributing an additional million in net revenues to its domestic pharmaceutical operations 
these new products included the december introduction of ivax albuterol metered dose inhaler  the generic equivalent of glaxo inc s ventolin r inhalation aerosol  used in the treatment of asthma  which contributed million to net revenues 
although sales of these new products were a significant factor contributing to the overall increase in net revenues of the domestic pharmaceutical operations compared to  the levels of revenues generated during the introduction period of a new generic drug are often higher than the levels experienced for routine inventory replenishment by customers in the months following the drug s introduction 
net revenues attributable to sales of verapamil hcl er tablets manufactured by ivax totalled million in compared to million in the decline in net revenues was due primarily to a reduction in the net selling price of verapamil caused by competition  offset in part by increased unit volume caused by an increase in the substitution rate of generic verapamil for brand name verapamil 
ivax had been the sole united states supplier of generic verapamil until march  when zenith laboratories  inc zenith began distribution of generic verapamil supplied by a company marketing brand name verapamil 
notwithstanding ivax pooling of interests acquisition of zenith in december  competition in the generic verapamil market has continued because zenith s former verapamil supplier commenced distribution of generic verapamil through another generic pharmaceutical company 
in addition  in march  another generic manufacturer received regulatory approval for one of the dosage strengths of verapamil sold by ivax 
competition in the generic verapamil market is likely to result in lower verapamil net revenues and gross profit for ivax in as noted in the overview  other manufacturers may obtain regulatory approvals or otherwise determine to market generic products equivalent to ivax manufactured generic products  such as cefaclor  albuterol and verapamil  in and thereafter 
as additional competitors enter the generic pharmaceutical market with products similar to those manufactured by ivax  the resulting competition is likely to reduce ivax net revenues and gross profit generated from those products 
ivax international pharmaceutical operations generated net revenues of million in compared to million in the million increase in international pharmaceutical net revenues included an increase of million attributable to the operations of galena as galena 
the july acquisition of a majority interest in galena was accounted for as a purchase  and accordingly  galena s results of operations are included in ivax consolidated financial statements only since the acquisition date 
the remaining million increase in net revenues of ivax international pharmaceutical operations was primarily due to higher sales of branded respiratory products in the united kingdom accompanied by the favorable impact of exchange rate differences in comparison to the prior year 
net revenues attributable to sales of branded respiratory products represented approximately of the total net revenues of the international pharmaceutical operations in as compared to approximately of the total during the prior year 
the gross profit percentage of ivax pharmaceutical operations was in as compared to in the gross profit percentage remained relatively constant in comparison to the prior year due primarily to domestic sales of the recently approved generic products manufactured by ivax  which are sold at a higher margin  in combination with a shift in sales mix to higher margin branded products manufactured by ivax international pharmaceutical operations 
the margin contribution of these products almost entirely offset the decrease in the gross profit margin resulting from the competition in the domestic generic pharmaceutical distribution business experienced during net revenues of the intravenous products division totalled approximately million in  an increase of million from the million reported for the increase in net revenues resulted primarily from higher sales of infusion pumps and needlefree intravenous sets and increased revenues from admixture services  partially offset by lower net revenues attributable to both hespan r  mcgaw s brand name blood plasma expansion product  and specialty nutrition solutions 
net revenues for also included a million one time settlement of a contractual obligation 
gross profit was million in compared to million in the gross profit percentage of the intravenous products division decreased from in to in the reduction in gross profit and the decrease in the gross profit percentage were primarily due to the reduction in the net selling price of hespan r caused by new competition and the decrease in selling prices of the specialty nutrition solutions 
in february  another pharmaceutical company introduced a generic version of hespan r in the united states resulting in both lower prices and a reduction in the intravenous products division s share of the market 
net revenues and gross profit derived from hespan r are expected to continue to decrease in as compared to due in part to additional competition from other companies expected to begin marketing a generic version of the product 
net revenues and gross profit of ivax personal care products  diagnostics and specialty chemicals operations  excluding intersegment eliminations  represented approximately of consolidated net revenues and consolidated gross profit in combined net revenues of these other operations decreased million from primarily as a result of lower net revenues attributable to textile and denim product sales of ivax specialty chemicals group 
declines in gross profit were experienced by each of ivax other operations during  resulting in a decrease in combined gross profit of million compared to operating expenses by business segment in thousands research amortization general and and of merger selling administrative development intangibles expenses total pharmaceuticals      intravenous products      other operations      corporate and other    total       pharmaceuticals       intravenous products      other operations      corporate and other    total       selling expenses totalled million of net revenues in compared to million of net revenues in  an increase of million 
an increase in selling expenses of ivax international pharmaceutical operations  due primarily to the rise in its net revenues  accounted for approximately of this increase  or million 
general and administrative expenses totalled million of net revenues in compared to million of net revenues for the prior year 
the million increase in general and administrative expenses of ivax pharmaceutical operations  in comparison to the prior year  was principally the result of increased general and administrative expenses of the international pharmaceutical operations primarily due to higher facilities and personnel related expenditures  the impact of a full twelve months of general and administrative expenses of galena during  and the unfavorable effect of exchange rate differences 
the intravenous products division reported an increase of million in this expense category compared to principally as a result of a million adverse arbitration award during the fourth quarter related to a contract dispute  in combination with increased legal expenses incurred throughout the year 
corporate general and administrative expenses increased million from the prior year primarily due to increases in personnel  travel and facilities costs 
research and development expenses for rose million  or  in comparison to the prior year  to a total of million 
over of the growth in this expense category was concentrated in ivax pharmaceutical operations 
the increase in research and development expenses in comparison to the prior year reflects ivax continuing focus on the development of new and improved products 
management intends to continue to increase the level of its research and development efforts 
actual expenditures will depend on  among other things  the outcome of clinical testing of products under development  delays or changes in government required testing and approval procedures  technological and competitive developments  and strategic marketing decisions 
amortization expense decreased million compared to as a result of the write off of deferred financing costs associated with the march retirement of debt by the intravenous products division  in combination with the effect of the amortization of the excess of the fair value of assets acquired from galena over the purchase price paid 
the million of merger expenses reported for were primarily related to a proposed merger with hafslund nycomed which was abandoned in november the million of merger expenses incurred during the prior year were principally attributable to the december acquisition of zenith 
other income  net  increased million compared to primarily due to the sale of ivax investment in preferred stock of north american vaccine  inc which resulted in a pre tax gain of million 
higher licensing and grant revenues of ivax international pharmaceutical operations and a gain on the sale of certain trademarks by ivax personal care products group  contributed to the remaining million increase in other income  net  as compared to year ended december  compared to the year ended december  ivax reported net income of million for the year ended december   a decrease of million from the million of net income in income before extraordinary items was million for compared to million for  a decline of million

ivax international pharmaceutical operations generated net revenues of million in approximately million of the total million increase in international pharmaceutical net revenues resulted from the july acquisition of a majority interest in galena 
the remaining million increase in net revenues of ivax international pharmaceutical operations was primarily due to higher sales of both branded and generic products in the united kingdom 
excluding the impact of ivax acquisition of zenith  net revenues attributable to sales of verapamil manufactured by ivax were million  a decline of million from the december acquisition of zenith contributed an additional million to ivax consolidated verapamil net revenues 
domestic pharmaceutical net revenues  exclusive of verapamil  were approximately million in compared to million in during the first quarter and part of the second quarter of  the domestic pharmaceutical operations were adversely impacted by delays in processing and shipment of customer orders and the loss of customer orders as a result of the conversion to a new computer software system designed to integrate sales order entry  inventory control and product delivery functions 
prior to the close of the second quarter of  ivax had resolved most of the system conversion problems and had significantly increased its promotional efforts as a means to restore customer relationships affected by the system conversion problems 
the gross profit percentage of ivax pharmaceutical operations declined from in to in the decline was primarily attributable to the reduction of verapamil unit sales prices  in combination with competition in the domestic generic pharmaceutical distribution business  partially offset by a shift in sales mix to higher margin branded products by ivax international pharmaceutical operations 
net revenues of the intravenous products division totalled million in  an increase of million from the million reported in higher net revenues from specialty intravenous solutions and sets  in combination with an increase in the admixture services business  primarily accounted for the rise in net revenues 
the increase from also included a million one time payment received in by mcgaw from a customer in settlement of a contractual obligation 
gross profit of the intravenous products division rose million from  to a total of million 
the increase in gross profit was principally the result of increased revenues  a more favorable product mix  the revenues associated with the settlement of the contractual obligation referenced above and improved product pricing combined with stable product costs 
net revenues of ivax personal care products  diagnostics and specialty chemicals operations  excluding intersegment eliminations  represented approximately of consolidated net revenues in both and net revenues of these other operations increased million  while gross profit of these operations decreased million as compared to the specialty chemicals group reported both higher net revenues and gross profit in comparison to  or increases of million and million  respectively 
these increases were principally attributable to sales generated by the businesses acquired from elf atochem north america  inc elf atochem in june the acquisition of the businesses was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  the results of operations of the acquired businesses were included in ivax consolidated financial statements only since the date of acquisition 
operating expenses by business segment in thousands research amortization general and and of merger selling administrative development intangibles expenses total pharmaceuticals       intravenous products      other operations      corporate and other    total       pharmaceuticals      intravenous products       other operations      corporate and other   total       selling expenses totalled million of net revenues in compared to million of net revenues in an increase in selling expenses of ivax pharmaceutical operations accounted for approximately of the million increase in total selling expenses as compared to increased personnel costs  primarily within ivax domestic pharmaceutical operations  in combination with higher advertising and promotional costs in both the domestic and international operations  were the primary factors contributing to the million increase in selling expenses of the pharmaceuticals group 
general and administrative expenses totalled million of net revenues in  an increase of million in comparison to the million of net revenues reported for the million increase in general and administrative expenses of ivax pharmaceuticals operations resulted primarily from increased facilities and personnel expenditures  and the inclusion of million of general and administrative expenses of galena 
higher corporate expense levels required as a result of ivax growth contributed million to the total rise in general and administrative expenses as compared to general and administrative expenses of ivax other operations increased million in comparison to  primarily due to million in costs related to charges of the specialty chemicals group in connection with  primarily  the closing of certain facilities 
merger expenses were million in compared to million in approximately million of the merger expenses incurred in were attributable to the acquisition of zenith  including million paid by zenith in connection with the termination of its distribution agreement with its former generic verapamil supplier 
interest expense declined million in comparison to  primarily due to the march redemption of mcgaw s million of subordinated notes and the march repayment of mcgaw s million of term floating rate debt  partially offset by increased interest expense associated with borrowings under ivax revolving credit facility 
other income  net  decreased million compared to principally due to lower licensing and grant revenues of ivax international pharmaceutical operations  in combination with increased losses on the disposal of plant and equipment 
currency fluctuations for  and  approximately  and  respectively  of ivax net revenues were attributable to operations which principally generated revenues in currencies other than the united states dollar 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar impact the reported results of operations for ivax 
if the united states dollar weakens relative to the foreign currency  the earnings generated in the foreign currency will  in effect  increase when converted into united states dollars and vice versa 
as a result of exchange rate differences  net revenues increased by million in as compared to  and increased by million in as compared to as of december   ivax corporation the parent company had a net british pound sterling million approximately million short term intercompany receivable 
ivax seeks to reduce the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations in short term intercompany balances  and on december  the parent company entered into foreign currency forward contracts totalling british pound sterling million 
costs associated with these contracts are being amortized over the contracts lives 
the contracts expire on march  norton healthcare uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to currency fluctuations on certain of its raw material inventory purchases 
as the commitments made by the contracts represent offsetting exposure to commitments to purchase inventory at specified amounts payable in other currencies  exposure to foreign currency losses is eliminated 
the contract amounts of these instruments at year end and were approximately million and million  respectively 
income taxes ivax effective tax rate was  and in  and  respectively 
for the three years ended december   the effective tax rate for ivax foreign subsidiaries was  and  respectively 
ivax consolidated effective tax rate in and was substantially lower than the effective tax rate in primarily as a result of a higher proportion of income generated by ivax operations in ireland  puerto rico and the us virgin islands  which are taxed at lower statutory rates 
additionally  during  ivax consolidated tax provision was reduced by million as a result of the release of valuation allowances associated with the realization of the benefits of available net operating loss carryforwards and other temporary differences 
during  ivax consolidated tax provision was reduced by million as a result of the release of valuation allowances associated with the realization of the benefits of available net operating loss carryforwards 
certain subsidiaries of ivax  including mcgaw and zenith  have net operating loss carryforwards which are subject to certain limitations 
for further information see note  income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
ivax future consolidated effective tax rate will  to a large extent  depend on the mix between foreign and domestic taxable income and the statutory tax rates of the related tax jurisdictions 
the mix between ivax foreign and domestic taxable income may be significantly affected by the jurisdictions in which new products are manufactured 
ivax receives a us tax credit under section of the internal revenue code for certain income generated by its puerto rican and virgin island operations 
for  this credit was million and completely offset the entire us tax liability of such operations 
no assurance can be given that congress will not eliminate the section tax credit in the future 
liquidity and capital resources at december   ivax working capital totalled million  compared to million and million at year end and  respectively 
cash and cash equivalents were million at december  compared to million at year end and million on the same date in ivax generated million in cash from operating activities during  representing declines of million from and million from the decline in cash generated from operating activities as compared to both and was primarily due to a higher rate of growth in accounts receivable  partially offset by increased net income 
the increase in accounts receivable during was primarily due to the launch of new manufactured generic products by the domestic pharmaceutical operations during the third and fourth quarters and the extension of credit terms in connection with the launch of those products 
the comparison of cash generated by operations in versus was also affected by lower growth in inventories and significant gains from the disposal of assets 
net cash of million was used for investing activities in  a decrease of million from and an increase of million from cash utilized for capital expenditures increased from million and million in and  respectively  to a total of million in approximately of the total capital expenditures made in were devoted to ivax pharmaceuticals and intravenous products operations 
during  ivax sold its investment in preferred stock of north american vaccine  inc for approximately million in cash 
ivax used million in cash to acquire businesses in  representing a decline from both and ivax used million in cash  including the payment of acquisition related expenses and net of cash acquired  to obtain a majority ownership interest in galena during during  ivax used million of cash to acquire businesses  including approximately million of cash to acquire certain businesses from elf atochem 
prior to the close of  two of the businesses acquired from elf atochem were sold for a business valued at million and million in cash 
on march   ivax established a revolving credit facility permitting borrowings of up to million  secured by a pledge of the stock of mcgaw and an agreement not to pledge or dispose of certain of ivax significant subsidiaries 
in november  the credit facility was amended  increasing permitted borrowings to million 
as of december   million in borrowings were outstanding under this facility  an increase of million from the prior year end 
the credit facility contains various financial covenants  including a restriction on the payment of dividends by ivax during any fiscal year in excess of of ivax consolidated net income 
ivax is in compliance with all such covenants 
during  amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility were primarily used to fund working capital requirements and to fund capital expenditure programs within ivax pharmaceuticals and intravenous products operations 
during  borrowings under the revolving credit facility were used  in part to finance ivax acquisition of a controlling interest in galena and to repay mcgaw s million of term floating rate notes and the amounts borrowed under mcgaw s revolving facility which totalled million as of december  mcgaw s credit facility was terminated in june in november  ivax obtained an unsecured floating rate overdraft facility which provides for advances of up to million 
as of december    was outstanding under the overdraft facility 
the revolving credit facility providing for borrowings of up to million previously maintained by zenith expired in june during and  ivax redeemed a total of million and million  respectively  face value of its convertible subordinated notes due additionally  during and  mcgaw repurchased million and million  respectively  face value of its senior notes due senior notes at a purchase price of of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 
on january   mcgaw repurchased  face value of its senior notes at a purchase price of of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the indenture governing the senior notes contains certain covenants applicable to mcgaw  including limitations on restricted payments  dividends and additional borrowings 
as of december   mcgaw was either in compliance with these covenants or had received a waiver from the trustee 
on march   ivax revolving line of credit was amended to provide for an additional million in borrowings for a period of ninety days 
the amendment also changed the expiration date of the revolving line of credit from march  to may  ivax is seeking to enter into a new revolving line of credit in the amount of million with a bank syndicate 
proceeds from the new line of credit will be used to refinance the existing line of credit and the senior notes  and for general corporate purposes  including to fund working capital requirements and to finance acquisitions 
proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants totalled million in  increases of million from and million from in march  mcgaw completed a public offering of its common stock resulting in net proceeds of million 
mcgaw used the net proceeds from its stock offering  plus an additional million borrowed under its million revolving credit facility  to redeem million of mcgaw s subordinated notes due at a contractually required premium of million 
a portion of the proceeds were also used by mcgaw to pay a cancellation fee and accrued interest related to an interest rate swap agreement totalling million 
during  ivax paid total cash dividends of million  or 
per share on its common stock 
this represented increases from the million  or 
per share  and the million  or 
per share  in dividends paid on ivax common stock during and  respectively 
immediately prior to its acquisition by ivax in december  zenith paid all outstanding cumulative dividends on its preferred stock or a total of million 
ivax issued  shares of its common stock valued at approximately million as of the acquisition date and paid approximately million in cash during in connection with three acquisitions 
see note  acquisitions  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information concerning these acquisitions 
during  ivax issued an aggregate of approximately million shares of common stock having a value of million at the respective issuance dates to consummate the acquisition of mcgaw and zenith 
in addition  during  ivax acquired a majority ownership interest in galena for approximately million in cash 
during  ivax issued an aggregate of million shares of common stock having a value of approximately million at the respective issuance dates  and paid an aggregate of approximately million in cash  to consummate four acquisitions 
ivax intends to continue to expand through the acquisition of other businesses  as well as internal growth 
certain acquisitions could result in material changes in ivax financial condition and results of operations 
ivax believes it has adequate capital and sources of financing to support its ongoing operational requirements 
these funds will be derived from ivax existing working capital  the increased revolving credit facility currently under negotiation and cash flow from operations 
for the long term  ivax presently believes it will be able to obtain long term capital to the extent necessary to support its growth objectives 
ivax plans to spend substantial amounts of capital in to continue the research and development of its pharmaceutical and intravenous products 
although combined research and development expenditures of the pharmaceutical and intravenous operations are planned to increase by approximately to in comparison to  actual expenditures will depend on  among other things  the outcome of clinical testing of products under development  delays or changes in government required testing and approval procedures  technological and competitive developments and strategic marketing decisions 
in addition  ivax plans to spend substantial amounts of capital in to improve and expand its pharmaceutical and intravenous related facilities  with higher levels of capital expenditures devoted to these operations in comparison to
