item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations references to years are to the company s fiscal years ended june alliance has devoted substantial resources to research and development related to its pharmaceutical products 
the company has been unprofitable since inception and expects to continue to spend substantial amounts on research and development  preclinical testing and clinical trials  regulatory activities  and commercial manufacturing start up 
the company has entered into collaborative research and development agreements with pharmaceutical companies for oxygent and liquivent  and is actively searching for a similar arrangement for imagent us 
the arrangements with its existing partners require them to reimburse the company for substantially all of its development expenses incurred for the respective products and to make milestone payments to the company upon the achievement of certain product development events  followed by royalties on sales at commercialization 
if the company enters into a similar arrangement for imagent us  and some of the development events under its existing agreements are achieved and the relevant payments made  the company could become profitable on a periodic basis over the next two years  prior to the commercialization of products 
however  the timing and amounts of such license fees and milestone payments  if any  cannot be predicted with certainty and may not occur if product development events are not achieved 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve profitability at all or on a sustained basis 
liquidity and capital resources through june  the company financed its activities primarily from public and private sales of equity and funding from collaborations with corporate partners 
to date  the company s revenue from the sale of products has not been significant 
in april  the company completed a public offering of million shares of newly issued common stock  resulting in net proceeds to the company of approximately million 
in february  the company entered into a license agreement with hmri  which provides hmri with worldwide marketing and manufacturing rights to the intratracheal administration of liquids  including liquivent  which perform bronchoalveolar lavage or liquid ventilation 
the product is being developed jointly by alliance and hmri with hmri responsible for substantially all of the costs of development and marketing 
in conjunction with the hmri license agreement  hmri purchased shares of series b preferred stock and series c preferred stock for million 
in addition  hmri paid alliance an initial license fee of million and agreed to pay further license fees  milestone payments  and royalties on product sales 
hmri also received a five year warrant to acquire  shares of common stock at per share 
in june  the series b preferred stock was converted into common stock of the company 
in august  the company entered into a loan and security agreement under which the company received million 
amounts borrowed under the agreement are secured by fixed assets  and are being repaid over three years 
if certain financial covenants are not satisfied  the debt may become due and payable 
the company has financed substantially all of its office and research facilities and related leasehold improvements under operating lease arrangements 
in april  the company completed offerings of million shares of newly issued common stock  resulting in net proceeds to the company of approximately million 
in august  the company entered into the ortho license agreement for injectable pfc emulsions capable of transporting oxygen for therapeutic use  including oxygent 
under the ortho license agreement  ortho paid to alliance an initial fee of million and agreed to make other payments upon the achievement of certain milestones 
ortho is responsible for substantially all the remaining costs of developing and marketing the products and will pay alliance a royalty based upon sales of products after commercialization 
from august through june   the company had received aggregate research revenue payments under the ortho license agreement of million from ortho  and as of june   had recorded a receivable of million  which was subsequently received 
in conjunction with the ortho license agreement  j jdc purchased series a preferred stock for million and obtained a three year warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at per share 
in june  the series a preferred stock was converted into common stock of the company  and j jdc exercised its warrant for  shares 
the company had net working capital of million at june  compared to million at june  the company s cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments increased to million at june  from million at june  the company received net proceeds of approximately million from the public offering of million shares of common stock in april the company also received million in june from the exercise of the warrant held by j jdc 
the company received million from the issuance of preferred stock to hmri  and million under the august loan and security agreement 
these increases were partially offset by net cash used in operations of million  and property  plant and equipment additions of million 
the company s operations to date have consumed substantial amounts of cash  and are expected to continue to do so for the foreseeable future 
in december  in order to obtain a commitment for a long term supply of raw material for both clinical trials and anticipated future production requirements  the company entered into an agreement with a supplier under which the company was obligated to make payments to the supplier through may based  in part  upon the achievement of certain milestones 
based upon the supplier s intent to negotiate directly with the company s existing and future collaborative partners  that agreement was modified in july to terminate certain commitments by both parties 
some or all of the company s payment obligations that remain may be reimbursed to the company by existing collaborative partners 
the company continually reviews its product development activities in an effort to allocate its resources to those product candidates that the company believes have the greatest commercial potential 
factors considered by the company in determining the products to pursue include projected markets and need  potential for regulatory approval and reimbursement under the existing health care system  status of its proprietary rights  technical feasibility  expected and known product attributes  and estimated costs to bring the product to market 
based on these and other factors  the company may from time to time reallocate its resources among its product development activities 
additions to products under development or changes in products being pursued can substantially and rapidly change the company s funding requirements 
the company expects to incur substantial additional expenditures associated with product development 
the company will seek additional collaborative research and development relationships with suitable corporate partners for its non licensed products 
there can be no assurance that such relationships  if any  will successfully reduce the company s funding requirements 
additional equity or debt financing may be required  and there can be no assurance that funds from these sources will be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to delay  scale back  or eliminate one or more of its product development programs  or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require the company to relinquish rights to certain of its technologies  product candidates  or products that the company would not otherwise relinquish 
alliance anticipates that its current capital resources  including the net proceeds from the recent offering  expected revenues from the ortho license agreement  hmri license agreement  and investments  will be adequate to satisfy its capital requirements for at least the next months 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including continued scientific progress in its research and development programs  progress with preclinical testing and clinical trials  the time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  patent costs  competing technological and market developments  changes in existing collaborative relationships  the ability of the company to establish additional collaborative relationships  and the cost of manufacturing scale up 
while the company believes that it can produce materials for clinical trials and the initial market launch for its emulsion products at its existing san diego facility and for liquivent at its otisville facility  it may need to expand its commercial manufacturing capabilities for its products in the future 
this expansion may occur in stages  each of which would require regulatory approval  and product demand could at times exceed supply capacity 
the company has not selected a site or obtained any regulatory approvals for construction of a commercial production facility for its products  nor can there be any assurance that it will be able to do so 
the projected location and completion date of any production facility will depend upon regulatory and development activities and other factors 
the company cannot predict the amount that it will expend for the construction of such a production facility  and there can be no assurance as to when or whether the fda will determine that such facility complies with good manufacturing practices 
construction of a facility will depend on regulatory approvals  product development  and capital resources  among other things 
the ortho license agreement provides an option to ortho to elect to manufacture the emulsion products referred to therein  or to require the company to manufacture such products at a negotiated price 
the hmri license agreement requires the company to manufacture liquivent at its otisville facility for a period of time after market launch and to sell the product to hmri at a negotiated price 
hmri will be responsible for establishing production capacity beyond the maximum capacity of the otisville facility 
except for historical information  the statements made herein and elsewhere are forward looking 
the company wishes to caution readers that these statements are only predictions and that the company s business is subject to significant risks 
the factors discussed herein and other important factors  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  the company s actual results and could cause the company s actual consolidated results for  and beyond  to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company 
these risks include the inability to enter into collaborative relationships to further develop and commercialize the company s products  changes in any such relationships  or the inability of any collaborative partner to adequately commercialize any of the company s products  the uncertainties associated with the lengthy regulatory approval process  obtaining and enforcing patents important to the company s business  and possible competition from other products 
furthermore  even if the company s products appear promising at an early stage of development  they may not reach the market for a number of important reasons 
such reasons include  but are not limited to  the possibilities that the potential products will be found ineffective during clinical trials  failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals  difficulties in manufacturing on a large scale  failure to obtain market acceptance  and the inability to commercialize because of proprietary rights of third parties 
the research  development  and market introduction of new products will require the application of considerable technical and financial resources  while revenues generated from such products  assuming they are developed successfully  may not be realized for several years 
other material and unpredictable factors which could affect operating results include  without limitation  the uncertainty of the timing of product approvals and introductions and of sales growth  the ability to obtain necessary raw materials at cost effective prices or at all  the effect of possible technology and or other business acquisitions or transactions  and the increasing emphasis on controlling health care costs and potential legislation or regulation of health care pricing
