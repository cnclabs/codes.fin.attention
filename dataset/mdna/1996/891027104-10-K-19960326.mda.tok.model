item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and torchmark s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
results of operations in the fourth quarter of  torchmark decided to dispose of its coalbed methane gas development in the black warrior basin of alabama due to disappointments in production 
during  torchmark experienced increased difficulties in obtaining significant gas production from the lower coal seams from this development  resulting in revisions to engineering estimates of reserves 
accordingly  the black warrior investment was written down to its estimated realizable value 
the writedown amounted to an after tax charge of million  or per share for please refer to black warrior writedown on page of this report for more information 
in addition to the black warrior disposal  torchmark also determined earlier in to sell torch energy  its energy management subsidiary 
torchmark is currently negotiating the disposal of torch energy through a management led buyout 
it is anticipating that the transaction will result in total consideration of approximately million  consisting of cash and other securities 
a small gain is expected on the sale 
as a result of the proposed sale of torch energy and the decision to dispose of black warrior  torchmark has elected to exit the energy industry  accounting for such as a disposal of a segment 
therefore  torchmark has modified the presentation in its financial statements for and all prior periods to set forth separately the net assets and results attributable to the discontinued energy segment as discontinued operations 
net income from continuing operations for was million  increasing over million in on a per share basis  income from continuing operations was in  gaining from 
net income was million  or per share in  compared with million or per share in excluding realized investment gains and losses and the associated adjustment to deferred acquisition costs  net income from continuing operations was per share  rising over the prior period amount of 
in  net income per share from continuing operations  excluding realized investment gains and the associated adjustment to deferred acquisition costs  rose over per share in the adjustment to deferred acquisition costs was made because of an accounting rule requiring that deferred acquisition costs on interest sensitive insurance products be amortized in accordance with expected gross profits 
since realized investment gains or losses on assets backing such products change profit expectations  the adjustment is required 
realized investment losses for included a million after tax  or 
per share  writedown of an investment in southwestern life corporation  which filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in the third quarter of in a comparison of results with those of  attention should be given to the acquisition of american income on november  for total consideration of million 
american income s results were consolidated with torchmark s after the acquisition date  being included for a full year in for the first time 
american income added approximately million to torchmark s net income  after taking into account goodwill amortization and financing costs 
in comparison with  a number of nonrecurring items should be considered 
in november   torchmark sold of its interest in vesta insurance group  inc vesta  which was a wholly owned property and casualty subsidiary prior to the sale 
such interest was sold for proceeds of million and a million pretax gain from the sale was recognized as other income 
vesta s operations were consolidated with torchmark s in prior to the sale 
results for included an million pretax charge for nonoperating expenses  compared with million for these charges related to legal costs  guaranty assessments  and other contingencies  some of which are discussed in more depth in item legal proceedings on page of this report 
the million charge in was offset  however  by a reclassification of nonoperating expense to health benefits  since actual payments will be made in the form of health benefits 
two new accounting standards which dealt with postretirement benefits and income taxes were implemented in  increasing earnings million 
corporate tax legislation was enacted in which increased tax rates from to  resulting in an additional charge to earnings of million to adjust the deferred tax liability relating to prior years 
revenues increased in to billion from billion in  an increase of million 
the american income acquisition accounted for the increase when adjusting for lost investment income from the purchase  adding million to total revenues in  compared with million in in comparison with  revenues decreased 
after exclusion of vesta revenues and the one time gain from the vesta sale in  the decrease in revenues would have been 
premium income rose in over the prior year to billion  after having increased in over the prior period  adjusting to exclude vesta premium in the million gain in premium in was caused by the inclusion of american income premium for a full year  which increased million over the components of torchmark s revenues and operations are described in more detail in the discussion of segments and investment operations found on pages through of this report 
other operating expenses rose million in over the prior year or 
the inclusion of american income s expenses for a full year accounted for million of the increase 
after adjusting for american income and vesta  expenses declined from increases in goodwill amortization  interest expense  and the mips dividend were caused by the american income acquisition in and the united management acquisition in the american income purchase added million and the united management purchase added million in annual goodwill amortization 
please refer to the following sections of this report for a more complete discussion of these purchases and the related financing costs acquisition of american income on page  capital resources on page  and merger with united management on page the following is a discussion of torchmark s operations by segment 
insurance life insurance torchmark markets life insurance under a variety of different distribution channels 
the following table presents life insurance premium income during each of the three years ended december  by distribution method life insurance premium by distribution method dollar amounts in thousands of of of amount total amount total amount total united american general agency    united american captive agency    direct response    home service    american income captive agency   preneed captive agency 
   waddell reed captive agency    other    life insurance premium  including policy charges  grew to million for the year life premium in was million  increasing over the american income acquisition in late had a considerable impact on life insurance operations subsequent to the acquisition date 
american income life premium was million in  compared with million in  accounting for million of the million increase in life premium for sales of life premium were strong in both and in terms of annualized premium in force issued  sales were million and sales were million  increasing in and in american income  however  accounted for million of sales  or of the increase 
annualized life premium in force climbed in to million at december annualized life premium in force was million at december   rising over year end 
the increase was after adjusting for the inclusion for american income s annualized life premium in force of million at the acquisition date 
annualized premium in force data includes amounts collected on certain interest sensitive life products which are not recorded as premium income but exclude single premium income and policy charges 
torchmark s life annualized premium in force exceeded its health annualized premium in force at year end for the first time since year end  underscoring torchmark s emphasis on life insurance sales 
torchmark has emphasized increases in sales of life insurance product lines relative to health and other insurance products because profit margins for life insurance are superior 
additionally  assets backing the higher reserves required for life products allow torchmark to increase investment income 
profit margins for life insurance operations  as measured by insurance operating income as a percentage of premium  has approximated in each of the three years presented 
life insurance summary of results dollar amounts in thousands of of of amount premium amount premium amount premium premium and policy charges    policy obligations    required reserve inter est    net policy obligations 
   amortization of acquisi tion costs    commissions and premium taxes    other expense    total expense    insurance operating in come    as a percentage of premium  insurance operating income has remained constant in both and over the prior period 
excluding american income  insurance margins have remained stable with a slight increase in policy obligations offset by lower amortization of acquisition costs 
a major factor in maintaining stable margins is improved persistency 
improvements in persistency are beneficial to operating income margins because they lower the rate of amortization of acquisition costs and certain other expenses 
in addition  improved persistency increases profits because the premium life is extended 
persistency improvements have resulted  at least in part  from revisions in agents compensation formulas to encourage lower lapses 
improvements have also been attributable to the conversion of a large portion of agent collected home service business to bank draft and direct billing premium  which have higher persistency 
in fact  torchmark will no longer sell agent collected business starting in agent collected premium as a percentage of total home service premium was approximately at year end  compared with five years earlier 
american income s life business has an insurance operating income margin of approximately  similar to other torchmark life insurance products 
however  as a percentage of premium  the american income business is characterized by lower policy obligations and higher amortization of acquisition costs 
the higher acquisition cost ratio is a result of the higher amortization of the value of insurance purchased relative to deferred acquisition costs 
the above presentation of life insurance results excludes a million benefit in from the review of reserving assumptions on a block of burial reserves 
an evaluation of assumptions regarding mortality  interest  and inflation pressures on burial costs indicated that sufficient experience existed to support a change in the level of reserves held on this block 
torchmark will continue to monitor its reserving assumptions for this block on an annual basis to ensure that reserves are adequate to meet contractual liabilities 
had this item been included  the ratio of policy obligations to premium would have been reduced and overall margin would have been increased 
health insurance health products sold by torchmark include medicare supplement insurance  cancer insurance  long term care  and other under age medical and hospitalization products 
as a percentage of annualized health premium in force at december   medicare supplement accounted for  cancer accounted for  and other products accounted for 
these products are marketed by general  captive  and home service agents  direct response  and through associations 
the table below presents health insurance premium income during each of the three years ended december  by distribution method health insurance premium by distribution method dollar amounts in thousands of of of amount total amount total amount total united american general agen cy    united american captive agen cy    direct response   home service    american income captive agen cy   health premium was million in  falling from million in health premium declined in annualized premium in force stood at million at december   declining from year end premium in force of million 
annualized health premium in force declined in sales of health insurance products in terms of annualized premium issued declined to million in  after having declined in these declines in sales resulted in the diminished base of annualized health premium in force 
the declines in sales of health annualized premium in both years were primarily due to decreases in medicare supplement product sales 
sales of medicare supplement insurance were million in  compared with million in they declined in and in these sales declines caused annualized premium in force for medicare supplement to decrease from million at year end to million at year end to million at december  in the past few years  torchmark has encountered considerable competition in the medicare supplement market with regard to price and attained age pricing  whereby premium may be increased on a basis of increased age as well as increased medical costs 
the increased price competition has had a negative impact on sales 
also  in recent years  there has been increased competition from health maintenance organizations in the medicare supplement market 
uncertainty has also been a factor negatively affecting sales 
particularly in and  there was considerable uncertainty regarding various health care reforms proposed by both the clinton administration and congress which had bearing on the medicare supplement market 
additionally  in recent years  this market has experienced a great deal of increased regulation including government mandated policy forms  a required minimum loss ratio of on policies sold  and a required leveling of agents commissions 
the mandated loss ratio and leveling of commissions have put significant pressure on margins for torchmark as well as the rest of the industry  thus discouraging sales 
torchmark is implementing a number of measures to increase its sales of medicare supplement business 
torchmark s price increases on these products have not been as great as certain major competitors  which should give torchmark the opportunity to compete more effectively on the basis of price 
torchmark has also obtained approval in a number of states to sell the attained age product  thereby allowing torchmark to compete on this basis 
also  torchmark is continually developing new medicare supplement products and markets 
one such new product is a group medicare supplement product targeted at employees  unions  and associations 
while non medicare supplement product sales also declined in  this trend reversed in non medicare supplement health annualized premium issued rose to million in from million in cancer insurance annualized premium in force was million at december   gaining slightly over the prior year end 
cancer sales in terms of annualized premium issued rose to million in  compared with million in cancer sales were million in other health product annualized premium issued increased to million for  after declining in health insurance summary of results dollar amounts in thousands of of of amount premium amount premium amount premium premium    other income    total revenue    policy obligations    required reserve inter est    net policy obligations 
   amortization of acquisi tion costs    commissions and premium taxes    other expense    total expense    insurance operating in come    as a percentage of premium  insurance operating income for torchmark s health insurance grew from in to in  where it stabilized at in a primary reason for the increases in margins is the decline in the amortization of acquisition costs due to improved persistency 
improvement in the persistency of torchmark s health business has continued throughout each of the years considered  resulting in lower ratios of acquisition costs to premium 
these improvements have been brought about  at least in part  by the requirement in many states to level agents commissions on medicare supplement products instead of paying a larger first year commission 
this leveling of commissions has encouraged persistency through the payment of a higher renewal commission 
it has also encouraged persistency through the payment of a lower first year commission  which discourages replacement 
excluded from the above presentation of health results in were increases in cancer policy benefits arising from the reclassification described on page of this report 
annuities torchmark s annuity products serve a wide range of markets  such as providing retirement income  funding prearranged funerals  and offering long term tax deferred growth opportunities 
annuities are sold on both a fixed and variable basis 
fixed annuity deposits are held and invested by torchmark and are obligations of the company 
amounts deposited for variable annuities are invested at the policyholder s direction into his choice among nine w r managed mutual funds which vary in degree of investment risk and return 
a fixed investment account is also available as a variable annuity investment option 
these investments for variable annuity deposits are reported as separate account assets and the corresponding deposit balances for variable annuities are reported as separate account liabilities 
annuity premium is accounted for as a deposit and is not reflected in income 
revenues on both fixed and variable annuities are derived from charges to the annuity account balances for insurance risk  administration  and surrender  depending on the structure of the contract 
variable accounts are also charged an investment fee and a sales charge 
torchmark benefits to the extent these policy charges exceed actual costs and to the extent actual investment income exceeds the investment income which is credited to policyholders on fixed annuities 
the following table presents the annuity account balance at each year end and the annuity collections for each year for both fixed and variable annuities annuity deposit balances annuity collections dollar amounts in dollar amounts in millions thousands fixed    variable     total       annuity premium collections rose to million in over the prior year 
fixed annuity collections of million were up over three times the collections of million 
the increase in fixed annuity collections resulted largely from the entry of the united american agents into annuity markets during the fourth quarter of these agents work primarily through banks and market annuity products to bank customers 
these sales generated million of collections in fixed annuity collections declined in from the prior year 
variable annuity collections declined to million in the period  after having fallen in weaker financial markets in and early were thought to have caused the declines in sales of variable annuities 
sales of these products recovered in the second half of variable annuity sales rose to million in the second half of over million in the first half 
the variable annuity balance on deposit was billion at year end  growing over the prior year end 
growth was largely attributable to the strength of financial markets in mid and late  but was also due to the additional deposit collections 
the fixed annuity balance gained to million at december   as a result of the increased sales

   insurance operating margins for annuities as measured by the mean reserve have remained fairly stable throughout the three years examined 
annuity policy charges have increased in each period 
these charges were million in  gaining over charges of million  which in turn rose over the prior year 
growth in these policy charges resulted from the increase in size of the annuity account balance over each of the prior years  the increase in the number of annuity contracts in force  and the cumulative effect of growth in sales over the past few years on which the sales charge is based 
the allocated investment income  or the investment income earned in excess of policy requirements  also grew in each of the periods through these increases resulted from the growth in the fixed annuity deposit balances 
asset management financial services 
torchmark s financial services operations consist of the exclusive marketing  through professional financial planners  of mutual funds  including the united group and the w r group of funds 
these representatives also market a variety of insurance products of torchmark subsidiaries 
financial services operations also involve the management of mutual fund portfolios  the management of institutional portfolios  and the servicing of customer accounts 
revenues are derived from commissions for the sale of investment and insurance products  fees for management of investment asset portfolios  and fees for servicing the accounts 
financial services revenues climbed to million for the year from the prior year amount of million 
these revenues grew in asset management fees of million in were the largest component of financial services revenues  gaining over fees of million 
asset management fees grew in over increases in these fees have occurred due to the growth in average mutual fund assets and institutional assets under management  on which asset management fees are based 
average assets under management rose in and in growth in average assets under management resulted from added investment product sales in both the and periods 
additionally  asset growth was boosted by the strength in the financial markets 
assets under management were billion at december  and billion at december   rising in the increase in assets under management was less than 
commission revenues are derived from the sale of both investment and insurance products  with investment product commissions representing of total commission revenues and insurance product commissions the balance 
the commissions from insurance products and variable annuities are primarily from torchmark insurance subsidiaries  and are eliminated in consolidation 
investment product commissions declined to million in  after declining in investment product sales for and were level at billion  after having declined in from billion in in  sales of united funds  a front load product  declined to million  while sales of the w r funds  a deferred load product  rose to million

pretax operating margins improved in both and over the prior year  growing in to million after a rise in to million 
as a percentage of financial services revenues  pretax income stood at for the primary cause for the margin improvements has been the rapid growth in asset management fees in proportion to commission revenues 
asset management fees have a significantly greater profit margin than commissions 
commissions and selling expenses as a percentage of commission revenues declined from in to in but rose to in the decline was caused by the implementation of a b service fee which offsets certain direct expenses 
while this fee increased in  the decrease in expense was more than offset by additional expense from product promotion and efforts to expand the sales force 
it is anticipated that these additional expenditures will result in increased product sales in future periods 
energy as previously discussed on page of this report  torchmark intends to dispose of its energy operations and has classified such operations as discontinued operations in the financial statements 
these energy operations involved the management of proven producing oil and gas properties for both torchmark affiliates and unrelated parties by torch energy 
energy operations also included drilling of developmental wells  acquisition of properties and facilities  and marketing of oil and gas products by torch energy 
they also involved the extraction and production of energy products through direct energy investments 
black warrior writedown torchmark has maintained an investment in a coalbed methane gas development since in the black warrior basin of alabama 
the development was completed in during and  production results were below expectations and losses were experienced in both years 
prior to  torchmark reviewed its investment quarterly and determined there were no impairments for reserves under successful efforts accounting 
sfas was adopted by torchmark at issuance of the standard in march   and there were no impairments under the provisions of that standard at the time of adoption 
in the fourth quarter of  production problems accelerated  and it became apparent that it was not cost effective to incur the additional cost required to produce gas from the deeper coal seams 
as a result  certain reserves of the black warrior investment were reclassified from proved to possible  causing an approximate percent decline in the estimated proved gas reserves 
because of these factors  a decision was made by torchmark in the fourth quarter of to sell the black warrior investment 
as a result of these events  a review was made for impairment under the provisions of sfas in accordance with the requirements of sfas and in view of torchmark s desire to dispose of black warrior  torchmark wrote down its investment to its estimated net realizable value  resulting in an after tax charge of million  or per share in net realizable value was determined using a discounted cash flow model 
even though gas prices improved in  the significant decline in proved reserves resulted in the impairment of black warrior s estimated net realizable value 
investments because torchmark s black warrior coalbed methane investment and certain other energy investments are included in the disposed energy segment  these investments and the associated investment income are presented in the financial statements as discontinued operations 
therefore  all previously reported amounts of invested assets and investment income have been reclassified accordingly 
net investment income increased to million in  after having experienced a decline from million in to million in in comparison of net investment income between these three periods  the acquisition of american income and the disposition of vesta must be taken into account 
after adjusting for the effect of the american income acquisition  net investment income rose from million in to million 
when excluding the effect of both transactions  investment income declined from million in in addition to the larger invested asset base caused by the american income purchase  the increase in income over the prior year was also caused by certain other factors 
first  nonrecurring investment income was received in the fourth quarter of on passive energy investments retained by torchmark in the amount of million from a legal settlement 
additionally  there was a slight improvement in yield on the portfolio 
the effects of accelerated mortgage backed prepayments need to be considered when making a comparison with net investment income 
the decline in interest rates in encouraged refinancing of mortgages  causing increased gnma prepayments in and early these funds were reinvested at lower prevailing rates  causing a reduction in torchmark s investment income in and an even greater reduction in subsequent years 
it is estimated that gnma repayments reduced investment income million from as rates rose in  the refinancing trend reversed and torchmark was able to reinvest repayment proceeds in higher yielding securities 
torchmark reduced its exposure to gnma securities during and  to a greater extent  during  so that at december   gnma investments represented of invested assets  compared with of the portfolio three years earlier 
for this reason  the decline in rates during and the related increase in refinancings had little impact on torchmark s net investment income 
in  a persistent easing of inflationary expectations helped create a significant bond market rally which more than offset the weakness of yields available on fixed investments declined throughout the year  falling approximately basis points when measured by the ten and thirty year treasury bond 
in this environment  torchmark emphasized the acquisition of call protected corporate bonds  while continuing to reduce mortgage backed investments and municipal holdings 
during  investment acquisitions in the amount of billion were made at an average yield of  compared with acquisitions of billion yielding in corporate obligations represented of total new purchases 
the increased acquisition activity in resulted from the inclusion of american income s investment operations for the full year of  and  the reinvestment of proceeds from two sale programs executed during designed to lessen exposure to mortgage backed holdings 
the decline in rates in caused an increase in the market value of fixed maturity assets 
during the year  the market value of these assets increased million or to billion  exceeding billion for the first time in at december   market value exceeded book value on fixed investments by million 
this is in contrast to year end when book value exceeded market by million 
at year end  there was an unrealized gain of million 
the unrealized loss in resulted from the rise in rates in that year 
with the decrease in gnma holdings  the percentage of government and government guaranteed holdings within torchmark s fixed income portfolio continued to decline 
this percentage was at year end  at year end  and at year end torchmark s preference for quality is demonstrated  however  by the fact that at december   of the fixed income holdings were rated aaa by rating agencies and were considered to be investment grade 
repayment of investment assets is a function of both maturity and the changing interest rate environment 
the reduction in cash flow which resulted from gnma sales during the year was more than offset by the acquisition of shorter maturity corporate bonds and the increased probability of early calls as rates declined 
accordingly  at year end  an estimated of the fixed maturity portfolio should repay within five years  compared with at year end and at year end the following table is a presentation of the percentages of torchmark s fixed investment portfolio by estimated maturity 
short terms and under year 
years years years years over years because torchmark s investment program is based upon high quality fixed maturity bonds  torchmark s percentage ownership of other types of investments varies significantly from other companies in the industry 
the following table presents torchmark s holdings by asset type as of december  as contrasted with the industry averages prepared by the american council of life insurance 
torchmark industry amounts investment grade bonds short terms  noninvestment grade bonds  equities  mortgage loans  real estate  policy loans  other  latest data available from the american council of life insurance at year end  average life of the portfolio increased to years  compared with years at year end and years at year end financial condition liquidity torchmark is highly liquid  as evidenced by its positive cash flows  its marketable investments  and its credit facilities 
its insurance and asset management operations generate strong positive cash flows  well in excess of its immediate needs 
cash flows provided from operations  including deposit product operations  were million in  compared with million in  an increase of 
this increase was primarily caused by increased deposit product sales in and a one time million tax settlement paid in related to prior periods 
operating cash flows were million in in addition to operating cash flows  torchmark received million in of scheduled investment maturities and repayments  further enhancing total positive cash flow 
such repayments were million in and million in cash flows in excess of immediate requirements are used to build an investment base to fund future requirements 
cash and short term investments were million at december   compared with million at year end these liquid assets represented approximately of total assets at december   compared with at the end of the previous year 
in addition to torchmark s liquid assets  torchmark has a portfolio of marketable fixed and equity securities which are available for sale should the need arise 
these securities had a value of billion at december  torchmark has in place a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allowed unsecured borrowings up to million at december  this line of credit is further designed as a backup credit line for a commercial paper program not to exceed million  whereby torchmark may borrow from either the credit line or issue commercial paper at any time but may not borrow in excess of a total of million on the combined facilities 
at december   million in commercial paper was outstanding and there were no borrowings on the line of credit 
a facility fee is charged on the entire million balance 
in accordance with the agreements  torchmark is subject to certain covenants regarding capitalization and earnings 
at december   torchmark was in full compliance with these covenants 
liquidity of the parent company is affected by the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends 
dividends are paid by subsidiaries to the parent in order to meet its dividend payments on common and preferred stock  interest and principal repayment requirements on parent company debt  and operating expenses of the parent company 
dividends from insurance subsidiaries of torchmark are limited to the greater of statutory net gain from operations on an annual noncumulative basis or of surplus  in the absence of special approval  and distributions are not permitted in excess of statutory net worth 
subsidiaries are also subject to certain minimum capital requirements 
although these restrictions exist  dividend availability from subsidiaries has been and is expected to be more than adequate for parent company operations 
at december   a maximum amount of million was available to torchmark from insurance subsidiaries without regulatory approval 
capital resources the carrying amount of torchmark s long term debt was million at both year ends and major debt issues outstanding at december  were as follows principal amount instrument due rate millions sinking fund debentures senior notes senior debentures notes notes in connection with the american income purchase in november   torchmark issued eight million shares or million face amount cumulative monthly income preferred securities  series a mips in october  the mips were issued at an annual dividend rate of 
they are subject to a mandatory redemption in full at september   although torchmark may elect to extend the mips for up to an additional years if certain conditions are met 
they are redeemable at torchmark s option at any time after september  while torchmark is obligated to pay dividends at a fixed rate of  torchmark subsequently entered into a ten year interest rate swap agreement with an unaffiliated party whereby torchmark agreed to pay a variable rate on the million face amount in exchange for payment of the fixed dividend 
additionally  torchmark acquired a five year interest rate cap on the swap agreement that insures the variable rate cannot exceed 
at december   the variable rate was 
during  torchmark s after tax dividend cost for the mips was million  compared with million that would have been incurred without the swap and cap transactions 
short term debt was million at year end  compared with million at the end of the previous year 
torchmark paid down a net of million on its above mentioned credit facility during shareholders equity rose to billion at december   an increase of from december  shareholders equity of billion 
book value per share was at year end  compared with and at year ends and  respectively 
after adjusting for the impact of interest rate fluctuations on shareholders equity required by accounting rules  book value per share was at year end  an increase of over at year end comparative book value per share was at year end return from continuing operations on common shareholders equity was in  compared with in  declining in large part due to the growth in shareholders equity 
the return on equity ratio excludes the mark up or down of shareholders equity for changes in interest rates required by accounting rules 
total debt as a percentage of total capitalization was at december   with the mips counted as equity and excluding the effect of the above mentioned accounting rule 
this debt to capitalization ratio was at year end and at year end torchmark s multiple of earnings before interest  taxes  and discontinued operations to interest requirements was for  compared with in and in other items acquisition of american income on november   torchmark acquired american income for a total cash purchase price of approximately million 
american income sells life insurance to union and credit union members through exclusive agents 
the addition of american income s quality line of products and low cost operation fits well with torchmark s strategy of growing life insurance operations in niche markets 
the results of operations of american income were consolidated with those of torchmark after the purchase date 
funds for the purchase were provided through a million preferred stock offering which is discussed in more detail in the capital resources section above  a million bridge loan from a group of banks  the sale of investments available for sale  and internal cash flow 
restructure torchmark is exploring a strategic restructuring for the purpose of enhancing shareholder value 
many alternatives will be examined 
one alternative includes the possibility that torchmark could be divided into separate publicly traded operating companies 
because there are many complex tax  accounting  business  operational  and capital issues to be resolved  should such a restructuring be undertaken  it is unknown at this time what the ultimate form of this restructuring might take 
litigation torchmark and its subsidiaries continue to be named as parties to pending or threatened litigation  most of which involve punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at liberty in alabama 
such punitive damage claims are tried in alabama state courts where any punitive damage litigation has the potential for significant adverse results 
it is impossible to predict the extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case  since the amount of punitive damages in alabama is left largely to the discretion of the jury in each case 
it is thus difficult to predict with certainty the liability of torchmark or its subsidiaries in any given case because of the unpredictable nature of this type of litigation 
also  the class action litigation in alabama over an exchange of liberty s cancer policies continued in in may   a settlement was approved involving both equitable and monetary relief  valued by the court at million 
an appeal from the trial court s final approval of the settlement was taken to the alabama supreme court  and final briefs in the case were submitted to the supreme court in february  the supreme court affirmed the trial court s decision in december  in february   the alabama supreme court issued a notice overruling a petition for a rehearing 
merger with united management on october   torchmark acquired the approximately of united management that it did not already own through the payment of per share in cash for the remaining outstanding shares 
accordingly  united management was merged into torchmark 
including share purchases made in  the total amount of consideration paid to the remaining united management shareholders was approximately million 
divestiture of vesta during  torchmark entered into a transaction whereby it disposed of approximately of its common stock in vesta  its wholly owned subsidiary  which was at that time the holding company for torchmark s property and casualty operations 
on november   vesta sold nine million shares of common stock in a public offering of which million shares were owned by torchmark prior to the sale and million were newly issued shares 
torchmark s million shares were sold for per share less expenses  amounting to proceeds of approximately million and resulting in a million pretax gain 
after the transaction  torchmark continued to own million shares of vesta outstanding common stock or approximately of the company 
torchmark also loaned vesta million in december   which was repaid in full in with interest 
in january   vesta declared and paid a three for two share stock dividend 
after this dividend  torchmark owned million shares of vesta stock  still representing approximately of the company 
new accounting rules accounting for stock based compensation fasb statement no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with earlier adoption encouraged 
this statement establishes and encourages a new accounting method for employee stock options based on a presumed fair market value of the option at the time of grant 
previously  accounting standards required these options to be valued at intrinsic value  or the difference between the market value of the stock and the option price 
the cost of the options are to be charged to earnings generally over the option s vesting period 
the new method of valuation of options is not required  but if the new method is not elected  disclosure of its impact on earnings on a pro forma basis is required 
additional disclosures are also required 
torchmark intends to continue to account for options using the accounting rules currently in effect 
therefore  while there will be no effect on future reported earnings and earnings per share  disclosure will be made giving the pro forma effect of valuing options at estimated fair value 
no determination of fair value for torchmark s options has been made  but such valuation should not have material impact on pro forma results 
in  torchmark granted to employees stock options to purchase thousand shares at a price of per share
