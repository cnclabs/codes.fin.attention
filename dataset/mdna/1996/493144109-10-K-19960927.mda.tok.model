item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations fiscal year started out very strong with first quarter sales in excess of million and net income of million 
however  various market driven events began to negatively impact sales beginning in the second quarter 
second quarter sales declined to million and sales were down to million for the third quarter 
although there was some recovery in the fourth quarter of the year  sales volume did not recover to the levels reached in the first and second quarter 
during the fourth quarter  it became apparent that to remain competitive in the european marketplace  the company would need to scale down its manufacturing facility in dundalk  ireland and fill excess capacity in its juarez manufacturing facility 
restructuring activities were implemented during the quarter and a charge of million was recorded to reflect the estimated costs associated with this restructuring see note to the june  consolidated financial statements 
unit sales increased by compared to fiscal while average selling price asp declined by 
gross profit percentage decreased by to in compared to the results of operations improved each quarter due to an increase in sales from new products and programs to original equipment manufacturing customers 
the increased sales volume and the benefit of operating a full year in the company s juarez  mexico plant resulted in a lower cost of goods sold which allowed the company to improve its gross margins 
also  the company s operating expenses decreased  primarily due to lower selling expenses and the restructuring provision recorded in not recurring in the current year 
the large declines in asp experienced in and slowed significantly in this resulted from the addition of new value added products at higher asp s 
to accommodate the increase in sales  the company increased its manufacturing capacity through additional investment in molding  membrane production  and assembly facilities 
for the year  total unit sales increased by compared to fiscal while asp declined by 
gross profit percentage increased by from the prior year to in risks and uncertainties that may affect future results the following risks and uncertainties could affect the company s actual results and could cause results to differ materially from past results or those contemplated by the company s forward looking statements 
when used herein  the words expects  believes  anticipates and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
potential fluctuations in quarterly results 
the company s quarterly operating results have varied in the past and may vary in the future due to a variety of factors  including changes in overall demand for computer products  success of customers programs  timing of new programs  new product introductions or technological advances by the company  its customers and its competitors and changes in pricing policies by the company  its customers and its competitors 
for example  the company relies on customers forecasts to plan its business 
if those forecasts are overly optimistic  the company s revenues and profits may fall short of expectations 
conversely  if those forecasts are too conservative  the company could have an unexpected increase in revenues and profits 
competition 
the keyboard and other input device industry is intensely competitive 
most of the company s principal competitors are headquartered in asian countries that have a low cost labor force 
those competitors may be able to offer customers lower prices on certain high volume programs 
this could result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of market share  all of which would materially and adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  competitors can copy the company s non proprietary designs after the company has invested in development of products for customers  thereby enabling such competitors to offer lower prices on such products due to savings in development costs 
concentration of major customers 
at present  the company s customer base is highly concentrated  and there can be no assurance that its customer base will not become more concentrated 
three of the company s oem customers accounted for  and individually  of net sales during fiscal in  the same customers accounted for  and of the company s net sales 
there can be no assurance that the company s principal customers will continue to purchase products from the company at current levels 
moreover  the company typically does not enter into long term volume purchase contracts with its customers  and the company s customers have certain rights to extend or delay the shipment of their orders 
the loss of one or more of the company s major customers or the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from such customers could materially and adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s future success depends in large part on the continued service of its key technical  marketing and management personnel and on its ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees 
the competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
the loss of key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
litigation 
the company currently is a party to approximately lawsuits brought by computer keyboard users in state and federal courts 
these lawsuits allege that specific keyboard products manufactured by the company were sold with manufacturing  design and warning defects which caused or contributed to the claimants alleged injuries  generally referred to as repetitive stress injuries rsi or cumulative trauma disorders ctd 
the company believes it has valid defenses to these claims  and it will vigorously defend them 
these lawsuits are in the early stages of discovery 
at this time  management believes that it is not likely that the ultimate outcome of these lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position 
however  given the limited information currently available  the complexity of the litigation  the inherent uncertainty of litigation and the ultimate resolution of insurance coverage issues  management s position will change if warranted by facts and circumstances 
technological change and new product risk 
the market for the company s products is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and relatively short product life cycles 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies or the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete or unmarketable 
the company s success will depend upon its ability to enhance its existing products and to develop and introduce  on a timely and cost effective basis  new products that keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards and address evolving and increasingly sophisticated customer requirements 
failure to do so could substantially harm the company s competitive position 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in identifying  developing  manufacturing and marketing products that respond to technological change  emerging industry standards or evolving customer requirements 
dilution and stock price volatility 
as of june   there were outstanding options and warrants for the purchase of approximately  shares of common stock of the company common stock  of which options for approximately  shares were vested and exercisable 
holders of the common stock will suffer immediate and substantial dilution to the extent outstanding options and warrants to purchase the common stock are exercised 
the stock price of the company may be subject to wide fluctuations and possible rapid increases or declines over a short time period 
these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to the company such as variations in quarterly operating results or changes in analysts earnings estimates  or to factors relating to the computer industry or to the securities markets in general  which  in recent years  have experienced significant price fluctuations 
these fluctuations often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies whose stocks are traded

on january  the company reached a settlement in the amount of  with one of its insurers for reimbursement of costs associated with the colbert landfill a superfund site  which were incurred and paid in previous years 
this amount was recorded in other income expense in no settlement has been reached with the final insurer  and therefore  the amount of any contingent gain is not determinable

accordingly  in the income tax provision primarily resulted from net income from domestic operations and has been reported net of any tax benefit from foreign operations

 accounting for income taxes see note to the june  consolidated financial statements 
the effect on the company s operations was to increase net income by  additionally  a deferred tax asset of  was recorded  which was net of a valuation allowance of  the balance of the deferred tax asset on june  was  which was net of a valuation allowance of  the increase in the valuation allowance is based on management s estimate of the future realizable value of the net deferred tax asset 
in recording this deferred tax asset  the company considered both negative and positive evidence 
negative evidence includes the fact that the company had sustained taxable losses in three of the four years prior to adoption 
the company operates in a volatile industry which has seen average selling prices decline significantly due to foreign competition 
also  the company incurred a significant amount of debt as a result of the acquisition of the keyboard division of honeywell in this is offset by positive evidence including greatly reduced product costs as a result of moving production to juarez  mexico  where a lower wage base can be attained and lower operating expenses by reducing commissions for sales representatives 
the company was awarded significant new programs by new large oem customers  which have and are expected to improve revenues and profits 
as a result  backlogs grew to million an the end of fiscal year from million at the previous year end 
backlogs continued to grow in fiscal to a balance of million by year end 
fiscal year experienced a decrease in backlog to million  primarily due to reduced lead time requirements from the company s customers 
in order to fully utilize this deferred tax asset  the company must generate approximately  in taxable income before the net operating loss carryovers expire 
management believes that the positive evidence outweighs the negative evidence  and it is more likely than not that the company will generate sufficient taxable income to allow the realization of the deferred tax asset within the next three or four fiscal years
