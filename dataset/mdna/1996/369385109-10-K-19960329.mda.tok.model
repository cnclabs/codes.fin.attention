the company provides message telephone services in a variety of ways to the united states government and its armed forces personnel

a reduction in federal military spending or closure of a major facility in alaska would have a substantial adverse impact on the state and would both directly and indirectly affect the company 
a reduction in the number of military personnel served by the company and a reduction in the number of private lines required by the armed forces would have a direct effect on revenues

the company generally has experienced increased costs in recent years due to the effect of inflation on the cost of labor  material and supplies  and plant and equipment 
a portion of the increased labor and material and supplies costs directly affects income through increased maintenance and operating costs 
the cumulative impact of inflation over a number of years has resulted in higher depreciation expense and increased costs for current replacement of productive facilities 
however  operating efficiencies have partially offset this impact  as have price increases  although the latter have generally not been adequate to cover increased costs due to inflation 
competition and other market factors limit the company s ability to price services and products based upon inflation s effect on costs
