in the event the company is not successful in accomplishing a prepayment to mgtf  it believes it will be capable of fulfilling its normal payment obligations under the respective debenture and note agreements with mgtf 
however  in the event the company is unable to meet its obligations pursuant to the debentures in a timely manner  the company s oil and gas reserves and its operations may be adversely affected

during  gold line incurred various financial and purchasing problems which resulted in diminished throughput volumes and lower lease fees to the company and also prevented gold line from making its note payments to the company as scheduled in september and december see item business refinery lease 
these problems resulted in lower cash flow to the company of up to million  which required it to utilize other methods to acquire funds necessary to satisfy its monetary and contractual obligations  including the issuance of equity  as described above 
during the first quarter of  the company issued shares of its common stock in exchange for cash and services rendered to the company totalling an aggregate of approximately  placed in accordance with the safe harbor provided by regulation s as promulgated by the sec 
in march  gold line was successful in solving its financial and purchasing problems  and secured a new one year million fuel supply contract with the dfsc 
as a result  gold line expects to process higher volumes of feedstock through the refinery  which should enable it to make its scheduled quarterly principal and interest note payments to the company beginning in june in addition  gold line s lease fees increased to 
per barrel of feedstock in from 
per barrel in during march  gold line processed a high of approximately  daily barrels of feedstock and was processing an average of  barrels of feedstock per day 
it expects to average  barrels per day during the remainder of the lease  a level it needs to maintain in order to meet its obligations under its two dfsc contracts 
the combination of gold line s note payments and increased lease fees could provide the company with approximately million more cash flow during the next twelve months than during the last 
also in march  the company received net proceeds of  from the sale of convertible subordinated redeemable debentures the debentures in a private placement to various foreign buyers under regulation s 
at its option  the company may redeem any or all of the debentures after issue and prior to conversion by paying to the holder in cash of the then outstanding principal balance of the debentures plus accrued interest to date

the company is utilizing the proceeds from the debenture to repay debts and for working capital purposes 
the company has received an offer from an oil company and inquiries from various others regarding a possible farmout of its new chicoral discovery and its other colombian properties in return for cash and drilling obligations in the company s toqui toqui field 
such a transaction could provide the company with capital to repay a major portion of its recently issued debenture  while ensuring that its chicoral discovery would be fully exploited in the shortest time practicable with little or no cost to the company 
although a farmout would result in a lower overall company ownership interest of its colombian reserves  the net result to the company could be an increase in its oil and gas reserve base  a stronger balance sheet and greater potential for earnings and cash flow growth 
the company has no remaining drilling or work obligations in colombia or peru 
depending upon available funds  or whether the company is successful with its farmout plans  the company estimates it could utilize up to  for exploration and development of its properties and prospects in south america during the next twelve months 
in december  the company entered into a farmout agreement with pt pelangi niaga mitra internasional  an indonesian company pnmi  whereby the company is expected to earn a working interest in a technical assistance contract tac with pertamina for the pamanukan selatan area of west java province  indonesia by providing of the funding for the exploration  development and operation of the tac 
full exploration and development of the tac is expected to cost between and million over the next three years  of which approximately  will be required during as a portion of its obligations under the farmout agreement  the company issued  pursuant to regulation s of the securities act of   shares of its common stock to pnmi 
the company will be the operator of the joint operations and the tac and is to be reimbursed for of all expenditures  pursuant to the cost recovery provisions in the tac  before any distribution of profits to pnmi can occur 
the company will also be entitled to recoup indirect overhead charges up to five percent of total expenditures  which amount will be part of the cost recovery 
all monetary obligations the company may have under the farmout agreement are subject to pnmi receiving governmental certification and pertamina s approval to conduct operations under this tac  which pnmi expects to occur in may of under certain circumstances however  the company could decide not to proceed with the project 
the company intends to meet its capital and operating funds requirements in the near term from revenues generated from operations  and from additional financing as necessary 
however  there is no assurance of success of any farmout or financing efforts the company may pursue or the timing or success of the exploitation of its discoveries in colombia and peru  its potential projects in indonesia  and or its vdu project 
in the event the company is not able to fund its exploration and development projects on its own in a timely manner  management believes it will be able to obtain partners for certain projects 
the company does not engage in hedging transactions to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and has not experienced significant gains or losses related to such events 
the company receives proceeds from sales of oil and gas in colombia and peru in local currency and utilizes these receipts for local operations 
periodically funds are transferred from us accounts to colombia and peru and converted into pesos and soles  respectively  when the local currency is insufficient to meet obligations payable in local currency 
impact of changing prices the company s revenues  its ability to repay indebtedness and the carrying value of its oil and gas properties are affected by changes in oil and gas prices 
oil and natural gas prices are subject to substantial seasonal  political and other fluctuations that are beyond the ability of the company to control 
since crude oil prices are an important determining factor in the carrying value of oil and gas assets  significant reductions in the price of crude oil could require non cash write downs of the carrying value of those assets 
this occurred in  when the prices the company received for its crude oil declined significantly 
as a consequence  a reduction in the carrying value of the company s oil and gas properties of  was recorded during the fourth quarter in however  prices increased  thereby reducing the impact of a reduction of previous estimates of proven reserve quantities by the company s independent reservoir engineers  whose estimate for that period resulted in a further reduction of the carrying value of the company s oil and gas assets of  during the fourth quarter of no reduction in the carrying value of the company s oil and gas assets was necessary at december  results of operations the following table highlights the results of operations for the years ended december   and for the years ended december  exploration and production activity colombia properties revenue oil sales s    lease operating expenses s  production volume    average price per bbl production cost per bb dd a per bbl peru properties revenue oil sales s lease operating expenses s production volume bbls   average price per bbl production cost per bbl dd a per bbl refinery operations refinery lease fees s    average daily throughput bbls    average throughput fee dd a does not include provision for reduction of oil and gas properties of  and  in and  respectively

production activity for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december oil production in increased to  barrels  a increase over average oil prices declined however  by or 
per barrel  to in as compared to in the net effect of these occurrences resulted in a  increase in the company s oil revenues in compared to production cost declined by  in compared to  primarily due to transportation costs incurred during the first four months of  which were not incurred after that time

for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  oil and gas revenues decreased by  or  in compared to approximately of the decrease resulted from the company s new crude oil sales contract  which became effective may  under the terms of the new contract  the company sells its crude oil directly to an end user at the well head 
therefore  the transportation cost  which was included in the selling price during  was excluded from the price under the new agreement 
approximately of the decline was related to a decrease in the average price of the company s crude oil in as compared to  reflecting the overall weakness in the world oil market during much of the remaining portion of the decline was due to an decrease in the total oil produced in as compared to the previous year 
production costs decreased by  or  in as compared to approximately half of the decline was due to the elimination of transportation costs  mentioned above

the company charges gold line a fee for each barrel of feedstock processed at the refinery 
the fee during was 
per barrel of throughput  which increased to 
per barrel on january  this rate continues until the lease expires on march  refinery lease fees declined by approximately in to  as compared to the decline relates primarily to financing and purchasing problems encountered by gold line during see item business refinery lease 
as a result  gold line experienced a decline in its annual throughput in compared to however  gold line  as previously discussed  has apparently resolved these problems and in march secured a one year million fuel supply contract with the dfsc which  when combined with its other contract with the dfsc  is expected to result in gold line processing  barrels of feedstock per day 
this increased activity should provide the company with minimum annual lease fees of approximately million 
gold line has also indicated to the company that it is attempting to obtain supplemental fuel supply contracts  which would call for an additional  barrels per day of throughput volume to be processed in the refinery 
there can be no assurance at this time  however  that gold line will continue to process an average of  barrels of feedstock per day or be successful in securing supplemental contracts 
for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  refinery lease fees increased approximately to  in as compared to the increase was due primarily to a increase in the per barrel throughput fees charged to gold line in the last half of and a increase in the average daily throughput compared to the previous year
