the main component of this was a second quarter charge of million primarily to restructure its core consumer electronics and network systems business 
the charge was primarily composed of provisions made in anticipation of cash expenditures that were paid in the second half of or will be paid in the first half of the major elements of the restructuring related to severance expenses million associated with employment reductions mostly in the company s us salaried workforce and costs associated with realigned distribution activities million as the company changed to direct to retail distribution on a nationwide basis 
the remaining charges related to other non recurring items  including certain environmental  legal and other regulatory matters  along with trade receivable write offs primarily for accounts in mexico as a result of the peso devaluation 
the reduction in the salaried workforce  together with other initiatives  are expected to reduce annual costs by about million 
the remainder of the charges related to fourth quarter charges totaling million that were incurred as a consequence of the lg electronics  inc lge purchase of common stock 
during  the company recorded million of restructuring and other charges 
this was driven by a fourth quarter charge primarily to restructure certain product areas and re engineer its core business 
the restructuring affected computer monitors and magnetics  product areas that were phased out or sold in major elements of this charge were the non cash writedown of fixed assets and inventory million as well as re engineering and severance costs million that were substantially paid during as expected  the restructuring actions reduced compensation expense by approximately million and reduced depreciation expense by approximately million

the company selectively reduced color tv prices in february in order to maintain market share 
although the company continues to seek more than million in additional cost reduction opportunities for  the decline in color tv pricing along with inflationary cost pressures are expected to have a negative impact on the company s financial results for cash flows the statements of consolidated cash flows reflect the changes in cash for the last three years by classifying transactions into three major categories  operating  investing and financing activities 
operating activities a principal use of the company s liquidity is the cash used by operating activities which consists of the company s net loss as adjusted for non cash operating items and the changes in current assets and liabilities such as receivables  inventories and payables

the company is planning significant capital investment projects during and  primarily in the color picture tube area  which include the expansion of production capacity for color tv picture tubes  new automated production processes and the addition of new production lines for computer display tubes and color picture tubes for large screen direct view color tv sets 
financing activities financing activities provided cash of million in  million in and million in the increase in cash provided was due to the company selling million of common stock to investors  principally the sale at per share of million shares to lge in november

cash was also provided during as the company entered into a term loan agreement for million 
cash was used during as the company repurchased million principal amount of its convertible senior subordinated debentures due and  at par plus accrued interest 
this repurchase resulted from the exercise by certain holders of the debentures of the right to require repurchase of all or a portion of the debentures following a change of control of the company  which occurred upon the purchase of a controlling interest in the company by lge 
in  financing activities provided million of cash which included million provided from sales of the company s common stock and million from the sale of senior subordinated convertible debentures due this was offset by million of cash used to redeem the company s outstanding notes due january at a redemption price equal to par value plus accrued interest 
in  financing activities provided million of cash which included million provided from the sale of senior subordinated convertible debentures due and million provided from sales of the company s common stock 
this was offset by million of cash used to repay borrowings under the company s credit agreement 
financial condition as of december   the company had million of cash and had interest bearing obligations that consisted of million of long term debt  the current portion million of the term loan agreement and million of extended term payables with lge 
the company s long term debt is composed of million of convertible subordinated debentures due that require annual sinking fund payments of million beginning in  million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated convertible debentures due and  and the long term portion of the term loan agreement million 
the term loan agreement requires scheduled quarterly principal payments over the life of the loan with a balloon payment of million due on the termination date of the loan  june  in november  the company entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement and a first amended and restated term loan agreement 
these agreements replaced similar agreements with the same group of lenders and were amended as a result of the purchase by lge  of a controlling interest in the company 
these agreements contain restrictive financial covenants that must be maintained as of the end of each fiscal quarter  including a liabilities to net worth ratio and a minimum net worth amount 
in addition  these agreements restrict the amount of capital expenditures by the company in each fiscal year 
the amendments increased the required minimum net worth as of december  and for each quarter thereafter and also improved the interest rate and interest rate options 
the maximum commitment of funds available for borrowing under the credit agreement is million  but is limited by a defined borrowing base formula related to eligible receivables and eligible inventory 
the credit agreement terminates on june  at which time all outstanding indebtedness thereunder would have to be refinanced 
as of december   no borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement in keeping with the seasonal nature of the company s working capital needs 
as discussed in investing activities  the company is planning significant capital investment projects over the next two years 
the company is exploring options for additional financing that will be required to support these projects 
because these planned capital investment projects would exceed the permitted expenditures allowed under the credit agreement and term loan agreement  the company will need to seek amendments to these agreements 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to find the additional financing required to support these projects nor can there be any assurance that the lenders under the credit agreement and term loan agreement will approve amendments  if requested by the company 
although the company believes that its credit agreement  together with extended term payables expected to be available from lge and the company s efforts to obtain other financing sources  will be adequate to meet its seasonal working capital  capital expenditure and other requirements during  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience liquidity problems in the future because of adverse market conditions or other unfavorable events
