in addition  sales of new products and increased efforts by  and the addition of members to  the company s sales staff have contributed to increased sales volumes 
sales attributable to new products totaled approximately  and of  and net sales  respectively 
export and foreign sales to unaffiliated customers  primarily in europe  canada  south america and the far east in fiscal year were  or of net sales compared to  or of net sales in fiscal year and  or of net sales in fiscal year cost of goods sold cost of goods sold was  or of net sales in fiscal year compared to  or in fiscal year and  or in fiscal year the gross margin erosion from to was primarily attributable to several factors  including but not limited to a shift in product sales mix  product transition issues  rising material component costs  including higher costing one time programmable microprocessors used during the early phase of new product introductions before converting to lower costing masked versions  and the continued costs associated with the ramp up of two new plants 
during  the product sales mix shifted toward lower end products as the company actively pursued growing opportunities in markets for the company s lower margin back ups r and surge products and  to a lesser degree  a mix shift within the smart ups r product family toward the lower margin smart ups v s  a product targeted at price sensitive departmental lan customers 
also during  the company s smart ups family underwent a major product transition as the company introduced a new third generation smart ups product line replacing the existing second generation  which has been in place for the past five years 
there were several product transition impacts to gross margins increased inventory reserves  reduced average selling prices of the older second generation products and the costs associated with lower production yields on the new products 
the total inventory reserves at december  were million compared to million at december  the increased inventory reserves have been provided primarily to cover the potential loss exposure that may result from excess inventories as the demand for second generation products diminishes 
second generation smart ups represented approximately of total inventories at december  the company s reserve estimate methodology involves quantifying the total inventory position having potential loss exposure reduced by an amount reasonably forecasted to be sold and adjusting its interim reserve provisioning to cover the net loss exposure 
the decline in average sales prices of second generation products was driven primarily by price discounting and sales promotions used to accelerate the transition to the third generation products 
the decline from to was attributable to start up costs and production inefficiencies relating to the newly established manufacturing operations in galway  ireland  additional freight and duty costs associated with the transportation of component materials to the galway facility  as well as the promotional bundling of selected products at special reduced prices 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were of net sales in compared to of net sales in and of net sales in the increase in sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales for and is primarily attributable to the hiring of additional personnel  particularly in the sales and marketing areas  and increased advertising and promotional efforts  both domestically and internationally

the company has experienced and continues to experience very strong collection performance from its accounts receivable with outstanding balances over days outstanding representing and of total receivables at december  and  respectively 
write offs of uncollectible accounts represent less than of total receivable balances 
a majority of international customer balances are covered by receivables insurance 
the increase in bad debt reserves was primarily attributable to increased international sales  particularly in regions not covered by the company s receivables insurance ie the former soviet union 
research and development expenditures for  and were   and  respectively 
the increased research and development spending primarily reflects increased numbers of software and hardware engineers and costs associated with new product development and engineering support 
although the aggregate dollars of research and development expenses have increased from to as a result of continued product and process development  the decrease from to as a percentage of sales is attributable to certain fixed research and development expenses spread over a higher revenue base 
other income expenses the decrease in interest income from to was attributable to a significant reduction in funds available for investment  particularly during the first nine months of the increase from to was primarily due to the continued diversification of a portion of the company s invested funds into low risk  government backed securities coupled with the upward trend of short term investment rates 
interest expense during was the result of short term borrowings during the second and third quarters of which were fully repaid during the fourth quarter 
other income in was due primarily to the million settlement of an insurance claim for the inventory losses resulting from a fire at the company s third party warehouse in the netherlands 
the company s effective income tax rates were  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease from to is the result of tax savings derived from an increasing portion of taxable earnings being generated from the company s operations in ireland  a jurisdiction which currently has a lower income tax rate for manufacturing companies than the present us statutory income tax rate 
effects of inflation management believes that inflation has not had a material effect on the company s operations 
liquidity and financial resources working capital at december  was  compared to  at december  the company has been able to increase its working capital position as the result of continued strong operating results and despite financing the capital investment of the expansion of its operations  particularly in ireland see below 
inventory turnover decreased from turns for to for inventory levels had been increased in order to support the growth in the company s sales volume  as well as to maintain the necessary carrying levels of raw materials  in process assemblies and finished stock as a result of major new products introduced during the past five quarters  in particular  the smart ups product transition discussed above 
the transistion continued throughout as a result of continued demand for the second generation smart ups products which required continued production and materials procurement for these products 
during the last three quarters of  inventory levels as a percentage of quarterly sales have declined from in the second quarter to and in the third and fourth quarters  respectively 
the company anticipates its cash requirements for the foreseeable future will be satisfied by cash flow from operations  existing cash  and  if needed  short term borrowings or the sale of additional common stock 
at december   the company had available for future borrowings million under an unsecured line of credit agreement at a floating interest rate equal to the bank s cost of funds rate plus and an additional million under an unsecured line of credit agreement with a second bank at a floating interest rate equal to the bank s base rate 
no borrowings were outstanding under these facilities at december  and additionally  the company has no significant financial commitments outstanding other than those required in the normal course of business 
during and  the company s capital expenditures  net of capital grants  amounted to approximately million and million  respectively  consisting primarily of manufacturing equipment  building improvements  office equipment and purchased software applications 
the nature and level of capital spending was made to improve manufacturing capabilities in the united states  establish and improve manufacturing capabilities in galway  ireland and to support the increased selling  marketing and administrative efforts necessitated by the company s significant growth 
net capital expenditures were financed from available operating cash

the company executed an agreement with the industrial development authority of ireland ida under which the company will receive grant monies equal to of the costs incurred for machinery  equipment and building improvements for the galway facility 
the maximum amount attainable under the agreement is approximately million 
the grant monies would be repayable  in whole or in part  should the company fail to meet certain employment goals established under the agreement which are to be achieved over a five year implementation period and or the company discontinues operations in ireland prior to the termination of the agreement 
the agreement terminates eight years from the date of the last claim made by the company for grant monies

under a separate agreement with the ida  the company will also receive up to  per new employee hired for the direct reimbursement of training costs 
the total cumulative amount of training grant claims submitted through december  was approximately million 
the total cumulative amount of training grants received through december  amounted to approximately  capital expenditures  net of capital grants  for the galway facility amounted to approximately million and million during and  respectively  and were financed from operations 
capital expenditures subsequent to will be primarily related to manufacturing capacity requirements based on future operational needs and market growth 
in addition to the grant monies provided by the irish government  the remaining capital expenditures will be financed with cash generated from operations and  if needed  short term borrowings or the sale of additional common stock 
the company continues to investigate potential sites for manufacturing expansion in international regions 
on november   the company announced that it will begin further negotiations with the ida for financial incentives in connection with the possible future expansion of the company s manufacturing operations to additional sites within ireland 
the company is presently pursuing the establishment of a manufacturing operation in the philippines 
if established  capital expenditures for the philippines expansion are estimated to be million for and will be financed from operating cash and  if needed  short term borrowings 
management believes that current internal cash flows  together with cash and short term investments  and the available credit facilities are sufficient to support anticipated capital spending and other working capital requirements for foreign currency activity during the fourth quarter of  the company began invoicing its customers in great britain  france and germany in their respective local currencies 
realized and unrealized transaction gains or losses are included in the results of operations and are measured based upon the effect of changes in exchange rates on the actual or expected amount of functional currency cash flows 
transaction gains and losses were not material to the results of operations in and at the end of  the company s unhedged foreign currency accounts receivable  by currency  were as follows british pounds  approx 
us  french francs  approx 
us  german marks  approx 
us  total gross accounts receivable at december  was  the company also had non trade receivables of  irish pounds approximately us  as well as irish pound denominated liabilities of  approximately us 
the company continually reviews its foreign exchange exposure and considers various risk management techniques including the netting of foreign currency receipts and disbursements  rate protection agreements with customers vendors and derivatives arrangements  including foreign exchange contracts 
the company presently does not utilize rate protection agreements or derivatives arrangements 
the company s rationale for not hedging its currency risk exposure through derivatives arrangements is based on the assessment that the net foreign currency position was not material to the financial condition or results of operations of the company at december  and  to a lesser degree  an assessment that the risk of loss from exchange rate fluctuations was not material based upon available forecasts of short term exchange rate movements for the currencies noted above
