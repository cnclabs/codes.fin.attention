liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of liquidity are cash provided from operating activities and external borrowing

operating activities including net special credits charges  net cash provided by operations was million in  million in and million in the decrease in cash from operations was primarily due to lower net income  significantly lower accounts payable and other liabilities and increases in accounts and notes receivable and other assets 
the reduction in accounts payable reflects the payment of amounts owed to various suppliers including advertising agencies

accounts and notes receivable was higher in because of an increase in international sales which was offset in part by decreased receivables from the container joint venture

other assets increased primarily due to increased investment and equity in the container joint ventures 
the increase in cash from operations was primarily due to higher net income  higher accumulated deferred income taxes  and higher depreciation offset in part by an increase in accounts and notes receivable  a decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities primarily due to the payment of obligations related to the restructuring and an increase in accounts payable

for  the company met its two financial covenants under the committed revolving line of credit a minimum tangible net worth test and a debt to total capitalization test 
hedging activities as of december   hedging activities consisted exclusively of hard currency forward contracts to directly offset hard currency exposures 
these irrevocable contracts eliminated the risk to financial position and results of operations from changes in foreign exchange rates 
any variation in the exchange rate that would accrue to the contract would be directly offset by an equal change in the related obligation

outlook the company will report results based on a week fiscal year versus the week year used in additionally  the company will change its reporting to a period fiscal year from the period fiscal year that was used in and prior years 
the fiscal year is composed of four week quarters  compared to prior years  which had three week quarters and one week quarter the third quarter 
the change in quarter length will require restatement of the quarterly results in order to make the results of comparable 
the change to week quarters creates a fiscal year that is similar to a calendar year and more comparable to the reporting practices of other consumer product companies

the company continues to believe that financial performance can improve over following industry pricing trends  the company raised prices in several key us markets in the fourth quarter of  and price increases have gone into effect in many of the remaining states in the middle of the first quarter of although the company continues to believe that industry prices will more closely track inflation in  it cannot predict the degree to which pricing will be eroded by discounting or the impact that higher prices will have on total volume or consumers trading down to lower margin products 
trends early in indicate that packaging and commodities costs will be stable 
while the company continues to believe that initiatives in its operations and technology areas have the potential to deliver substantial cost reductions over time  significant savings are not likely to be realized before the second half of total interest expense in the first half of the year will be higher than in the same period of by approximately million primarily as a result of the million private debt placement that closed in july the increasing efficiencies from the can  end and glass joint ventures should continue to provide income to the company 
marketing  general and administrative costs are expected to remain basically unchanged for the company s effective tax rate is expected to remain near the rate of assuming increased pre tax income  decreased non taxable income items and continued non deductible items 
in  the company has planned capital expenditures including contributions to its container joint ventures for capital improvements of approximately million compared with capital expenditures that averaged million over the previous years 
the decline reflects the completion of several plant acquisition and capacity expansion projects  along with the company s intention to manage capital expenditures and cash more aggresively through a variety of means  including asset sales  lease financing and joint ventures 
in addition to the company s planned capital expenditures  incremental strategic investments will be considered on a case by case basis

the city and county of denver  waste management of colorado  inc and chemical waste management  inc brought litigation in in us district court against the company and other prp s to determine the allocation of costs of lowry site remediation 
in  the court approved a settlement agreement between the company and the plaintiffs  resolving the company s liabilities for the site 
the company agreed to initial payments based on an assumed present value of million in total site remediation costs 
in addition  the company agreed to pay a specified share of costs if total remediation costs are in excess of this amount 
payments representing the company s agreed share based on the million assumption were made into a trust to be applied to costs of site remediation and operating and maintenance costs 
the city and county of denver  waste management of colorado and chemical waste management  inc are expected to implement remediation of the site 
the epa s projected costs to meet the announced remediation objectives and requirements are below the million total assumed as a basis for the company s settlement 
the company has no reason to believe that total remediation costs will result in additional liability to the company 
in  the company filed suit against certain of its former and current insurance carriers  seeking recovery of past defense costs and investigation  study and remediation costs 
settlements were reached during and with all defendants

the company has also been notified that it is or may be a prp under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla or similar state laws with respect to the cleanup of other sites where hazardous substances have allegedly been released into the environment 
the company cannot predict with certainty the total costs of cleanup  its share of the total cost or the extent to which contributions will be available from other parties  the amount of time necessary to complete the cleanups  or insurance coverage 
however  based on investigations to date  the company believes that any liability would not be material to the financial condition of the company with respect to these sites 
there can be no certainty  however  that the company will not be named as a prp at additional cercla sites in the future  or that the costs associated with those additional sites will not be material 
while it is impossible to predict the eventual aggregate cost to the company for environmental and related matters  management believes that any payments  if required  for these matters would be made over a period of years in amounts that would not be material in any one year to the consolidated results of operations or to the financial or competitive position of the company 
the company believes adequate disclosures have been provided for losses that are reasonably possible 
furthermore  as the company continues to focus attention on resource conservation  waste reduction and pollution prevention  it is the company s belief that potential future liabilities will be reduced
