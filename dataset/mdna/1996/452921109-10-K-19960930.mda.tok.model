revenues from sales outside of the united states declined to of total revenues in fiscal from in fiscal the company recognizes revenues derived from systems sales to end user customers  including of software license fees and of hardware revenues  upon the factory acceptance by the customer and delivery of the configured system 
the company defers recognition of of the software license fees until completion of certain insignificant vendor obligations primarily related to the site acceptance by the customer 
revenues derived from systems sales to distribution partners are recognized upon delivery if the contract is between the company and the distribution partner  the payment terms are fixed with all amounts due within twelve months  there are no other significant obligations to be performed by the company and provided that the distribution partner meets the company s criteria with respect to sell through and credit risk 
revenues derived from systems sales to distribution partners in which the contract is between the company and the customer the end user of the distribution partner are recognized in accordance with the company s revenue recognition policy for end user customers described above 
revenue recognition for systems sales to end users that have been delivered and accepted by the customer with contractual payment terms that extend beyond one year is determined by the company based upon the company s historical experience with the customer  the customer s credit worthiness  and an assessment of the enforceability of the contract 
all revenues recognized related to contracts with payments due in more than one year are discounted at the company s incremental borrowing rate 
revenues from professional services  which may include preparation of functional specifications  customization and programming  systems integration  and training  among others  are recognized as the services are performed

any significant or ongoing failure to achieve signed contracts and subsequent customer acceptance after expending time  effort and funds could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
because the company adjusts the timing of an installation to accommodate customers needs  and because a typical installation requires two to months to complete  the company is unable to predict accurately the number of signed sales contracts it expects to fill and consequently the amount of revenues it expects to achieve in any particular period

the company s revenues from systems sales have varied significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of the volume and timing of systems sales and customer acceptance and delivery 
professional services revenues have also fluctuated from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing of the installation of software and hardware  project management and customized programming 
revenues from maintenance services have not fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter and have been increasing as the number of the company s customers increases 
since a significant percentage of the company s expenses are fixed  quarterly operating results will vary with the timing and fluctuation of total revenues 
liquidity and capital resources since its inception in  the company has funded its operations  working capital needs and capital expenditures primarily from revenues and sales of equity securities 
the company was initially capitalized primarily by three investment companies 
subsequently  the company completed four private placements in which new investors purchased company securities 
in july  the company received approximately million net of underwriter s discounts and offering costs from its initial public offering 
in february  the company received an additional million net of underwriters discounts and offering costs from a subsequent offering of its common stock 
cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities at june  were million  an increase of million from june  the increase was due to the proceeds from the company s initial and secondary offerings of common stock 
during fiscal  the company used cash of million for operating activities  as compared to cash used in operating activities of million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the funding of additional accounts receivable of million and inventories of million associated with increased sales volume  offset by increased net income  without consideration of non recurring charges 
the company plans to continue to increase its professional staff during fiscal and the foreseeable future  to meet anticipated sales volume and to support research and development efforts 
the company expects that its requirements for office facilities and office equipment will grow as staffing requirements dictate 
the company currently leases  square feet of office space 
to accommodate continuing growth  the company signed an operating lease  effective january  to increase its headquarters space 
the company expects to move to the new facility in january and will incur increased rental expense 
management expects to sublease its existing facility at a rate commensurate with the existing lease commitment and has engaged a real estate agent to assist in the sublease 
the company has budgeted capital expenditures of approximately million in fiscal for the purchase of computer equipment for existing and new employees  furniture and fixtures  and equipment associated with the new office facility  new training equipment  and new equipment for customer demonstrations

the company has referred the matter to its patent counsel for review

see also business risk factors dependence on proprietary rights and patents 
the company has experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in operating results which may continue in future periods 
the company s revenues from systems sales have varied significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of the volume and timing of systems sales and customer acceptance and delivery 
professional services revenues have also fluctuated from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing of installation of software and hardware  project management and customized programming 
revenues from maintenance services have not fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter and have been increasing as the number of the company s customers increases 
since a significant percentage of the company s expenses are fixed  quarterly operating results will vary with the timing and fluctuation of total revenues 
furthermore  margins are affected by the mix of products sold 
the company s accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso have continued to increase in fiscal management believes that its willingness to grant extended terms  on a negotiated  case by case basis  provides the customer or distributor with additional incentives to commit to large purchases  because such terms i demonstrate that the company is comfortable with providing the customer or distributor the leverage inherent in deferred payments thereby demonstrating its confidence in its product  and ii permit the customer or distributor and the company to commit to a large order  while the payment stream is tailored to a longer period of time thereby providing the customer or distributor with a means to finance the project over one or more internal cash budgeting cycles 
therefore  management believes the accounts receivable dso trend will continue in fiscal  due to the extended terms selling strategy 
however  the failure by the customer or distributor to pay the company account receivable balances outstanding as they become due would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company believes that its cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  along with revenues from operations  will be sufficient to finance expected cash requirements for operating activities and anticipated growth for at least the next months 
the company s ability to meet its cash obligations on a long term basis will depend on its achieving profitable operations and on consistent and timely collection of its accounts receivable 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on the company s revenues or expenses 
the company will require significant funds to implement its business strategies 
unless its revenues increase significantly  the company will continue to experience losses due to the following factors i the company s operating expenses are budgeted on anticipated revenues  ii the company incurs significant expenses in connection with research and development  and more recently  the development of its direct and indirect selling and marketing efforts  and iii a high percentage of the company s expenses are fixed 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the company will be profitable in the future or that available funds  together with any funds provided by operations  will be sufficient to fund the company s ongoing operations 
if the company has insufficient funds  there can be no assurance that additional financing can be obtained on acceptable terms  if at all 
the absence of such financing would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  including a possible reduction or cessation of operations 
in addition to the information in this filing  certain risk factors  among others  should be considered carefully in evaluating the company and its business 
these risk factors include the following i limited operating history  lack of profitable operations  ii variability in quarterly operating results  volatility of stock price  iii customer concentration  iv product acceptance and market development  dependence on distribution partners  v long sales and delivery cycle  dependence on future systems sales  vi ability to manage growth  vii risks associated with acquisitions  viii risks associated with new distribution partner hboc  ix technological changes  competition  x uncertainty in healthcare industry  government healthcare reform proposals  xi dependence on key personnel  xii dependence on proprietary rights and patents  xiii product liability  xiv foreign operations  xv control by officers and directors  xvi shares eligible for future sale  and xvii certain anti takeover considerations
