foreign currency activity the company s foreign exchange exposure is principally limited to the relationship of the us dollar to the japanese yen and the british pound sterling 
japan sourced products denominated in japanese yen accounted for approximately percent of product purchases in fiscal compared with percent in fiscal although the dollar strengthened against the japanese yen during fiscal  in past years the dollar had weakened dramatically in relation to the yen  resulting in increased costs for such products 
when market conditions permit  cost increases due to currency fluctuations are passed on to customers through price increases 
the company also attempts to reduce the impact of an unfavorable exchange rate condition through cost reductions from its suppliers  lowering production cost through product redesign  and shifting product sourcing to suppliers transacting in more stable and favorable currencies

when market conditions permitted  such cost increases were passed on to the customer through price increases

the company intends to increase prices and seek lower prices from suppliers to mitigate exchange rate exposures  however  there can be no assurance that such steps will be effective in limiting foreign currency exposure 
inflation the impact of inflation on the company has lessened in recent years as the rate of inflation remains low 
however  inflation continues to increase costs to the company
