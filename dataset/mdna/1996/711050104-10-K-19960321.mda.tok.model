all nonagency issues held are currently rated aa or aaa by either standard poors or moody s 
approximately of the mortgage backed securities are floating rate issues  the majority being indexed to the constant maturity treasury index 
management s normal practice is to purchase securities at or near par value to reduce risk of premium write offs resulting from unexpected prepayments 
at december   the company did not have any structured notes as currently defined by regulatory agencies in the securities portfolios since management believes the uncertainty of cash flows from these securities  which are driven by interest rate movements  could expose the company to greater market risk than traditional securities 
funding average deposits increased  or million to  million from million for local markets for deposits are competitive 
core deposits  the company s most important and stable funding source  are a decreasing portion of average interest bearing liabilities 
the core deposit base is supplemented with brokered deposits  short term and long term borrowings to fully fund loan growth 
average brokered deposits amounted to million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively

the company s subsidiary banks have obtained various short term and long term advances from the federal home loan bank fhlb under blanket agreements for advances and security agreements agreements 
the agreements entitle the subsidiary banks to borrow additional funds from the fhlb to fund mortgage loan programs and satisfy other funding needs 
nonperforming assets and risk elements as illustrated in table  nonperforming assets  which include nonperforming loans and foreclosed property  have generally declined over the last three years 
nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and other real estate declined to at december  compared to and at december  and  respectively 
a small number of loans and one tract of undeveloped land  portions of which have been sold  represent most of the nonperforming balance for the last three years 
the decline in nonperforming assets reflects good economic conditions in the area and the company s comphrehensive loan administration and workout procedures 
also  diversification within the loan portfolio is an important means of reducing inherent lending risks 
at december   the company had no concentrations of ten percent or more of total loans in any single industry nor any geographical area outside of the paducah  kentucky  western kentucky region  the immediate market area of the subsidiary banks 
the company discontinues the accrual of interest on loans which become ninety days past due as to principal or interest  unless the loans are adequately secured and in the process of collection 
other real estate owned is carried at the lower of cost or fair value 
a loan is classified as a renegotiated loan when the interest rate is materially reduced or the term is extended beyond the original maturity date because of the inability of the borrower to service the debt under the original terms 
table nonperforming assets december  in thousands nonaccrual loans    renegotiated loans      other real estate owned     nonperforming assets as a percent of total loans and other real estate loans past due ninety days and still accruing interest   allowance for loan losses coverage of nonperform ing assets management continues to exert efforts to monitor and minimize nonperforming assets even though the nonperforming totals are significantly lower than peer bank holding company ratios 
a significant focus on underwriting standards is maintained by management and the subsidiary bank boards 
internal credit review procedures are designed to alert management of possible credit problems which would create serious doubts as to the future ability of borrowers to comply with loan repayment terms 
at december   loans with a total principal balance of million have been identified that may become nonperforming in the future  compared to million at december  and million at december  potential problem loans are not included in nonperforming assets since the borrowers currently meet all applicable loan agreement terms 
capital resources and dividends the company s strong capital position and overall financial strength provide flexibility when management evaluates opportunities to improve stockholder value 
stockholders equity was of assets at december   an increase from at december  exclusive of unrealized net gain and loss on securities held for sale  net of applicable income taxes  stockholders equity increased million  or  during  and increased million  or  during the capital base has been strengthened through earnings retention and issuance of common stock through various shareholder and employee plans 
the earnings retention rate  which the board of directors adjusts through declaration of cash dividends  was for  for and for proceeds from the sale of common stock through shareholder and employee plans amounted to million in  million in and million in unrealized gain or loss on securities held for sale  net of applicable income taxes  are recorded directly to stockholders equity 
for stockholders equity was increased by million  for was decreased by million and for was increased by million to record the change during the year in the fair value of securities held for sale 
the board of directors develops and reviews the capital goals and policies of the consolidated entity and each of the subsidiary banks 
the company s capital policies are designed to retain sufficient amounts for healthy financial ratios  considering future planned asset growth and to leverage stockholders equity to a desirable degree 
subsidiary bank dividends are the principal source of funds for the company s payment of dividends to its stockholders 
at december   approximately million in retained earnings of subsidiary banks was available for dividend payments to the company without regulatory approval or without reducing capital of the respective banks below minimum standards 
the board of directors raised the quarterly dividend to per share in the third quarter of and to per share in the third quarter of stock dividends of were declared in april and in janaury on janaury   the board of directors approved the purchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock in the open market during the following eighteen to twenty four month period 
shares acquired may be used in conjunction with the company s stock dividend program 
an important measure of capital adequacy of a banking institution is its risk based capital ratios 
bank regulatory agencies minimum capital guidelines assign relative measures of credit risk to balance sheet assets and off balance sheet exposures 
based upon the nature and makeup of their current businesses and growth expectations  management expects all of the reporting entities risk based capital ratios to continue to exceed regulatory minimums 
at december  and  the company and the subsidiary banks ratios were as follows table risk based capital total tier i leverage ratio december  company peoples first national bank first kentucky federal savings bank results of operations net income increased in  reaching a record level of million  compared to an increase of in when net income totaled million 
on a per common share basis  net income increased to per share for the year ended december   compared to an increase of to per share for the year ended december  net income per common share for the fourth quarter of increased to from for the fourth quarter of the earnings increases were primarily due to increased interest income due in part to strong loan demand in and reductions in deposit insurance expense due to the level of fdic capitalization and the absence of acquisition related expense contributed to the earnings increase 
earnings performance for was negatively impacted by transaction costs of approximately per share related to two acquisitions completed during the year 
return on average stockholders equity for the years ended december   and was  and  respectively 
return on average assets for the years ended  and was  and  respectively 
net interest income the amount by which interest earned on assets exceeds the interest paid on sup porting funds  constitutes the primary source of income for the company 
measured on a fully taxable equivalent te basis  net interest income for the year ended december   increased  or million to million compared to million for for the year ended december   net interest income te increased  or million from million for as expected  s increase is attributable to growth in the volume of average earning assets while the net interest margin decreased basis points from substantially all of s increase is attributable to growth in the volume of average earning assets 
net interest income te as a percent of average earning assets was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company s concentration in residential real estate loans  competition for increased loan volumes and reliance on time deposits and non core funding results in narrower interest spreads 
the subsidiary banks generally maintain a relatively balanced position between volumes of rate repricing assets and liabilities to guard to some degree against adverse effects to net interest income from possible fluctuations in interest rates 
low levels of nonperforming loans favorably contributed to margins each period 
provision for loan losses a significant factor in the company s past and future operating results is the level of the provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses amounted to million for  an increase of compared to million in  which was a decrease of compared to million in the increase was required to reflect the growth in outstanding loans and chargeoffs 
the decrease was influenced by declines in net charge offs  nonperforming assets and potential problem loans 
the provision for loan losses as a percentage of average loans was for the year ended december   up from for the year ended december  and compared to for the year ended december  net loan chargeoffs over the last three years were at levels below historical trends 
net chargeoffs for were million compard to million for and million for as a percentage of average loans  net chargeoffs were for  up from for and for  periods of unusually low net chargeoffs 
net chargeoffs as a percent of average loans were for the five year period ended december  the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level which management considers adequate to absorb estimated potential losses in the loan portfolio  after reviewing the individual loans and in relation to risk elements in the portfolios and giving consideration to the prevailing economy and anticipated changes 
at december   the allowance for loan losses is of outstanding loans compared of outstanding loans at december  the december  allowance is of nonperforming assets compared to at december  noninterest income fees from traditional deposit services as well as revenues from insurance  brokerage activities and other commission business have been increased by management s focus on improving all areas of noninterest income during the last three years 
noninterest income amounted to million in  a increase compared to million in which was an increase of compared to million in excluding net securities gains  the and increases were more comparable and were and  repectively 
service charges on deposit accounts  the largest component of noninterest income  increased in and in net gains of   and  were recognized in  and  respectively 
securities held for sale  primarily mortgage backed securities  totaling million  million and million  respectively  were sold to reduce  to the extent possible  the company s interest rate sensitivity on assets in response to changing interest rates and prepayment risks as a part of the company s asset liability strategies 
the company has shown small growth in the amount of trust assets managed 
fees from personal and pension lines of business for the last three years have been relatively the same 
the and increases in insurance commissions in and  over prior respective years  are attributable to greater opportunities resulting from the significant increase in consumer loans as well as better penetration of this product to customers 
as expected  fee income from secondary market mortgage loan services during and were lower than due to the unusually large amount of home refinancing in in  the company sold its student loan portfolio and changed to a fee income program from the previous practice of originating and holding the loans 
the company made available two new financial services during to bank customers 
management believes that investment brokerage services and property and casualty insurance products made available in will generate a higher level of fees in than in the first two introductory years 
the relative improvement in fee income is slightly more than the growth in net interest income 
noninterest income excluding securities gains was of total net tax equivalent interest income plus noninterest income for  compared to for and for management expects this trend to continue into noninterest expense after rising in  the ratio of noninterest expense net of noninterest income exclusive of securities gains to average total assets fell in the ratio was for  for and for since internal asset growth has slowed  management continues to focus on controlling the rate of increase of noninterest expense by reconfiguring certain functions to gain more employee productivity 
the company consolidated six of the previously separate corporate subsidiaries into one bank during and to allow the personnel at all locations to better focus on consistent quality customer service  increasing the volume of business and to reduce a small amount of redundant costs 
noninterest expense decreased in due to reduced deposit insurance rates and the absence of merger related professional fees 
this compares to an increase of in when all categories of noninterest expense rose 
salaries and employee benefits increased in  compared to in staffing levels were approximately the same at december  and the company has made investments in facilities and equipment of approximately million during the last three years as technology has advanced and the need to leverage personnel costs has intensified 
occupancy expense increased in and in equipment expense increased in and in due to depreciation and maintenance of new equipment 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets which range from two to ten years for equipment 
much of the recent years equipment purchases are electronic and technology sensitive items which the company depreciates over a five year or shorter period 
management plans to continue to invest in techology for new product delivery systems 
the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic currently administers two separate deposit insurance funds  the bank insurance fund bif and the savings association insurance fund saif 
the bif and saif were established primarily to insure the depositors of insured banks and savings associations and to finance the resolution of failed institutions 
the company s lead bank subsidiary pays deposit insurance premiums to the bif and the company s other subsidiary pays deposit insurance premiums to the saif based on a rate applied to their respective assessable deposits 
beginning in  the assessments were based not only on deposits but also on the risk characteristics of the individual financial institutions 
both of the company s subsidiaries received the lowest applicable deposit assessment rates from the fdic 
assessments for deposit insurance were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in fdic insurance expense is attributable to a bif refund and rate reduction 
during september  as a result of the stability of the commercial bank industry and the level of insurance fund reserves  the fdic refunded the lead bank a portion of the deposit insurance premiums paid and reduced rates 
the company accounted for the bif refund in the third quarter when received as a component of operating income 
congress is considering a variety of legislation that will recapitalize the saif through a special assessment on the assessable deposits of saif member institutions such as the company s savings association subsidiary 
at december   the company had not accrued a liability for the potential special assessment 
the expense for any special assessment will be recorded as a component of operating income in the period of the enacted legislation 
management estimates the special assessment will be between million and million and payable in the second quarter of the legislation may provide for lower premiums following the special assessment 
for  management currently believes lower bif and saif rates will generally offset the expense of the anticipated special saif assessment 
increased data processing expense is attributable to a greater volume of activ ity  the outsourcing of a portion of some functions and one time system conversion costs incurred mainly in the increase was in and in some reduction in kentucky bankshare taxes occurred in due to the consolidation of the six separate banking corporations 
kentucky has raised the assessment level and has been attempting to significantly increase this taxation  which is based upon net income and capital of the subsidiaries 
the company s bank subsidiaries are required to to maintain significant noninterest bearing balances with the federal reserve and to pay fees to regulatory agencies for periodic examinations by the agencies 
during  the company completed two pooling of interest acquisitions 
included in other noninterest expense for and is approximately  and  respectively  of professional fees related to these acquisitions 
income taxes increases in income tax expense are attributable to higher operating earnings and higher effective tax rates 
the company s effective income tax rate was  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the federal income tax rate increase mandated by the omnibus budget reconciliation act of and a continued decline in the amount of tax exempt income as a percentage of operating income has increased the effective rate 
also increasing the rate for was nondeductible organizational costs associated with two mergers 
the company manages the effective tax rate to some degree based upon changing tax laws  particularly alternative minimum tax provisions  the availability and price of nontaxable debt securities and other portfolio considerations 
liquidity and interest rate sensitivity the company s objective of liquidity management is to ensure the ability to access funding which enables each bank to efficiently satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers 
asset liability management alm involves the funding and investment strategies necessary to maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and liabilities as well as to assure adequate liquidity 
the company s alm committee monitors funds available from a number of sources to meet its objectives 
the primary source of liquidity for the banks  in addition to loan repayments  is their debt securities portfolios 
securities classified as held for sale are those that the company intends to use as part of its asset liability management and that may be sold prior to maturity in response to changes in interest rates  resultant prepayment risks and other factors 
the company s access to the retail deposit market through individual locations in twelve different counties has been a reliable source of funds 
additional funds for liquidity are available by borrowing federal funds from correspondent banks  federal home loan bank borrowings and brokered deposits 
various types of analyses are performed to ensure adequate liquidity  and to evaluate the desirability of the relative interest rate sensitivity of assets and liabilities 
management considers current liquidity positions of the subsidiary banks to be adequate to meet depositor and borrower needs 
because banks must assume interest rate risks as part of their normal opera tions  the company actively manages its interest rate sensitivity as well as liquidity positions 
both interest rate sensitivity and liquidity are affected by maturing assets and sources of funds  however  management must also consider those assets and liabilities with interest rates which are subject to change prior to maturity 
the primary objective of the alm committee is to optimize earnings results  while controlling interest rate risks within internal policy constraints 
the subsidiary banks and the company collectively measure their level of earnings exposure to future interest rate movements 
a balance sheet analysis is conducted to determine the impact on net interest income for the following twelve months under several interest rate scenarios 
one scenario uses current rates at december  and holds the rates and volumes constant for the simulation 
when this projection is subjected to immediate and parallel shifts in interest rates rate shocks of basis points  both rising and falling  the annual impact of the rate shock at december  on the company s projected net interest income margin was less than five basis points 
currently  the company does not employ interest rate swaps  financial futures or options to affect interest rate risks

nonaccrual loans are included in the rate sensitive category 
the scheduled maturities of mortgage backed securities assume principal prepayments on dates estimated by management  relying primarily on current and concensus interest rate forecasts in conjunction with historical prepayment schedules 
transaction and savings deposits that have no contractual maturities are scheduled according to management s best estimate of their re pricing in response to changes in market rates 
industry developments on september   the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of the branching act was enacted 
under the branching act  beginning september   adequately capitalized and adequately managed bank holding companies are allowed to acquire banks across state line  without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited by state law  however  they will be required to maintain the acquired institutions as separately chartered institutions 
any state law relating to the minimum age of target banks not to exceed five years will be preserved 
under the branching act  the federal reserve board will not be permitted to approve any acquisition if  after the acquisition  the bank holding company would control more than of the deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or or more of the deposits in the state where the target bank is located 
the federal reserve board could approve an acquisition  notwithstandig the limit  if the state waives the limit either by statute  regulation or order of the appropriate state official 
in addition  under the branching act beginning on june   banks will be permitted to merge with one another across state lines and thereby create a main bank with branches in separate states 
after establishing branches in a state through an interstate merger transaction  the bank could establish and acquire additional branches at any location in the state where any bank involved in the merger could have estabished or acquired branches under applicable federal or state law 
under the branching act  states may adopt legislation permitting interstate mergers before june  in contrast  states may adopt legislation before june   subject to certain conditions  opting out of interstate branching 
if a state opts out of interstate branching  no out of state bank may establish a branch in that state through an acquisition or de novo  and a bank whose home state opts out may not participate in an interstate merger transaction
