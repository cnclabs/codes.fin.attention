foreign currency the company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes and is not a party to leveraged derivatives transactions 
the company s sales from foreign locations and exports are significant  therefore  the company does enter into foreign currency forward contracts as a hedge for certain existing or anticipated business transactions denominated in various foreign currencies

as a result  in connection with the preparation of its fiscal consolidated financial statements  the company determined to reclassify the operations of that segment and its former professional audio segment into the following two business segments i automotive  which includes the design  manufacture and distribution of fuel  power transmission  and fluid handling systems and components  and filters and filtration systems for the global automotive aftermarket and original equipment manufacturers oem market 
ii industrial  which includes the design  manufacture and distribution of power transmission  fluid handling  and filtration components and systems for industrial oem and industrial distribution markets worldwide 
the industrial segment also includes the company s transportation products and professional audio business units 
the results of operations of purolator have been included in the company s results of operations for fiscal from its november acquisition date 
in reviewing the company s sales performance  the following results by segment should be considered for each of the fiscal years presented dollars in thousands increase increase over prior over prior amount year amount year amount net sales to customers automotive    industrial    total    the most significant reason for the increase in net sales in fiscal is the fact that the results of operations of purolator were included for all of fiscal  and for only four months following purolator s november acquisition date in fiscal on a pro forma basis  including purolator for all of fiscal  net sales increased by million in fiscal on a consolidated basis  and by million for the automotive business segment 
the million increase in net sales for the industrial segment for fiscal was generated primarily by the segment s domestic power transmission and fluid handling business product lines 
the automotive segments increase in net sales  excluding the effects of purolator  was primarily the result of increased oem sales in europe  offset somewhat by reduced sales in the segment s domestic after market product lines 
the increase in net sales in fiscal was also primarily the result of the purolator acquisition 
excluding the results of purolator  sales increased approximately million over fiscal  with million of the increase coming from domestic sales  and the balance being generated primarily in europe 
cost of products sold as a percentage of consolidated net sales were   and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in the percentage of costs in fiscal is primarily the result of the purolator acquisition  due to its historically lower gross margin 
on a pro forma basis including purolator for the entire fiscal year  such costs were for fiscal this level of costs also reflects the positive effects of the company s cost control programs  which have helped to substantially offset the negative pressures on the margins experienced by both of the company s business segments 
selling and administration costs as a percentage of consolidated net sales were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the reductions in fiscal and are primarily the result of the purolator acquisition  which had a lower level of such costs 
on a pro forma basis  including purolator for the entire fiscal year  such costs were for fiscal the reductions also reflect operating efficiencies achieved in fiscal from the integration of the purolator business and the reorganization of the company s business segments 
the lower level of costs also indicates that the company s continued emphasis on cost control and cycle time reduction has been successful in offsetting the impact of inflation on such costs 
research and development costs increased by million in fiscal over fiscal  which in turn increased by million over fiscal the increases in fiscal and are primarily due to the purolator acquisition 
as a percentage of consolidated net sales  such costs were in the range of to in each of fiscal  and this consistent level of investment reflects the company s continuing emphasis on new product development 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million in fiscal over fiscal  which in turn increased by million over fiscal the increases in fiscal and are primarily attributable to the purolator acquisition  and the increased level of capital equipment expenditures 
the above mentioned items resulted in the following operating income for each of the fiscal years presented dollars in thousands of of of related related related amount sales amount sales amount sales operating income automotive    industrial    total operating income before corporate expenses    corporate expenses  
  operating income a    a including purolator s results of operations on a pro forma basis for all of fiscal and  operating income as a percentage of consolidated net sales would have been  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase is primarily attributable to the company s emphasis on cost control as discussed above 
in spite of the increased interest costs resulting from borrowings to fund the purolator acquisition  interest expense increased only million in fiscal in comparison to fiscal the relatively slight increase in fiscal s expense was achieved as a result of the financing transactions referred to previously under liquidity and capital resources  as well as lower interest rates resulting from the company s improved debt to total capitalization position 
fiscal s interest expense increased million over fiscal s interest expense 
this slight increase was achieved for the same reasons notwithstanding the higher interest rates prevailing during fiscal the company s provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before provision for taxes was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the higher rates in fiscal and were primarily the result of increased income in foreign jurisdictions with higher statutory tax rates than in the us as a result of all of the above  the company s income before extraordinary items in fiscal increased million over fiscal in turn  fiscal s income before extraordinary items increased million over fiscal before the effect of an accounting change in 
as a result of replacing prior credit facilities and the issuance of the company s notes  the company incurred extraordinary losses  net of related tax benefits  of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
additionally  the company s adoption of sfas no 
in fiscal resulted in the recognition of a net of tax charge of million as the cumulative effect of the accounting change in fiscal impact of inflation although the company has experienced delays in its ability to pass on certain inflation related cost increases  the company does not expect that such delays or the overall impact of inflation will have a material impact on the company s operations
