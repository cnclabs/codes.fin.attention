item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general fremont general corporation  a nationwide property and casualty insurance and financial services holding company  operates through its wholly owned subsidiaries in select businesses in niche markets 
the three core operating lines of business are workers compensation insurance  real estate lending and commercial finance lending 
additionally  on a smaller scale  the company is involved in underwriting various other insurance products 
the primary operating strategy of the company is to build upon its core business units through acquisition opportunities and new business development 
the company s secondary strategy is to achieve income balance and geographic diversity among its business units in order to limit the exposure of the company to industry  market and regional concentrations 
the company began its workers compensation insurance operations in and continues to derive the majority of its revenues from this business 
the company s workers compensation insurance business has grown through internal expansion  as well as through the acquisition of other workers compensation insurance companies 
in  the company restructured its workers compensation insurance operations under a single management group 
by consolidating duplicate offices and functions  this management group has increased efficiency and achieved substantial cost savings 
more recently  on february   the company completed the acquisition of all outstanding stock of casualty insurance company casualty and its wholly owned subsidiary workers compensation and indemnity company wcic from the buckeye union insurance company buckeye 
casualty underwrites workers compensation insurance primarily in illinois and several other mid western states  as well as a modest amount through wcic in california 
casualty currently is the largest underwriter of workers compensation insurance in illinois and has provided the company with a significant presence in the mid western region 
the casualty acquisition has provided geographic diversity within the company s workers compensation insurance business segment and the company s revenues from workers compensation insurance premiums were evenly divided between the west and mid west regions 
the company believes this geographic diversity mitigates potential fluctuations in earnings from cyclical downturns in various regional economies 
the company s balance sheet at december  has been significantly impacted by the acquisition of casualty 
the purchase price was million  comprised of million in cash and million in a note payable to buckeye 
in addition  million of costs were incurred in connection with the acquisition bringing the total cost to million 
the acquisition was treated as a purchase for accounting purposes and approximately ten months of casualty s operating results are included in the company s results of operations for the year ended december  at the acquisition date  the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  net of the purchase price and purchase accounting adjustments  are summarized in the following table thousands of dollars assets acquired fixed maturity investments at fair value  short term investments  premiums receivable and agents balances  reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid losses  deferred policy acquisition costs  deferred income taxes  costs in excess of net assets acquired  other assets  including cash  accrued investment income  state deferred taxes and trade name  total assets acquired  liabilities assumed losses and loss adjustment expenses  unearned premiums  dividends to policyholders  other liabilities  total liabilities assumed  since the date of acquisition  the company has re invested the short term investments acquired into longer term investments 
this accounts for the significant increase in the company s fixed maturity and non redeemable preferred stock portfolios for the year ended december  see note b of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information with respect to the acquisition of casualty 
in july  california enacted legislation to reform the workers compensation insurance system and to  among other things  adopt an open rating system through the repeal of the minimum rate law effective january  the repeal of the minimum rate law has resulted in lower premiums and lower profitability on the company s california workers compensation insurance policies due to increased price competition 
the company expects that the premiums earned in california will continue to decrease  principally due to price competition 
see results of operations property and casualty insurance operations premiums 
the company believes that its acquisition of casualty  with policies written primarily outside of california  has lessened the impact of the repeal of the minimum rate law by providing geographic diversity  which mitigates the impact of economic and regulatory changes within a regional marketplace 
in illinois  where casualty underwrites the majority of its workers compensation insurance premiums  price competition will continue to impact workers compensation companies due to an overall average decrease in advisory rates of which became effective january  although insurance companies are not required to adopt such advisory rates  companies in illinois generally follow such rates

in  the company acquired fremont investment loan formerly investors thrift  a california thrift and loan that now serves more than  customers through its branches 
the thrift and loan operations are primarily engaged in commercial and residential real estate lending 
for commercial real estate loans  principal amounts primarily range between to million and for residential real estate loans  principal amounts are generally below  the company s operating strategy is to pursue growth of the loan portfolio through origination of new loans and acquisition of loan portfolios that meet its underwriting guidelines applied to origination of new loans 
assets of the real estate lending operation grew from million at the end of to billion at the end of  due primarily to increased loan originations and to the purchase of loan portfolios from other financial institutions 
see item business financial services operations real estate lending 
the ability of the company to continue to originate loans  and of borrowers to repay outstanding loans  may be impaired by adverse changes in local or regional economic conditions which affect such areas or by adverse changes in the real estate market in those areas 
such events could also significantly impair the value of the underlying collateral 
if the company s collateral were to prove inadequate  the company s results of operations could be adversely affected 
the company s commercial finance subsidiary  fremont financial corporation fremont financial  provides working capital loans  primarily secured by accounts receivable and inventory  to small and middle market companies on a nationwide basis 
fremont financial s total loan portfolio grew from million at december  to million at december  this growth has been achieved through development of fremont financial s customer base through loan originations and through participation in syndicated loan transactions 
see item business financial service operations commercial finance 
the lending market has become increasingly competitive for small to middle market commercial borrowers 
as a result  fremont financial has experienced decreasing yields on its commercial finance loans 
adverse economic developments can negatively affect the company s business and results of operations in a number of ways 
such developments can reduce the demand for loans  impair the ability of borrowers to pay loans and impair the value of the underlying collateral 
between and  the company discontinued its domestic treaty reinsurance business  its other primary and excess property and casualty insurance operations and the underwriting of all remaining assumed reinsurance 
in  a single management group was put in charge of all discontinued operations  and it is the intention of the company to complete the liquidation of these operations by the commutation of liabilities and as claims are paid

results of operations by providing diverse insurance and financial services to small and medium sized businesses  the company has achieved growth in both revenues and net income during the three years ended december  higher revenues and net income in were also achieved through the acquisition of casualty 
the following table presents information for each of the three years in the period ended december  with respect to the company s core business segments

revenues were higher in as compared to  due primarily to higher workers compensation insurance premiums  net investment income and loan interest income 
the higher workers compensation insurance premiums and net investment income are due primarily to the acquisition of casualty  partially offset by lower insurance premiums earned in california 
see property and casualty insurance operations premiums 
revenues between and were flat due primarily to the combined effects of higher loan interest  substantially offset by lower workers compensation insurance premiums 
realized investment gains losses were   and  in  and  respectively 
the company had net income of million or per share for  as compared to million or per share and million or per share for and  respectively

workers compensation insurance operations posted income before taxes of million for  as compared to million for and million for the increase in income before taxes in is due primarily to the acquisition of casualty  offset partially by lower income on the company s california business 
the increase in income before taxes in is due primarily to the continued decline in the frequency and severity of reported claims incurred on the through accident years and lower than expected operating costs  offset partially by lower premiums 
the combined ratio for was compared to and for and  respectively 
the company s professional medical liability  corporate and other segment is composed principally of revenues and expenses that pertain to the company s professional medical liability business medical malpractice  as well as miscellaneous expenses associated with the company s downstream property and casualty insurance holding company  fremont insurance group  inc  fremont insurance group 
medical malpractice revenues were flat at million in as compared to million for medical malpractice revenues increased in from million in due primarily to a shift in underwriting focus towards those medical specialties that had higher premiums 
income before taxes for the medical malpractice business was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the decrease in income before taxes in and  as compared to  is due primarily to an increase in the frequency and severity of reported claims 
expenses of fremont insurance group include interest expense on debt and other obligations of million  million and million  respectively  for  and  and overhead expenses of million  million and million for the corresponding periods 
since the operations of fremont insurance group consist primarily of interest expense and overhead expenses management does not expect it to operate at a profit 
the financial services business segment posted increases of and in income before taxes for and  respectively 
these increases are consistent with increases in financial services revenues and are due primarily to the significant growth in the average loan portfolio over the three year period ended december  from million in to billion in contributing to this growth in the average loan portfolio is the acquisition of approximately million in primarily commercial real estate loan portfolios which were completed during the last six months of this segment  which consists principally of real estate lending and commercial finance operations  recorded income before taxes of million  million and million for  and  respectively 
corporate revenues consisted primarily of investment income  while corporate expenses consisted primarily of interest expense and general and administrative expense 
the corporate loss before income taxes was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the increase in the corporate loss before taxes in over was due primarily to increased interest expense and decreased investment income 
the increase in interest expense is due primarily to additional debt incurred in the acquisition of casualty  along with modest increases in administrative expenses 
the decrease in corporate loss before taxes in compared to was primarily due to increased investment income and higher intercompany interest income from the company s subsidiaries 
income tax expense of million  million and million for  and  respectively  represent effective tax rates of  and on pretax income of million  million and million for the corresponding periods 
the company s effective tax rates for all years presented are lower than the enacted federal income tax rate of  due primarily to tax exempt investment income which reduces the company s taxable income 
property and casualty insurance operations the following table represents information with respect to the company s property and casualty insurance operations year ended december  thousands of dollars revenues    expenses    income before taxes    revenues from the property and casualty insurance operations consist primarily of workers compensation insurance premiums earned and net investment income 
expenses consist primarily of loss and loss adjustment expenses  policy acquisition costs  other operating costs and expenses and  for the years ended december and  dividends to policyholders 
premiums 
premiums earned from the company s workers compensation insurance operations were million in  as compared to million and million in and  respectively 
premiums were significantly higher in due primarily to the acquisition of casualty  partially offset by lower premiums earned in california 
for the year ended december   the company s workers compensation insurance premiums earned in its western region  consisting primarily of california  accounted for million  or of the company s total workers compensation insurance premiums earned for such period  representing a decrease of million from this decrease was due primarily to the increased price competition resulting from california s adoption of an open rating system and the repeal of the minimum rate law 
see workers compensation regulation 
this increased price competition has led to i lower premium rates and ii a lower average policy size due to the company s shift in focus to smaller employers 
additionally  non renewing polices have increased in which has also contributed to the lower premium volume in california 
the increase in non renewing polices occurs as a result of certain premium prices falling below required minimum pricing pursuant to the company s underwriting standards 
the company expects that the premiums earned in california will continue to decrease  principally due to price competition 
for the year ended december   the company s workers compensation insurance premiums earned in its mid western region  consisting primarily of illinois  accounted for million  or of the company s total workers compensation insurance premiums earned 
in addition  the company anticipates price competition to continue in illinois  where an additional overall average decrease of in advisory rates  which workers compensation insurance companies in illinois tend to follow  became effective january  premiums were lower in as compared to  due primarily to reductions in california workers compensation manual premium rates which occurred in the last six months of net investment income 
net investment income within the property and casualty insurance operations was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
significantly higher invested assets  due primarily to the acquisition of casualty  resulted in increased investment income in as compared to and the effects of lower invested assets and lower investment yields during resulted in net investment income levels lower as compared to see item business investment portfolio 
loss and loss adjustment expense 
workers compensation loss and loss adjustment expenses lae were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in addition  the ratio of these losses and lae to workers compensation insurance premiums earned was  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in incurred loss and lae in as compared to is due primarily to the acquisition of casualty  partially offset by lower incurred loss and lae in california 
additionally  the increase in the loss and lae ratio in as compared to  is partially due to lower premiums on california policies which resulted from increased competition in see premiums 
the decrease in california premiums was greater than the decrease in california incurred loss and lae  thereby resulting in a higher loss and lae ratio 
the negative impact on the company s profitability resulting from the higher loss and lae ratio has been mitigated to an extent by the elimination of dividends accrued on california workers compensation business in the dividend elimination occurred as the majority of the workers compensation policies written in were non participating 
this type of policy is not eligible for dividend consideration 
see dividends to policyholders 
the decrease in the loss ratio in as compared to is due primarily to the positive impacts of the continued decrease in the frequency and severity of reported claims on the and subsequent accident years  particularly in southern california  which began in mid the company attributes this reduction in claim frequency and severity to aggressive loss control and improved underwriting 
improved loss control has been achieved through a significant effort to reduce fraudulent workers compensation claims by california law enforcement and regulatory authorities  the insurance industry and the company under its zero tolerance program 
underwriting improvements were made to focus on businesses with stable work environments and less hazardous occupations 
see item business insurance operations loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
the company regularly reviews its reserving techniques  overall reserve position and reinsurance 
in light of present facts and current legal interpretations  management believes that adequate provisions have been made for loss reserves 
in making this determination  management has considered its claims experience to date  loss development history for prior accident years and estimates of future trends of claims frequency and severity 
however  establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process  and there can be no certainty that currently established reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent actual experience 
subsequent actual experience has resulted and could result in loss reserves being too high or too low 
future loss development could require reserves for prior periods to be increased  which would adversely impact earnings in future periods 
policy acquisition costs and other operating costs and expenses 
the ratio of policy acquisition costs and other operating costs and expenses to premiums earned is referred to as the expense ratio  which was  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in this ratio in and  as compared to  was due primarily to higher agents commission costs 
dividends to policyholders 
in there were no dividends accrued 
this is compared to million and million in dividends accrued in and  respectively 
the ratio of dividends accrued to workers compensation insurance premiums earned therefore decreased to in from and in and  respectively 
the significant decrease in dividends accrued is due in part to a change in the type of workers compensation insurance policy written on and after january  in  the company s workers compensation insurance policies  both in california and those underwritten by casualty  were predominately written as non participating  which does not include provisions for dividend consideration 
in and prior  the company s policies were predominately written as participating  thereby obligating the company to consider the payment of dividends 
this shift in policy type is due primarily to the increased competition in the california market which has resulted from the repeal of the minimum rate law  effective january  the company anticipates that this shift to non participating policies will continue and be a characteristic element of the competitive environment established by the july california legislation 
see workers compensation regulation 
variability of operating results 
the company s profitability can be affected significantly by many factors including competition  the severity and frequency of claims  interest rates  regulations  court decisions  the judicial climate  and general economic conditions and trends  all of which are outside of the company s control 
these factors have contributed  and in the future could contribute  to significant variation of results of operations in different aspects of the company s business from quarter to quarter and year to year 
with respect to the workers compensation insurance business  changes in economic conditions can lead to reduced premium levels due to lower payrolls as well as increased claims due to the tendency of workers who are laid off to submit workers compensation claims 
legislative and regulatory changes can also contribute to variable operating results for workers compensation insurance businesses 
for example  in  the company experienced the negative impact of lower premiums and lower profitability on the company s california workers compensation business due to increased price competition resulting from legislation enacted in california in july which  among other things  repealed the minimum rate law effective january  see workers compensation regulation 
the company anticipates that its workers compensation insurance premiums earned in california will continue to decrease as a result of this increased price competition  which could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
see premiums 
also  the establishment of appropriate reserves necessarily involves estimates  and reserve adjustments have caused significant fluctuations in operating results from year to year 
workers compensation regulation 
illinois began operating under an open rating system in and california began operating under such a system effective january  in an open rating system  workers compensation companies are provided with advisory rates by job classification and each insurance company determines its own rates based in part upon its particular operating and loss costs 
although insurance companies are not required to adopt such advisory rates  companies in illinois generally follow such rates 
however  insurance companies in california have  since the adoption of an open rating system  generally set their premium rates below such advisory rates 
before january   california operated under a minimum rate law  whereby premium rates established by the california department of insurance were the minimum rates which could be charged by an insurance carrier 
in july  california enacted legislation to reform the workers compensation insurance system and to  among other things  i reduce workers compensation manual premium rates by effective july  and ii repeal the minimum rate law effective january  in addition to the july legislation  in december  the california insurance commissioner reduced workers compensation manual premium rates on new and renewal business an additional effective january  in september  california workers compensation manual premium rates were further reduced by effective october  on all business incepting on or after january  the repeal of the minimum rate law on january  has resulted in lower premiums and lower profitability in the company s california workers compensation insurance business due to increased price competition 
the company believes that its acquisition of casualty  with policies written primarily outside of california  has lessened the impact of the repeal of the minimum rate law by providing geographic diversity  which mitigates the impact of economic and regulatory changes within a regional marketplace

revenues consist principally of interest income and  to a lesser extent  life insurance premiums  fees and other income 
the following table presents information with respect to the company s financial services operations year ended december  thousands of dollars revenues    expenses    income before taxes    revenues increased in and in  due primarily to greater loan interest and fee revenue attributable to the growth in the average loan portfolios of the real estate lending and commercial finance operations from billion in to billion in contributing to this growth in the average loan portfolio was the acquisition of approximately million in primarily commercial real estate loan portfolios which were completed during the last six months of in  no portfolios of commercial real estate loans were purchased  primarily due to increased competition which resulted in inadequate yields or unacceptable risk profiles for the portfolios considered 
income before taxes in the financial services operations was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the increase in income before taxes in as compared to is due primarily to continued growth in the loan portfolios  offset partially by increases in the provision for loan losses and other expenses

the margin between the company s interest income and cost of funds decreased in and  due primarily to changes in the mix of loans in the real estate lending operation  as well as a decrease in the net margins in the commercial finance lending segment 
in the real estate lending operation  the change in portfolio mix occurred under a corporate strategy which began in  to shift away from high rate  high risk loans secured by personal property or junior liens on real estate  to lower yielding commercial and residential first trust deed real estate loans 
the lower yields on the commercial and residential real estate portfolios are compensated for by the improved underlying collateral and by the improved lien position on the collateral 
the net margins decreased in the commercial finance segment due primarily to increases in the credit quality of the loan portfolio which has resulted in lower net margins  as well as to an increase in the competitive environment

net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash provided by continuing operations decreased in over due primarily to the following items i a smaller net decrease in agents balances and reinsurance recoverables  ii an increase in accrued investment income  iii a greater decrease in claims and policy liabilities  iv and higher policy acquisition costs deferred  net of amortization 
these conditions were partially offset by higher net income  a net increase in other liabilities  net of other assets and a significant increase in the provision for deferred income taxes 
the decreases in agents balances and claims and policy liabilities are primarily due to lower premium volume in the company s california workers compensation insurance business 
higher policy acquisition costs deferred are due primarily to increases in annuity contract receipts in the company s life insurance operation see notes f and p of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the net increase in other liabilities  net of other assets  is due primarily to increased accruals for other operating costs
