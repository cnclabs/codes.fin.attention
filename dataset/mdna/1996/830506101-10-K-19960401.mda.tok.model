item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition center banks incorporated the company is a bank holding company  with skaneateles savings bank the bank being its sole subsidiary 
the financial condition and operating results of the company are largely dependent on the bank  its primary investment 
consolidated assets of the company were million at december   compared with million at december   an increase of million or 
this growth was funded primarily by deposit growth of million or net loans were million at december   an increase of million or from december  mortgage loans increased million or and were million at december  residential mortgages accounted for all of the increase  while commercial mortgages decreased  during  the bank originated million of residential loans  a decrease of million or from s originations of million 
this decrease is primarily the result of reduced loan demand caused by the lingering effects of higher interest rates in late and early and a general slowdown in the economy 
approximately million of the bank s residential loan originations in were refinancings  compared with million in during the first half of  refinancings comprised approximately of total originations  while only of the originations in the second half of were refinancings 
this trend  brought upon by higher interest rates  continued into the first part of during the first half of  refinancings comprised approximately of the million originated 
refinancings during the second half of increased as interest rates fell  comprising approximately of the million originated during the period 
total loans millions approximately million or of the residential loans originated in were for fixed rates of interest  compared with million and  respectively  in fixed rate mortgages with terms of years or less are originated for portfolio as long as they fit the company s established asset liability mix  while fixed rate mortgages with terms greater than years are sold on the secondary market to control the company s interest rate risk 
during  the bank retained approximately million of year fixed rate mortgages for portfolio  compared with million in in addition to fixed rate loans  the bank offers adjustable rate loans with rates that adjust annually year arm  or once every three years year arm 
originations of year and year arm s totaled million or in  compared with million or in the bank also offers a arm and arm 
the arm is a loan with a fixed rate of interest for the first five years 
on the loan s fifth anniversary  the rate converts to the current rate for a year arm  and adjusts annually over the remaining term of the loan 
the arm is identical to the arm except that the rate of interest is fixed for the first years 
originations of and arm s totaled million or of the residential loan originations in  compared with million or in during the bank sold approximately million of fixed rate residential loans  compared with million in the bank retains servicing on all sold loans 
variable rate loans are generally retained for portfolio 
the shift in residential loan demand away from variable rate loans into loans with fixed rates is a direct result of the sharp drop in long term interest rates during at december  the average rate for a year fixed rate mortgage in the company s market area was approximately  compared with a fully indexed rate of approximately for a year arm 
it is expected that demand will continue to be heavily weighted toward fixed rate loans until this rate difference narrows 
other loans business  home equity  consumer and student loans were million at december   down from december  business loans decreased million or due in large part to prepayments on existing loans during  compounded by slow growth in new loans due to a highly competitive local market 
consumer  home equity and student loans increased million or 
the company placed more of an emphasis on consumer lending in  particularly for home equity products and home improvement loans  which are secured by a second mortgage on residential property 
total outstanding balances on home equity and home improvement loans were million at december   up from million at december  securities available for sale were million including net unrealized gains of  at december   compared with million including net unrealized losses of  at december  and consisted of us government and agency obligations and mortgage backed securities 
on january  the company reclassified its entire portfolio of mortgage backed securities from available for sale to held to maturity  at the securities fair value of million 
the change reflected management s intention to hold the securities to maturity and was done to shield equity from future volatility in the fair value of the securities due to changes in market rates 
in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a special report entitled a guide to implementation of statement on accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  as more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company adopted the provisions of the guide in november and transferred securities with an amortized cost of  from the held to maturity portfolio to the available for sale category 
the  net unrealized gain on the securities was recorded in the separate component of stockholders equity at the time of transfer 
other assets were million at december   an increase of million or from december  the company reclassified million from cash and due from banks to other assets in this amount represents the amount owed the bank by nationar  as more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
asset quality nonperforming assets are comprised of nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned 
management s policy is to place a loan on nonaccrual status with respect to interest income recognition when collection of the interest is doubtful 
generally  this occurs when principal or interest payments are ninety days or more past due  although interest accruals may continue for certain loans that are adequately secured 
the classification of a loan as nonaccruing does not necessarily indicate that the principal and interest ultimately will be uncollectable 
the company s historical experience suggests that a portion of assets so classified will eventually be recovered 
all nonperforming loans are in various stages of workout  settlement or foreclosure 
nonperforming assets totaled million  or of total assets at december   down from million  or of total assets at december  nonaccrual loans were million and million at december  and  respectively  and consisted primarily of business loans and commercial real estate loans 
the reduction in nonaccrual loans is primarily attributable to the reclassification of a large commercial loan which accounted for million or of nonaccrual loans at december   due to its restructuring in this loan  which matures in  is included in the amount of loans considered by management to be impaired  as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
non performing assets total assets the allowance for loan losses was million at december  compared with million at the end of the ratio of the allowance to nonperforming loans was at december   compared with at the end of charge offs  net of recoveries  amounted to  in  compared with  in allowance for loan losses as a of nonperforming loans the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated monthly  and is determined primarily by management s informed judgment concerning the amount of risk inherent in the portfolio 
management s judgment is based upon a number of factors including historical loan loss experience  the present and prospective financial condition of borrowers  estimated value of underlying collateral  industry and geographic concentrations  and current and prospective economic conditions 
the company utilizes a risk rating system in its credit quality estimation process 
this system involves an ongoing review of business loans and commercial real estate loans that culminates in loans being assigned a risk rating based upon various credit criteria 
if the review indicates a sufficient level of risk  an allowance is established proportional to the perceived risk for each loan 
loans not having an individually established allowance are aggregated by the type of loan and an allowance is estimated based upon aging statistics  past experience and economic factors 
as with any financial institution  poor economic conditions  high interest rates  high unemployment and other matters outside of the company s control may lead to increased losses in the loan portfolio 
management has various controls in place designed in an effort to limit losses  such as a comprehensive watch list of possible loan problems  a fully documented policy concerning loan administration loan file documentation  disclosures  approvals  etc 
and a loan review staff to audit for adherence to established company controls and to review the quality and anticipated collectibility of the portfolio 
the loan review department reports monthly to the executive committee of the board of directors  which in turn  reports to the full board of directors 
the power to authorize charge offs rests solely with the board of directors 
the financial accounting standards board issued statement accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan as amended by statement  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
these statements prescribe recognition criteria for loan impairment  generally related to commercial type loans  and measurement methods for certain impaired loans and all loans whose terms are modified in troubled debt restructuring subsequent to the adoption of these statements 
a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that the borrower will be unable to repay the loan according to the original contractual terms of the loan agreement 
as of january   the company has adopted the provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
the effect of adoption was not material to the consolidated financial statements 
the company recognizes interest income on impaired loans using the cash basis of income recognition 
cash receipts on impaired loans are generally applied according to the terms of the loan agreement  or as a reduction of principal  based upon management judgment and other factors 
management believes that the allowance as of december  was adequate based upon the quality of the loan portfolio at that date 
future additions to the allowance will be based  among other factors  on changes in economic conditions and financial stress of the company s borrowers 
real estate owned  net reo totaled  at december   which represents a decrease of  or from the balance at december  the company wrote down its reo portfolio by  in and sold properties with book values aggregating  including two large non residential properties which had been owned by the company for a number of years 
asset liability management the goal of asset liability management is to reduce the volatility of net interest income during periods of changing market interest rates interest rate risk 
historically  interest rate risk measurement was limited to a review of the company s gap position  or the difference between assets and liabilities which reprice and or mature within a given time frame  typically the cumulative one year horizon 
the company s cumulative year ratio of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities rsa rsl was at december   compared to at december  although the gap approach delineates when a given dollar of assets or liabilities has the ability to mature or reprice  it provides no illumination concerning the probable response of that asset or liability to changes in interest rates 
during management of the company  while acknowledging there is value in understanding the relative repricings and maturities of interest sensitive accounts  came to the conclusion that undue reliance on a gap report to analyze the company s interest rate risk position can lead to flawed investment and lending decisions 
in view of this conclusion  the company adopted a new model for interest rate risk measurement  adding to traditional gap analysis approaches known as income simulation and rate shock market value analysis 
not only does income simulation consider the maturity and repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities it captures the relative sensitivities of these balance sheet components 
income simulation analysis attends to both the possibility and probability of the behavior of balance sheet items 
market value of equity analysis is intended to address the change in equity value arising from movements in interest rates 
the market value of equity is estimated by valuing the company s assets and liabilities 
the extent to which assets have gained or lost value in relation to the gains or losses of liabilities determines the appreciation or depreciation in equity on a market value basis 
for example  in a rising rate environment  both assets and liabilities decrease in value 
if the assets lose relatively more value than the liabilities  the market value of equity will shrink 
conversely  should the liabilities depreciate by a proportionally greater amount  the market value of equity will increase despite the fact that rates have risen 
in the latter case  the company s obligations have lost more value than its assets  and hence the company has realized greater equity value 
management believes that because of the ability to model the relative rate sensitivities of assets and liabilities  management can more clearly define the ability of the company to absorb or benefit from shifts in interest rates 
proposed strategies to manage perceived risks can be tested in the computer model prior to implementation 
overall  the use of the company s simulation model greatly enhances the planning process 
stockholder s equity at december   the company s stockholders equity totaled million  an increase of million from million at december  this increase is the result of i net income of million  ii proceeds of  from issuance of stock under stock plans  iii cash dividends of  and iv a  increase in the fair value of securities available for sale  net of taxes 
the company s leverage capital ratio was at december  compared with at december  total capital to risk adjusted assets was and  respectively  at december  and the company and bank are in compliance with federal reserve board and fdic capital requirements as of both respective dates 
leverage capital ratio liquidity and capital resources the purpose of liquidity management is to assure that there is sufficient cash flow to meet all of the company s financial requirements and to be able to capitalize on opportunities for increasing income 
liquidity is mainly provided by cash  securities available for sale  principal collections on loans and mortgage backed securities and borrowing facilities from correspondent banks 
another component affecting the company s liquidity is deposit accounts  which provide liquidity as well as a customer base to which additional products and services can be offered 
during  the company s deposit base experienced an increase of million or 
now and demand accounts increased million  time accounts grew by million and savings and money market accounts decreased million 
this change in the company s deposit mix is attributable primarily to the movement of rate sensitive savings and money market accounts to higher yielding alternatives  such as time accounts  in response to the higher market rates in late and early this trend slowed considerably in the latter part of in response to lower interest rates 
based on historical analysis  the company believes that a portion of its savings account balances are rate sensitive and may move to higher yielding alternatives  such as time accounts  during a period of rising rates 
the company s liquidity position is monitored daily and the asset liability committee is responsible for setting general guidelines to ensure maintenance of prudent levels of liquidity 
because of the multitude of funding sources available  the company does not foresee any difficulties in generating sufficient liquidity 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  general the company s and bank s earnings are largely dependent upon net interest income  and are also affected by its provision for loan losses  other operating income and expenses  and taxes 
net income was  or per share in  compared with  or per share in a  increase in net interest income and a  decrease in provision for loan losses was partially offset by a  increase in other expenses 
income taxes increased  net interest income net interest income is affected by the difference between the yield earned on interest earning assets and rates paid on deposits and borrowings 
the relative amounts of interest earning assets  deposits  and borrowings also impact net interest income levels 
net interest income was million in  an increase of  or from million in interest income increased million or in due to a million increase in average interest earning assets and a 
increase in the yield on those assets 
residential mortgages accounted for much of the growth in earning assets during yields were up for all categories of interest earning assets in  due to the higher level of interest rates that resulted from a series of rate hikes during and early by the federal reserve the fed 
the yield on mortgage loans increased 
in  and the yield on other loans  which consist primarily of business loans and home equity lines of credit  increased 
home equity lines and business loans generally carry a variable rate of interest tied to the bank s prime rate 
the rate on business loans adjusts whenever the prime rate changes 
home equity adjustments take effect between and days after a change in the prime rate 
the bank s prime rate  which is directly impacted by movements in short term rates by the fed  averaged in  compared with in interest expense increased million or in due to a million increase in average interest bearing liabilities and a 
increase in the cost of funds 
average interest bearing deposits increased million or due in large part to the assumption of million of interest bearing deposits acquired from first national bank of rochester in december the company s cost of funds has trended downward beginning in the latter part of and continuing into due in large part to the lower interest rate environment compared with most of market interest rates alone do not dictate the rates the company pays for its funds  although they are an important factor 
other factors that impact the company s cost of funds include liquidity needs  the desired mix of deposits and borrowings  local market competition  asset growth objectives and profit objectives 
the company s net interest margin  which is computed by dividing net interest income by average interest earning assets  was in  compared with in analysis of net interest income the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  information regarding i the total dollar amount of interest income from interest earning assets and the resulting average yields  ii the total dollar amount of interest expense on interest bearing liabilities and the resultant average cost  iii net interest income  iv interest rate spread  v net interest earning assets  vi net yield on interest earning assets  and vii ratio of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities

in much of the company s million portfolio of adjustable rate mortgages is indexed to the year us treasury note and the rates are adjusted annually 
in  the yield on the year treasury note nearly doubled  increasing to approximately at the end of  with roughly of the increase occurring in the last quarter 
as a result  rates on many adjustable rate mortgages either adjusted before the majority of the market rate increases in had occurred or  for residential mortgages that adjusted in the latter part of  the adjustment was less than the market rate increase because of annual adjustment caps  which are generally 
the result of these factors was an increase in the yield on adjustable rate mortgages of approximately

part of the proceeds from the assumption of deposits were used to liquidate borrowings totaling million in december 
the company s cost of funds did not move in direct step with its earning asset yield because of the company s ability to manage its liability structure and the magnitude and timing of changes in deposit rates 
the cost of funds declined for all categories of interest bearing liabilities in compared with  however the trend in and into has been an increase in the cost of funds

the company recorded income tax expense of  in  compared with an income tax benefit of  in impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements presented in the annual report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
measurement of financial position and operating results have been made in terms of historical dollars 
changes in the relative purchasing power of money due to inflation are not reflected 
virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature  thus banks are more affected by changes in interest rates than by inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily reflect the direction or magnitude of changes in the price of goods and services which are primarily affected by inflation 
in the current interest rate environment  liquidity and the maturity structure of the company s assets and liabilities are of major importance in maintaining acceptable levels of performance 
recently issued accounting standards in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the statement requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used by a company be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
in performing the review for recoverability  companies are required to estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
under sfas no 
 an impairment loss is recognized if the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset 
the statement also establishes standards for recording an impairment loss for certain assets that are subject to disposal 
excluded from the scope of the statement are financial instruments  mortgage and other loan servicing rights  deposit intangibles and deferred tax assets

the company currently follows accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees in accounting for its plans 
in october  the fasb issued statement no 
entitled accounting for stock based compensation which encourages  but does not require  companies to use a fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation plans 
under this method  compensation cost is measured as of the date stock awards are granted based on the fair value rather than the intrinsic value of the award  and such cost is recognized over the service period  which is usually the vesting period 
if a company elects to continue using the intrinsic value based method under opinion  pro forma disclosures of net income and net income per share are required  as if the fair value based method had been applied 
under the intrinsic value based method presently utilized by the company  compensation cost is the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of the stock as of the grant date over the amount employees must pay to acquire it  or over the price established for determining appreciation 
under the company s compensation policies  there is no such excess on the dates of grant 
sfas no 
is effective on january  the company will continue to account for its compensation plans under opinion no
