average earning assets grew million of which million was related to loan volume 
strong loan demand contributed positively to the net interest margin funded mainly by higher costing deposit liabilities and other sources of borrowed funds and  in part  by an increase in average non interest bearing deposits of million 
late in the second quarter and continuing throughout the remainder of  the corporation invested in adjustable rate collateralized mortgage obligations cmo s funded by repurchase agreements which also added to the net interest margin 
consumers continued to shift their deposits from interest checking  money market  and savings accounts into higher interest paying time deposit accounts

statement of income net interest income net interest income  the difference between total interest income and total interest expense  is the corporation s principal source of earnings 
the amount of net interest income is determined by the volume of interest earning assets  the level of rates earned on those assets and the cost of supporting funds 
the difference between rates earned on interest earning assets with an adjustment made to tax exempt income to provide comparability with taxable income and the cost of supporting funds is measured by the net interest margin 
the distribution of assets  liabilities  and shareholders equity for the last three years  along with the related levels of fully taxable equivalent interest income and expense  is presented on page of this report 
the variances in interest income and expense caused by differences in average balances and rates are shown on page of this report 
the general level of interest rates declined in the second half of as the federal reserve eased monetary policy 
the prime rate decreased in tandem with the drop in short term interest rates  maintaining a basis point spread between prime and federal funds rate 
the impact on the corporation s net interest margin was favorable  rising basis points to for compared to the achieved in average earning assets increased million  or  with higher yielding loans accounting for million of the total growth 
while the overall cost of interest bearing liabilities increased  due largely to the upward repricing of time deposits generated during the low rate cycle of and  a higher percentage of earning assets were funded by noninterest bearing liabilities 
the combination of an increasing net interest margin  a more profitable asset mix and growth in earning assets in generated an increase in net interest income of million  or approximately provision for loan losses a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings for the purpose of establishing an allowance for loan losses

the amount of the allowance for loan losses is established based on a continual review of the overall quality of the loan portfolio 
in this analysis  consideration is given to nonaccrual  past due and other problem loans  historical loan loss experience and the growth and mix of the loan portfolio 
current and projected economic conditions are also variables that must be considered in establishing the allowance 
at year end  the ratio of the allowance to loans was compared with the at december  the allowance for loan losses at december  represented of nonperforming loans  compared with at december  the allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a quarterly basis and was considered adequate at december  a discussion concerning credit quality is included in the loans and credit quality section of this discussion

investment securities gains losses securities gains were thousand in compared to losses of million in during the fourth quarter of  management restructured the corporation s balance sheet  through the sale of that portion of collateralized mortgage obligations securities most sensitive to a rising rate environment 
this action resulted in an after tax charge to earnings of approximately million 
noninterest expense total noninterest expenses in were million and stable with levels of million 
salaries expense was million in compared to million in  an increase of 
part of this is attributable to staffing of key holding company positions in the latter part of also  the corporation accrued an estimate for separation costs associated with the consolidation of certain back office activities at the holding company level in accordance with its out placement policy  which impacted total salary and benefit costs for full time equivalent employees totaled at year end compared with at year end the remainder of the increase was due to normal salary increases 
employee benefit costs totaled million in up in comparison to these increases were due to rises in pension expense due to a new defined benefit plan along with a matching k plan implemented by the corporation 
increases in the stock price which affects the compensation expense accrued for stock options outstanding also contributed to the rise in expense 
net occupancy expense experienced a thousand decrease in in comparison to equipment costs were million at year end compared to million in  an increase of

 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
sfas no 
requires that securities be classified into three categories which are held to maturity  available for sale and trading securities 
bankgroup has securities in the held to maturity portfolio and the available for sale portfolio 
debt and equity securities in the available for sale category are to be reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of shareholders equity  net of the related deferred tax effect 
balance sheet investment portfolio investments  including securities available for sale and securities held to maturity totaled million on december   compared to million the prior year 
the increase occurred in the available for sale position and was comprised principally of adjustable rate collateralized mortgage obligations cmo s funded with floating rate debt of the same index and repricing frequency 
during fourth quarter of  the financial accounting standards board allowed financial institutions a one time opportunity to restructure their investment portfolios under the designations of sfas no 
management took advantage of this opportunity by redesignating million of held to maturity as available for sale without any penalty or tainting of the remaining held to maturity portfolio 
as of december   of the corporation s investment portfolio was classified in the available for sale category  with the remaining of investment securities classified as held to maturity 
this distribution allows more flexibility in the management of interest rate risk  credit  liquidity and capital adequacy 
the maturity distribution of all securities and average taxable equivalent yields as of december   are shown on pages and of this report 
all cmo s are classified as available for sale 
at least on a quarterly basis  and more often in times of heightened interest rate volatility  these securities are tested to monitor their sensitivity to movements in interest rates and the effects of prepayments on their market price 
this review is conducted utilizing the ffiec high risk test  under which securities are analyzed on the assumption of an immediate and parallel shift of basis points in the yield curve 
at december   the corporation s cmo portfolio has an average life of years 
were rates to rise or fall by basis points  the average life of the portfolio would extend to years  or decline to years  respectively 
the market price of the cmo portfolio would decline by approximately or increase by approximately were rates to rise or fall by basis points  respectively 
the overwhelming majority of the corporation s cmo portfolio are issued by the federal national mortgage association or the federal home loan mortgage corporation and are backed by collateral issued by these agencies 
management believes there is no material credit risk inherent in these investments 
loans and credit quality average loans  net of unearned income  increased from million in to million in  up 
average gross loan categories increased as follows commercial up  consumer up  real estate up and credit card up 
credit card loans outstanding at the end of of million  up from million in are low in comparison to other loan categories

management believes that early detection of credit problems through regular reviews of borrowers collateral and financial performance is an important factor in overall credit quality 
although there were no large concentrations of credit to any particular industry  the economic trends of the areas served by bankgroup affiliates are influenced by the significant industries within the region including textiles  furniture  pre built housing and agriculture 
virtually all of our business activity is with customers located in the central and western part of southern virginia

the debentures were convertible at any time on and prior to october  into shares of the company s common stock at a conversion rate of shares of common stock for each  principal amount of debentures equivalent to a conversion price of per share 
holders converting debentures were not entitled to receive interest from april  the corporation also entered into a standby agreement with scott and stringfellow  incorporated  a broker dealer headquartered in richmond  virginia providing that debentures not converted by the holders would  in effect  be converted by scott and stringfellow and the resulting common stock sold in a public offering

requires an adjustment to shareholders equity for net unrealized losses in the available for sale securities portfolio 
this adjustment at december  and  was million and million  respectively 
after the adjustment  total shareholders equity was million and million at december  and  respectively 
asset liability management the role of the asset liability management function within the corporation is to maximize profitability within established guidelines for liquidity  capital adequacy and interest rate risk 
management seeks to minimize the risks to earnings and equity associated with movements in market interest rates 
measurement and monitoring of liquidity  capital adequacy and interest rate risk are performed centrally for the corporation and the subsidiary banks  and reported relative to guidelines established by management  the boards of directors and regulators 
interest rate sensitivity is traditionally measured in three ways the difference  or gap  between interest sensitive earning assets and interest sensitive bearing liabilities  the resultant change in net interest income due to market interest rate fluctuations  and the effect of interest rate movements on the market value of assets  liabilities and capital 
because of the shortcomings of gap reporting  the corporation also utilizes an asset liability management simulation model to measure potential earnings and capital risk 
the simulation model  because of its dynamic nature  can capture the effects of future balance sheet trends  differing patterns of rate movement and changing relationships between rates basis risk 
additionally  the model captures the impact of varying levels of prepayment risk on certain loan and investment categories relative to movements in market rates 
while most assets and liabilities reprice either at maturity or in accordance with their contractual terms  several balance sheet components demonstrate characteristics that require adjustments to more accurately reflect their repricing behavior 
assumptions based on historical pricing relationships and anticipated market are made to certain core deposits to reflect the elasticity of the changes in their interest rates relative to changes in market rates 
year end simulations which forecast changes in net interest income that may result from movements in interest rates over the forward twelve month time horizon  indicate that net interest income would increase by approximately given a parallel rise of basis points in market rates and decrease of approximately given a decline of basis points 
a longer term measure of interest rate risk exposure is market value of portfolio equity  which simulates the magnitude of change in the market values of assets  liabilities and capital resulting from movements in interest rates 
while the corporation utilizes its asset liability management simulation model to measure shifts in market value  no specific policy limits have been established 
the process of developing an understanding of all the issues raised in the measurement and interpretation of this risk is still evolving 
the corporation separately utilized outside sources to measure the effects of rising and declining rates on our mortgage backed securities portfolios  with respect to both market value and prepayment assumptions 
according to these sources  the market value of these securities would decrease by approximately with an average life extension of 
years  given a basis point rise in market rates  and increase by approximately with an average life decrease of years under a basis point decrease in market rates 
management believes that measurement of interest rate risk based on the one year impact on net interest income and the longer term effect on portfolio equity are complimentary  and should be used together to provide a more complete picture than would be provided by either perspective alone 
the measurement of liquidity is performed by monitoring ratios that indicate the level of liquid assets relative to liabilities  the dependence on potentially volatile funding sources  and the relationship of loans to deposits 
while relying on core deposit relationships as the basis of liquidity  increased loan demand over the year has resulted in the corporation seeking alternative sources of liquidity and utilizing existing sources to a higher level with established liquidity guidelines 
it is anticipated this trend will continue in to meet future liquidity needs  the corporation and its subsidiary banks have expanded funding sources  primarily with the federal home loan bank  and continue to seek other alternative funding sources 
effects of inflation over the past few years  the rate of inflation has been relatively mild 
however  because interest rates and the level of loans and deposits generally increase as the rate of inflation increases  the financial statements reflect these effects of inflation

additionally  a pre tax increase of million in loan loss provision was recorded during in order to cover net loan charge offs occurring in the fourth quarter and to maintain adequate reserve coverages 
net interest income continued to improve throughout  driven by a higher level of earning assets and a widening of basis points in the net interest margin 
during  the corporation s balance sheet was slightly asset sensitive which resulted in a favorable impact as a result of the rising interest rate environment through the year 
the higher level of service charges  fees and other income in was partially distorted by a pre tax thousand recovery from previous litigation settled on more favorable terms than anticipated for the corporation

in addition  during the commonwealth of virginia clarified its instructions related to the calculation of the virginia bank franchise tax

noninterest expenses were dramatically affected by this provision  as well as by legal and audit fees related to this matter 
as of february   all of these matters have been resolved and no additional provisions were required during salary and employee benefit expenses totaled million  a rise over year ago levels
