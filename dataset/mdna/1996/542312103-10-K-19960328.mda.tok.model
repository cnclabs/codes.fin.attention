item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview lst s revenues are derived from steel s two business segments oilfield products and services and industrial products 
products and markets 
the oilfield products business includes the manufacture and marketing of octg  the casing and tubing used in oil and gas well drilling and production  and line pipe that is used to gather and transport oil and gas from the well site to storage or refining facilities 
steel is one of the largest domestic producers and suppliers of octg  based on data compiled by the american iron steel institute 
octg represents three fourths of steel s oilfield products volume as measured in tonnage  and exports have ranged from approximately to of this segment s shipments during the last three years 
demand for oilfield products is generally affected by customers expectations of future oil and gas prices and political factors such as energy and trade policies 
a key indicator of domestic demand is the average number of drilling rigs operating in the united states which  during the last three years  has been historically low 
according to baker hughes  the average united states rig counts in   and were   and  respectively 
demand is also affected by the amount of oilfield products imported into this country as well as available industry inventories 
imported octg has represented approximately of the total supply in  down from in and in  the united states department of commerce prevailed in trade cases instituted against several foreign manufacturers alleging they were being illegally subsidized on the manufacture of tubular goods and were held to have dumped their products in the united states market  which resulted in the imposition of protective tariffs on imports from certain countries 
as a result of reduced import competition  the supply of imported octg in the united states is expected to remain comparable to lower levels experienced in the last half of for at least the next months 
the effect of available inventory  which is believed to be low  has been insignificant in the marketplace in the past three years 
the volatility of oil and gas prices creates uncertainty with respect to the timing and extent of increased activity in the energy sector 
this affects customer confidence in the longer term outlook for energy prices and as a result some drilling projects may be deferred 
however  international markets strengthened considerably in as long postponed exploration and production projects were started 
this trend is expected to continue in as companies engaged in exploration and production continue to seek large reserves in the international arena 
steel s industrial products segment includes two product groups specialty tubing and flat rolled steel 
specialty tubing consists of a wide array of high quality  custom made steel tubular products requiring critical tolerances  precise dimensional control  and special metallurgical properties 
these products are used in the further manufacture of automotive  construction  and other industrial equipment such as hydraulic cylinders  stabilizer tubes and intrusion devices  and machine parts 
steel s primary emphasis in the industrial products segment is the specialty tubing market 
specialty tubing is used in a wide range of industrial applications and demand is therefore sensitive to general economic conditions 
demand was down slightly in the second half of  however  steel has continued to identify new market applications which enabled it to increase both volume and price 
steel is one of the largest domestic producers of specialty tubing  based on shipment data compiled by the steel tube institute 
international shipments of specialty tubing were   and of shipments in   and  respectively 
steel s participation in the flat rolled steel commodity market is generally concentrated in the southwestern region of the united states and is affected by factors such as price  capacity utilization  and raw material costs 
flat rolled steel produced by steel either is further processed by steel in the manufacture of tubular products or shipped to customers for the manufacture of a variety of commercial and industrial products 
flat rolled steel is sold in highly competitive markets  with price and availability primarily determining customer purchase decisions 
manufacturing 
the manufacture of steel s products is capital intensive 
utilization rates are generally below capacity at steel s manufacturing facilities  and therefore  steel has downsized its operations over the past ten years  adjusting its cost structure to reflect current production levels 
however  there does exist excess capacity that may be used in the future as needed 
steel is also expanding its specialty tubing facilities  a product line that has been subject to production constraints 
the level of production volume through steel s various facilities has a significant effect on the cost of manufacturing 
key variable costs include costs of raw materials  including scrap steel  steel slabs  electricity  and natural gas 
as part of steel s overall capital outlays  lst and the minority shareholders of steel have agreed to fund up to million for a capital expenditure program during and included in the program is a significant expansion of steel s capacity to manufacture specialty tubing products 
the balance of the expenditures is being used to upgrade steel s capability to manufacture tubular products for use in the energy sector 
at the end of  million had been funded for this capital expenditure program 
results of operations consolidated revenues reported in the statements of earnings are as follows in millions oilfield products and services industrial products consolidated total compared with net revenues increased to million in from million in net revenues of oilfield products increased to in from million in shipment volumes and prices increased in from levels by and  respectively 
although the average domestic rig count declined to in from in  demand for steel s octg was favorably impacted due to the reduction in imported octg caused by the imposition of protective tariffs on imported products from certain countries in  and by the types of drilling being conducted  such as deep water drilling in the gulf of mexico  which increased the industry s requirements for larger diameter  higher grade products for which steel is most competitive 
export sales of oilfield products also increased in from as international markets strengthened from long postponed exploration and production projects that were started 
industrial products net revenues increased by to million in from million in this comprised a increase in specialty tubing net revenues and was partially offset by a reduction in flat rolled revenues 
for the specialty tubing product group  volume and price increased by and  respectively 
these increases are generally attributable to the improvement in the domestic general economy 
flat rolled shipments were down in volume  although a price increase of was realized for over gross earnings improved to million in from million in this was primarily attributable to increased shipments and prices of oilfield and specialty tubing products 
however  increases in raw materials  principally a increase in the cost of scrap steel and steel slabs  offset some of these margin improvements 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to lower legal and consulting fees 
interest income was million more in than in as short term interest rates were higher on the average in than in interest expense for increased to million from million in  reflecting higher interest rates in on steel s revolving credit facility 
other income  net 
net other income in of million included million from the gain on sale of approximately  acres of land in east texas 
net other income in was million and included million from the gain on sale of working interests in oil and gas properties 
net earnings and earnings from continuing operations for were both million  or earnings per share 
for  there was a loss from continuing operations of million  or loss per share 
after a million gain on sale of discontinued operations  net earnings in were million  and after a per share downward adjustment for the redemption of preferred stock  the amount available to common shareholders was a net loss per share 
compared with net revenues in total increased to million in from million in oilfield products and services revenues increased to in from million in both shipment volumes and prices were relatively flat compared with levels 
this corresponds with the domestic average rig count remaining relatively stable at in versus in industrial products net revenues increased to million in from million in this included a increase in specialty tubing net revenues  reduced by a decrease in flat rolled net revenues 
for the specialty tubing product group  volume increased and prices improved 
these increases were due to improvement in the domestic general economy 
flat rolled shipments were down in volume  although prices improved in over gross earnings increased to million in from million in this was due to an improvement in revenue levels and a better mix of higher margin products  but was offset by increased steel costs of in compared to selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in interest income in was million compared to million in and was due to earning a full year of interest on investments resulting from the sale of afb in november interest expense in increased to million from million in  primarily due to higher average borrowings under steel s revolving credit agreement 
other income  net 
net other income of million in primarily included nonrecurring gains on sales of steel s nonstrategic assets 
in  there were fewer sales of such assets 
net earnings for were million  which included a million gain on sale of discontinued operations 
the net loss for was million  which included million for earnings on and gain on sale of afb s discontinued operations  and an extraordinary charge of million to record steel s obligation under the coal industry retiree health benefit act of to fund medical and death benefits of assigned retirees and eligible dependents of the united mine workers of america 
on a per share basis  the loss from continuing operations was and per share for and  respectively 
after adjusting for discontinued operations  the extraordinary item  and the adjustment for the redemption of preferred stock  the net loss available to common shareholders was and per share for and  respectively 
prior to the sale  afb earned million 
as a result of recognizing only the million in proceeds received at the time of the sale  lst experienced a loss of million on the disposition that reduced the reported earnings from discontinued operations to million 
the remaining million in sale proceeds was placed in escrow to provide for possible future claims by gfb that are permitted under the sale agreement 
in  lst received million of the escrowed funds  and million remains in escrow subject to contested pending claims 
financial condition and liquidity lst has no direct business operations other than steel or significant sources of cash other than from short term investments or the sale of securities 
steel is restricted from paying cash dividends under terms of its revolving credit agreement  however  lst is reimbursed by steel for a portion of its operating costs as provided by its cost sharing agreement with steel 
in november  lst sold the stock of afb  one of its operating subsidiaries  to guaranty federal bank  fsb gfb 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been restated to reflect afb as a discontinued operation 
the sale price was million  of that  lst received million in cash on the date of the sale and million in november and million remains in escrow to pay for certain claims that may be made by gfb pursuant to the sale agreement 
to date  lst has not paid any claims  but approximately million in claims are pending 
at december   lst had available cash and short term investments of million 
steel has embarked on a capital expenditure program for the years through that is designed to increase the productive capacity for specialty tubing and make other improvements that will lower operating costs and improve the quality and precision of steel s production process 
as part of steel s overall capital outlays  in november  lst and certain minority shareholders of steel agreed to fund up to million for the capital expenditure program 
in october  the minority shareholders agreed to increase this funding up to million 
steel issues cumulative convertible preferred stock to its participating shareholders as funds are advanced to finance the program 
the steel preferred stock to be issued to lst and the other participating shareholders has a designated value equal to the amount of the funds advanced and pays quarterly dividends at the rate of per year 
the preferred stock is required to be redeemed by steel  unless earlier redeemed or converted  on january   in cash  at the designated value plus any unpaid dividends 
prior to redemption of the stock  dividends may be paid in cash  although currently prohibited by the terms of the revolving credit agreement  or in additional preferred shares  which is permitted 
to date  quarterly dividends have been paid in additional preferred shares 
these preferred shares are convertible into steel common stock prior to redemption at the rate of one share of common stock for each  of designated value subject to antidilution provisions 
in addition  as a result of an earlier unrelated transaction  lst holds warrants to purchase shares of steel common stock  and other steel shareholders hold warrants to purchase shares for  per share subject to antidilution provisions 
the warrants are exercisable at any time until december  steel presently has a total of  shares of common stock outstanding 
in november  lst purchased for million shares of steel from certain minority holders 
this increased lst s ownership percentage of steel to 
depending upon warrant exercises and preferred share conversions  this percentage could change 
lst periodically purchases steel slabs which are consigned to steel for use in its production process and thereby affords steel somewhat longer payment periods for this raw material 
steel pays lst as the slabs are used or within days  whichever occurs first 
this program s structure is consistent with those previously established with third parties 
during  lst s slab purchases amounted to approximately million 
it is currently anticipated that the remainder of the proceeds from the sale of afb will be used by lst for general corporate purposes  which could include further investment in steel or such other uses as may reasonably be determined by the board of directors to be in the best interest of lst and its shareholders 
lst believes it has and will continue to have adequate funds to meet its operating requirements 
steel requires capital primarily to fund general working capital needs and capital expenditures 
principal sources of funds include cash generated by operations  borrowings  and equity financing 
steel has a revolving credit agreement under which it can borrow the lesser of million or an amount based upon eligible accounts receivable and inventories that secure the borrowings 
the credit line will increase by million in march of each of the next three years 
at december   borrowings totaled million on an available borrowing base of million 
the interest rate on borrowings was prime plus which  at year end  was 
steel also pays a fee of on the unused portion of the credit facility 
the agreement  which extends to march  contains various restrictive covenants  including requirements to maintain minimum net worth levels and meet other financial ratios 
in march  steel also borrowed million at to be repaid in equal monthly installments through march steel believes that funds generated by operations  its borrowing capacity under the revolving credit agreement  and capital contributions from its shareholders will provide the liquidity necessary to fund its cash requirements during steel s defined benefit pension plans cover its bargaining unit employees 
at december   the projected benefit obligation exceeded the plans assets by million 
steel s annual pension expense  including amortization of the excess obligation  approximates million 
the coal industry retiree health benefit act of required steel to fund future medical and death benefits of certain umwa retirees and dependents 
an extraordinary charge of million  net of minority interest  was recognized in to reflect future payments which are assessed annually 
the payment amounted to approximately 
million  and the payment amounted to approximately million 
steel is making these payments under protest and has filed suit in federal district court 
steel s operations are subject to restrictive environmental compliance and permitting requirements of various governmental agencies that include the tnrcc and the epa 
steel has entered into specific agreements with these agencies to conduct numerous environmental studies and to develop plans to ensure continuous compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
steel believes that the cost of maintaining compliance with environmental requirements will fall within its contemplated operating and capital expenditure plans  averaging million annually in the foreseeable future
