currency fluctuations deterioration in economic conditions in venezuela resulted in significant devaluation of the country s currency during the first half of to a large extent  the company has been able to insulate its ongoing operations from currency exchange losses by matching the local currency component of contracts to the amount of operating costs transacted in local currency 
the company is continuing its efforts to maximize the us dollar component of its venezuelan contracts 
during the first two quarters of  the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar resulted in currency translation losses for the company 
these losses resulted principally from the translation of the net venezuelan monetary assets that is  essentially accounts receivable in excess of trade payables at devaluing exchange rates from month to month 
in the latter part of june  the venezuelan government imposed exchange control policies and established an official fixed exchange rate of bolivars per us dollar 
this official rate was maintained for the remainder of and during the first three quarters of accordingly  no currency translation losses resulted in those periods 
in december  the venezuelan government devalued its currency by revising the official exchange rate to venezuelan bolivars per us dollar 
the december devaluation did not result in the recognition of any material currency translation gain or loss by the company in its consolidated financial statements 
if the official rate is subsequently revised or a market exchange mechanism is re implemented so that the bolivar floats relative to the us dollar  the company could be susceptible to future translation losses with respect to its venezuelan operations 
the company intends to continue to monitor developments in this regard and to take such measures as may be practical to limit its exposure to currency translation losses in future periods
