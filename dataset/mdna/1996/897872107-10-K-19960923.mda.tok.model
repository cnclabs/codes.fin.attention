net sales were million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  from fiscal international net sales represented of net sales for fiscal  compared to for fiscal the results for fiscal are comprised of net sales of million from the truevision product line and million from the rasterops product line 
this compares with million an increase of in fiscal compared with fiscal of truevision revenues and million of rasterops revenues in fiscal the product mix change was due to a shift in the company s product focus 
during the latter part of the first quarter of fiscal the company began to separate and analyze its product lines in terms of truevision and rasterops products 
the truevision product line consists of all video and oem products  while the rasterops product line consisted of macintosh and pc graphics acceleration cards and monitors 
at that time  the company elected to terminate its entire pc graphics product line  reduce its dependency upon monitor sales and focus on its higher margin truevision desktop digital video product line 
during fiscal the company exited the monitor and graphics product lines completely 
the following table compares truevision and rasterops product line net sales for fiscal and in millions  except ratio data year year product line sales sales change truevision retail distribution oem rasterops total net sales sales of the truevision product line to the retail distribution channel during fiscal were million  or of net sales  compared to million  or  for fiscal the increase in the retail business was attributable primarily to an increase in units sold of the targa product family 
during fiscal  the company negotiated a three year oem agreement with avid  which accounted for of net sales for fiscal  compared to for fiscal the company s agreement with avid provides avid the right to manufacture certain truevision products rather than purchasing them from the company and avid will be required to pay related royalties 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  avid exercised that right with respect to the current products of the company that are used by avid 
because avid and the company negotiated a fully paid license for avid to manufacture the current products used by avid  which are not the company s most advanced product offering  the company does not expect to receive any further revenues or royalties resulting from avid s manufacture and use of such products 
this will have a negative impact on the company s net sales in future periods 
however  the company believes it should be able to offset this loss of revenue through growth in other oems and its retail distribution channel 
net sales for fiscal and included million and million  respectively  of revenues from license fees under product license agreements including the million avid product license buyout in fiscal discussed above and engineering services revenue from a product design and development agreement

the company  therefore  may incur increased research and development spending in future periods 
because of the inherent uncertainty of development projects  there can be no assurance that increased research and development efforts will result in successful product introductions or enable truevision to maintain or increase sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expense decreased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expense decreased to in fiscal compared with for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to expenses in fiscal related to increased reserves for bad debts attributable to two of the company s foreign distributors  lease terminations  and legal fees  which did not recur in fiscal in the absence of unusual circumstances or events  the company expects that selling  general and administrative spending as a percentage of net sales will remain relatively constant through fiscal other income expense  net

the company believes the demand reduction in graphics products was due primarily to intensified competition  particularly late in the first quarter  and apple s integration of graphics acceleration features into its macintosh computers and the monitor business was receiving increased competition with entry of apple and sony into this market 
the company s gross margins improved steadily during the last three quarters of fiscal as the company shifted its focus to developing  manufacturing and selling more high margin desktop video products and at the same time gradually exiting the low margin monitor business
