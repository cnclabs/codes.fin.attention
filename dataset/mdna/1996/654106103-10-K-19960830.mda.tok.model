during fiscal  the company continued to gain market share in united states footwear  in spite of a rather mature market 
industry sources expected only moderate market growth rates of to 
us apparel experienced significant revenue growth during a sluggish period for the industry and marketplace 
outside the us  the markets in which the company operates are less mature and offer tremendous potential for growth 
the company continues to invest in infrastructure and local marketing to capitalize on these opportunities and balance the strength of the global nike brand 
through its aggressive worldwide marketing efforts and global infrastructure spending  the company is positioning itself to continue to expand markets and gain market share on a worldwide basis 
the company experienced revenue growth in fiscal in all breakout categories see chart 
the most significant increase in absolute dollars was us footwear  which grew million  or  as a result of more pairs shipped and a increase in average selling price per pair 
men s basketball  women s fitness and men s training comprise approximately half of the us footwear category in terms of total revenues  and individually increased  and  respectively  over the prior year

us apparel increased million  or  experiencing growth in all categories and demonstrating the strength of the nike brand 
international non us brand revenues also increased significantly  growing million  or  as a result of increases of million and million in footwear and apparel  respectively  over the prior year 
international revenues were increased as a result of the foreign currency translation impact 
all nike regions outside the us experienced revenue increases greater than 
europe increased  asia pacific   and the americas  
the most significant increases were in japan  italy  united kingdom  korea and canada 
other brands which include cole haan r  tetra plastics  inc  sports specialties corp  and bauer inc formerly canstar sports inc 
increased million  or  over the prior year 
bauer  which was acquired at the end of the company s third quarter of the prior year  contributed million of the increase

men s basketball continued to dominate the category with revenues up for the year 
women s fitness grew  women s sport was up and outdoor increased over international brand revenues also increased significantly  growing million  or  as a result of a million increase in footwear revenues and a million increase in apparel 
international revenues were increased as a result of the foreign currency translation impact 
while european revenues remained relatively constant  in spite of decreases in france and germany  the asia pacific and americas regions were up substantially with and increases  respectively 
asia pacific growth was primarily a result of japan and korea  for which nike acquired the distribution operations in fiscal  while the americas region was up primarily as a result of argentina  also acquired in fiscal  and improved revenues in canada 
us apparel rebounded strongly in  up million  and other brands grew million  primarily due to the acquisition of bauer 
the breakdown of revenues follows in thousands year ended may  chg chg chg united states footwear    united states apparel    total united states    international footwear    international apparel    total international    other brands    total nike    gross margins were in fiscal compared to in and in gross margins remained strong in fiscal and  similar to  can be attributed to the high demand for nike products  internally controlled close out distribution  a solid inventory position along with strong inventory management  and the company s innovative advance futures order program 
the slight reduction in gross margins compared with was primarily driven by increased costs of air freight to meet delivery dates on increasing customer orders  and increased footwear product costs not fully recovered through the selling price 
these higher expenses were partially offset by improved apparel margins due to significant increases in revenues and a reduction in close outs as a percentage of total revenues 
total selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to as compared to in and in the reduction can be attributed primarily to the significant increase in revenues 
the increase in absolute dollars was million  or 
us operations increased million and international increased million  largely a result of increased sales and marketing spending as well as infrastructure to support growth outside the us bauer accounted for million of the increase 
the increase of million in over was attributed to the acquisition of formerly independent international operations and planned growth in international infrastructure 
the company intends to continue to invest in growth opportunities and worldwide marketing and advertising in order to ensure the successful sell through of the high level of orders discussed below 
interest expense increased million due primarily to the higher levels of short term borrowings needed to fund current operations 
in  average cash and equivalents were higher  as available cash was used to fund the acquisition of bauer 
interest expense during increased million over as a result of significant operational and investment cash needs financed with short term borrowings  lower net cash position compared with  and the reduction of long term debt with the repayment of million in long term notes which occurred at the beginning of fiscal other income expense rose million in expense over  primarily as a result of increased goodwill amortization from the acquisition of bauer  a reduction in interest income due to a net lower cash position compared with the prior year  and increased profit share expense due to increased earnings 
these were partially offset by the absence of non recurring specific obligations which occurred in the prior year related to the shutdown of certain facilities in conjunction with the consolidation of european warehouses 
in the prior year  other income expense rose million in expense over  primarily as a result of increased goodwill amortization and additional non recurring charges discussed above  offset partially by increased interest income resulting from higher interest rates and excess cash in the first half of the year 
the fiscal effective tax rate remained constant with at  and was in in  the rate was affected by a non recurring state tax credit offset by increased taxes on foreign earnings 
the decrease in compared with was primarily the result of lower taxes provided on non us earnings 
fiscal s effective tax rate increased due to the non us federal tax increase of  which was applied retroactively  and the company s subsequent implementation of financial accounting standards board statement  which required the application of the increase to deferred taxes 
this increase was partially offset by the company s decision to permanently reinvest more foreign earnings overseas  reducing tax expense by the us tax previously recognized 
the company anticipates the effective tax rate for fiscal to approximate the rate for worldwide futures and advance orders for nike brand athletic footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from june through november   were approximately billion  higher than such orders booked in the comparable period of the prior year 
these orders and the percentage growth in these orders are not necessarily indicative of the growth in revenues which the company will experience for the subsequent periods 
this is because the mix of advance futures and at once orders has shifted significantly toward futures orders as the nike brand became more established in all areas  specifically in the us apparel business and in international regions 
the mix of advance orders to at once orders will continue to vary as the us apparel business and international operations continue to account for a greater percentage of total revenues and place a greater emphasis on futures programs 
finally  exchange rates can cause differences in the comparisons 
since the company operates globally  it is exposed to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in order to minimize the effect of fluctuations on the company s foreign currency transactions  the company uses highly liquid foreign currency spot  forward and purchased options with high credit quality financial institutions 
the company only transacts foreign exchange contracts to hedge underlying economic exposures and does not transact in derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
where possible  the company nets its foreign exchange exposures to take advantage of natural offsets that occur in the normal course of business 
firmly committed transactions and the related receivables and payables may be hedged with forward exchange contracts or purchased options 
anticipated  but not yet firmly committed transactions  may be hedged through the use of purchased options 
additional information concerning the company s hedging activities is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
generally  a weaker us dollar in comparison to foreign currencies  will result in higher translation of operating results in these financial statements than would a stronger us dollar 
the net effect of translations on the results of operations was minimal while its effect on was favorable 
the company s international operations are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad  such as the imposition of import quotas or anti dumping duties 
in february   the eu commission  at the request of the european footwear manufacturers  initiated two anti dumping investigations covering certain footwear imported from the people s republic of china the prc  indonesia and thailand 
the investigations expressly exclude certain types of sports footwear as defined in the notices of initiation of anti dumping proceedings 
the company believes that most of its footwear sourced in the target countries for sale in the eu fits within these exclusions and  therefore  that it will not be materially affected by the results of these anti dumping investigations 
however  the above mentioned exclusions are subject to interpretation and or amendment by the eu customs authorities eg  as to the meaning of terms such as footwear designed for a sporting activity 
as of the end of the fiscal year  the company is unable to estimate the likelihood that the eu commission will ultimately impose anti dumping duties on any of the footwear covered by the investigations  or the amount of any such duties 
however  the most recent information obtained by the company concerning this matter suggests that provisional anti dumping measures will probably be imposed by late and that  in the case of china and indonesia  these may entail the imposition of substantial duties 
in the event that any of the company s footwear were deemed to not be covered by the above mentioned exclusions and hence  were affected by such duties  the company could consider  in addition to its possible legal remedies  shifting the production of such footwear to other countries in order to maintain competitive pricing 
the company believes that it is prepared to deal effectively with any such anti dumping measures that may arise and that any adverse impact would be of a short term nature 
the company continues to closely monitor international trade restrictions and to adopt its multi country sourcing strategy and contingency plans 
the company believes that its major competitors would be similarly impacted by any such restrictions 
as discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements  beginning in fiscal year  the company will eliminate the one month lag in reporting of certain international operations  in order to coincide with the consolidated fiscal year end 
this change will not have a material effect on the annual results of operations  however  quarterly results will change as certain reporting periods will shift one month 
the selected quarterly data section includes adjusted quarterly data as if the change had been in effect in fiscal years and liquidity and capital resources the company s financial position remains extremely strong at may  total assets grew over million to approximately billion and shareholder s equity increased million to approximately billion 
cash and equivalents increased million 
working capital increased million as a result of higher levels of all current assets  offset by increased notes payable  accounts payable  and accrued liabilities  primarily a result of the increases in operations 
the company s current ratio increased only slightly compared to may  inventory levels have increased million since may   primarily due to increases in us apparel and international inventories to support the high level of futures orders for the next quarter 
accounts receivable increased million due to the high level of fourth quarter revenues higher than the previous year 
prepaid expenses have increased million primarily due to advance payments relating to the july summer olympics 
net deferred tax assets increased by million from million at may  to million at may  the increase is primarily attributable to a reduction of million of deferred tax liabilities associated with undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries  and increases in deferred tax assets related to foreign loss carry forwards million  reserves and accrued liabilities million and deferred compensation million 
the change related to undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries is attributable to a net increase in unremitted foreign earnings from subsidiaries in higher taxed jurisdictions 
the increase in deferred tax assets related to foreign loss carry forwards is due to tax losses in certain individual jurisdictions incurred as a result of initial investments required to centralize the company s european operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further breakdown of the company s deferred tax balances 
other assets were also increased by prepayments on certain long term endorsement contracts 
current liabilities increased million  with the most significant increases occurring in accounts payable million and accrued liabilities million

during fiscal  the board of directors voted to extend the program until july  funding has  and is expected to continue to  come from operating cash flow in combination with occasional short or medium term borrowings
