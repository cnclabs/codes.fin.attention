the corporation believes that the growth in premiums written was due to marketing efforts  increased purchases of property reinsurance due to greater sensitivity to catastrophe exposures  the increase in insurance premiums written by medium and smaller sized primary companies that generally purchase relatively more reinsurance  the migration back to the united states of some insurance and reinsurance premiums that were being written in the london market  increased reinsurance cessions by primary companies as they seek to deleverage their capital in response to rating agency concerns and increased demand for reinsurance from better capitalized and more creditworthy reinsurers 
in  grc s net premiums written will be adversely affected by the nonrenewal of a treaty which accounted for approximately million of net premiums written 
the lost after tax investment income from nonrenewal of this contract is estimated to be less than million for for the general star operations  which principally write excess specialty insurance  net premiums written grew percent in due to increased marketing activities and improved rates for property business in the southeast 
general star has produced a statutory underwriting profit for eleven consecutive years 
the genesis operations provide direct excess insurance and reinsurance to companies with self insurance programs

since cologne re s results are reported on a quarter lag  the amounts include only nine months of activity for cologne re 
cologne re s results in  net of financing  opportunity costs and minority interest  contributed approximately million to the corporation s after tax income  excluding realized gains 
international net premiums written were  million in  compared with million in the premium growth is principally attributable to the inclusion of  million of cologne re s property casualty premiums beginning in the second quarter of in addition  the international property casualty growth reflects the continued expansion of existing and new client relationships 
in the second quarter of  the corporation s wholly owned european operations began to include estimated premiums and losses for the current underwriting year in its financial results 
this change increased net premiums written by approximately million and added approximately million to net income in income before taxes for the international property casualty operations of million in increased percent over levels 
included in these results were realized gains of million in growth in the income for the international property casualty operations resulted principally from an underwriting profit of million in  compared to an underwriting loss of million in underwriting results improved over due to stronger pricing and demand in higher margin businesses  particularly in the corporation s european operations 
international net premiums written of million in increased million  or percent  over premiums of million 
the premium growth reflects the continued expansion of existing client relationships  an increase in reinsurance rates  and the acquisition of new reinsurance relationships  particularly in european operations 
premium growth in also resulted from expanded operations in madrid and the opening of new offices in cologne  milan  paris and singapore during the prior two years 
cologne re on december   the corporation and colonia konzern ag colonia formed a new company that acquired percent of the ordinary shares and approximately percent of the preference shares of kolnische ruckversicherungs gesellschaft ag cologne re  which collectively represents a percent economic interest in cologne re 
in exchange for its cologne re shares  colonia  for itself and as trustee for nordstern allgemeine versicherungs ag collectively  ckag  received percent of the class a shares of the new company  gr ck 
the corporation initially contributed million dm  million to gr ck in exchange for percent of the class b shares of gr ck 
on december   gr ck paid million dm million to the corporation in exchange for notes in the principal amount of dm million 
the notes pay interest of percent annually to gr ck and are due on december  the intercompany notes have been eliminated in consolidation 
the funds invested in gr ck are subject to certain investment restrictions according to the joint venture agreement 
the class a shares have percent of the votes of gr ck and are entitled to an annual class a dividend  which is based on a formula and is subject to a minimum of approximately dm million  while the class b shares have percent of the votes of gr ck and are entitled to the earnings of gr ck in excess of the class a dividend

the option has a minimum exercise price of dm  million and a maximum of dm  million  subject to certain warranty and other adjustments that may affect the exercise price 
if the corporation does not exercise its option to purchase the class a shares of gr ck from ckag  ckag has the option to purchase the class b shares of gr ck from the corporation under a similar exercise price formula 
during the second quarter of  cologne re completed a rights offering that raised dm million million at the june  exchange rate  which increased its capital under united states generally accepted accounting principles by percent over the amount at december  in connection with cologne re s rights offering  gr ck subscribed for its pro rata share  approximately dm million million at the june  exchange rate  of the offering 
in addition to its ownership in cologne re through gr ck  the corporation purchased for its own account an additional percent of the ordinary and preference shares of cologne re during for aggregate consideration of million  which increased the corporation s consolidated economic interest in cologne re to percent 
life health due to the corporation s reporting of its international operations  including all of cologne re s business  on a quarter lag  the results include only three quarters of life health operations 
this segment includes the us and international life health operations of cologne re 
during the life health operations income before taxes and minority interest was million 
this consists of pretax income of million  million  and million in the second  third and fourth quarters  respectively 
pretax income during resulted from underwriting income of million  investment income of million and realized gains of million 
life health premiums written were million during approximately one half of this segment s premium was written in continental europe  another percent was written in the united states and the remaining percent was written throughout the rest of the world 
financial services the financial services operations include the corporation s derivative products  insurance brokerage and management  investment management  reinsurance brokerage and real estate management operations 
pretax income for the financial services operations was million in  an increase of percent from million earned in the increase in income was principally due to increased profitability of the corporation s derivative products subsidiary  general re financial products corporation grfp  and revenues from general re underwriting services limited grus 
grus provides underwriting services for tempest reinsurance company limited tempest  an affiliated bermuda based company specializing in excess property catastrophe reinsurance 
tempest is negotiating an exchange of shares of tempest for shares in ace limited  a bermuda insurer 
the transaction would be subject to approval by both companies boards of directors and shareholders 
if the transaction is consummated  the corporation would sell back to tempest its percent interest in tempest for cash consideration 
in addition  the underwriting services provided to tempest by grus would be terminated 
the financial effect of this transaction would be recorded in grfp is a dealer in derivative products and offers a full line of interest rate and cross currency swaps  options  and other derivative products 
grfp s gross trading revenue was million in  compared with million in and million in the growth in grfp s trading revenue for the year compared to was due to specialty products and growth in swap transactions outside of north america 
the overall growth in the derivatives market in the united states was slower than outside of the united states due to continuing concerns about controls over the inappropriate use of derivative products by certain end users 
grfp closely monitors its derivatives operations and actively manages its open positions to control its exposures 
grfp hedges its exposure to market risk which includes foreign exchange  interest rate  swap spread  volatility  correlation  and yield curve risks in connection with its dealer activities by purchasing or selling futures contracts  entering into forward foreign exchange contracts  purchasing or selling united states and foreign government securities or entering into offsetting transactions 
the corporation s insurance and reinsurance brokerage operations also contributed to the increased profitability of the financial services segment in in addition  the corporation has expanded its investment management services 
in august  the corporation acquired all of the outstanding stock of new england asset management in exchange for stock of the corporation and combined it with the corporation s own investment management subsidiary 
the resulting company  general re new england asset management  inc gr neam  provides investment management services primarily for other insurance companies that seek the corporation s expertise in managing insurance company investment portfolios 
gr neam has approximately insurance company clients and approximately billion of client assets under management at december  pretax income for the financial services operations was million in  an increase of percent from million earned in the increase in income was principally due to increased profitability of grfp and new revenues from grus 
financial condition assets investments at december   total assets were  million  compared with  million at december  the  million of growth in assets was attributable to an increase of  million in the total assets of the united states property casualty operations   million in the international reinsurance operations  and million in the financial services segment 
the growth in the assets of the united states property casualty operations was primarily due to the favorable bond and stock markets in and the investment of operating cash flows 
the increase in the assets of the international operations was due to the investment of operating cash flows and the strengthening of the german mark compared to the united states dollar which increased assets by approximately million 
the corporation s invested assets increased from  million at december  to  million at december  the  million increase in invested assets was the result of an increase of  million in the united states property casualty segment  an increase of  million in the international reinsurance operations and an increase of million in the financial services operations 
the unrealized appreciation after deferred income taxes on the corporation s investment portfolio was  million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the increase was due to the favorable effect on bond prices of declining interest rates and appreciation in the equity markets in the united states 
at december   all fixed maturity securities of the corporation have been categorized as either available for sale or trading 
most of the securities transferred to the available for sale category were tax exempt securities grandfathered under the tax reform act of that the corporation anticipates being called within the near future 
the recategorization of the held to maturity securities increased investments by million  and common stockholders equity by million 
united states property casualty invested assets the corporation s investment portfolios are managed for after tax total return while maintaining high credit quality across the portfolios 
at december   total invested assets of the united states property casualty operations were  million  a percent increase over invested assets 
the composition of the united states property casualty invested assets was as follows december short term securities unites states taxable bonds tax exempt bonds nondollar bonds convertible securities united states common equities foreign equities preferred equities other investments total throughout  the corporation continued to shift assets toward tax advantaged securities due to improved underwriting profitability and increased international profits 
furthermore  municipal bonds became attractive relative to taxable bonds for all but the shortest maturities as the spread between taxable and tax exempt bonds became historically narrow due to concerns about tax reform which could adversely affect tax exempt bonds 
the corporation also added to its preferred stock holdings in  since these securities were an attractive after tax alternative to municipal bonds 
to minimize its exposure to shifts in interest rates  the corporation balances the duration a present value weighted measure of average life of its property casualty claim liabilities with the duration of fixed maturity investments in the investment portfolio 
the table below shows the average maturity and effective duration of the united states taxable and tax exempt portfolios december average maturity in years taxable portfolio tax exempt nongrandfathered effective duration in years taxable portfolio tax exempt nongrandfathered bonds purchased after august  that do not remain fully tax exempt under the tax reform act of at december   the effective average maturity of the fixed maturity portfolio was years  compared to an estimated average life of years for the corporation s property casualty claim liabilities 
the duration of the fixed maturity portfolio was years  compared with years for the property casualty claim liabilities 
this compares with durations of years and years  respectively 
the increase in the duration of the corporation s liabilities at december  was principally due to the sharp decline in interest rates in and  to a lesser extent  due to the mix of premiums written 
of the increase in the duration of the portfolio assets  approximately two thirds was due to the decline in interest rates  with the rest accounted for by specific shifts in the portfolio during the year 
included in fixed maturity investments were mortgage backed securities mbs of million percent of consolidated invested assets and other asset backed securities abs of million percent of consolidated invested assets at december  these securities have interest and principal repayment patterns that differ from typical fixed maturities 
mbs issued by quasi federal agencies  federally supported institutions and corporations can either be direct pass throughs of cash flows from the underlying mortgages or can be a grouping of underlying mortgages into various principal repayment tranches  known as collateralized mortgage obligations cmos 
the mbs portfolio comprises pass through securities percent and cmos percent based on december  market values 
the cmo portfolio is composed of almost entirely planned amortization class pacs securities which have experienced less volatility in repayment of principal than other types of cmo securities 
abs are usually debt instruments which are collateralized by credit card or auto loan receivables whose interest and principal payments will vary with the underlying receivable 
almost all of the mbs and abs portfolios are publicly traded and market values were obtained from an external pricing service 
at december   equity investments in the united states portfolio totaled  million  representing percent of the united states property casualty investment portfolio 
the united states equity portfolio is well diversified and primarily consists of holdings in companies with large capitalizations that  collectively  have a calculated volatility approximating the standard poor s index 
a small portion of the united states investment portfolio was dedicated to nontraditional  private investments 
these alternative investments  included in the balance sheet caption  other invested assets  were million percent of consolidated invested assets and million percent of consolidated invested assets at december  and  respectively 
most of these investments are interests in limited partnerships run by professional managers 
over time  these investments are expected to provide a higher return than the overall portfolio 
this segment  however  also may entail a greater amount of risk both in terms of limited liquidity and greater uncertainty of returns compared to the rest of the corporation s portfolio 
the corporation evaluates the fair value of these alternative investments on a quarterly basis by reviewing available financial information of the investee and performing other financial analyses in consultation with external advisors 
any changes in the fair value of limited partnerships are included in unrealized appreciation or depreciation in common stockholders equity  unless a decline in fair value is considered other than temporary  resulting in a charge to income 
credit quality credit considerations are an important part of the corporation s fixed maturity investment strategy 
the overall fixed maturity portfolio continued to average a credit rating of aa 
the distribution of the corporation s united states property casualty fixed maturity portfolio by credit quality was as follows december  taxable tax exempt aaa aa a bbb below bbb nonrated total investment returns the overall pretax yield on the united states property casualty invested assets was percent in and during  the segment had approximately million of calls and maturities on grandfathered tax exempt bonds 
these bonds had an average yield of approximately percent and the proceeds from the calls were reinvested at an average yield of approximately percent 
in addition  based on its current investment portfolio and the current yield curve  the corporation presently anticipates additional calls and maturities of approximately million on grandfathered tax exempt bonds with an average yield of approximately percent through the end of reinvestment of these funds may adversely affect average portfolio yields and investment income 
pretax total return for the united states portfolio was percent in  compared with a negative return of percent in with lower interest rates and sharply higher stock prices  all investment sectors recorded higher returns in than in international property casualty and life health the corporation s international property casualty and life health reinsurance operations had invested assets of  million at december   an increase of  million from december  these portfolios include  million of cologne re s investments   million in wholly owned international operations investments and million of gr ck investments 
gr ck s investment portfolio consisted of high credit quality  german mark denominated securities with an average maturity of approximately years 
the composition of cologne re s investment portfolio was as follows december short term securities bonds common equities real estate and other investments total the primary goal of cologne re s investment policy is the optimization of after tax investment income taking into consideration the duration and currency structure of cologne re s reinsurance liabilities 
the investment objectives of cologne re s subsidiary companies are determined by specific investment guidelines which take into consideration the different legal requirements in their respective jurisdictions 
the investments of the subsidiaries are monitored and reviewed by cologne re s finance department 
at december   cologne re s invested assets were  million  an increase of  million  or percent from year end the fixed maturity portfolio consisted of high credit quality securities 
almost all bonds were investment grade  the average rating of the portfolio was above aa 
the common equity portfolio of cologne re was well diversified with holdings principally from the major european stock markets  united states  and japan 
the real estate portfolio was internationally diversified with principal holdings in germany 
the relatively high share of short term investments in cologne re s portfolio is due to the need to hedge investment crediting provisions in certain financial reinsurance contracts  a specific barbell bond strategy in and an unusually high volume of cash at the end of the reporting period 
as part of its foreign exchange risk management program  cologne re s investment portfolio is globally diversified  with most fixed maturities having a term less than five years 
the currency structure of the investment portfolio is determined by cologne re s reinsurance business 
cologne re hedges its currency risk by seeking to match its assets and liabilities by currency 
due to the high volatility and the significant movements in the currency markets during  cologne re remained relatively neutral in its currency exposures 
the composition of cologne re s invested assets by currency was as follows december  united states dollar german mark great britain pound french franc australian dollar japanese yen other currencies total the overall pretax yield on cologne re s portfolio was percent during cologne re writes a significant portion of its business in property lines of business and  accordingly  invests in shorter duration securities as part of its program to match its asset and liability durations 
in addition  cologne re s reported investment yield is decreased by the sharing of investment income under certain reinsurance agreements 
the invested assets of the corporation s wholly owned international subsidiaries of  million at december  consist of percent in fixed maturities  percent in equities and percent in short term investments 
the overall pretax yield on these operations was percent in and the portfolio of each subsidiary is managed by local professional asset managers who are overseen by a local board of directors and the corporation s investment department 
the portfolio is diversified by country of issuer and duration to match the currency and duration structure of the reinsurance operations 
the composition of the corporation s wholly owned international subsidiaries investment portfolio by currency was as follows december  great britain pound australian dollar united states dollar german mark french franc other currencies total liabilities the gross liability for claims and claim expenses  which provides for future obligations arising from current and prior property casualty reinsurance transactions  amounted to  million and  million at december  and  respectively 
growth in the liability of  million during was due to million in the united states property casualty segment and  million in the international property casualty segment 
in addition to the gross liability for property casualty claim and claim expenses  the corporation  through its interest in cologne re  had a gross liability for policy benefits for life health contracts of  million and  million at december  and  respectively 
the asset for reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid losses was  million at december   compared to  million at december  growth of million in the asset for reinsurance recoverable was due to million associated with the united states property casualty segment  million for the international property casualty operations and million related to the life health operations 
the ongoing financial integrity of the corporation is dependent on reserve adequacy 
the gross liability and reinsurance recoverable for claims and claim expenses were based on the corporation s analysis of reports and individual case estimates received from ceding companies 
the liability and related recoverables  which include an amount estimated by the corporation for claims and claim expenses incurred but not reported ibnr  are evaluated continuously by management  annually by the corporation s independent account ants in conjunction with their audit and periodically by independent consulting actuaries at the discretion of the board of directors 
any resulting adjustments are included in the current period s income 
the liability for claims and claim expenses for and prior accident years for the united states operations  net of related reinsurance recoveries  increased by million in the increase was principally the result of the net effect of reserve strengthening for environmental and latent injury claims  partly offset by favorable loss development on casualty lines of business 
the liability for prior accident years was decreased by million in and was increased by million during the adverse income impact in was the result of reserve strengthening principally for environmental and latent injury claims 
the liability for claims and claim expenses for and prior accident years for the international operations  net of related reinsurance recoveries and foreign exchange  increased by million in included in the corporation s liability for claims and claim expenses are liabilities for environmental and latent injury damage claims 
these claims are principally related to claims arising from cleanup costs associated with hazardous waste sites and bodily injury claims relating to asbestos products 
these amounts include provisions for both reported and ibnr claims 
the table below presents the three year development of the balance sheet liability for environmental and latent injury claims in millions gross liability  beginning of year    reinsurance recoverable liability  net of reinsurance  beginning of year  amount incurred during year less amount paid during year cologne re first included in december  balance sheet liability  net of reinsurance  end of year   reinsurance recoverable gross liability  end of year    the corporation continually estimates its liabilities and related reinsurance recoverable for environmental and latent injury claims and claim expenses 
while most of the corporation s liabilities for such claims arise from exposures in the united states  the corporation has also provided for international environmental and latent injury exposures 
environmental and latent injury exposures do not lend themselves to traditional methods of loss development determination and therefore may be considered less reliable than reserves for standard lines of business eg  automobile 
the estimate is composed of four parts known claims  development on known claims  ibnr and direct excess coverage litigation expenses 
although reliability is constrained by uncertainties  the corporation has confidence in the reported  known claim liabilities and  based on alternative methods  has projected a fairly reliable estimate of development for these claims 
the corporation has also included an estimate for ibnr which is based on fitted curves of estimated future claim emergence  this estimate is less reliable than the estimated liability for reported claims 
the effect of joint and several liability on the severity of claims and a provision for future claims inflation have been included in the loss development estimate 
the corporation has established a liability for litigation costs associated with coverage disputes arising out of direct excess insurance policies rather than from reinsurance assumed 
certain subsidiaries were parties in active direct excess coverage cases involving environmental and latent injury claims at december  such coverage litigation expenses are estimated using an actuarial estimate of actionable items and their projected costs 
the corporation paid million in such costs during  and as of december   the liability for future litigation costs related to coverage disputes for environmental and latent injury claims was million included in the table above 
as coverage disputes are tried and verdicts rendered  the corporation expects that the settled case law will result in a downward trend in future direct excess litigation expenses 
because reinsurance contracts generally contain arbitration clauses which control disputes between the ceding company and the reinsurer  the corporation does not expect the future costs associated with reinsurance disputes to be material 
comprehensive environmental laws have been enacted in most european countries  generally imposing sanctions in the form of fines  cleanup costs or civil damage awards 
to date  insureds in europe have generally not recovered the costs from insurers arising from environmental cleanup except those claims considered sudden and accidental 
changes in environmental regulations and litigation practices within the european union may affect future claim development 
ceding companies report information about environmental and latent injury claims based upon their individual and differing methodologies for characterizing claims 
for example  some ceding companies report one claim for a policyholder with a number of exposure sites  whereas others report each exposure at each site as a separate claim 
in addition  a substantial number of latent injury claims  which are often reported to the corporation on a precautionary basis by the ceding companies and insureds prior to reaching the reinsured layer  close without reinsurance payment 
due to these factors  the corporation is unable to provide meaningful claim count information 
the liability for environmental and latent injury claims and claim expenses is management s best estimate of future claim and claim expense payments and recoveries which are expected to develop over the next several decades 
the corporation continues to monitor evolving case law and its effect on environmental and latent injury claims 
changing government regulations  newly identified toxins  newly reported claims  new theories of liability  new contract interpretations and other factors could significantly affect future claim development 
while the corporation has recorded its current best estimate of its liabilities for unpaid claims and claim expenses  it is reasonably possible that these estimated liabilities  net of estimated reinsurance recoveries  may increase in the future and that the increase may be material to the corporation s results from operations  cash flows and financial position 
it is not possible to estimate reliably the amount of additional net loss  or the range of net loss  that is reasonably possible 
the corporation discounts certain liabilities associated with workers compensation claims 
current statutory rules allow the discounting of tabular reserves as defined and allow discounting of nontabular reserves if permitted by the insurer s state of domicile 
as of december   grc recorded  million in claim liability discount  of which million relates to tabular reserves and million relates to nontabular reserves for medical costs associated with tabular reserve claims 
the delaware insurance department has confirmed that grc may discount both its tabular reserves and the medical expenses associated with such tabular reserves at percent per year 
financial services assets and liabilities the asset and liability positions of the financial services operations fluctuate based on ongoing derivatives transactions and related risk management activities 
the purchase of united states and foreign government securities fixed maturities at fair value  which are primarily financed through collateralized repurchase agreements securities sold under agreements to repurchase  and the sale of united states and foreign government securities securities sold but not yet purchased  whose proceeds are invested in reverse repurchase agreements securities purchased under agreements to resell  contribute to the short term fluctuations in the operations total assets and liabilities  while generally not having any material effect on common stockholders equity 
during  invested assets of these operations increased million to  million 
securities purchased under agreements to resell an asset declined million in to million 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase a liability increased million in to  million 
securities sold but not yet purchased represent obligations of the corporation to deliver the specified security at the contracted price  thereby creating a liability to repurchase the security in the market at prevailing prices 
accordingly  the corporation s ultimate obligation to satisfy the sale of securities sold but not yet purchased may exceed the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
the liability for securities sold but not yet purchased decreased million in to million at december  grfp controls its market risk exposures through the use of cash instruments and derivative transactions 
grfp s components of market risk include foreign exchange  interest rate  swap spread  volatility  correlation and yield curve risk 
grfp controls these risk exposures by taking offsetting positions in either cash instruments or other derivatives to reduce the overall exposure to loss due to movements in these variables 
grfp manages its exposures on a portfolio basis 
under this approach  grfp monitors its market risk on a daily basis across all swap and option products by calculating the effect on operating results of potential changes in market variables over a one week period  based on historical market volatility data and informed judgment 
grfp s aggregate weekly market risk limit across all trading books was million 
grfp sets market risk limits for each type of risk based on a percent probability that movements in market rates will not affect the results from operations in excess of the limit over a one week period 
since inception  grfp s largest consolidated weekly position change has been million 
in addition to these daily and weekly assessments of risk  grfp prepares periodic stress tests to assess its exposure to extreme movements in various market risk factors 
the value at risk table below shows the aggregate risk management limit  as defined  and highest and lowest profits and losses recorded over one week periods 
years ended december  in millions risk limit usage average profit and loss highest lowest average grfp evaluates and records a fair value adjustment against trading revenue to recognize counterparty credit exposure and future costs associated with administering each contract 
the expected credit exposure for each trade is initially established on the trade date and is determined through the use of a proprietary credit exposure model that is based on historical default probabilities  market volatilities and  if applicable  the legal right of setoff 
these exposures are continually monitored and adjusted due to changes in the credit quality of the counterparty  changes in interest and currency rates or changes in other factors affecting credit exposure 
the fair value allowance for counterparty credit exposures and future administrative costs on existing contracts was million and million at december  and  respectively 
grfp has not experienced any credit losses as a result of counterparty defaults 
equity common stockholders equity at december  was  million  an increase of percent over  million at december  the change in common stockholders equity was primarily due to net income of million  after tax unrealized appreciation of  million  less stock repurchases of million and dividends paid of million 
common stockholders equity at december  increased percent over the  million at year end liquidity and capital resources a summary of the corporation s cash flow by business segment was as follows years ended december  in millions operating activities united states property casualty international property casualty and life health financial services consolidated operating cash flow   investing activities united states property casualty international property casualty and life health financial services net purchase of shares in gr ck cash obtained on purchase of gr ck consolidated investing cash flow  financing activities united states property casualty international property casualty financial services consolidated financing cash flow consolidated change in cash the corporation s cash flow from operations was  million in  compared with  million in  and million in in the corporation s prior years financial statements  grfp s interrelated cash flows were disaggregated for financial reporting purposes into operating  investing  and financing activities 
in  all of grfp s trading related cash flows have been included in operating cash flow to improve the meaningfulness of the cash flow presentation
