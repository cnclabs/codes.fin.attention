the company takes a proactive approach in addressing the applicability of these laws and regulations as they relate to its manufacturing operations and in proposing and implementing any remedial plans that may be necessary 
the company has identified certain situations that will require future capital and non capital expenditures to maintain or improve compliance with current environmental laws and regulations as well as to support planned future expansion 
the majority of the identified situations are found at the company s largest manufacturing facilities and primarily deal with groundwater remediation  quality of air emissions and wastewater treatment processes 
the company s policy is to accrue environmental remediation costs when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
while it is often difficult to reasonably quantify future environmental related expenditures  the company currently estimates its future non capital expenditures related to environmental matters to range between million and million 
in connection with these expenditures  the company has accrued million at december  representing management s best estimate of probable non capital environmental expenditures

the measurement of liability is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual situation and takes into consideration factors such as existing technology  presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites 
as assessments and remediation progress at individual sites  these liabilities are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information which becomes available 
the company believes it is either in material compliance with all currently applicable regulations or is operating in accordance with the appropriate variances and compliance schedules or similar arrangements 
actual costs to be incurred for identified situations in future periods may vary from the estimates  given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures due to unknown conditions  changing government regulations and legal standards regarding liability and evolving related technologies

the company s long term capital investment program includes approximately million in planned expenditures in the exact amount and timing of the capital spending is difficult to predict since certain projects may extend into or beyond depending upon equipment delivery and construction schedules
