fiscal and special charges to facilitate year to year comparisons  the following table details the impact of the jewelry liquidation commenced in the fourth fiscal quarter  the pretax special charges of million for fiscal  and the pretax special charge of million for fiscal these special charges are more fully discussed below and in note n of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
fiscal fiscal fiscal millions millions millions revenues merchandise sales pawn service charges total revenue cost of goods sold net revenue operating expenses operations administrative depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income loss during fiscal  the company sold on a wholesale basis or scrapped million of jewelry which had been identified as excess and written down to its net realizable value during its fourth fiscal quarter 
these sales and their related cost are included in merchandise sales and cost of goods sold 
due to the earlier write down  these sales had no effect on income for fiscal in the fourth fiscal quarter  the company identified and commenced the liquidation of approximately million in jewelry inventory which had accumulated primarily as a result of a million new jewelry program undertaken in prior periods and as a result of past lending practices  which have since been modified 
during this quarter the company sold approximately million of this jewelry included in cost of goods sold for million included in merchandise sales 
largely as a result of this scrapping activity  the company increased its valuation reserve by million included in cost of goods sold 
in addition  the company provided million for the closing and consolidating of thirty two stores including the write down of various tangible and intangible assets included in operations expense and provided million for several legal matters included in administrative expense 
in fiscal  a million charge was made for inventory valuation  consisting of million in markdowns on merchandise sold through a company wide clearance sale and a million increase in the inventory valuation reserve million included in merchandise sales  million included in cost of goods sold  and million included in operations expense 
during fiscal  the company implemented a newly developed computer software program to calculate accrued pawn service charges on a loan by loan basis 
previously this accrual was based on a store by store calculation using pawn service charge collections  loan principal payments and other information available to management 
the difference in these two methods amounted to a million reduction in accrued pawn service charges included in pawn service charges 
while it is impractical to assign this amount to specific prior periods  management believes that most of the difference is attributable to the fiscal period 
the fiscal special charge included million primarily for a pending wage and hour investigation and organizational changes million in operations expense and million in administrative expense 
results of operations the company s primary activity is the making of small  non recourse loans secured by tangible personal property 
the income earned on this activity is pawn service charge revenue 
for fiscal  pawn service charge revenue decreased million from fiscal to million 
a decline in same store pawn service charge revenue million and the loss of pawn service charge revenue of the closed stores million were partially offset by new stores not open the full month period million 
the million same store pawn service charge decline is the net result of lower average loan balances in stores open the full twelve month period million pawn service charge revenue impact offset by annualized yield improvement on the pawn loan portfolio of five percentage points to million 
at september   same store pawn loan balances were below september  for fiscal  pawn service charge revenue increased million from fiscal to million 
an increase in same store pawn service charge revenue million and pawn service charge revenue from newly established stores million resulted in the year over year increase 
annualized yield on the pawn loan portfolio increased to in fiscal from in fiscal as a result of a managed shift in the loan portfolio to higher yielding loans 
a secondary  but related  activity of the company is the sale of merchandise  primarily collateral forfeited from its lending activity 
for fiscal  merchandise sales decreased approximately million from fiscal to approximately million 
a decline in same store merchandise sales million  merchandise sales of the closed stores million  and the decrease in amount of sales associated with the special inventory liquidation discussed above million were offset by new store sales million 
same store sales for fiscal declined two percent from fiscal primarily as a result of lower inventory levels per store  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal 
for fiscal  merchandise sales increased million from fiscal to million 
new store sales million and the effect of the special charges discussed above million were offset by the decline in same store merchandise sales million 
same store sales for fiscal declined nine percent from fiscal in fiscal  the company sold a substantial amount of new jewelry  and federal legislation the brady bill increased demand for hand guns 
these two activities and higher inventory levels per store  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal created a higher level of sales in fiscal compared to fiscal for fiscal  gross profits as a percentage of merchandise sales increased percentage points from fiscal to 
excluding the impact of the special charges discussed above  gross profits as a percentage of merchandise sales decreased two percentage points from fiscal to 
this decrease results from a decline in margins on merchandise sales six percentage points offset by the combined favorable effect of a reduction in inventory shrinkage measured as a percentage of merchandise sales down three percentage points to approximately two percent and improved gross profit on the sale of scrap jewelry one percentage point 
the lower merchandise sales margins result primarily from management s strategy of pricing merchandise based on  among other factors  merchandise age since acquired and forfeited 
for fiscal  gross profits as a percentage of merchandise sales decreased percentage points from fiscal to two percent 
excluding the impact of the special charges discussed above  gross profits as a percentage of merchandise sales decreased four percentage points from fiscal to 
this decrease results from a decline in margins on merchandise sales seven percentage points offset by the favorable effect of improved gross profit on the sale of scrap jewelry three percentage points 
in fiscal  the company had a higher level of new merchandise or merchandise purchased over the counter which typically sold for a higher margin 
management believes that sales of this purchased merchandise came at the expense of the sales of forfeited collateral 
the company s gross margin level gross profit as a percentage of merchandise sales results from  among other factors  the composition  quality and age of its inventory 
at september  and the company s inventories consisted of approximately and jewelry eg  ladies and men s rings  chains  bracelets  etc 
and and general merchandise eg  televisions  vcrs  tools  sporting goods  musical instruments  firearms  etc at september  and  approximately and of the jewelry inventory was less than twelve months old based on the company s date of acquisition date of forfeiture for collateral or date of purchase as was approximately and of the general merchandise inventory 
in fiscal  operating and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased five and two percentage points  respectively two and one percentage points  excluding the effect of the special charges discussed above from fiscal to and 
in fiscal  operating and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were and  respectively and excluding the special charges 
both operating and administrative expenses have declined relative to total revenues as a result of the closure of under performing stores and the company s programs to reduce costs 
depreciation and amortization expense increased year over year from fiscal to fiscal largely as a result of the higher level of depreciation on new stores opened since september  in  the company revised the estimated useful lives of leasehold improvements resulting in increased depreciation expense of million 
in fiscal  depreciation and amortization expense increases were partially offset by the effect of stores that were closed 
interest expense in fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal largely as a result of decreased borrowings under the company s bank line of credit 
income tax expense for fiscal was million of pretax income compared to a tax benefit of million for fiscal resulting from the fiscal net operating loss 
net income for fiscal was million compared to a net loss million for fiscal the improvement in net income results from the net year over year favorable effect of the special charges discussed above  the favorable operating impact of the store closings  and the favorable impact of lower inventory shrinkage  operating and administrative expenses  and interest expense 
these favorable factors were offset partially by the effect of lower revenues and margins in fiscal liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was million compared to million provided in fiscal and million used in fiscal improved operating results and inventory reductions were the main factors in the improved cash generation from operating activities 
a portion of the fiscal operating cash flow is the result of income tax refunds from the carryback of the company s fiscal net operating loss and the lower level of taxes payable resulting from the carryforward of this net operating loss 
in fiscal  the million from operating activities  million provided from investing activities million decrease in investments in pawn loans  million from sale of assets  and million invested in property  plant and equipment  and million of the company s beginning cash balances were used to reduce total bank borrowings by million 
in fiscal  the company invested million to open newly established stores  to remodel or relocate existing stores  and to upgrade or replace existing equipment and computer systems 
the company funded these expenditures largely from cash flow provided by operating activities 
the company plans to open approximately to new stores and remodel to stores in the next twelve months 
the company anticipates that cash flow from operations and funds available under its existing bank line of credit should be adequate to fund these capital expenditures and expected pawn loan growth during the coming year 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s cash flow and line of credit will provide adequate funds for these expenditures 
the company s current revolving line of credit agreement  which matures january   requires  among other things  that the company meet certain financial covenants and provide the bank group a first lien security interest in certain assets of the company 
borrowings under the line bear interest at the bank s eurodollar rate plus one and one half percent 
the amount which the company can borrow is based on a percentage of its inventory levels and outstanding pawn loan balance  up to million 
at september   the company had million outstanding on the credit facility and additional borrowing capacity of approximately million 
seasonality historically  pawn service charge revenues are highest in the company s fiscal fourth quarter july  august and september due to higher loan demand during the summer months and merchandise sales are highest in the company s fiscal first quarter october  november and december due to the holiday season
