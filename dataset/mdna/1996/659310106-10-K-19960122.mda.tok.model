item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the trust is a passive fixed investment trust which holds overriding royalty rights  receives income under those rights from certain operating companies  pays its expenses and distributes the remaining net funds to its unit owners 
the trust is not involved in any business or extractive operations of any kind in the areas over which it holds royalty rights and is precluded from any such involvement by the trust agreement 
there are no requirements  therefore  for capital resources with which to make capital expenditures or investments in order to continue the receipt of royalty revenues by the trust 
the trust does not conduct any active business operations and has only limited need of funds for its own administrative services 
these funds are used to pay trustees fees computed under the trust agreement and based upon a percentage of royalties received  the remuneration fixed by the trustees for the managing trustee and the managing director  professional fees paid to consultants  legal advisors and auditors  transfer agent fees  and secretarial and other general office expenses 
another requirement for funds by the trust relates to the occasional necessity of making lump sum payments of arrearages of dividends of a corporate predecessor and distributions previously declared by the trust 
such payments are required when owners of shares of stock in predecessor corporate entities  who have not previously presented their shares for conversion to units of beneficial interest in the trust  make such a presentation or furnish properly documented affidavits of loss and obtain an unlimited  open penalty bond 
as indicated in note to the financial statements  if presentation were made with respect to all predecessor corporate shares which have not been previously presented  a total of  would be required for arrearage payments 
depending on the number of such shares presented or claims filed  payment of such arrearages would likely require a reduction or deferral of distributions which otherwise would be made on presently outstanding units 
the trust has no means of assuring continued income from overriding royalty rights at their present level or otherwise 
economic and political factors which are not foreseeable may have an impact on trust income 
the effect of changing economic conditions on the demand for energy throughout the world and future prices of oil and gas cannot be accurately projected 
the relatively small amounts required for administrative expenses of the trust limit the possible effect of inflation on its financial prospects 
continued price inflation would be reflected in sales prices  which  with sales volumes  form the basis on which the royalties paid to the trust are computed 
in addition  fluctuations in the mark dollar exchange rate have an impact on domestic energy prices within germany and on the amount of dollars received upon conversion 
the impact of inflation or deflation on energy prices in germany is delayed by the use in certain long term gas sales contracts of a deferred trailing average related to light fuel oil prices 
fiscal versus fiscal for fiscal the trust s royalty income of  was higher than the previous year 
a combination of increased sales from the higher royalty area of western oldenburg and a strong deutsche mark yielded the increased royalties 
in contrast to the prior year  when the partial shutdown of the grossenkneten desulfurization plant significantly affected the amount of royalties received in the third and fourth quarters  no such unusual or extended interruption of production occurred during fiscal since last year s partial shutdown affected production of saleable gas from the higher royalty western portion of oldenburg to a greater degree  in the increase in production and sales was slanted toward gas from the west 
total gas sales of billion cubic feet from the higher royalty western area increased by while gas sales of billion cubic feet for all of oldenburg only increased by 
in addition  the continued strength of the deutsche mark throughout the year contributed to the amount of dollars received by the trust upon the transfer of funds from germany 
for the year  the average value of the deutsche mark increased from cents to cents  an improvement of 
while gas prices  which averaged pfennigs per kwh  declined somewhat from the prior year and for western and overall oldenburg respectively  the negative effect of that decline was easily offset by the increases in sales and exchange rates 
there have been no payments under the mobil sulfur royalty  since the most recent sulfur price of dm per metric ton is well below the threshold for the resumption of royalty payments 
the world sulfur situation looks to deteriorate further as a result of world wide over supply and continued increases in the removal of sulfur from petroleum products for environmental compliance 
trust expenses of  showed a decrease of nearly  reflecting a reduction in legal expenses as well as the absence of audit expenses in the off year of the biennial audit cycle of the operating companies in germany 
the increase in interest income to  reflects both the increase of funds available for investment as well as somewhat higher rates available through the exclusive use of treasury bills for short term investments 
during fiscal and respectively  an additional  and  trust units were issued and  and  were paid to former unlocated shareholders of north european oil corporation and north european oil company who presented shares for exchange or filed properly documented affidavits of loss and obtained an unlimited  open penalty indemnity bond 
fiscal versus fiscal for fiscal the trust s total royalty income of  was lowerthan the previous year 
there are four primary factors that affect the level of royalties the amount of gas sales  the gas prices  the geographic source of sales and the exchange rates 
this year  as in last year  a fifth factor of business interruption was added 
the year commenced on a strong note with both the first and second quarters showing increases in all factors except for exchange rates when compared to the prior year s quarter 
during the third and fourth quarters all the factors affecting royalties reversed themselves 
where previously the amount of gas sales  gas prices and geographic source of sales showed increases  they now showed declines 
the previous declines in exchange rates now showed increases 
the basis for this reversal was the fifth factor of business interruption  which involved an extended shutdown at the grossenkneten desulfurization plant from april to july  during this shutdown  production was reduced to between one third and two thirds of normal levels 
the rationale behind the shutdown was three fold conduct normal annual maintenance  install additional tail gas clean up units to address lingering environmental concerns and overhaul and update control system for the entire plant 
the effects of this shutdown on the trust s royalty stream and subsequent distributions were significant 
the first six months of fiscal showed distributions of cents per unit compared to cents per unit for fiscal  an increase of 
the final six months of fiscal showed distributions of cents per unit compared to cents per unit for fiscal  a decrease of 
in average for the year the four factors affecting royalties showed decreases or were unchanged 
under the higher royalty agreement with mobil covering sales of gas from western oldenburg  sales declined by  prices and exchange rates were unchanged 
because the combined royalty rate in effect on these sales is seven times greater than the royalty in effect on sales from eastern oldenburg  any decline in sales from the west has an exaggerated effect on trust royalties 
under the lower royalty agreement covering the entire oldenburg area  sales declined by  gas prices by and the exchange rate by 
despite the improvement in sulfur prices from in the first quarter to per metric ton in the fourth quarter  the threshold level for the resumption of royalties under the agreement with mobil has not been reached 
until the overabundance of sulfur on the world market is reduced  the trust will receive only minor amounts of royalties from sulfur 
trust expenses showed an increase of nearly reflecting increased legal expenses relating to escheat matters 
interest income increased slightly  despite the reduced amount of funds available  because of the gradually increasing interest rates in effect 
during fiscal and  respectively  an additional  and  trust units were issued and  and  were paid to former unlocated shareholders of north european oil corporation and north european oil company who presented shares for exchange or filed properly documented affidavits of loss and obtained an unlimited  open penalty indemnity bond
