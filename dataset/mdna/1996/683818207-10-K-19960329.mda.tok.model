item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition due to the nature of the company s business  the key components of its financial condition constitute receivables  inventory  fixed assets  accounts payable  and debt 
trends of key financial indicators show a change in corporate net worth to  for compared to  in and  in the current ratio for decreased to from in and in billed accounts receivable at year end was  compared to  in  and  in the days outstanding in accounts receivable averaged days in  days in and days in bad debt write offs represent less than of one percent of the total yearly revenues 
the low level of bad debts is due partly to the percentage of business the company does with the us government and fortune companies 
the company also uses a careful screening process and performs credit qualification of customers before accepting their orders 
for any new account  credit checks are always conducted  and questionable situations are either placed on a cod or a letter of credit basis 
accounts receivable are closely monitored  those that are delinquent are continuously contacted until payment is received 
the overall composition of the inventory has changed somewhat over the last three years as shown in the following chart inventory composition production materials    work in process    finished goods    total    one of the tools the company uses for trend analysis is a comparison of our inventory levels to total sales 
in  this level was compared to in and in the value of the raw material and work in process inventory remained stable in compared to although our objective is to reduce inventory levels as much as possible  the value of finished goods inventory was increased substantially in to provide products available from stock 
this action was taken to meet competitive pressures as customers are demanding shorter product delivery times 
we will attempt to reduce the amount of raw material inventory to partially offset the higher level of finished goods inventory 
the company believes that its reserve for inventory obsolescence is adequate to properly value any excess quantities of this inventory 
fixed asset additions were  in   in  and  in capital expenditures of  are planned in for test and manufacturing equipment to lower the direct cost of manufacturing our products 
results of operations combined revenues were less than both and results 
a loss of  which represented of revenue for  compares to a profit of for  and for communication products division cpd communication products division revenues decreased by from revenues and resulted in an operating loss of  compared to a profit of  in increased competition has forced the company to significantly increase sales discounts offered to customers on many products  and the requirement to increase the volume of product shipments to achieve a slightly lower total revenue compared to led to severely lower margins and the corresponding loss 
the company has instituted a program of implementing product designs specifically intended to be produced by automatic assembly processes to minimize direct costs  also  a modification of our sales commission policy was initiated to motivate the internal and external sales staff to achieve sales at higher margins 
cost of sales in  direct cpd costs in relation to sales increased by 
the increase is attributed to growing competition forcing us to lower our prices 
however  the cost to produce products continued to decrease due to the investment in automated manufacturing facilities 
as more of our product designs evolve toward automated assembly  our ability to successfully compete at lower sale prices will improve 
as stated previously  direct costs as a percent of revenue increased in while overhead as a percent of revenue remained constant 
cost comparison cost of sales    gross sales    cost as a percent of revenue the cpd division is an engineering driven producer of fiber optic equipment 
few of its products have a long lifetime 
this means new products are being developed and released to production constantly  which leads to high initial production costs and low margins at product introduction 
due to the degree of difficulty in proceeding from a design phase to a production phase in a relatively short time frame  the company has  in many instances  been forced to perform engineering through the production phase of the initial part of the product life cycle 
direct costs versus sales direct costs    percent of sales overhead and g a absolute overhead costs fell in by  although as a percent of revenue  they were unchanged because revenue was lower than the company believes that some additional increases in sales can be attained at the current level of fixed costs 
included below is a comparison of overhead costs for the past three years cost comparison overhead costs    overhead costs as a percent of revenue applied overhead applied overhead allocates costs in overhead to a final product 
the company uses a computation method in which overhead costs are divided by direct labor costs 
this establishes the percent of overhead costs to be applied to the final product 
examples of these costs include rent  utilities  telephone  inventory variances  and depreciation of production capital equipment costs 
applied overhead amounts for the past three years were  in   in and  in inventory write offs direct inventory write offs increased in to  compared to  in and  in generally  these write offs are due to engineering changes which result in obsolete raw materials and subassemblies used on products we no longer intend to sell 
in  a write off for  was taken to recognize the lack of additional business in our satellite down link market 
as previously mentioned  our major customer for this equipment discontinued planned installations when their shopping mall customer underwent downsizing 
although we make every attempt to minimize obsolete inventory  the rapid engineering evolution of our product line and the changes in our product mix makes some obsolescence unavoidable 
g a general and administrative costs consist primarily of expenses related to sales  marketing and engineering activities 
commercial product engineering development costs have remained constant  reflecting stable staff size and workload 
during  development focused on additions to the product line for highway traffic monitoring equipment 
also  a new effort to develop video technology was initiated  which will result in new product introductions in the three year record of these engineering costs exclusive of fringe is  in   in  and  in early in  the company implemented changes to the sales and marketing staff to more closely align the technical aspects of the selling process with customer requirements 
this led to a reorganization of these departments and establishment of a customer support activity 
the costs of this effort  additional advertising and trade show costs  and commission payments to the sales representative firms we have appointed during are reflected in the increased g a expenses for this year  which were  prior year costs were  in and  in research and development division r d research and development division revenues decreased compared to the decrease in revenue was caused by termination of work on a contract from litton guidance and control systems 
this contract was terminated for the convenience of the government  and had represented a significant portion of the total revenue planned for although other work was received later in the year  it was not of sufficient magnitude to mitigate the effects of the lost revenue 
other work included contracts from smiths industries for  and  from arpa for fiber optic technology development 
division revenue for the last three years was  for   for  and  for comparable period profits losses were  in   in  and  in cost of sales the cost of sales as a percent of revenue has increased significantly due to the severe erosion of revenue caused by the termination of the litton contract 
given below are the last three years results cost comparison cost of sales    gross sales    cost as a percent of revenue overhead and g a overhead overhead costs for the r d division were  in   in  and  in overhead expenses have decreased due to lower labor costs within the division and a lower corporate expense allocation 
these costs are apportioned as a percent of floor space assigned to revenue generating activities and have been reduced as the size of the division has declined 
g a g a expenses for the division were  in   in  and  in these numbers reflect a slightly higher expense in  due to the impact of the litton contract termination and the costs of marketing as the division has sought to obtain other business to replace the lost litton revenue 
we expect additional business in from these efforts  primarily in fiber optic gyroscope coil winding 
glint division was another successful year for the glint division 
at this time  it appears that the air force will require ongoing support for the gunship for at least the next several years 
while it is difficult to quantify the level of potential business  it does seem likely that optelecom will provide products and maintenance support during that period 
divisional revenue for the year was  compared to  in and  in prior to the th quarter of  the financial results of this division were included in the r d division as the glint laser array was in the final development phase 
profits were  for   for  and  for the fourth quarter of the decline in revenue in compared to was due to a change in the composition of the type of business addressed by this division 
in  contract work consisted of fabrication of complete illuminator systems  in  work consisted essentially of fabrication of spare laser arrays  with a small additional effort associated with contract development work 
in the fourth quarter the division s revenues declined to  and the division incurred an operating loss of 
the decline was due solely to the effects of the government shutdowns which occurred during that quarter 
these shutdowns impacted the planned award of a new contract for repair and refurbishment of laser illuminator systems which was eventually received in early in anticipation of the imminent award of that contract  the staff was retained  thus incurring costs in excess of revenue 
cost of sales the cost of sales as a percent of revenue remained constant compared to  reflecting a balanced application of manpower to specific work requirements 
cost comparison cost of sales    gross sales    cost as a percent of revenue overhead and g a overhead overhead costs for the glint division were  compared to  for  and  for overhead expenses have decreased slightly due to a lower level of revenue activity compared to g a the general and administrative expenses were  in   for  and  for other operating expenses overall advertising costs increased substantially in these costs include advertising in trade magazines  participation in trade shows  and product literature  including catalogs and specification sheets 
compared to prior years  the type of advertising changed as a result of a redirection of our advertising emphasis 
advertising expenditures increases occurred mainly in the areas of magazines and trade shows 
the costs of advertising for the last three years were  in   in  and  in these costs are attributed specifically to the communications products division and are included in its operating results 
interest expense of  decreased significantly in compared to  in and  in this decrease was a direct result of the positive cash flow from operations in the first three quarters of the year  which allowed us to fund operations without borrowing 
income tax benefit expense was  in   in  and  in the effective tax rate was in primarily as a result of realizing tax benefit of carrying back the current year loss to the prior year 
accordingly  the company recorded a  income tax refund receivable in for amounts expected to be received in impact of inflation inflation has not had any significant effect on the operations of the company during  and we do not expect it to have any significant effect during liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity requirements are largely generated by working capital needs 
these needs are primarily focused on financing inventories and accounts receivable 
as a result of a net operating loss and increases in inventory balances  net cash used in operational activities was 
non cash outlays such as depreciation and amortization were  cash used in investing activities was  and included expenditures for capital equipment for manufacturing operations  facility upgrades  and general office equipment 
in order to finance these activities  optelecom used existing cash flows  borrowing in short term notes and long term borrowings for equipment 
no other material changes in cash flow are expected 
the company has the ability  provided there are sufficient eligible receivables  to borrow up to  under its line of credit as of december  the company also has the ability to borrow funds for specific capital asset purchases to a maximum of  from a local bank 
loans for these assets are collateralized by the specific equipment asset and payable over no more than years 
during  the company borrowed  to purchase capital equipment for the manufacturing operation 
at the end of  the outstanding balance on this loan was  effects of recently issued accounting standards in october  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the new standard defines a fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation plans 
under this method  compensation cost is measured based on the fair value of the stock award when granted and is recognized as an expense over the service period  which is usually the vesting period 
this standard will be effective for the company beginning in and requires measurement of awards made beginning in the new standard permits companies to continue to account for equity transactions with employees under existing accounting rules  but requires disclosure in a note to the financial statements of the pro forma net income and earnings per share as if the company had applied the new method of accounting 
the company intends to implement these disclosure requirements beginning adoption of the new standard will not impact reported net income or cash flows 
in march  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
this standard will be effective for the company beginning in and is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s financial statement
