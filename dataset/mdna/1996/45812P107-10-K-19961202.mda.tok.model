item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  net sales 
net sales consist principally of total product sales less estimated sales returns 
net sales increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the company s sram product family accounted for a substantial majority of total net sales in fiscal and during fiscal  there was a significant drop in the average selling prices of sram products due to worldwide over capacity 
although the company increased its unit shipments of sram products in fiscal from fiscal  this increase in unit shipments was generally offset by lower average selling prices 
the increase in total sales of approximately was primarily attributable to growth in the company s nvm product line sales which more than doubled in fiscal compared to fiscal during fiscal and  the company s k sram products accounted for a majority of its net sales 
although the company anticipates that its k sram products will continue to account for a significant portion of sales  the proportion of such sales is expected to decline as demand shifts to higher density products  particularly the k and megabit products 
the company believes that the average selling prices of its existing products will continue to decline for the next several quarters 
there can be no assurance that such declines will be offset by higher volumes or by higher prices on newer products 
see certain factors quarterly fluctuations and declines in average selling prices 
gross profit 
the company s cost of revenues includes die cost from the wafers acquired from foundries  subcontracted package and assembly costs and costs associated with in house product testing and quality assurance 
gross profit decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the decline in gross margin includes a million write down of inventory recorded in the june quarter 
there can be no assurance that additional inventory write downs will not be needed in the future and such write downs could have a material adverse affect on the company s future operating results 
the general decrease in gross profit was primarily the result of lower average selling prices for the company s sram products in fiscal compared to fiscal the company experienced a significant drop in the average selling prices of its sram products in fiscal and  to a lesser extent  a decline in the average selling prices of its nvm products 
although product costs were also generally lower in fiscal  the significant drop in average selling prices resulted in lower gross margins 
the company believes that the average selling price of its products will continue to decline and  unless the company is able to reduce its cost per unit to the extent necessary to offset such declines  the decline in average selling prices will result in a material decline in the company s gross margin 
the company has product cost reduction programs in place and believes that the excess wafer capacity at its suppliers will result in reduced wafer costs 
however  there can be no assurance that product cost reductions will occur or that such possible reductions will be sufficient to offset the expected declines in average selling prices 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  research and development expenses increased to in fiscal  from in fiscal the increase was primarily the result of an increase in engineering personnel and payroll related expenses and increased expenses related to the development of new products 
during fiscal  the company s development efforts principally focused on geometry reductions for its memory products  synchronous srams  wider bus width srams such as k x and k x configurations  flash memories  voice eproms  and other memory related products 
the company anticipates that its research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods  although such expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of net sales 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal  from in fiscal the increase was primarily the result of the addition of marketing and sales personnel  payroll related expenses and increased selling commissions 
the company expects its selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as it continues to expand its sales and marketing efforts  although such expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of net sales 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily due to increased net interest earnings as a result of higher cash and short term investment balances 
benefit for income taxes 
the company recorded a tax benefit of  for fiscal year which was primarily attributable to a net loss before income taxes  the company s taiwan tax exemption and investment tax credits earned in taiwan 
as a result of its location in the hsinchu science based industrial park in taiwan  issi taiwan receives a significant tax exemption for taxable income from october  through september  the precise amount of the exemption is calculated annually based upon the extent of issi taiwan s net operating taxable income and measured by certain factors  including use of qualified manufacturing equipment  self manufacturing costs and qualified sales revenue 
the portion of issi taiwan s taxable income which is not subject to exemption is taxed at a flat tax rate 
for fiscal  the company was able to reduce current taxes payable by approximately  per share related to this exemption 
in addition  the company recognized benefits from investment tax credits in taiwan of approximately  in the current fiscal year 
there can be no assurances that the company s current tax status in taiwan will not change in the future due to changes in the regulatory environment  the inability to qualify for exempt status or other factors 
the company has established a valuation allowance covering a portion of the gross deferred tax assets based on management s expectations of future taxable income and the actual taxable income during the three years ended september  approximately  of the valuation allowance at september  is attributable to tax benefits of stock option deductions which will be credited to paid in capital when realized 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september net sales 
net sales increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in sales was principally due to increased unit shipments of sram products and  to a lesser extent  nonvolatile memory products  changes in product mix to lower voltage v and higher density products  and higher average selling prices for the company s sram products 
the increased units were a result of increased wafer allocation from the company s primary outside foundry  tsmc  and design improvements which resulted in more die per wafer 
the company generally experienced increasing average selling prices for its sram products in fiscal compared to fiscal due to a general shortage of wafer capacity in the industry 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased to for fiscal from for fiscal this change was a result of increased shipments in fiscal of higher margin products such as the volt k sram and the higher density k and meg srams  higher average selling prices for sram products in general  and reduced die costs as a result of advances in design geometries from and micron to micron for the company s primary products 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  research and development expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in absolute dollars was primarily the result of an increase in engineering personnel  including the establishment of an engineering group in the people s republic of china  and increased expenses related to the development of new products 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in absolute dollars was primarily the result of increased sales commissions as the company expanded its network of manufacturing representatives and added marketing and sales personnel 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily due to increased net interest income as a result of higher cash and short term investment balances 
provision for income taxes 
as a result of its location in the hsinchu science based industrial park in taiwan  issi taiwan receives a significant tax exemption for taxable income from october  through september  for fiscal  the company recognized a tax benefit of approximately million per share related to this exemption 
for fiscal  the company increased its provision for income taxes to of income before income taxes and minority interest as compared to for fiscal  primarily reflecting increased operating income attributable to the company s us operations 
the company s consolidated effective tax rate for any given period is calculated by dividing the total provision for income taxes incurred by the company and each of its subsidiaries by consolidated pre tax income before minority interest in net loss of consolidated subsidiary 
losses incurred by one subsidiary generally are not deductible by another subsidiary in calculation of their respective taxes 
therefore  the relative earnings of the company and its subsidiaries would affect the company s consolidated effective tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources as of september   the company s principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments of approximately million  of which approximately million are held by issi taiwan 
approximately million of the cash held by the company is restricted as of september  for purposes of securing available short term lines of credit and letters of credit 
during fiscal  operating activities utilized cash of approximately million 
cash utilized by operations was primarily due to increases in inventory and prepaid and other assets and decreases in accounts payable  partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable and net income adjusted for non cash items 
in addition  the company received net proceeds from borrowings under short term and long term lines of credit of million 
the company made capital expenditures of approximately million in fiscal  primarily for the purchase of test equipment and design and engineering tools 
the company expects to spend approximately million to purchase capital equipment during the next twelve months  principally for the purchase of additional test equipment  design and engineering tools  and computer hardware and software 
additionally  the company commenced construction  in july  of an million facility in the hsinchu science based industrial park to house its taiwan operations 
the building is expected to be completed in late in june  the company entered into a joint venture wafertech  llc with tsmc  altera  analog devices  and private investors to build a wafer fabrication facility in camas  washington 
the company will invest million for a equity interest in the venture and as of september   million had been paid by the company to wafertech in this regard 
the next payments by the company of million and million are expected to be made in december and november  respectively 
in fiscal  the company entered into an agreement with tsmc pursuant to which the company agreed to acquire specified wafer capacity through in exchange for wafer capacity commitments by tsmc  the company agreed to make certain annual payments to tsmc which commenced in june the first payment in june was approximately million and is being credited towards the purchase of wafers in the additional required payments totaling approximately million over the next four years represent annual increases in capacity which must be purchased by the company  a portion of which is secured by a letter of credit for million 
additionally  in fiscal  the company entered into a manufacturing agreement and joint venture agreement with umc 
under the terms of these agreements  the company received a supply of wafers from umc beginning with the december quarter and the company agreed to invest approximately million for a equity interest in a joint manufacturing venture of which umc retains ownership 
as of september   approximately million has been paid by the company to umc for the joint venture 
based on the completion of certain milestones  the company is committed to future payments to umc of approximately million 
the next payments of approximately million and million are expected to be made in january and july  respectively  subject to certain milestone completions 
the company has million available through a number of short term lines of credit with various financial institutions in taiwan 
as of september   the company had borrowings of approximately million under these short term lines of credit 
the company has a number of long term lines of credit with the bank of communication in taiwan to finance the purchase of machinery  equipment and building construction in taiwan 
total obligations related to these borrowings as of september  were million  of which million is included in the current portion of long term obligations 
these obligations bear interest at rates of from to and are payable in quarterly installments through as of september   the company had available long term lines of credit of approximately million of which approximately million is for construction financing for the company s new facility in the hsinchu science based industrial park 
the company believes that its existing funds will satisfy the company s anticipated working capital and other cash requirements through at least the next months 
the company may also use bank borrowings and capital leases depending on the terms available 
the company  from time to time  evaluates potential acquisitions and equity investments complementary to its memory expertise and market strategy 
to the extent the company pursues such transactions  any such transactions could require the company to seek additional equity or debt financings to fund such activities and  in certain circumstances  to provide product or technology rights 
there can be no assurance that any such additional financing could be obtained on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
certain factors which may affect the company s business or future operating results quarterly fluctuations and declines in average selling prices the company s future quarterly and annual operating results are subject to fluctuations due to a wide variety of factors  many of which are outside of its control  including declines in average selling prices of the company s products  oversupply of memory products in the market  failure to introduce new products and to implement technologies on a timely basis  the timing and announcement of new product introductions by the company and its competitors  market acceptance of the company s and its customers products  the failure to anticipate changing customer product requirements and fluctuations in manufacturing yield 
other factors include changes in product mix  seasonal fluctuations in customer demand for the company s products  the timing of significant orders  increased expenses associated with new product introductions or process changes  the ability of customers to make payments to the company  increases in material costs  increases in costs associated with the expansion of sales channels  increases in general and administrative expenses and certain production and other risks associated with using independent manufacturers 
in this regard  the company experienced quarterly sequential declines in revenue in the quarters ending march  june and september  principally due to declines in the average selling prices of its products and the inability to offset these declines by sufficient increases in unit shipments 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience further declines in quarterly revenue 
such revenue declines have had a material adverse impact on the company s gross profit and net income 
the company s future operating results will also depend in part on general economic conditions in asia  the united states and its other markets 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the markets for the company s products  which are highly cyclical  will continue to grow 
competitive pricing pressures resulted in significant price decreases for the company s products during historically  average selling prices for semiconductor memory products have declined and the company expects that average selling prices will decline in the future 
accordingly  the company s ability to maintain or increase revenues will be highly dependent upon its ability to increase unit sales volume of existing products and to introduce and sell new products which compensate for the anticipated declines in the average selling prices of its products 
declining average selling prices will also adversely affect the company s gross margins and profits unless the company is able to reduce its cost per unit to offset declines in average selling prices 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase unit sales volumes  introduce and sell new products or reduce its cost per unit 
shifts in industry wide wafer capacity from shortages to oversupply or from oversupply to shortages may also result in significant fluctuations in the company s quarterly or annual operating results 
excess capacity may result in declining average selling prices or write downs in the value of inventory due to excess inventory or inventory values that exceed selling prices 
in this regard  in the june quarter  the company recorded a million write down of inventory 
product concentration and dependence on personal computer industry in fiscal  substantially all of the company s net sales were derived from the sale of sram products  primarily k products 
substantially all of the company s products are incorporated into computer and computer peripheral products such as modems  disk drives and networks 
in recent periods  the pc industry has experienced strong unit sales growth  which has increased demand for integrated circuits  including memory products offered by the company 
the pc and pc peripherals industry has from time to time experienced cyclical  depressed business conditions  often in connection with  or in anticipation of  a decline in general economic conditions 
such industry downturns have resulted in reduced product demand and declining average selling prices 
the company s business and operating results would be materially and adversely affected by any future downturns in the pc or pc peripherals industry 
customer concentration the company s sales are concentrated within a limited customer base 
in fiscal  one customer accounted for approximately of net sales 
the company expects a significant portion of its future sales to remain concentrated within a limited number of strategic customers 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain its strategic customers or that such customers will not otherwise cancel or reschedule orders  or in the event of canceled orders  that such orders will be replaced by other sales 
in addition  sales to any particular customer may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
the occurrence of any such events could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
dependence on independent wafer foundries the company has adopted a fabless manufacturing strategy with the objective of establishing collaborative manufacturing relationships with selected semiconductor manufacturers 
to date  the company s principal manufacturing relationship has been with tsmc  and in fiscal  the company obtained a substantial majority of its wafers from tsmc 
the company also receives wafers from chartered semiconductor and umc 
each of the company s wafer suppliers also fabricates for other integrated circuit companies  including certain of the company s competitors 
although the company has written commitments specifying increasing wafer quantities  the company would have little or no recourse if its wafer suppliers experienced manufacturing failures or yield shortfalls  chose to prioritize capacity for other use or reduced or eliminated deliveries to the company 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to qualify additional manufacturing sources for existing or new products in a timely manner or that such additional manufacturing sources would agree to deliver an adequate supply of wafers 
if the company were unable to obtain an adequate supply of wafers from its current or any alternative sources in a timely manner  its business and operating results would be materially and adversely affected 
the company has agreed to certain minimum wafer purchase commitments with its foundry partners in exchange for wafer capacity commitments 
the company also agreed to make certain annual payments to tsmc for capacity increases 
additional required payments to tsmc totaling approximately million over the next four years represent annual increases in capacity which must be purchased by the company 
the company also has minimum purchase obligations for its joint venture with umc and wafertech llc 
although the company has rights to re schedule or assign capacity to another party  there can be no assurance that such re schedule or assignment would be successfully accomplished 
should the company fail to re schedule or assign unneeded capacity  the company s business and operating results would be materially and adversely affected 
claims regarding intellectual property in the semiconductor industry it is typical for companies to receive notices from time to time alleging infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights of others 
the company has been  and may from time to time continue to be  notified of claims that it may be infringing patents  maskwork rights or copyrights owned by third parties 
although none of these companies have pursued a claim against the company  there is no assurance that these or other companies will not in the future pursue claims against the company with respect to the alleged infringement 
if it appears necessary or desirable  the company may seek licenses under patents that it is alleged to be infringing 
although patent holders commonly offer such licenses  there is no assurance that any licenses will be offered or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to the company 
the failure to obtain a license under a key patent or intellectual property right from a third party for technology used by the company could result in protracted  costly litigation and cause the company to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend the manufacture of the products utilizing the invention or to attempt to develop non infringing products  any of which could materially and adversely effect the company s business and operating results 
management of growth the company has grown rapidly over the last several years 
this growth has resulted in a significant increase in responsibilities for existing management which has placed  and may continue to place  a significant strain on the company s limited personnel and other resources 
the company s ability to manage its growth effectively will require it to continue to improve its operational  financial and management systems  to successfully attract new employees and to properly train  motivate and manage its employees 
if the company s management is unable to manage growth effectively  the company s business and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
risk of increased taxes the company s tax rate could increase for a number of reasons 
for example  if the proportions of taxable income shifted such that a greater proportion of taxable income is earned by us operations  the company s effective tax rate may increase 
it is possible that the taiwan tax holiday applicable to the earnings of issi taiwan could be modified by changes in law or otherwise reduced 
in addition  the company s taxes would increase if all or a portion of the earnings of issi taiwan were to become subject to us tax as the result of actual dividends or through us rules for taxing controlled foreign corporations 
further  if profits of issi taiwan are distributed to the company as dividends they become subject to taiwan withholding tax as well as us tax with an offset for underlying taiwan taxes paid and the tax rate would increase 
it is not the company s intention to cause issi taiwan to distribute dividends 
issi taiwan is a controlled foreign corporation cfc for us income tax purposes 
under us rules for taxing cfcs  all or a portion of the earnings of issi taiwan may become subject to us tax as inclusions in the us taxable income of the company with a credit for foreign taxes paid by issi taiwan if one or more of a number of events occur 
such events include  but are not limited to issi taiwan accumulating cash and other passive assets in excess of of its total assets  issi taiwan lending funds to the company or otherwise investing in certain proscribed assets  and issi taiwan engaging in various types of transactions defined in the subpart f provisions of the us internal revenue code 
if cash is accumulated through operations and not otherwise invested in non passive assets such as capital equipment  such amounts in excess of of total assets would cause the company s effective tax rate to increase 
the company believes that its existing plans will minimize the impact of the cfc rules for the immediate future  subject to such changes in us tax laws as may occur 
however  over time the cfc rules may cause the company s tax rate to increase 
volatility of stock price the trading price of the common stock increased substantially after the company s initial public offering in february  subsequently declined  and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  future announcements by the company or its competitors  increases or decreases in wafer capacity  general conditions in the semiconductor or computer industries  governmental regulations  litigation  new or revised earnings estimates  comments or recommendations issued by analysts who follow the company  its competitors or the semiconductor industry and other events or factors 
in addition  stock markets have experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility in recent years 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities of many high technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock
