government regulations the properties are subject to various federal  state and local regulatory requirements such as local building codes and other similar regulations 
the company believes that the properties are currently in substantial compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements  although expenditures at properties may be required to comply with changes in these laws 
no material expenditures are contemplated at this time in order to comply with any such laws or regulations 
under various federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations  an owner or operator of real estate is liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances released on  above  under  or in such property 
such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances 
the costs of such removal or remediation could be substantial 
additionally  the presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate such substances may adversely affect the owner s ability to borrow using such real estate as collateral 
all of the properties have had phase i environmental site assessments which involve inspection without soil sampling or groundwater analysis by independent environmental consultants and have been inspected for hazardous materials as part of the company s acquisition inspections 
none of these phase i assessments has revealed any environmental conditions requiring material expenditures for remediation 
the phase i assessment for milpitas town center indicates that the ground water under the property either has been or may in the future be impacted by the migration of contaminants originating off site 
according to information available to the company  the responsible party for this off site source has been identified and has begun remediation pursuant to a clean up program mandated by a california environmental authority and the clean up program is backed by an insurance policy from cigna up to million 
the company does not believe that this environmental matter will impair the future value of milpitas town center in any significant respect 
the company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with all federal  state and local laws regarding hazardous or toxic substances  and the company has not been notified by any governmental authority of any non compliance or other claim in connection with any of its present or former properties 
the company does not anticipate that compliance with federal  state and local environmental protection regulations will have any material adverse impact on the financial position  results of operations or liquidity of the company 
results of operations compared to income from property operations income from property operations increased  or  in compared with this was due to an increase of rental income of  combined with a decrease in rental expenses of  the increase in rental income is primarily attributable to acquisitions of real estate investments 
the major acquisitions occurring in late and in were woodlands ii  town center drive  dupont industrial center  mariner court  and milpitas town center 
these acquisitions increased rental income by approximately  this increase was partially offset by the sales of point west place and university tower in  generating a reduction in rental income of approximately  the decrease in rental expenses is primarily attributable to the decrease in the amortization of leasing commissions and tenant improvements 
the newly acquired buildings have not yet incurred significant leasing commissions and tenant improvement costs 
since leasing commissions and tenant improvement costs are amortized over the life of the lease generally three to five years  the impact of having the portfolio consisting primarily of newly acquired buildings has been a significant reduction in amortization expense 
expenses interest expense  which includes amortization of loan fees  increased  or  in compared with the increase is attributable to the company s higher level of borrowing on its credit facility combined with the increase in interest rates and amortization expense of loan fees 
the higher level of borrowing was attributable to the acquisition of real estate in late and general and administrative expenses remained relatively unchanged in compared with gains on sales in  management and the board of directors decided to revise the investment strategy and geographic focus of investments from a continental wide basis to a western united states focus 
this was done because of the value growth advantage perceived in the western united states  new management s knowledge and experience in real estate in the western united states and  in part  because greater management effectiveness and cost efficiencies can be achieved by operating in a smaller geographic region 
certain properties in the real estate portfolio were identified for disposition 
those properties were individually evaluated and written down to management s best estimate of net realizable value 
such properties continued to be depreciated during the holding period prior to disposition 
in writing down the properties  the company relied on studies performed by outside appraisers and consultants 
the three methods used  discounted cash flows  noi capitalization and comparable sales  indicated that current market values of these properties were below their book value 
on may   the company sold its interest in the edison square partnerships  which were unconsolidated joint ventures  and recorded a gain of  this gain was due primarily to the book value of those partnerships having been reduced to negative  as the result of partnership losses 
in august  the company sold its investment in university tower for  and recorded a gain of  in october  the company sold its investment in point west place for  and recorded a gain of  on january   the company sold its investment in the texas bank north building for  and recorded a gain of  the gains on the sales of university tower and point west place related primarily to the depreciation of those properties during the holding period 
the gain from the sale of texas bank north was due to improvements in in the local real estate market 
the significant number of property sales occurring in and were attributable to management s decision to refocus the real estate portfolio on suburban office and industrial buildings located in the western united states 
the company does not expect this level of property sales to occur in the future 
dividends dividends declared for the four quarters of totaled per share 
consistent with the company s policy  the dividend declared for the last quarter of was paid in  as a result  the company s statement of cash flows for the year ended december  reflects dividends declared for the fourth quarter of and the first three quarters of the dividends declared for the fourth quarter of and were and per share respectively 
financial condition total assets of the company at december  increased by  compared with december   primarily as a result of an increase in real estate investments net of depreciation of  during  the company acquired properties and sold properties 
total liabilities at december  increased by  compared with december   primarily as a result of increased borrowings under the company s credit facility in order to finance the purchase of the landsing pacific portfolio

the convertible preferred stock contains financial covenants and conditions that if the company fails to maintain or achieve  its holders have the right to cause the company to redeem all of the outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock at a redemption price of per share plus all accrued dividends payable 
in that case  the company could experience substantial difficulty in financing such redemption and may be required to liquidate a substantial portion of its properties 
a portion of net cash proceeds from the convertible preferred stock sale was used to pay off outstanding borrowings under the company s million credit facility 
the facility  obtained in december for million and increased to million in august  was restated and amended to million on september  the amended facility  which matures on september   bears interest at a floating rate equal to either the lender s published reference rate plus or its offshore rate similar to libor plus 
the credit facility contains various restrictive covenants including  among other things  a covenant limiting quarterly dividends to of average funds from operations for the immediately preceding two fiscal quarters 
the facility was used  in part  to finance the acquisitions of mariner court  dupont industrial center  village green  and milpitas town center in and the landsing pacific portfolio in at september   the company was in compliance with the covenants and requirements of the credit facility 
the company and the lender under the credit facility have agreed  in principle  to amend the credit facility  subject to the final approval of the lender and negotiation of definitive documentation 
there can be no assurance  however  that an agreement between the lender and the company will actually be finalized 
if finalized  the company believes that the amendment will increase the commitment from million to million and reduce the interest rates 
the amendment of the credit facility will be conditioned upon the company s receipt of net proceeds from its currently proposed public offering of not less than million 
in addition  the company has obtained a commitment from a major financial institution for loans which would be secured by mortgages on three to four of the company s properties 
the mortgage loans are subject to the negotiation of definitive documentation and there can be no assurance that an agreement between the mortgage lender and the company will actually be finalized 
if finalized  the company believes that the principal amount of the loan would be approximately to million and the loan would mature in the company anticipates that the cash flow generated by its real estate investments will be sufficient to meet its short term liquidity requirements 
the company expects to fund the cost of acquisitions  capital expenditures  costs associated with lease renewals and reletting of space  repayment of indebtedness  and development of properties from i cash flow from operations  ii borrowings under the credit facility and  if available  other indebtedness which may include indebtedness assumed in acquisitions  iii the sale of real estate investments  and iv the sale of equity securities and  possibly  the issuance of equity securities in connection with acquisitions 
the ability to obtain mortgage loans on income producing property is dependent upon the ability to attract and retain tenants and the economics of the various markets in which the properties are located  as well as the willingness of mortgage lending institutions to make loans secured by real property 
the ability to sell real estate investments is partially dependent upon the ability of purchasers to obtain financing at commercially reasonable rates 
potential factors affecting future operating results for the years ended december  and  net income has been positively affected by gains on sales of real estate investments and joint venture partnerships 
the company does not anticipate that its net income will be materially impacted by such gains on sales 
at the present time  borrowings under the company s credit facility bear interest at a floating rate 
the company anticipates that its results from operations in may be negatively impacted by future increases in interest rates and substantial borrowings to finance property acquisitions 
while the company has historically been successful in renewing and releasing space  the company will be subject to the risk that certain leases expiring in may not be renewed or the terms of renewal may be less favorable than current lease terms 
however  the company expects to release the vacant spaces without any material adverse impact on operations 
in addition  the company expects to incur costs in making improvements or repairs to its portfolio of properties required by new or renewing tenants and expenses associated with brokerage commissions payable in connection with the reletting of space 
many other factors affect the company s actual financial performance and may cause the company s future results to be markedly outside of the company s current expectations
