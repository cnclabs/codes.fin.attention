the company believes the actions set forth above and the availability of its financing facilities  together with the company s available cash and expected cash flows from fiscal operations and beyond  will enable ames to fund its expected needs for working capital  capital expenditures and debt service requirements 
achievement of expected cash flows from operations and compliance with the ebitda covenant note is dependent upon the company s attainment of sales  gross profit  and expense levels that are reasonably consistent with its financial projections 
the company expects from time to time to consider possible capital market transactions  debt refinancing  and other transactions to further enhance the company s financial flexibility 
the significant net operating loss carryforwards remaining after fiscal  subject to limitations pursuant to internal revenue code sec 
 should offset income on which taxes would otherwise be payable in future years
