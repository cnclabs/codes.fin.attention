recent developments in january  network initiated a policy to offer both new and existing cardholders an alternative to the traditional arrangement of a savings with an annual membership fee of the new program  the program  provides a savings to cardholders with no annual fee so long as cardholder usage is at least during each membership year 
network has indicated that commencing in  substantially all programs to obtain new cardholders will utilize the program and that network will take a leading role to promote the transmedia card on a national basis utilizing arrangements with large national organizations and businesses  including mbna  united airlines and unocal 
the company believes that because of the portion of the overall us population residing in california  network s national programs will result in the addition of a meaningful number of new california cardholders 
the company also believes that a substantial number of new cardholders residing in california will initially enroll in the program and that an increasing number of existing cardholders in california will convert to the program 
all costs of such national programs will be borne by network 
no commissions will be paid by network to the company with respect to new program cardholders obtained from these national programs 
transmedia restaurant charges in participating restaurants by cardholders who have enrolled in the program  will result in the receipt by the company of net sales from each such individual transaction that are greater than those received under the traditional savings arrangement 
accordingly  the company s gross profit from each such transaction will increase from approximately to 
there will be no change with respect to the company s approximately gross profit from individual transmedia restaurant charges by cardholders who remain enrolled in the traditional savings program 
no assurance can be given as to the number of cardholders residing in or outside california that will enroll in or convert to the program 
therefore  the company is presently unable to predict the magnitude of the effect that the program will have upon overall net sales or gross profit 
the company anticipates that its own activities directed to obtaining new cardholders in california will be reduced as a result of the national programs of network discussed above 
however  the company will continue to solicit new cardholders utilizing the program through programs in california with organizations and businesses with significant memberships or customers that will involve distribution of at least  applications per program 
the company anticipates that it will be reimbursed for its expenses by network for a significant number of such programs 
as mentioned above  in  network began to offer to holders of the transmedia card use of the card at certain hotels  resorts  golf courses  ski lifts and access to discount long distance telephone services 
the company s rights under the franchise agreement relate only to participating restaurants in the franchise territory 
the company does not have any rights to participate in or derive any income from these programs 
liquidity and capital resources the company commenced operations in august the company s principal expenditures are made to i purchase rights to receive from participating restaurants  ii advertise and market for cardholders and restaurants in california and iii pay for general and administrative expenses  including officers compensation and compensation to sales employees  for the recruitment of participating restaurants in the franchise territory 
the company s principal revenues result from the sale of rights to receive to cardholders 
the company is actively engaged in acquiring rights to receive from participating restaurants solicited primarily in the san francisco bay area  the los angeles metropolitan area  and the orange county area 
the number of restaurants that participate in the transmedia network depends primarily upon several factors  including general market acceptance of the company s business in california  competition  economic trends in the restaurant industry in california  the number of sales employees soliciting participating restaurants and the general effectiveness of the company s and network s advertising and marketing activities 
these factors make it difficult to estimate the number of restaurants from which it will purchase rights to receive

it is the company s experience that approximately of all of the participating restaurants listed in the transmedia network s published directories renew their rights to receive agreements after the initial amount of rights to receive purchased by the company from such participating restaurants are expended and additionally that of all participating restaurants eligible for their second renewal renew their contract 
after the second renewal  renewal rates drop sharply because the participating restaurants with the company s help have become more successful and no longer wish to sell rights to receive at a discount  the company chooses not to renew the participating restaurant or the participant restaurant has gone out of business 
however  offsetting this drop is the fact that new restaurants start up as old ones go out of business  providing the company with new restaurant prospects 
during the year ended december   the company began entering into nine to month commitment agreements with certain participating restaurants 
the commitment agreements establish a minimum time period of participation by the restaurant in the event that the initial credits purchased by the company from the restaurant are exhausted prior to the expiration of the commitment period
