during the past four years  the company maintained growth in net revenue  completed the sale of its radio stations in three markets  completed the acquisition of radio station kube fm in seattle washington  entered into an agreement to purchase television station kfty in santa rosa  california  and continued the cost containment program initiated in one by product of the cost containment effort that has remained an important part of the company s operating strategy is increased scrutiny of expenses 
rather than concentrating solely on maximizing revenues  the company focuses on maximizing the operating cash flow of each of its business segments 
proposed expenses are evaluated in light of the enhancements to revenue anticipated to flow from such expenditures 
as with many media companies that have grown through acquisitions  the company s acquisitions and dispositions of television and radio stations have resulted in significant non cash and non recurring charges to income 
for this reason  in addition to net income loss  management believes that operating cash flow defined as net revenue less operating expenses plus other income before amortization  depreciation  interest expense and disposition of assets is an appropriate measure of the company s financial performance 
this measure excludes expenses consisting of depreciation  amortization  interest  litigation expense  and disposition of assets because these expenses are not considered by the company to be costs of ongoing operations 
the company uses operating cash flow to pay interest and principal on its long term debt as well as to finance capital expenditures 
operating cash flow  however  is not to be considered as an alternative to net income loss as an indicator of the company s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of the company s liquidity 
the regional markets the company serves  from time to time  experience varying degrees of recessionary influences 
management cannot presently determine the potential negative impact of such recessionary influences on the company s operations and its financial condition
