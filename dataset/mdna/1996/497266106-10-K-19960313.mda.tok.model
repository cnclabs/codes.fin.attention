operating income for the marine transportation segment for the year totaled  including  from equity in earnings of marine partnerships  an increase of compared with operating income of  and over operating income of  for comparative purposes  the transportation revenues for the  and years included acquired assets during and which contributed to the majority of the increase in revenues for each comparable year 
in march  the company acquired the assets of tpt  in may  the assets of afram lines and in december  the assets of chotin transportation 
in july  the company acquired four offshore tankers and in november  the company acquired the transportation assets of dow 
all of the above noted acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
collectively  the above noted acquisitions generated revenues for the year of approximately  since their dates of acquisition and the above noted acquisitions generated revenues for the year of approximately  since their dates of acquisition 
as a provider of service for both the inland and offshore united states markets  the marine transportation segment is divided into three divisions organized around the markets they serve the inland chemical division  serving the inland industrial and agricultural chemical markets  the inland refined products division  serving the inland refined products market  and the offshore division  which serves the offshore petroleum products  container  dry bulk and palletized cargo markets 
a division analysis by years of marine transportation revenues follows marine transportation revenues the inland chemical division s transportation revenues for totaled  or of total transportation revenues 
such amount represents a increase compared with  reported in the inland chemical division operates under long term contracts  short term contracts and spot movements of products 
as of december  and  approximately of such movements were under contracts and approximately were spot movements 
the acquisition from dow of inland tank barges and the assumption of the lease of inland tank barges from dow along with a ten year contract with dow to provide inland bulk liquid marine transportation services  contributed to the majority of the increase in over the demand for movements of industrial chemicals by the inland chemical division remained strong during the second half of benefited from the full integration of the dow fleet into the division s fleet and the achievement of operating efficiencies from such integration 
the movements of liquid fertilizer and anhydrous ammonia by the inland chemical division is normally seasonal  coinciding with the spring and fall fertilizer season 
the upper mississippi river flooding  more fully described below  extended both the spring and fall season as demand was enhanced from the flooding of the midwest farmlands 
revenues from the inland refined products division for improved to  or of total transportation revenues  an increase of compared with  reported for the inland refined products division  like the inland chemical division  operates under long term contracts  short term contracts and spot market movements 
for  approximately of such movements were under term contracts and were spot market movements 
during  the inland refined products division experienced strong demands for its services  however  when compared with  movements were down slightly  as additional refinery capacity was added in the midwest united states and pipeline efficiencies to the midwest improved 
revenues from the offshore division for decreased to  representing of total transportation revenues for  from the  reported in the offshore division  which participates in movements of both refined petroleum products and dry products  continued to experience weaknesses in certain of its offshore markets during  due primarily to excess equipment capacity and reduced demand for movements of such products 
the offshore movements of refined petroleum products continued to experience weaknesses  however  the offshore operations improved during when compared with from both a utilization and rate standpoint 
the requirements for the use of reformulated gasoline under the clean air act in non attainment areas  effective january   was beneficial in placing eight of the company s eleven offshore vessels operating at that time under term charters that became effective during the fourth quarter 
such charters ranged from six months to three years at favorable rates 
during the first quarter  spot market rates for the three vessels operating in such market declined significantly  as the unusually mild winter in the northeast and imports of gasoline from europe decreased the normal movements of heating oil and gasoline from the gulf coast to the northeast 
due to the lack of demand during the second quarter  three customers did not exercise renewal options for charters and the vessels were placed in the spot market 
during the third quarter  one spot market tanker was laid up  as rates did not justify an anticipated expenditure of approximately  to maintain the vessel s operating certificate 
the laid up tanker had an opa expiration date of october in anticipation of the idle tanker not returning to service  effective september   the tanker was written down by approximately  to scrap steel value upon the adoption of sfas no 
and subsequently scrapped in march certain spot market tank vessels were laid up for various periods of time during due to weak demand for equipment and resulting low rates 
however  in december  the demand for tank vessels increased significantly due to the cold weather in the northeast and resulting low heating oil inventory levels 
such demand resulted in higher rates  although both demand and rates have subsequently abated 
movements for the transportation of food aid and related products under the united states government s preference aid cargo programs and military cargo movements were sporadic during the year 
during portions of all three freighters operating in this market have been laid up at various times due to the market s excess capacity 
such excess capacity and lack of available cargos have resulted in rates that were inadequate to achieve profitability 
marine transportation revenues the inland chemical division s revenues for totaled  or of total transportation revenues  an increase of compared with  reported in the inland chemical division operates under long term contracts  short term contracts and spot movements of products 
as of december   approximately of such movements were under contracts and approximately under spot movements 
since march  the division experienced spot rate increases  and the higher spot rates were conducive to increases in contract rates as contracts were renewed 
the inland chemical division benefited from positive improvements in equipment utilization and rates  generated primarily from a hike in the business levels of the division s customers  the chemical manufacturers 
during the majority of the year  the company s river operation continued to experience pricing pressure in movements of chemicals in the ohio river market 
however  during the latter part of the year  the river operation did begin to strengthen as business levels tightened capacity 
the demand for movements of liquid fertilizer and anhydrous ammonia by the inland chemical division remained strong during all of acreage planting in the midwest farm belt increased  partially due to the low levels of grain commodities resulting from the upper mississippi river flooding 
revenues from the inland refined products division for improved to  representing of total transportation revenues  an increase of compared with  reported in the inland refined products division  like the inland chemical division  operates under long term contracts  short term contracts and spot market movements 
approximately of such movements were under term contracts and the remaining under spot market movements 
during  rates for spot market movements of refined petroleum products remained higher than the majority of movements performed under contracts  however  as contracts were renewed  higher rates were received due to the continued improvements in spot market rates 
the inland refined products division experienced high utilization of its fleet during all of the division benefited substantially from the addition of inland tank barges acquired from chotin transportation in december  along with a transportation contract through the year the asset acquisition and resulting contract substantially increased the division s market presence in the contract and spot movements of refined petroleum products on the mississippi river system 
revenues from the offshore division for declined to  representing of total transportation revenues for  from the  reported in the offshore division  which participates in movements of both refined products and dry products  experienced weaknesses in all of its markets during the year  due primarily to excess equipment capacity and reduced demand for movements of products from each of the markets 
the offshore movements of refined products remained extremely weak during the year  with the exception of the first quarter and the latter portion of the fourth quarter 
during the first quarter  certain vessels were engaged in spot market trade delivering heating oil to the northeast due to the harsh winter season 
profitability of such spot market movements was adversely affected by the winter weather conditions  which hampered operating efficiencies 
during the second quarter  three of the company s offshore liquid vessels were idle and during the third quarter and early fourth quarter  as many as six of the company s offshore liquid vessels were idle  including the three tankers acquired from omi in july spot market rates during the second  third and a portion of the fourth quarter were extremely low 
during the fourth quarter  the market for the company s offshore liquid equipment reflected significant improvement in both utilization and rates 
the requirements for the use of reformulated gasoline under the clean air act in nine non attainment areas  effective january   was beneficial in placing nine of the company s twelve offshore liquid vessels under term contracts that became effective during the fourth quarter 
of the remaining three vessels  two were engaged in shorter term movements at satisfactory rates and one was out of service pending scrapping effective january   in compliance with the opa 
in addition  further temporary tightening of the offshore liquid market occurred in mid october   when the houston area san jacinto river flooding caused certain refined products pipelines serving the united states northeast to break  suspending service for varying periods of days 
movements for the transportation of food commodities and related products under the united states government s preference aid cargo programs and military household goods movements also remained weak 
excess equipment capacity and a reduction in available movements led to rates that were significantly lower than rates for the market 
such weakness in the market resulted in one of the company s ships being idle for three weeks during the third quarter and one ship was idle for the latter part of december 
the softness in the overall preference aid cargo market also negatively affected the company s other offshore dry cargo barge and tug units that primarily work under a long term contract with an electric utility company  but periodically operate in the preference aid market as a supplement to their long term contract movements 
marine transportation revenues revenues from the inland chemical division increased from the previous year totaling  or of total transportation revenues 
movements of industrial chemicals were intermittently weak during the year  as recessionary pressures negatively influenced the market during the first quarter of and budgetary constraints by petrochemical manufacturers negatively affected the market during the second half of movements of liquid fertilizer and anhydrous ammonia remained at a high level during due to continued heavy usage of fertilizer products and consistent exports 
for the year  the movements of liquid fertilizer were conducted well past the normal fertilizer season  the result of enhanced demand due to the flooding of the upper mississippi river farmlands more fully described below 
the inland refined products division s revenues increased to  contributing to the company s overall transportation revenues 
the demand for the movement of gasoline  diesel fuel and jet fuel escalated during the year and such demand benefited equipment utilization and enabled modest rate increases 
a full year of operation of sabine transportation and omr transportation also contributed to the increase 
revenues for the offshore division increased to  contributing of the company s total transportation revenues 
the acquisition of afram in may accounted for a significant portion of the year to year gain 
throughout  the division s break bulk vessels remained in heavy demand  being removed from service only for scheduled maintenance 
the offshore division s liquid market  however  reflected price and demand weakness due to excess capacity in the offshore liquid market  particularly affecting spot market rates 
during  certain offshore liquid vessels were idle due to lack of business 
marine transportation costs and expenses costs and expenses  excluding interest expense and the  write down as discussed below  for the marine transportation segment for the year increased to  an increase of over the comparable costs and expenses of  and over the costs and expenses of  the majority of the increases for the comparable periods reflect the costs and expenses  including depreciation  associated with the acquisitions  mergers and asset purchases consummated during the  and years  as more fully described in business acquisitions and developments below 
in addition  the increases for each year reflect higher equipment costs  health and welfare costs  general and administrative costs and inflationary increases in costs and expenses 
specific events which affected the costs and expenses for each of the last three years are more fully described below 
marine transportation costs and expenses as stated above  in september  the company adopted sfas no 
 which establishes standards for the impairment of long lived assets  certain identifiable intangibles related to those assets to be held and used  and for long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be disposed of 
the company reduced the carrying value of certain marine transportation equipment and related intangibles by taking a  pre tax  non recurring charge in the third quarter 
the after tax effect of the charge was  or 
per share 
the company reviewed long term assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment by division  and by vessel class within each division 
for purposes of determining fair value  the company estimated future net cash flows expected to be generated  assuming the above asset groups 
approximately  of the  charge reduced the carrying value of the three freighters and related intangibles engaged in preference aid cargo and military cargo movements 
freight rates  which have been depressed since  were not expected to recover to levels which would allow the freighters to make consistent contributions to earnings 
the freighters were reduced to a fair market value of  in addition to the charge  the company also reduced administrative overhead associated with the freighters through employee reductions  office closure and internal merging of the shoreside support functions of the freighter operations with the tanker operations 
the company is prepared to exit the preference aid and military cargo markets by selling or scrapping the freighters if demand and rates do not return to profitable levels 
the marine transportation segment s inland operations were negatively affected by the upper mississippi river system closure for all marine transportation movements from may through june  and  to a lesser extent  flooding in the arkansas river 
the closure of the upper river  the result of severe flooding  resulted in idle  delayed or diverted equipment equal to approximately of the company s inland tank barge fleet 
when the upper river opened  operations were impeded by channel silting which restricted drafts  and in some cases  briefly closed the upper river in certain areas 
the closure marked the second time in three years the upper river has closed due to flooding 
in the previous years  the upper river has closed four times as a result of flooding 
the company estimated that operating income was reduced by approximately   after taxes or 
per share from the effects of the upper river and arkansas river flooding 
additionally  in the third quarter  the illinois river was closed for lock repairs for almost the entire quarter and numerous hurricanes during affected the operating results of the inland operations 
in  the company formed a captive insurance operation  oceanic  to insure the majority of risks previously self insured by the company and to access the reinsurance market directly 
during  the effect of insuring casualty losses  previously expensed on an incurred basis  was to increase insurance expense charged to the company s subsidiaries by approximately marine transportation costs and expenses during the first quarter  one of the company s offshore dry cargo barge and tug units experienced difficulties with collection of its empty containers from several voyages carrying preference aid cargo to haiti  which  during that time  was politically unstable 
collectively  the voyages to haiti reduced the company s first quarter earnings before taxes by an estimated   after taxes  or 
per share 
the company s foreign flag container service  which provided a direct all water transportation service from memphis  tennessee to mexico and central america  was discontinued effective august  aggressive pricing from competitors resulted in slower than anticipated acceptance of the service 
volumes were increasing with each voyage  however  operating losses and the negative prospect for future profitability did not warrant continuation of the service 
since inception in february  the operation suffered operating losses through august of approximately   after taxes  or 
per share 
additionally  shut down expenses totaled approximately   after taxes  or 
per share 
marine transportation costs and expenses the transportation segment s inland operations were curtailed during the third quarter by flooding on the upper mississippi river and the closing of the algiers lock at new orleans 
collectively  the pretax effect of the two events reduced the results by an estimated   after taxes  or 
per share 
flooding on the upper mississippi river closed the upper river to marine transportation movements from june through august and continued to disrupt deliveries even after that date 
movements north of cairo  illinois were curtailed substantially  several of the inland river towing units were stranded by the flood  and the segment s lower mississippi river marine operations were rescheduled 
the closing of the algiers lock for repair from july through september required the inland towing vessels to use alternate routes  which resulted in time delays 
the algiers lock is situated along the main artery of the intracoastal waterway near new orleans 
marine transportation operating income the company s inland chemical and refined products division s operating income for the year totaled  an increase of compared with operating income of  and over operating income of  operating margins for increased to compared with for and for for  the offshore division s operating income totaled  compared with an operating loss of  in and an operating income of  in operating margins for were compared with a negative for and an operating margin of for during  as noted above  the formation of oceanic and the effect of insuring casualty losses  previously expensed on an incurred basis  was to increase insurance expense charged to the company s subsidiaries by approximately  diesel repair the company s diesel repair segment reported diesel repair revenues for the year of  reflecting a increase compared with  for and a increase compared with  for revenues for the and years reflect the formation of a new diesel repair operation which provides parts and service to shortline railroads and industrial companies that operate locomotives 
the diesel repair segment is divided into two divisions organized around the markets they serve 
the marine diesel repair division operates on all three coasts and in the midwest through five facilities that repair and overhaul marine diesel engines and reduction gears  and sell related parts and accessories 
the rail diesel repair division  which commenced operations in january   provides replacement parts  service and support nationwide to shortline railroads and industrial companies that operate locomotives 
diesel repair revenues revenues for the marine diesel repair division increased to  contributing of the diesel repair segment s total revenues during such revenues represented an increase compared with the  reported in during  as in prior years  the division continued to operate in a very competitive market  however  the gulf coast and midwest markets benefited from the overall general health of the inland tank barge and dry cargo industry  the main customer base for such markets 
the east coast market remained stable during from military customers  however  revenues from the west coast declined as the division shifted its focus from the south pacific fishing fleet to the north pacific fishing fleet 
revenues from the rail diesel repair division increased to  contributing of the diesel repair segment s total revenues during such revenues represented a increase when compared with  of revenues reported in the division continues to expand its aftermarket parts sales as the exclusive distributor to shortline and industrial railroads for emd  the world s largest manufacturer of locomotives 
diesel repair revenues the marine diesel repair division s revenues increased to  contributing of the diesel repair segment s total revenues during  an increase of compared with the  reported in operating in a very competitive market  the marine diesel repair division reflected significant improvements in its midwest and gulf coast markets  particularly during the second half of inland dry bulk cargo carriers had slowly rebounded from the effects on their business from the upper mississippi river flooding during the third quarter 
as a result of the flooding  which caused depressed coal and grain markets  the division s customers either curtailed or postponed scheduled repairs and maintenance and significantly curtailed parts purchases 
the east coast markets also reflected improvements during the second half of as military customers enhanced their repair and maintenance activities 
also  the west coast market improved  as a hike in tuna prices enabled the offshore fishing customers to slowly rebound from depressed and fishing markets 
the rail diesel repair division  which commenced operations in january  reported revenues for of  contributing of the diesel repair segment s total revenues 
the rail diesel repair division reported a modest profit from its first year of operations 
diesel repair revenues revenues for the marine diesel repair division fell to  from the  reported in flooding in the upper mississippi river during the third quarter resulted in a significant reduction in revenues from the midwest market  which consists primarily of the inland barge industry 
customers either curtailed or postponed scheduled maintenance and parts purchases 
the east coast market  catering to the military  was negatively affected by united states military reductions and governmental budget restraints 
the west coast market  catering to the offshore tuna fishing industry  was hindered by deferred maintenance to their commercial customer s fleets due to the low worldwide price of tuna 
in the gulf coast market  business remained relatively constant 
diesel repair costs and expenses costs and expenses  excluding interest expense  for the diesel repair segment for totaled  compared with  for and  for the increase of for compared with reflected the continued growth in revenues from both the marine diesel repair division and the rail diesel repair division 
the increase for compared with reflected the overall growth in revenues for the marine diesel repair division  as well as costs and expenses associated with the commencement of the rail diesel repair division 
the reduction reflected the overall decline in revenues and its negative effect on the segment s profit margin 
diesel repair operating income the diesel repair operating income for was  an increase of compared with operating income of  and over operating income of  operating margins for were compared with for and for the results reflect continued pressure on parts sales margins brought about by price competition in the industry 
property and casualty insurance change in method of accounting for investment the company currently has a voting common stock ownership of universal  a full service property and casualty insurance company  which operates exclusively in the commonwealth of puerto rico 
on july   universal redeemed  of its common stock from the company and sold  of its common stock to eastern america group  thereby reducing the company s voting ownership from  prior to such redemption and sale  to the current 
such redemption and sale increased eastern america group s voting ownership from to the present 
effective july   the company is accounting for its investment in universal under the equity in earnings method of accounting 
prior period financial statements have not been restated 
for the first six months  results for universal are consolidated with a minority interest expense recorded for eastern america s interest 
for the last six months of  the company s investment in universal is recorded on the equity in earnings method of accounting 
comparability of net premiums earned  commissions earned on reinsurance  investment income  losses  claims and settlement expenses  policy acquisition costs  minority interest expense and  to a lesser extent  selling  general and administrative expenses  taxes  other than on income and depreciation and amortization were affected by the change in the method of accounting for the company s investment in universal effective july  universal has continued to expand its vehicle single interest and double interest lines of business primarily the result of strong automobile sales in puerto rico and from universal s expanded market share 
the amount recorded by the company as equity in earnings for the company s investment in universal is influenced to the extent that anticipated future redemptions by universal of its common stock exceed the company s investment in universal s stock 
the company also has an investment in universal s nonvoting preferred stock 
because the preferred stock controls a separate portfolio of us treasury securities  the company accounts for this preferred stock under sfas therefore  the interest earned  as well as the realized gains from the sale of us treasury securities collateralizing the preferred stock  are included as part of equity in earnings of insurance affiliate 
during the third quarter  the company recognized  of realized gains from the sale of such us treasury securities  which are included in equity in earnings of insurance affiliate 
the company s portion of universal s pretax earnings for totaled  of which pretax earnings of  are consolidated through the first six months and  are recorded as equity in earnings of insurance affiliate for the second half 
since merging with eastern america in september  universal s premiums earned in compared with increased  and its earnings before taxes on income for compared with increased 
in addition  universal s investment income  from its growing investment portfolio  increased when comparing with since the date of the merger  the company s voting common stock ownership has declined from to and  in addition to the reduction in ownership as stated above  the amount recorded by the company as equity in earnings for the company s investment in universal is influenced to the extent that anticipated future redemptions by universal of its common stock exceed the company s investment in universal s stock 
property and casualty insurance revenues the company s property and casualty insurance segment reported premiums written of  for  an increase of compared with premiums written of  for net premiums earned for totaled  an increase of compared with net premiums earned of  for the increase in premiums written for over reflected continued emphasis on the automobile lines of insurance  particularly the vehicle single interest and double interest lines 
new financial institution customers  portfolio transfers and significant improvement in automobile sales in puerto rico have all led to improved premiums written under the automobile lines 
the improvement in automobile sales was generated partially from an improved puerto rico economy and from lower automobile prices on united states manufactured automobiles  the result of a reduction in puerto rico s excise tax rates 
the increase in net premiums earned for over reflected the amortization of net premiums written over the life of a policy 
the substantial increase reflected the result of the increase in premiums written during  as well as the significant increase in premiums written during net premiums earned reflects the amortization of net premiums written over the life of the policy 
net premiums earned continued to be negatively affected by higher reinsurance costs for the commercial multiple peril line associated with the ceding of a portion of the gross premiums written under the segment s reinsurance program 
during  some stabilization had occurred  however  reinsurance rates remained high 
property and casualty insurance revenues premiums written reflected a increase in to  business generated from eastern america s portfolio  brought in with the merger of eastern america with and into universal in september  was the primary reason for the increase 
a new government policy  two vehicle single interest portfolio transfers and the addition of vehicle single interest business from two financial institutions  which was the result of an improvement in automobile sales in  also contributed to the significant improvement in premiums written 
net premiums earned increased in to  reflecting the hike in the business volume from the merger with eastern america  as well as a significant increase in the single interest line of business during as in  net premiums earned for were negatively affected by the hike in reinsurance cost  primarily the result of the number of worldwide catastrophic events within the past few years 
property and casualty insurance investment income investment income is generated primarily from the segment s investment in united states treasury securities  due to their investment safety and favorable puerto rico tax treatment 
investment income totaled  for compared with  for the hike in interest rates during contributed to the increase for  however  prior to the decline in interest rates  the segment procured a constant yield on a large portion of its untied states treasury securities with fixed rates 
even though interest rates remained low during  the insurance segment s investment income increased 
the investment income also benefited from the merger with eastern america in property and casualty insurance costs and expenses losses  claims and settlement expenses for totaled  compared with  for the increase for reflected a significant increase in business volume  particularly the vehicle double interest line and a favorable year for actual loss events 
for  the increase in losses  claims and settlement expenses reflected the merger with eastern america as well as an increase in all lines of insurance  with the emphasis on the vehicle single interest line 
losses  claims and settlement expenses for the year included a reserve of  for potential  but as yet unreported  losses related to mariner 
during through  mariner participated in the writing of property and casualty reinsurance 
mariner received certain delayed large loss advices  which resulted in the increases in the loss reserves 
the year was the last year for participation in the reinsurance market 
property and casualty insurance pretax earnings for and the company s portion of the property and casualty insurance segment s pretax earnings totaled  for  an increase of compared with net earnings of  for  in spite of a reduction of the company s ownership position from to during financial conditions  capital resources and liquidity balance sheet total assets as of december  were  a decrease of when compared with total assets of  as of december  and lower than the december  total assets of  the december  total asset decrease is partially due to the adoption of sfas no
