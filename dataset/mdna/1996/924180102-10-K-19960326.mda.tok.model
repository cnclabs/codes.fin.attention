the difference between the rate earned on total earning assets and the rate paid on total interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income increased million or to million in from million in this compared to a million or increase in from on a fully taxable equivalent basis  net interest income increased million  or  from to and million  or  from to the increase in was almost equally attributable to favorable changes in levels of earning assets and interest rates 
in  changes in interest rates reduced net interest income by million 
this was more than offset by the impact of a million increase in earning assets 
management anti cipates that the company s net interest margin will shrink somewhat in  but that net interest income will still increase  although at a slower pace than in average earning assets increased slowly over the last two years with and growth rates in and  respectively 
the growth came from a million  or  increase in loans and an million  or  increase in federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell 
the growth in loans was primarily in the residential real estate area 
average interest bearing liabilities increased million  or  in following a million  or  growth in over the two year period  average core interest bearing deposits savings and transactional deposits and certificates of deposit under  increased by million 
non core interest bearing liabilities were increased by million over the same period 
the following table provides an analysis of the variances in net interest income  on a fully taxable equivalent basis  attributable to changes in volume and rate 
volume variances are calculated by multiplying the preceding year s rate by the current year s change in the average balance

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses charged to operating expense is based upon management s judgment of the amount necessary to maintain the allow ance for loan losses at a level adequate to absorb possible losses 
the factors evaluated include  but are not limited to the size  composition  growth and quality of the loan portfolio  specific and potential problem loans  current economic conditions and their effect on a borrower s performance in relation to contract terms  historical loss experience by loan type and loan collectibility 
the provision for loan losses in was million compared to million in and million in net loans charged off were million  million and million for the respective years 
the provision was reduced million in and million in as nonperforming asset levels and the company s local economy continued to improve

see note to the consolidated financial statements 
partially offsetting the expense improvements in was a million increase in other noninterest expense 
nearly half of this increase was due to the receipt of million in life insurance proceeds in s second quarter 
over the last two years management has coordinated a profit improvement plan which has focused on delivering high quality customer service more efficiently and at a reduced cost 
during that period net noninterest expense net of securities transactions has decreased from million in to million in and million in management anticipates that net noninterest expense will be reduced further in applicable income taxes during  and the company recorded income tax expense of million  million and million  respectively 
the changes were almost entirely due to the level of pre tax earnings

financial condition loans the loan portfolio decreased million  or  in follow ing a million  or  increase in in structuring the composition of its loan portfolio  the company considers the following factors profitability  liquidity  risk  rate sensitivity and service in its market area 
it tries to maintain a balance between commercial lending commercial  commercial real estate and construction loans and consumer lending residential real estate and consumer loans with each representing between and of the total loan portfolio 
over the last two years the commercial lending sector decreased million and decreased from to of the total loan portfolio 
through its subsidiary banks the company makes commercial business loans to small and medium sized businesses in vermont and massachusetts 
vermont national bank is the leading commercial lender in the state of vermont 
construction and commercial loans secured by real estate include loans secured by residential and commercial properties  office and industrial buildings  condominium development and land development properties 
the company limits both of these types of lending activities and the properties securing these loans to its primary market areas in vermont and massachusetts  and adjacent communities in neighboring states 
approximately of the commercial real estate portfolio represents loans on owner occupied properties 
real estate values in vermont have been depressed as a result of the recent recession in new england and the nation  but have experienced some recent improvement 
management s goal is to keep the construction loan portion of the loan portfolio below of total loans 
as of december  this sector represented of the portfolio 
in  the company originated million of residential mortgage loans and sold million of loans in the secondary market  compared to million originated and million sold in and million originated and million sold in the decrease in mortgage loan originations was primarily due to higher interest rates 
the high levels of were in part due to lower interest rates which led to a significant number of mortgage refinancings 
at year end  the mortgage servicing portfolio totaled million compared to million at year end and million at year end and currently generates income of approximately million per year 
the million  or  decrease in was principally due to the sale of the right to service million of mortgage loans on second home properties during the second quarter of a resulting gain of million is included in other operating income

credit card loans and related plans were million and million of total consumer loans at december  and  respect ively 
the following table summarizes the composition of the company s loan portfolio at the dates indicated 
december  in thousands commercial      real estate residential      commercial      construction      total real estate      consumer      total loans  net of unearned income      includes loans to massachusetts and vermont municipalities and industrial revenue bonds of     and  for years through  respectively 
the following table details the loan maturity and interest rate sensi tivity of loans  exclusive of loans secured by family residential property and consumer loans  at december  repricing after one after within but within five one year five years years total in thousands loans with fixed interest rates     with variable interest rates     total     nonperforming assets and risk elements it is the company s policy to manage the loan portfolio so as to recognize and respond to problem loans at an early stage and thereby minimize losses 
all new loan originations  loan renewals  loans categorized as past due and classified loans are reviewed on a weekly basis by the administrative officers in charge of the commercial  mortgage and consumer loan portfolios 
in turn  the status of these loans is reported in detail to senior management and the loan committee of the board of directors on a monthly basis 
from these reviews  determinations are made on a case by case basis as to the collectibility of principal and interest 
nonreceipt of contractually due principal or interest payments on loans days after the due date results in their being reported as past due with increased monitoring and collecting efforts to restore such loans to current status 
mortgage loans are classified as nonaccrual when the become days past due or when foreclosure action is started  whichever is sooner 
commercial loans are placed on nonaccrual status when they become days past due as to principal or interest 
loans may be left in accrual status if they are adequately collateralized or are expected to result in collection within the next days 
cash payments received on loans in nonaccrual status are applied as principal re ductions 
while no specific period of delinquency triggers nonaccrual status for consumer loans  unsecured installment loans days or more past due and secured installment loans days or more past due are generally recommended for charge off 
a loan remains in nonaccrual status until the factors which indicate doubtful collectibility no longer exist and six consecutive months of contractual payments are received or until the loan is determined to be uncollectible and is charged off against the allowance for loan losses 
credit card loans are required to be charged off after days without a payment 
commercial loans days or more past due must be recommended for charge off unless management determines the collateral is sufficient 
when a mortgage loan in default is trans ferred to oreo  its carrying value is the lesser of the loan amount or the fair value of the property collateralizing the loan  less the estimated cost to sell the property 
a loan is classified as a re structured loan when the interest rate is materially reduced or when the term is extended beyond the original maturity date because of the in ability of the borrower to service the interest payments at the con tractual rate 
all of the million of accruing restructured loans as of december  were in full compliance with restructured terms and conditions 
the average yield on these loans is

interest income was recognized solely on nonaccrual loans which were subsequently determined to have no doubt as to the ultimate collectibility of prin cipal 
at december   all nonaccrual loans were collateralized 
in addition  it is the company s policy to obtain personal guarantees of the borrower s whenever it is possible 
as of december   of the total nonaccrual loans are current as to contractual terms 
loans to five borrowers  totaling million represented of nonaccrual loans 
management expects to see significant improvement in over the charged off loan total with a further decrease in the level of nonperforming assets 
management is not aware of any current recommen dations by regulatory authorities or suggestions with respect to loans classified as loss  doubtful  substandard or special mention which  if they were implemented  would have a material effect on the company 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is available to absorb future losses which are anticipated in the current loan portfolio 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  which is formally reviewed on a monthly basis by management  is evaluated according to the factors outlined in provision for loan losses 
to maintain the allowance at an adequate level  current earnings are charged with an amount necessary to restore the allowance to the desired level 
a loan loss is charged against the allowance when management believes the collectibility of principal and interest with respect to such loan is unlikely 
the allowance for loan losses equalled million  or of the total loan portfolio at december   compared with at year end and at year end on december  the allowance for loan losses represented of total nonperforming assets and of nonperforming loans  compared to and  respectively  at year end the following table provides an analysis of the allowance for loan losses and an analysis of loans charged off and recoveries by type of loan and for the years indicated

this compares with  or in and  or in in loans charged off for one customer totaled  no other charge offs exceeded of the respective year s net loans charged off 
while all segments of the company s loan portfolio are subject to continuous quality evaluation  there is no precise method for predicting loan losses 
an evaluation of the collectibility of a loan requires the exercise of management s judgment 
since the determination of the adequacy of the allowance is necessarily judgmental and involves con sideration of various factors and assumptions  management is of the opinion that an allocation of the reserve is not necessarily indicative of the specific amount of future charge offs or the specific loan categories in which these charge offs may ultimately occur 
the following table summarizes the allocation of the allowance for loan losses at december     and notwith standing these allocations  the entire allowance for loan losses is available to absorb charge offs in any category of loans 
also during the last five years  management provided an unallocated allowance for expected charge offs not specifically identified in the loan portfolio
