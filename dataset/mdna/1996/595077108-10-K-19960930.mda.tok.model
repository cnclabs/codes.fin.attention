new operating systems in august  microsoft corporation released windows  a bit operating system that is the successor product to the dos operating system and the windows operating environment 
almost all of the company s current products have been developed to be used with bit operating systems which also encompasses windows nt 
because windows is currently the most prevalent operating environment on pcs  windows and windows nt are expected to be the dominant operating systems in the future 
currently  the windows nt upgrade cycle is occurring at a slower rate than initially expected 
as the rate of upgrade to windows nt increases  it should initiate a strong product upgrade cycle as customers purchase bit applications that take advantage of the enhanced capabilities 
however  there can be no assurance that upgrades to windows nt will occur at a rate sufficient to benefit the company s efforts to sell its bit products 
the company s future revenue could be negatively impacted by the rate at which customers transition to the windows nt environments 
new product introductions the company s future financial performance will depend in significant part upon the successful development and introduction of new and enhanced versions of its products and customer acceptance of these products  of which there can be no assurance 
licensing agreements the company s business strategy includes entering into licensing agreements with third parties in an effort to increase brand awareness for the company s products by associating the micrografx name with products and services which customers already know 
one such licensing agreement is with hallmark cards  inc relating to the hallmark connections card studio product for the consumer greeting card software market 
the hallmark connections card studio product accounted for million or approximately of the company s fiscal revenues 
hallmark cards  inc has recently announced the introduction of a new product for the consumer greeting card market in conjunction with microsoft corporation which will compete directly with the company s greeting card products  and hallmark cards  inc has advised the company that it does not intend to renew the company s license agreement for the hallmark connections card studio product 
the license expires in september unless earlier terminated 
the company expects the new competing hallmark microsoft product to be shipped in the first quarter of fiscal in light of the above  the company has entered into a licensing agreement with american greetings corporation for a new product for the consumer greeting card market  american greetings creatacard plus  to be shipped in the first quarter of fiscal based upon hallmark cards  inc s product introduction with microsoft  the maturing life cycle of the company s hallmark connections card studio product  increasing competition and other factors  the company expects that it will not be able to rely on continued sales of the hallmark connections card studio product  particularly not at the revenue levels experienced in fiscal therefore  the company expects that its success in the consumer greeting card software market will be dependent upon the successful market introduction and market acceptance of the american greetings creatacard plus  of which there can be no assurance 
because the american greetings product is a new market entrant in the consumer greeting card market  having a suggested retail price that is lower than the company s hallmark connections card studio and in light of the competition it will confront from the new hallmark microsoft product  there can be no assurance that in fiscal the american greetings product  when combined with sales of the hallmark connections card studio product  will generate revenues which are comparable to the revenues generated by the hallmark connections card studio product in fiscal the company s product offering in fiscal included crayola art and crayola art studio  pursuant to a license agreement between the company and binney smith properties  inc  a subsidiary of hallmark cards  inc 
together these products accounted for million or of fiscal revenues 
this license agreement expires on december   at which time the company must discontinue distribution of these products  except that it may sell off existing inventories through march  the company does not expect that this license agreement will be renewed 
technological change the personal computer industry is subject to rapid technological change and continuing development of new and enhanced operating environments 
the success of the company s products will depend to a large extent upon the company s ability to continue to develop and introduce innovative and competitive products on a cost effective and timely basis  of which there can be no assurance 
competition the personal computer applications software market is highly competitive 
the company s competitors include many companies who have larger technical staffs  more established and larger marketing and sales organizations and significantly greater financial resources than does the company 
additionally  recent merger activity in the applications software market has served to strengthen the merging companies ability to compete 
international operations the company anticipates that international net revenues will continue to account for a significant portion of net revenues  which will result in a significant portion of the company s net revenues being subject to the risks inherent in international operations 
these risks include unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  exchange rates  tariffs and other barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary operations  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
changes in distribution channels the retail distribution channel for software products is currently undergoing significant changes  with the expansion of software products into mass merchandisers and computer superstores 
additionally  the company distributes its consumer products through channels not typically associated with software products  including mass merchandisers and toy stores 
the company s success depends in part on the ability to identify and respond to changes in the distribution channel 
seasonality the company s results of operations are subject to significant quarterly variations 
causes of these variations include seasonality of the retail software market  delays in the introduction of new or enhanced versions of the company s products  timing and cost of new product upgrades and introductions  and large distribution channel sales following the introduction of new or updated products 
historically  as is typical in the retail software industry  the company has experienced some seasonal variations in demand  with sales declining somewhat in the summer months and increasing somewhat during the christmas quarter and first calendar quarter 
upgrades product upgrades  which enable users to upgrade from earlier versions of the company s products  or from competitors products  typically have lower prices than new products  resulting in lower gross profit margins 
the company plans to continue upgrading successful products in the future 
internet the company provides products for use in the internet market 
the internet market is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an increasing number of market entrants 
as is typical in the case of a new and evolving industry  demand and market acceptance for recently introduced products and services are subject to a high level of uncertainty 
critical issues concerning the commercial use of the internet including security  reliability  cost  ease of use and access  and quality of service remain unresolved and may impact the growth of internet use  together with the software standards and electronic media employed in such markets 
gross profit product margins vary according to product mix and the geographical region in which the products are sold 
changes in product mix  including the mix of upgrade sales  the transition to suite products accompanied with value pricing  as well as changes in the components of direct costs  may negatively affect the company s gross profit in future periods 
liquidity and capital resources at june   the company s principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million 
the company maintains approximately million in total credit facilities  all of which was unused at june  as discussed in notes to consolidated financial statements  the company renewed its line of credit agreement effective january  the renewed line of credit remains secured by certain receivables and fixed assets and contains financial covenants  including limitations on minimum tangible net worth  net liquid assets and quick ratio  as defined 
the revolving line of credit is due on demand on january  and bears interest at the bank s prime rate at june  
cash flows during fiscal for the year ended june   cash provided by operating and financing activities exceeded cash used in investing activities  resulting in an increase in cash and cash equivalents of million 
cash flows from operating activities generated million in cash during fiscal  primarily due to positive income  and non cash expenses partially offset by higher receivables and a decrease in payables 
cash flows from investing activities used million during fiscal and consisted primarily of purchases of property and equipment  and additions to capitalized software development costs and acquired product rights 
expenditures for property and equipment during fiscal were million and consisted primarily of personal computer upgrades 
investments of million were also made in capitalized software development costs and acquired product rights related to the development of new and enhanced versions of the company s products 
cash flows from financing activities provided million in cash during fiscal  due primarily to proceeds received from employee stock programs 
this inflow of cash was partially offset by cash used to repay all outstanding notes payable and to repurchase approximately  shares of treasury stock 
capital resources as of june   the company had no significant commitments for capital expenditures 
the company believes that cash flow from operations  existing cash  and existing borrowing arrangements will be sufficient to meet the company s capital requirements in the short term the next months 
the company believes that thereafter its liquidity requirements could be met with cash flow from operations  and existing cash and short term investment balances 
other matters the assets and liabilities of non us operations are translated into non us dollars at exchange rates in effect as of the respective balance sheet dates  and revenue and expense accounts of these operations are translated at average exchange rates during the month the transactions occurred 
unrealized translation gains and losses are included as an adjustment to shareholders equity 
the company has mitigated a portion of its currency exposure through decentralized sales  marketing and administrative operations 
when necessary  the company may also hedge to prevent material exposure 
litigation the company is party to various legal proceedings arising from the normal course of business activities  none of which  in management s opinion  is expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations or its financial position
