item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources liquidity management involves the matching of the cash flow requirements of customers who may be either depositors desiring to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs and the ability of the company and the banks to meet those needs 
the company and the banks seek to meet liquidity requirements primarily through management of short term investments principally federal funds sold and monthly amortizing loans 
another source of liquidity is the repayment of maturing single payment loans 
also  the banks maintain relationships with correspondent banks which could provide funds to them on short notice  if needed 
the liquidity and capital resources of the company and the banks are monitored on a periodic basis by state and federal regulatory authorities 
as determined under guidelines established by these regulatory authorities  the banks liquidity ratios at december  were considered satisfactory 
at that date  the banks short term investments were adequate to cover any reasonably anticipated immediate need for funds 
at december   the company s and the banks capital asset ratios were considered adequate based on guidelines established by regulatory authorities 
during  the company increased its capital by  representing proceeds from exercise of common stock options 
it also increased its capital by retaining net earnings of  after payment of dividends 
after recording an increase in capital of  for unrealized gains on securities  net of taxes  total capital increased during by  at december   total capital of the company amounted to  at december   there were no binding outstanding commitments for capital expenditures 
however  the company anticipates that expenditures of approximately  will be required for expansion or relocation of properties which it plans to implement in in order to serve its customers and meet the needs of the citizens in the communities served by its banks 
in addition  the company has entered into definitive merger agreements for the acquisition of two bank holding companies in early  pending approval by regulatory authorities and shareholders of the companies being acquired 
it is expected that approximately  will be required to consummate these two acquisitions 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations the company s results of operations are determined by its ability to effectively manage interest income and expense  to minimize loan and investment losses  to generate noninterest income and to control noninterest expense 
since interest rates are determined by market forces and economic conditions beyond the control of the company  the ability to generate net interest income is dependent upon the banks ability to obtain an adequate spread between the rate earned on interest earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
thus  the key performance measure for net interest income is the interest margin or net yield  which is taxable equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets 
the primary component of consolidated earnings is net interest income  or the difference between interest income on interest earning assets and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest earning assets 
interest earning assets consist of loans  investment securities and federal funds sold 
interest bearing liabilities consist of deposits  of which approximately are noninterest bearing 
a portion of interest income is earned on tax exempt investments  such as state and municipal bonds 
in an effort to state this tax exempt income and its resultant yields on a basis comparable to all other taxable investments  an adjustment is made to analyze this income on a taxable equivalent basis 
the net interest margin increased by basis points or to in as compared to in this increase in net interest margin was achieved by an increase of basis points on average yield earned on interest earning assets accompanied by an increase of basis points in average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities

the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated periodically based on a review of all significant loans  with a particular emphasis on nonaccruing  past due and other loans that management believes require attention 
the provision for loan losses is a charge to earnings in the current period to replenish the allowance and maintain it at a level management has determined to be adequate 
the provision for loan losses charged to earnings amounted to  in   in and  in the increase in the provision for loan losses in of  or  as compared with was accompanied by an increase of in total loans in and an increase in the allowance for loan losses of

management considers the year end allowance for loan losses adequate to cover potential losses in the loan portfolio

federally tax exempt interest is presented on a taxable equivalent basis assuming a federal tax rate 
the change in interest attributable to rate has been determined by applying the change in rate between years to average balances outstanding in the later year 
the change in interest due to volume has been determined by applying the rate from the earlier year to the change in average balances outstanding between years 
thus  changes that are not solely due to volume have been consistently attributed to rate

this strategy is overseen in part through the direction of the asset and liability committee the alco committee of each bank  which establishes policies and monitors results to control interest rate sensitivity 
management s strategy is to maintain a balanced interest rate risk position to protect its net interest margin from market fluctuations 
to this end  the alco committee of each bank reviews  on a monthly basis  the maturity and repricing of assets and liabilities 
the company has adopted a goal of achieving and maintaining a one year gap ratio between rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities of to 
management believes that the type and amount of the company s interest rate sensitive liabilities a significant portion of which are composed of money market  now and savings accounts whose yields  to a certain extent  are subject to the discretion of management may reduce the potential impact that a rise in interest rates might have on the company s net interest income 
as of december   the company s cumulative one year interest rate sensitivity gap ratio was 
this indicates that the company s interest earning assets will reprice during this period at a rate slightly faster than the company s interest bearing liabilities 
certain assumptions regarding the interest sensitivity of these assets and liabilities have been incorporated into this analysis 
the company believes that it has positioned itself to maintain its net interest margin in the event of changes in interest rates 
there can be no assurance  however  that this strategy will be successful 
the following table sets forth the distribution of the repricing of abc s earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december   the interest rate sensitivity gap ie  interest rate sensitive assets less interest rate sensitive liabilities  the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio ie  interest rate sensitive assets divided by interest rate sensitivity liabilities and the cumulative sensitivity gap ratio 
the table also sets forth the time periods in which earning assets and liabilities will mature or may reprice in accordance with their contractual terms 
however  the table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the net interest margin since the repricing of various categories of assets and liabilities is subject to competitive pressures and the needs of the banks customers 
in addition  various assets and liabilities indicated as repricing within the same period may in fact reprice at different times within such period and at different rates 
at december  maturing or repricing within zero to three one three months to year to over months one year five years five years total dollars in thousands earning assets federal fund sold   investment securities      loans      interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand deposits    savings   certificates less than      certificates   and over     other short term borrowings   interest rate sensitivity gap      cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap     interest rate sensitivity gap ratio n a cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio the company has found that now checking accounts and savings deposits are generally not sensitive to changes in interest rates and  therefore  it has placed such liabilities in the one to five years category 
it has also found that the money market checking deposits reprice between three months to one year  on the average 
investment portfolio the company manages the mix of asset and liability maturities in an effort to control the effects of changes in the general level of interest rates on net interest income 
see asset liability management 
except for its effect on the general level of interest rates  inflation does not have a material impact on the company due to the rate variability and short term maturities of its earning assets 
in particular  approximately of the loan portfolio is comprised of loans which mature or reprice within one year or less 
mortgage loans  primarily with five to fifteen year maturities  are also made on a variable rate basis with rates being adjusted every one to five years

any loans classified by regulatory authorities as loss have been charged off 
commitments and lines of credit in the ordinary course of business  the banks have granted commitments to extend credit to approved customers 
generally  these commitments to extend credit have been granted on a temporary basis for seasonal or inventory requirements and have been approved by the banks board of directors 
the banks have also granted commitments to approved customers for standby letters of credit 
these commitments are recorded in the financial statements when funds are disbursed or the financial instruments become payable 
the banks use the same credit policies for these off balance sheet commitments as they do for financial instruments that are recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitment amounts expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
following is a summary of the commitments outstanding at december  and dollars in thousands commitments to extend credit   credit card commitments   standby letters of credit summary of loan loss experience the provision for possible loan losses is created by direct charges to operations 
losses on loans are charged against the allowance in the period in which such loans  in management s opinion  become uncollectible 
recoveries during the period are credited to this allowance 
the factors that influence management s judgment in determining the amount charged to operating expense are past loan experience  composition of the loan portfolio  evaluation of possible future losses  current economic conditions and other relevant factors 
the company s allowance for loan losses was approximately  at december   representing of year end total loans outstanding  compared with  at december   which represented of year end total loans outstanding 
the allowance for loan losses is reviewed quarterly based on management s evaluation of current risk characteristics of the loan portfolio  as well as the impact of prevailing and expected economic business conditions 
management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover possible loan losses on the loans outstanding 
management has not allocated the company s allowance for loan losses to specific categories of loans 
based on management s best estimate  approximately of the allowance should be allocated to real estate loans  to commercial  financial and agricultural loans and to consumer instalment loans as of december  the following table presents an analysis of the company s loan loss experience for the periods indicated december  dollars in thousands average amount of loans outstanding      balance of reserve for possible loan losses at beginning of period      charge offs commercial  financial and agricultural real estate  consumer recoveries commercial  financial and agricultural real estate consumer net charge offs   additions to reserve charged to operating expenses   allowance for loan losses of acquired subsidiary  balance of reserve for possible loan losses      ratio of net loan charge offs to average loans deposits average amount of deposits and average rate paid thereon  classified as to noninterest bearing demand deposits  interest bearing demand and savings deposits and time deposits  for the periods indicated are presented below
