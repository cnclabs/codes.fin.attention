item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
liquidity and capital resources during the dividend reinvestment and common stock purchase plan drip provided over  of new equity capital increasing the common stock equity component of the company s capitalization to  up from in utility plant additions were financed through cash provided by operating activities and funds received from others 
seasonal cash requirements were provided through interim bank borrowings 
interim bank loans payable at year end were approximately at the same level as last year 
management considers the current  line of credit with three banks adequate to finance expected short term borrowing requirements that may arise from operations during interest expense charged on interim bank loans will fluctuate subject to financial market conditions experienced during the year 
a return on average common equity was achieved in  up from in was the third consecutive year that interest coverage  the ratio of utility operating income plus federal and state income taxes to annualized interest expense on outstanding long term debt  exceeded times coverage 
rate relief and inflation the subsidiary s last rate increase was effective march  that rate decision included a allowed return on common equity and a allowed return on rate base 
future economic and financial market conditions  coupled with governmental regulations and fiscal policy  plus other factors which are unpredictable and often beyond the control of the company  will influence when future rate relief will be required 
construction expenditures mandated to comply with the amendments to the safe drinking water act sdwa will  when and if required  also affect water rates charged to customers 
a construction work in progress cwip rate surcharge calculated at the utility s last allowed return on rate base  applied to of the construction costs for new facilities mandated by the sdwa  is available to provide a cash return on the subsidiary s investment in sdwa mandated utility plant 
the subsidiary has collected a cwip surcharge in the past and expects to receive approval of a similar surcharge with respect to any future significant sdwa projects 
at this time management is not aware of any significant construction expenditures for new facilities presently mandated by the sdwa 
construction of a new rockville water treatment plant presently estimated to cost approximately  previously reported to begin in  has been delayed indefinitely 
instead  the existing water treatment plant will be refurbished in conjunction with related water distribution system improvements at an estimated cost of  over the next three years 
the new plant will be constructed when required by increased demand or increased sdwa requirements 
page the department of public utility control dpuc is authorized to approve an acquisition surcharge when it determines  in consultation with the department of public health dph  that a distressed water system should  or must  be acquired by a investor owned water company so as to assure the availability and potability of water and the provision of water at adequate volume and pressure to the customers served by the distressed water system 
this surcharge is based on the acquisition costs and construction improvements necessary to rehabilitate the acquired water company s system and may be calculated in a manner similar to the cwip surcharge 
the subsidiary had requested approval of such an acquisition surcharge in connection with the acquisition of the sound view water company system  mandated by the dpuc in the company received approval of a modified surcharge 
for more information see outlook for the company intends to apply for approval of an acquisition surcharge with respect to any other mandated water company acquisitions  although there is no assurance that the dpuc will permit such a surcharge 
the company  like all other businesses  is affected by inflation  most notably by the continually increasing costs required to maintain  improve  and expand its service capability 
the cumulative effect of inflation results in significantly higher facility replacement costs which must be recovered from future cash flow 
the ability of the company to recover this increased investment in facilities is dependent upon future revenue increases which are subject to approval by the dpuc 
management does not presently plan to petition the dpuc for an increase in permanent rates or to implement a cwip surcharge in outlook for the company s profitability is primarily attributable to the sale and distribution of water  the amount of which is dependent on seasonal weather fluctuations throughout the year and particularly during the summer months when water demand will vary with rainfall and temperature levels 
the board of directors has approved a  construction budget for funds provided by operating activities  given normal weather patterns and related operating revenue billings  are expected to finance approximately of this construction program 
refer to note  utility plant and construction program  in notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the subsidiary s future construction program 
the remainder of the construction program is expected to be financed through new equity capital from the drip and  if necessary  interim bank loans 
the dpuc mandated the subsidiary s takeover of the sound view water company water system in improvements to this water system over the next two years are estimated to cost  the dpuc decision on this matter approved an acquisition surcharge to be charged to the approximate former customers of sound view through and recognition of capital costs to finance the improvements in a manner similar to afudc until the subsidiary s next change in permanent rates 
page through december   the company has expended almost  in its effort to remediate the reynolds bridge well field rbwf contaminated with mtbe  a gasoline additive 
these costs have been deferred 
additional expenditures of approximately  related to this remediation effort are expected to be incurred in  and will also be deferred as management expects that these costs and future related costs will be recovered from the responsible parties  or through rates charged to customers
