fiscal contains fifty three weeks and fiscal years and contain fifty two weeks 
as such  the increases and decreases in operating results for the comparative periods  as discussed below  were partially attributable to the additional week of operations in fiscal in thousands net sales specialty steel segment koppel    newport    adhesives segment    cost of products sold specialty steel segment koppel    newport    adhesives segment    operating income loss specialty steel segment koppel    newport    adhesives segment    corporate allocations    shipment and sales data for the company s specialty steel segment for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended september  were as follows tons shipped koppel seamless tubular products    sbq products    newport welded tubular products    hot rolled coils and other products    net sales s koppel seamless tubular products    sbq products    newport welded tubular products    hot rolled coils and other products    fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  net sales in fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal to million 
specialty steel segment net sales increased million  or  and the adhesives segment net sales increased million  or  from fiscal the overall increase in specialty steel segment net sales was primarily attributable to increased shipments of the company s tubular products as more fully discussed below 
seamless tubular net sales increased million  or  on a volume increase of 
the increases in seamless tubular net sales and shipments were primarily due to increases in seamless octg product shipments and average selling prices which were attributable in part to a decline in the level of foreign imports  increased off shore drilling activity  as well as  with respect to pricing  changes in octg product mix 
fiscal average selling price for all seamless tubular products increased from fiscal welded tubular net sales increased million  or  on a volume increase of 
the increase in welded tubular net sales was primarily attributable to an increase in shipments of both welded line pipe products and welded octg products 
average selling price for all welded tubular products was essentially unchanged from fiscal the demand for the company s octg products is cyclical in nature  being primarily dependent on the number and depth of oil and natural gas wells being drilled in the united states and globally 
the average number of oil and natural gas drilling rigs in operation in the united states rig count was in fiscal  up from in fiscal the level of drilling activity is largely a function of the current prices of oil and natural gas and the industry s future price expectations 
demand for octg products is also influenced by the levels of inventory held by producers  distributors and end users 
in addition  the demand for octg products produced domestically is also significantly impacted by the level of foreign imports of octg products 
the level of octg imports is affected by i the value of the us dollar versus other key currencies  ii overall world demand for octg products  iii the production cost competitiveness of domestic producers  iv trade practices of  and government subsidies to  foreign producers  and v the presence or absence of governmentally imposed trade restrictions in the united states 
in july  the united states imposed duties on imports of various octg products from certain foreign countries in response to antidumping and countervailing duty cases filed by several us steel companies trade cases 
several foreign octg producers  as well as certain us producers  have appealed the determinations to international courts or panels 
the company cannot predict the outcome or timing of these appeals at this time
