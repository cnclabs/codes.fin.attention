increases in sales of products introduced in late and including cimetidine hcl solution  clobetasol cream and ointment  clemastine fumarate syrup and a number of other over the counter and prescription products  some price increases and increased volume in a number of products were offset by declines in the volume of cough and cold products sold due to a mild flu season in early as well as the discontinuance of products containing iodinated glycerol in july of animal health segment revenues increased primarily due to the acquisition of the wade jones company  inc in july in addition  revenue increases were achieved due to higher sales internationally and  to a lesser extent  domestically  of disease preventative products used in poultry markets and sales of products made pursuant to a poultry products distribution agreement signed with merck agvet in july the company has been informed that merck agvet may sell the poultry products line 
if it is sold the distribution agreement may be renegotiated 
bmdr sales increased marginally with volume gains in poultry markets  offset by lower volume in the domestic swine market which was impacted by adverse economic conditions experienced by pork producers

on a consolidated basis gross profit increased million and the gross margin percent increased to in compared to in gross profit dollars in hps accounted for a substantial amount of the dollar increase due to increased sales volume especially by the ipd  production efficiencies  the effect of translation of gross profits in dkk and nok into us dollars for both the ipd and fcd and selected price increases partially offset by the elimination of sales of high margin iodinated glycerol products 
gross profit percentages improved in hps as a result of increases in gross margin percentages and amounts in ipd and fcd which have higher than the prior years average gross margin percentage 
accordingly  the overall percentage increase is attributable to the hps 
gross profit dollars in the animal health segment increased at a rate lower than the sales increase 
the gross profit percent declined due to sales increases attributable to the wade jones company  inc  a distributor to the poultry market  and sales made pursuant to a poultry product distribution agreement with merck agvet

the company estimates that interest expense calculated on a comparable basis in would have been approximately million higher 
other income expense  net for includes net foreign exchange transaction losses of approximately 
million resulting from the translation of non functional currency receivables net of non functional currency payables and forward foreign exchange contracts 
the losses were primarily recorded by the company s subsidiaries in norway and denmark in the first quarter of and primarily relate to sales denominated in currencies ie ie dollar  swedish kroner  british pound and portuguese escudo which depreciated significantly in the first quarter compared to the nok and dkk

the volume increase was fueled by products introduced in late  epinephrine mist and clotrimazole cream and products introduced in cimetidine liquid  clobetasol cream and ointment  miconazole suppositories and clemastine liquid 
on an overall basis price increases for certain products offset and slightly exceeded price declines for other products caused by competitive pressures 
ipd  including oral health care  also accounted for a portion of the revenue increase due primarily to volume  and where permitted by local conditions selected price increases 
oral health care revenues increased by million and the related operating loss declined due to continued penetration in markets where approval has been received  especially sweden

ipd and fcd generally maintained gross margins in line with revenue increases 
gross profit dollars in the ahs increased at a rate less than the sales increase as the gross margin percent declined slightly 
the gross margin percent for the ahd declined mainly due to competitive pressure on bmdr prices and due to the acquisition of the wade jones company  a distributor to the poultry market  and sales made pursuant to a distribution agreement with merck agvet for poultry products

previous restated periods do not include the interest expense on the purchase price of million and other transaction costs which would have been incurred had the acquisition actually taken place in prior periods 
the company estimates interest calculated on a comparable basis for and would have been approximately million and million higher  respectively 
the provision for income taxes in exceeded pre tax income compared to a more representative tax rate in the disproportionate relationship is the result of low pre tax income due to the transaction costs and post combination actions which magnifies the effect of non deductible expenses principally goodwill amortization and portions of the transaction costs capitalized for tax purposes 
results for include an extraordinary item for a loss on extinguishment of debt 
the loss of 
million million less a tax benefit of 
million results from the expensing of debt issuance costs related to the previously existing debt when the company refinanced such debt with a million credit agreement 
inflation the effect of inflation on the company s operations during  and was not significant 
governmental actions affecting the company the company s operations in all countries are subject to regulation which includes inspections of manufacturing facilities  requires approvals to market products  and can result in the recall of products and suspension of production 
in the united states the food and drug administration fda has imposed more stringent regulatory requirements on the pharmaceutical industry 
the us manufacturing companies included in the company s human pharmaceuticals segment  barre  nmc  and able  are affected in that they are required to comply with the fda s interpretation of cgmp 
in this regard  barre and able are parties to separate consent decrees with the fda which define the specific standards they must meet to comply with cgmp 
in  and  regulatory compliance has continued to affect costs directly by requiring the addition of personnel  programs and capital and indirectly by adding activities without directly increasing efficiency 
the costs both direct and indirect of regulatory compliance which have increased in recent years may continue to increase in the future 
in july  the company ceased the marketing of products which contain iodinated glycerol 
the cessation was the result of an industry wide banning of such products by the fda 
because the fda allowed for an orderly cessation of sales of these products the immediate impact was minimized 
iodinated glycerol products represented approximately of the company s sales and the loss of sales of these products has negatively impacted the company s operations 
the company and its subsidiaries have filed applications to market products with regulatory agencies both in the us and internationally 
the timing of receipt of approvals of these applications can significantly increase future revenues and income 
the company cannot control or predict with accuracy whether such applications will be approved or the timing of their approval 
post combination management actions in december  the company announced a number of management actions which included staff reductions and certain product line and facilities rationalizations as a first step toward realizing combination synergies and maximizing the overall position of the newly combined company 
as a part of the december management actions  the company discontinued funding research projects relating to the colonic delivery of drugs and committed to disposing of the resultant equity interest in the r d company performing the research 
in september  the company announced additional management actions which continue the process begun in december the actions include elimination of up to positions company wide employees were severed in  further efforts toward consolidation of operations in the company s uspd  the utilization of substantial consulting resources focused primarily on accelerating the realization of certain combination benefits in the ipd and the sale in september of its minority equity position and certain other rights in the r d company 
in addition  announced management actions related to the uspd include a plan to transfer all suppository and cream and ointment production from two present locations to the lincolnton  nc location 
the transfer of prescription products requires the company to obtain the approval of the fda for each product transferred 
the entire process is expected to take from to months 
the process  however  may take longer due to the required fda approval 
the company cannot predict with certainty fda timing or approval 
because of the time necessary to achieve the transfer the company has instituted a retention program which assures each nmc employee a retention payment if the employee remains employed until terminated by the company 
if the employee leaves of their own accord no payment is made 
the company has commenced accruing the estimated retention payment over the period which employees are expected to be employed 
if all affected employees stay until termination the company estimates the retention payments will total approximately million 
as part of the post combination management actions in the company provided for the exiting of the us tablet business by the most probable exit plan ie sale 
however  if such exit by sale should fail to be consummated  an adjustment for additional future costs including severance for tablet business employees could be required 
the company was not successful in selling the tablet business in although extensive negotiations were held with prospective buyers 
efforts to sell the tablet business are continuing 
the and post combination management actions included severing certain employees 
as a result of the personnel actions  the company believes that approximately million of annual payroll and payroll related costs have been eliminated 
the company is continuing to study other opportunities to rationalize personnel functions and operations  both selectively and on a location basis  and accordingly  similar management actions may be initiated in the future 
in  the ipd has continued incurring consulting expenses at a reduced level from and is taking and considering additional actions which are designed to further strengthen the competitive nature of the division by lowering costs 
in the first quarter of  the ipd has severed sales and marketing personnel primarily in the nordic countries and will incur termination related costs of approximately million 
the company also announced that a preliminary study of production rationalization alternatives between the ipd s copenhagen  denmark and lier  norway manufacturing facilities has identified potential benefits 
based on these findings  a detailed study is being initiated which is expected to be completed in the second quarter of the company expects that the detailed study will result in a formal rationalization proposal which may result in charges for severance  write downs of fixed assets  and other exit costs 
any such plan will require approval by the board of directors 
european operations the fluctuations of european currencies have and will continue to impact the company s european operations which comprise approximately of revenues in in addition  many european governments have enacted or are in the process of enacting mechanisms aimed at lowering the cost of pharmaceuticals 
currency fluctuations and governmental actions to reduce or not allow increases of prices have affected revenue 
the company cannot predict future currency fluctuations or future governmental pricing actions or their impact on the company s results 
liquidity and capital resources at december   stockholders equity was million compared to million and million at december   and  respectively 
the ratio of long term debt to equity was  and 
at december   and  respectively 
the increase in stockholder s equity and subsequent improvement in the ratio in primarily reflects the earnings of the company and an increase in the translation adjustment million due to the strengthening of the dk and nok in coupled with scheduled repayments of long term debt 
the increase in the ratio from to reflects the financing required for the acquisition of al oslo  significant capital expenditures in  and increased working capital requirements 
additionally  the required accounting for the al oslo acquisition magnified the change in the ratio since restated prior year financials include al oslo s equity as part of restated stockholders equity and upon acquisition  the cash purchase price  million  was deducted from stockholders equity and in effect  added to long term debt ie the acquisition was financed 
working capital at december  was million compared to million and million at december  and  respectively 
the current ratio was at december  compared to and at december  and  respectively 
working capital increased in relative to and primarily due to increases in accounts receivable and inventory partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
accounts receivable increased due to seasonal sales of liquid pharmaceuticals by the uspd  and increased fourth quarter sales by the european subsidiaries 
inventory increased due to planned increases in animal health inventories and higher inventories for european subsidiaries to meet higher expected demand 
all working capital elements also increased in in us dollars as the functional currencies of the company s principal foreign subsidiaries  the danish krone and norwegian krone  strengthened versus the us dollar as compared to by approximately and  respectively 
the approximate increase due to currency translation was accounts receivable million  inventory million and accounts payable and accrued expenses million 
the company presently has various capital expenditure programs under way and planned including the expansion of a fermentation facilities in copenhagen  denmark and skoyen and overhalla  norway 
in  the company s capital expenditures were million and in the company plans to spend a higher amount than if anticipated sales growth occurs the company will have increased working capital requirements 
at december   the company had million available under existing short term unused lines of credit and million in cash 
in addition  the company has million available in europe under long term lines of credit and million available under a revolving credit facility which was included in the million credit facility 
the company believes that the combination of cash from operations and funds available under existing lines of credit will be sufficient to cover its currently planned operating needs 
a substantial portion of the company s short term and long term debt is at variable interest rates 
at december   the company has entered into interest rate agreements to fix the interest rates for million of the variable debt at plus the required margin through october and for million of debt at for six months 
the company is considering similar transactions to fix additional variable rate debt for specified periods to minimize the impact of future changes in interest rates 
the company s policy is to selectively enter into plain vanilla agreements to fix interest rates for existing debt if it is deemed prudent 
the million credit facility contains various financial covenants including the maintenance of minimum equity to assets  current and interest coverage ratios 
the equity to asset ratio requires the company maintain stockholders equity plus adjustments of at least of total assets 
unless waived  this ratio will in effect require the company to issue equity in the near term if significant additional funding for acquisitions or other purposes is required
