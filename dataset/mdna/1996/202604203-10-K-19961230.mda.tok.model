item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the company generated operating income during fiscal and and focused on increasing penetration and subscriber usage 
in addition  the company expects that operating income before depreciation and amortization ebitda  which was positive during the fiscal years ended september  and  will also be positive in future fiscal years although there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
certain financial analysts consider ebitda a meaningful measure of an entity s ability to meet long term financial obligations  and growth in ebitda a meaningful barometer of future profitability  especially in a capital intensive industry such as cellular telecommunications 
however  ebitda should not be considered in isolation to  or be construed as having greater significance than  other indicators of an entity s performance 
the results discussed below may not be indicative of future results 
consolidated results of operations include the revenues and expenses of those markets in which the company holds a greater than interest 
the results of operations of markets  of which were consolidated for the entire period  are included in the consolidated results for the fiscal year ended september  the results of operations of markets  of which were consolidated for the entire period  are included in the consolidated results for the fiscal year ended september  the increase in the number of markets included in consolidated results is due to acquisitions consummated subsequent to september  consolidated results of operations also include the operations of cellular  inc financial corporation cifc  the company s wholly owned financing subsidiary  as well as the operations of cellular inc network corporation cinc  a wholly owned subsidiary through which the company holds interests in certain cellular licenses 
equity in net loss of affiliates includes the company s share of net loss in the markets in which the company s interest is or less but or greater 
for the fiscal year ended september   markets were accounted for under the equity method  compared to such markets for the fiscal year ended september  markets in which the company s interest is less than are accounted for under the cost method 
eighteen markets were accounted for under the cost method for both fiscal years ended september  and september  ii interest income reflects interest income derived from the financing activities of cifc and the company with nonconsolidated affiliates  as well as interest income derived from cash and short term investments of the company and its consolidated affiliates 
cifc has entered into loan agreements with the company s affiliates pursuant to which cifc makes loans to such entities for the purpose of financing or refinancing the affiliates costs of construction and operation of cellular telephone systems 
such loans are financed with funds borrowed by cifc from cobank  acb  as agent for a syndicate of lenders cobank and from the company 
at september   loans bore interest at the average cost of cifc borrowings 
from time to time  the company advances funds on an interim basis to affiliates 
these advances typically are refinanced through cifc 
to the extent that the cellular markets in which the company holds an interest generate positive cash flow  the cash is generally used to repay borrowings by the affiliates from cifc and thereafter will be used to make cash distributions to equity holders  including the company 
management believes there exists a seasonality in both service revenues  which tend to increase more rapidly in the third and fourth quarters  and operating expenses  which tend to be highest in the first quarter due to increased marketing activities and customer growth  which may cause operating income to vary from quarter to quarter 
in addition to historical information  this report includes certain forward looking statements regarding events and financial trends which may affect the company s future operating results and financial position 
such statements represent the company s reasonable judgment on the future and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company s actual results and financial position to differ materially 
such factors include  but are not limited to a change in economic conditions in the company s markets which adversely affects the level of demand for wireless services  greater than anticipated competition resulting in price reductions  new product offerings  or higher customer acquisition costs  better than expected customer growth necessitating increased investment in network capacity  negative economies that could result if one or more agreements to manage markets are not renewed  increased cellular fraud  the impact of new business opportunities requiring significant initial investments  and the impact of deployment of new technologies on capital spending 
results of operations fiscal year compared with fiscal year cellular service revenues  including in roaming revenues  increased from  for the year ended september  to  for the year ended september  the growth was primarily due to the increase in the number of subscribers in consolidated markets

in roaming revenues increased by  or  from  for the year ended september  to  for the year ended september  due to increased coverage in cellular markets and to industry wide subscriber increases 
in roaming revenues are expected to increase in the future as a result of further industry wide growth in subscribers and expansion of the company s coverage  particularly along highway corridors  however  roaming rates may decline  consistent with expected industry trends 
average monthly revenue per subscriber  including in roaming revenues  decreased from for the year ended september  to for the year ended september   reflecting the benefit of declining prices to the consumer and lower usage by new subscribers which is consistent with an overall industry trend

ii cost of cellular service decreased as a percentage of service revenues from in fiscal year to in fiscal year  as revenues derived from the growing subscriber base outpaced the fixed components of cost of service 
equipment sales decreased from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year due to the introduction of the company s new customer satisfaction and pricing program 
the program packages the use of a handset  airtime and long distance within one area code for one monthly fee  which results in no handset revenue 
however  certain customers are charged additional monthly fees  which are classified as service revenues  for use of higher end equipment 
such fees are not significant currently but are expected to increase in the future 
after january  sales of accessories accounted for the majority of the company s equipment sales 
cost of equipment sales decreased from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year approximately  and  of the fiscal year cost of equipment sales relates to equipment provided to new and existing customers  respectively  which the customers are required to return to the company if service is terminated 
although the company retains ownership of the equipment  it carries such equipment at no value on its balance sheet 
the company expects negative equipment margins in the future as the company subsidizes use of handsets to shift consumer focus to the value of cellular service 
however  the company expects to implement a refurbishment program during fiscal whereby returned handsets would be reconditioned at a nominal cost and placed back in service 
general and administrative costs of cellular operations increased from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year  due to the growth in the customer base and the number of consolidated markets 
the majority of these costs were incremental customer billing expense and customer service support staff  offset by reductions to bad debt expense

corporate costs and expenses in fiscal year were  which represented gross expenses of  less amounts allocated to nonconsolidated affiliates of  corporate costs and expenses in fiscal year were  which represented gross expenses of  less amounts allocated to nonconsolidated affiliates of  the increase in corporate costs and expenses was due primarily to acceleration of depreciation expense related to certain corporate assets  and expenses related to paging activities which were not allocated to affiliates 
equity in net loss of affiliates decreased from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year the decrease was due primarily to decreased losses in nonconsolidated affiliates 
management expects operating results of the markets that are accounted for under the equity method to continue to improve 
ii interest expense increased from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year due to the higher interest rate on the subordinated notes than on the convertible subordinated debentures which were redeemed with the proceeds of the sale of subordinated notes  and the higher accreted discount note balance
