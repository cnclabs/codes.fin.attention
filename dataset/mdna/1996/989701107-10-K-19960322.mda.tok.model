item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations as of and for the years ended december    and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and detailed information presented elsewhere herein 
operating results zions bancorporation s consolidated net income rose to million in as compared to net income of million in and million in net income per common share in was as compared to in and in earnings results for were positively affected in the net amount of  or 
per share due to the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles implemented during the first quarter of the year 
the company s earnings for the year ended december  were also negatively affected by a one time expense of  included in noninterest expenses related to early extinguishment of certain long term debt 
the earnings results for represent a historic high for income before income taxes and net income 
some of the factors affecting the increase in earnings were a million increase in net interest income  a million increase in service charges on deposit accounts  a million increase in other service charges  commissions and fees  a million increase in loan sales and servicing income and a million decrease in fdic premiums expense 
these increased contributions to income were partially offset by a million decrease in trading account income  a 
million increase in the provision for loan losses  a million increase in salaries and employee benefits  a million increase in furniture and equipment expense  a million increase in all remaining noninterest expenses  and a million increase in income taxes 
earnings performance net interest income  margin  and interest rate spreads net interest income is the difference between the total interest income generated by earning assets and the total interest cost of the funds used to finance assets 
net interest income is the largest component of the company s revenue 
the company s taxable equivalent net interest income increased by to million in compared to million in the increased level of taxable equivalent net interest income was influenced primarily by the increase in average earning assets and an increased spread between the prime lending rate and the short term us treasury rate 
the prime lending rate is the primary basis used for pricing the company s loans and the short term treasury rate is the index used for pricing many of the company s deposits 
the company attempts to minimize interest rate movement sensitivity through the management of interest rate maturities  and to a lesser extent  the use of off balance sheet arrangements such as interest rate caps  floors and interest rate exchange contract agreements 
during  the company had income net of expense of  from the use of such off balance sheet arrangements compared to  in and  in the company intends to continue to use such off balance sheet arrangements to the extent necessary to minimize its exposure to changes in prevailing interest rates 
net interest margin is a measure of the company s ability to generate net interest income and is computed by expressing net interest income stated on a fully taxable equivalent basis as a percentage of earnings assets 
the company s net interest margin was for as compared to in the increase in the margin was due primarily to the prime lending rate short term us treasury spread 
the prime day t bill spread was at december as compared to at december the company is unable to effectively and economically hedge this basis point risk through the use of off balance financial instruments 
the increase in net interest margin was partially offset by the continued securitized sales of loans 
securitized sales of loans convert net interest income from loans to other operating income 
the security resell agreements are primarily in us government and us government agency securities which offer low yields but represent low risk to the company and require no consolidated risk based capital 
the spread on average interest bearing funds is the difference between the yield on earning assets and on the cost of interest bearing funds 
the company s spread on average interest bearing funds was for as compared to in the spread on average interest bearing funds was positively affected by the same factors that increased the net interest margin 
consolidated average balances  the amount of interest earned or paid  the applicable interest rate for the various categories of earning assets and interest bearing funds which represent the components of net interest income for the year and the previous four years  and interest differentials on a taxable equivalent basis and the effect on net interest income of changes due to volume and rates for the years and  are shown in tables on pages which follow 
income computed on a taxable equivalent basis is income adjusted to make income and earning yields on assets exempt from income taxes comparable to other taxable income

in the tables on the proceeding pages  the principal amounts of nonaccrual and renegotiated loans have been included in the average loan balances used to determine the rate earned on loans 
interest income on nonaccrual loans is included in income only to the extent that cash payments have been received and not applied to principal and is accrued on restructured loans at the reduced rates 
certain restructured loan agreements call for additional interest to be paid on a deferred or contingent basis 
such interest is taken into income only as collected 
in the analysis of interest changes due to volume and rates  the changes due to the volume rate variance have been allocated to volume with the following exceptions when volume and rate have both increased  the variance has been allocated proportionately to both volume and rate  when the rate has increased and volume has decreased  the variance has been allocated to rate 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses in increased by to  as compared to  in and  in the increase in the loan loss provision resulted from net larger provisions in the company s banking subsidiaries in arizona and nevada 
while the increase in the provision is large as a percentage increase  the total provision remains at a low level  reflecting continued improvement in credit risk management and a continuing healthy economy which have produced decreases in nonperforming assets 
noninterest income the company s noninterest income increased by to million as compared to million in and million in service charges on deposits increased by in to million  primarily as a result of price increases and higher volumes in other service charges  commissions and fees increased by in to million  primarily as a result of increased fees relating to commercial loan originations 
such increased fees were partially offset by a decline in fees generated from sales of investment products through the company s discount brokerage operations and personal investment officers  as well as fees from mortgage loan originations during trading account income decreased by to million in as compared to 
million in  due primarily to a million trading loss during the first quarter of  which resulted in the transfer of zions first national bank s capital markets operation in new york city to the bank s headquarters in salt lake city 
loan sales and servicing income increased to million primarily as a result of increased income on real estate loans sold in and higher servicing fees during on securitized loans sold 
the company does not recognize an initial gain on the sale of loans but recognizes the income over the servicing life of the sale 
other income decreased by in to million  primarily as a result of a smaller gain on the sale of mortgage servicing rights reported in the smaller gain was partially offset by interest income received on a state income tax refund

liquidity is primarily provided by the regularly scheduled maturities of the company s investment and loan portfolios 
in addition  the company s liquidity is enhanced by the fact that cash  money market securities  and liquid investments  net of short term or purchased liabilities and wholesale deposits  totaled  million or of core deposits at december  the company s core deposits  consisting of demand  savings  and money market deposits  and small certificates of deposit  constituted of total deposits at december   as compared to at december  maturing balances in loan portfolios provide flexibility in managing cash flows 
maturity management of those funds is an important source of medium to long term liquidity 
the company s ability to raise funds in the capital markets through the securitization process and by debt issuances allows the company to take advantage of market opportunities to meet funding needs at a reasonable cost 
the parent company s cash requirements consist primarily of principal and interest payments on its borrowings  dividend payments to shareholders  and cash operating expenses 
the parent company s cash needs are routinely satisfied through payments by subsidiaries of dividends  proportionate shares of current income taxes  management and other fees  and principal and interest payments on subsidiary borrowings from the parent company 
interest rate sensitivity interest rate sensitivity measures the company s financial exposure to changes in interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity is  like liquidity  affected by maturities of assets and liabilities 
interest rate sensitivity is measured in terms of gaps  defined as the difference between volumes of assets and liabilities whose interest rates are subject to reset within specified periods of time  and duration  a measure of the weighted average expected lives of the cash flows from assets and liabilities 
the company  through the management of interest rate maturities and the use of off balance sheet arrangements such as interest rate caps  floors  futures  options  and interest rate exchange agreements  attempts to minimize the effect on net income of changes in interest rates 
the company s management exercises its best judgment in making assumptions with respect to prepayments  early withdrawals and other noncontrollable events in managing the company s exposure to changes in interest rates 
information as to the company s interest rate sensitivity is presented in a table that follows 
the interest rate gaps reported in the table arise when assets are funded with liabilities having different repricing intervals  after considering the effect of off balance sheet hedging financial instruments 
since these gaps are actively managed and change daily as the interest rate environment changes  positions at the end of any period may not be reflective of the company s interest rate position in subsequent periods

loans serviced in recent years  many banks and other financial institutions have had an increasing tendency to securitize loans by pooling and selling them to investors  with the servicing responsibilities and residual income in excess of financing costs  servicing expenses  and loan losses accruing to the originating institution 
the securitization of receivables can assist an institution in effectively utilizing its capital and enhancing its liquidity while a the same time limiting its exposure to loss 
the company s participation in the securitization process  as well as its participation in originating and selling mortgage loans  sba loans and student loans  has increased in recent years 
during the company securitized and sold home equity credit line receivables totaling million  credit card receivables totaling million  and automobile loans totaling million

to accomplish this task  the company has written and placed in effect loan policies to govern each of its loan portfolios 
loan policies assist the company in providing a framework for consistency in the acceptance of credit and a basis for sound credit decisions 
generally  the company makes its credit decisions based upon debtor cash flow and available collateral 
the company has structured its organization to separate the lending function from the credit administration function to strengthen the control and independent evaluation of credit activities 
in addition  the company has well defined standards for grading its loan portfolio  and maintains an internal credit examination department which periodically conducts examinations of the quality  documentation  and administration of the company s lending departments  and submits reports thereon to a committee of the board of directors 
emphasis is placed on early detection of potential problem credits so that action plans can be developed on a timely basis to mitigate losses 
another aspect of the company s credit risk management strategy is the diversification of the loan portfolio 
at year end  the company had of its portfolio in loans held for sale  in commercial loans  in real estate loans  in consumer loans  and in lease financing and other receivables 
the company s real estate portfolio is also diversified 
of the total real estate portfolio  is in real estate construction loans  is in home equity credit lines  is in family residential loans and is in commercial loans secured by real estate 
in addition  the company attempts to avoid the risk of an undue concentration of credits in a particular industry or trade group  as indicated by the commercial loan and lease portfolio being allocated over more than major industry classifications 
at year end  the larger concentrations in the commercial loan and leasing portfolios were in the manufacturing  real estate  business service  and retail industry groupings  which each comprised approximately of the portfolio 
the manufacturing group was also well diversified over several subcategories 
agricultural and mining loans comprise less than of total commercial loans 
the company has no significant exposure to highly leveraged transactions and has no foreign credits in its loan portfolio

management reviews loans graded special mention and monitors the status of such loans for becoming potential problem loans and their likelihood of becoming nonperforming loans 
management considered no loans as potential problem loans at december  and  compared to two loans totaling  at december  management believes that for the near future  potential problem loans should remain at a relatively low level 
the company s total recorded investment in impaired loans  in accordance with financial accounting standard statements  amounted to  as of december  the company considers a loan to be impaired when the accrual of interest has been discontinued and meets other criteria under the statements 
the amount of the impairment is measured based on the present value of expected cash flows  the observable market price of the loan  or the fair value of the collateral 
impairment losses are included in the allowance for loan losses through a provision for loan losses

nonperforming assets nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans  restructured loans  and other real estate owned 
loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when the loan is days or more past due as to principal or interest  unless the loan is in the process of collection and well secured 
consumer loans are not placed on a nonaccrual status inasmuch as they are generally charged off when they become days past due 
loans are occasionally restructured to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal payments when the financial condition of the borrower deteriorates and requires that the borrower be given temporary or permanent relief from the contractual terms of the credit 
other real estate owned is primarily acquired through or in lieu of foreclosure on credits that are secured by real estate

continuous efforts have been made to reduce nonperforming loans and to liquidate real estate owned properties in such a manner as to recover the greatest value possible 
significant steps have been taken during the last few years to strengthen the company s credit culture by implementing a number of initiatives designed to increase internal controls and improve early detection and resolution of problem loans

in analyzing the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses  management utilizes a comprehensive loan grading system to determine risk potential in the portfolio  and considers the results of independent internal and external credit reviews  historical charge off experience  and changes in the composition and volume of the portfolio 
other factors  such as general economic conditions and collateral values  are also considered 
larger problem credits are individually evaluated to determine appropriate reserve allocations 
additions to the allowance are based upon the resulting risk profile of the portfolio developed through the evaluation of the above factors

review of nonperforming loans and evaluation of the quality of the loan portfolio  as previously mentioned  results in the identification of certain loans with risk characteristics which warrant specific reserve allocations in the determination of the amount of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance is not allocated among all loan categories  and amounts allocated to specific categories are not necessarily indicative of future charge offs 
an amount in the allowance not specifically allocated by loan category is necessary in view of the fact that  while no loans were made with the expectation of loss  some loan losses inevitably occur
