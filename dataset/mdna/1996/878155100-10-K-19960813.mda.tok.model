c narrative description of business environmental services general 
the company s environmental services are provided through team environmental services  inc these services consist of leak sealing and mechanical services  as well as environmental monitoring services 
the company is one of the leaders in the industry in providing on stream repairs of leaks in piping systems and related equipment 
in conjunction with its leak sealing services  the company markets a line of products which includes both standard and custom designed clamps and enclosures for plant systems and pipelines 
the company s monitoring services provide fugitive emissions monitoring and reporting as required under the clean air act and title iii of the superfund amendments reauthorization act sara 
the company provides these services for approximately  customers in the chemical  petrochemical  refining  pulp and paper  power  steel and other industries 
most of the revenues and operating profits from the environmental services segment are provided by leak sealing services 
in fiscal   and  leak sealing services accounted for  and  respectively  of the company s consolidated revenues 
in fiscal  and  environmental consulting  engineering and monitoring services accounted for  and  respectively  of the company s consolidated revenues 
the company has sold its environmental consulting and engineering business 
team s environmental services segment operates through domestic locations in states and one international operating location in huddersfield  england  however  not all services and products are presently offered by all operating locations 
mechanical services are available on a national basis from certain of the company s locations  including the company s alvin  texas location 
in addition  certain environmental services are offered by the company internationally through licensees operating in countries 
leak sealing 
the company s leak sealing and other industrial repair services consist of on stream repairs of leaks in pipes  valves  flanges and other parts of piping systems and related equipment primarily in the chemical  refining and utility industries 
the company uses specially developed techniques  sealants and equipment for repairs 
many of the company s repairs are furnished as interim measures which allow plant systems to continue operating until more permanent repairs can be made during scheduled plant shutdowns 
the company s leak sealing services involve inspection of the leak by the company s field crew who records pertinent information about the faulty part of the system and transmits the information to the company s engineering department for determination of appropriate repair techniques 
repair materials such as clamps and enclosures are custom designed and manufactured at the company s facility in alvin  texas and delivered to the job site 
the company maintains an inventory of raw materials and semi finished clamps and enclosures to reduce the time required to manufacture the finished product 
installations of the clamps and enclosures for on steam repair work are then performed by the field crew using  in large part  materials and sealants that are developed and produced by the company 
subsequent to year end  the company s manufacturing center earned the international iso certification for its engineering design and manufacturing operations 
iso is the most stringent of all iso programs in which to be certified 
the company s non destructive repair methods do not compromise the integrity of its customer s process system and can be performed in temperature ranging from cryogenic to  degrees fahrenheit and with pressures from vacuum to  pounds per square inch 
the company s sealants are specifically formulated to repair leaks involving over different kinds of chemicals 
the company also offers live loading services  which are used to repair valves and flanges 
the company utilizes live loading services through the installation of a spring loaded assembly  which automatically maintains constant pressure on valve packing material thereby ensuring performance of the valve and preventing leakage 
management attributes the success of its leak sealing division to be substantially due to the quality and timely performance of its services by its highly  in house trained technicians  its proprietary techniques and materials and its ability to repair leaks without shutting down the customer s operating system 
on stream repairs can prevent a customer s continued loss of energy or materials through leaks  thereby avoiding costly energy and production losses that accompany equipment shutdowns  and also lessen fugitive emissions escaping into the atmosphere 
the company has continued to develop different types of standard and custom designed clamps  enclosures and other repair products which complement the company s existing industrial market for leak sealing services 
the company s leak sealing services are supported by an in house quality assurance quality control program that monitors the design and manufacture of each product to assure materials traceability on critical jobs and to ensure compliance with customers requirements 
mechanical 
the company s mechanical services consist primarily of hot tapping and line stop registered trademark services 
hot tapping services involve utilizing special equipment to cut a hole in a pipeline so that a new line can be connected onto the existing line without interrupting operations 
hot tapping is frequently used for making branch connections into piping systems while the production process is operative 
line stop registered trademark services permit the line to be depressurized downstream so that maintenance work can be performed on the piping system 
the company typically performs these services by mechanically cutting into the pipeline and installing a device to stop the process flow 
the company also utilizes a line freezing procedure when applicable to stop the process flow using special equipment and techniques 
emissions monitoring and control 
the company also provides leak detection services that include fugitive emissions identification  monitoring  data management and reporting services primarily for the chemical  refining and utility industries 
these services are designed to monitor and record emissions from specific process equipment components as requested by the customer  typically to assist the customer in establishing an ongoing maintenance program and or complying with the clean air act  sara and other present and or future environmental regulations 
the company prepares standard reports in conjunction with us environmental protection agency epa requirements or can custom design these reports to its customers specifications 
the company is currently updating the teamware registered trademark software system to include new features that enhance the data management capabilities 
emissions data is electronically recorded at the customer s site via a data capturing process utilizing computerized monitoring equipment 
the data is then transferred to the company s central computer for data management 
this information is then processed by the company s teamware registered trademark software system  which provides for internal quality checks and efficient data processing and report generation 
this system allows for a large number of reports to be generated that are specific to a customer s needs 
the company maintains customer data for compliance purposes and for use in future reports that may be requested or required 
the company also offers its customers a software package named customware registered trademark  which provides the transfer of monitoring data from the company to the customer 
this gives the customer the ability to perform queries on the data to analyze the results of monitoring and to maintain information for its maintenance departments 
recently  the company has selected the leaktracker registered trademark system as the data collection device to provide the highest quality and flexibility to handle a plant s fugitive emissions monitoring program 
additionally  team has expanded its data management capabilities to include the use of other commercially available software packages that meet customers specific needs 
the clean air act amendments established a list of hazardous air pollutants which must be monitored and controlled and  pursuant to these amendments  regulations have been passed concerning many of these pollutants 
the epa has both proposed and issued final rules and regulations to achieve a substantial percentage of the clean air act s goals  which were to be implemented over several years 
additionally  title iii of the sara establishes requirements that facilities releasing toxic chemicals into the air  water or land must report emissions to regulatory agencies or be subject to fines and penalties 
affected facilities were expected to further increase their leak detection and repair as well as other emission reduction programs 
due to the fact that the implementation of certain of these rules and regulations has been delayed  demand for emissions monitoring has not increased as expected 
should additional legislation be enacted or the rules and regulations promulgated by the epa implemented  demand for emissions monitoring should increase 
customers are  however  required to monitor and report their emissions on an ongoing basis 
environmental consulting and engineering 
effective may   the company sold substantially all of the operating assets of its environmental consulting and engineering division 
the environmental consulting and engineering division was located in two major locations  houston  texas and san marcos  california 
the assets of the division located in san marcos  california were purchased by a privately held california company owned by former employees of the company 
the assets of the division located in houston  texas were purchased by a publicly held corporation 
further  the company sold the assets of the source emissions testing business to a privately held louisiana corporation 
no officer or director of team was a member of any of the above acquiring groups 
management believes that the aforementioned sales will allow the company to concentrate on improving the profitability of its environmental services segment 
the proceeds of the sale were used to reduce short and long term debt as required by the company s credit agreement 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
marketing and customers 
environmental services are marketed principally by marketing and professional personnel based at the company s various locations 
these services are provided through certain of the company s domestic locations 
the company has developed a cross marketing program to utilize its sales personnel in offering many of the company s services at its operating locations 
management believes that this business segment s operating and office locations are situated to facilitate timely response to customer needs  which is an important feature of its services 
no customer in this industry segment accounted for or more of consolidated company revenues during any of the last three fiscal years 
generally  customers are billed on a time and materials basis although some work may be performed pursuant to a fixed price bid 
emission control services are typically billed based on the number of components monitored 
services are usually performed pursuant to purchase orders issued under written customer agreements 
while some purchase orders provide for the performance of a single job  others provide for services to be performed for a term of one year or less 
in addition  team is party to certain long term contracts 
substantially all such agreements may be terminated by either party on short notice 
the agreements generally specify the range of services to be performed and the hourly rates for labor 
while contracts have traditionally been entered into for specific plants or locations over the past few years  the company has entered into several regional or national contracts which cover multiple plants or locations 
the company s leak sealing services are available hours a day  seven days a week 
the company typically provides various limited warranties for certain of its repair services 
to date  there have been no significant warranty claims filed against the company 
business strategy 
the company believes that the aging of its customers plants should result in increasing demand for its industrial and environmental services 
additionally  the company intends to expand its business by marketing more of its services to existing customers  marketing its services to new customers and expanding geographically  both domestically and internationally 
team may also increase its services through acquisitions or internal development of new services and technologies 
a variety of risks are inherent in this strategy 
marketing efforts may not generate increases in revenues as expected  although management believes sufficient qualified personnel are available in most areas  no assurance can be made that such personnel will be available when needed  growth may require additional capital that the company may be unable to obtain  and the company may be unable to develop profitable new services and technologies or acquire companies that provide such services on terms that permit an acceptable rate of return 
additionally  weak economics in the markets served by the company may constrain market demand 
although the company has a diversified customer base  a substantial portion of its business is dependent upon the chemical and refining industry sectors 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to implement its business strategy for this segment 
competition 
competition in the company s environmental services segment is primarily on the basis of service  product performance and price 
in general  competition stems from other outside service contractors and customers in house maintenance departments 
team believes it has a competitive advantage over plant maintenance departments due to its ability to perform quality leak sealing services on a timely basis  using special techniques and materials  while the customers equipment remains in service 
management believes team has a competitive advantage over most outside service contractors due to its in house and customer site specific trained technicians who are approved for immediate entry into the customer s facility  patented sealant materials  and iso quality procedures and specifications 
if  however  customers emphasize price over service and product performance  the company s competitive advantage may be impaired 
management knows of one outside service contractor of a similar size with which the company generally competes for leak sealing business 
other principal competitors are primarily regionally based companies that compete within a certain geographical area 
miscellaneous 
in general  the demand for the company s environmental services varies with the level of regulatory requirements  operations of its customers  the energy or product cost savings that may result from the company s services  and  with regard to the company s leak repair business  the length of time between scheduled plant maintenance shutdowns 
the company often experiences increased leak repair demand by customers in the winter due to the effect of weather conditions on piping systems and decreased leak repair demand in the late spring and summer due primarily to the timing of scheduled plant shutdowns 
to complement its leak sealing operations in the united states  the company has a wholly owned subsidiary in the united kingdom which operates as team environmental services  ltd 
in addition  to date the company has entered into license agreements in north america  south america  australia and the pacific rim and in europe and the mideast through teaminc europe  bv  a joint venture between team and a netherlands company  for the use of team s leak sealing technology 
most licensees are required to make a cash payment as initial consideration for the grant by the joint venture of the license 
substantially all licensees are required to make ongoing royalty payments  typically based on a percentage of its gross revenues from licensed operations 
to date  revenues to the company under these agreements have not been material 
the company is continuing to expand its leak sealing business outside the united states and expects to pursue similar license agreements for the use of company technology with other companies internationally 
in addition  the company is expanding the technology it provides under such license agreements to include certain other of its environmental services  such as fugitive emissions monitoring 
from time to time in the operation of its environmental consulting and engineering services  the assets of which have been sold  the company handled small quantities of certain hazardous wastes or other substances generated by its customers 
under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of the superfund act  the epa is authorized to take administrative and judicial action to either cause parties who are responsible under the superfund act for cleaning up any unauthorized release of hazardous substances to do so  or to clean up such hazardous substances and to seek reimbursement of the costs thereof from the responsible parties  who are jointly and severally liable for such costs under the superfund act 
the epa may also bring suit for treble damages from responsible parties who unreasonably refuse to voluntarily participate in such a clean up or funding thereof 
responsible parties include anyone who owns or operates the facility where the release occurred either currently and or at the time such hazardous substances were disposed of  or who by contract arranges for disposal  treatment  or transportation for disposal or treatment of a hazardous substance  or who accepts hazardous substances for transport to disposal or treatment facilities selected by such person from which there is a release 
management believes that its risk of liability is minimized since its handling consisted solely of maintaining and storing small samples of materials for laboratory analysis that are classified as hazardous 
the company does not currently carry insurance to cover liabilities which the company may incur under the superfund act or similar environmental statutes due to its prohibitive costs 
military housing projects during fiscal  subsidiaries of the company were awarded contracts to develop and construct four federal section military housing projects  aggregating single family homes  for the departments of the army  navy and air force  which were subsequently assigned to another subsidiary of the company  first america capital corporation  and its subsidiaries

this decrease resulted from lower revenues from the company s emissions monitoring and environmental consulting and engineering services primarily as a result of reduced reporting requirements by many of the company s customers due to the slowdown in environmental regulatory activity 
in addition  some of the company s customers have implemented internal reporting for emissions control services 
the company s leak sealing services business has remained stable while its mechanical hot tapping and line stop registered trademark services have increased 
operating expenses in the company s environmental services declined by from fiscal to fiscal  primarily due to lower personnel related costs 
gross margins declined from to as the company was not able to reduce costs sufficiently to offset the decline in revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal year compared to million in the prior year 
the company incurred one time charges of approximately million of general and administrative expenses that related primarily to certain compensation arrangements with former employees 
this increase was somewhat offset by the restructuring and relocation of its corporate office which resulted in lower personnel and general office costs 
interest expense of million was lower than in fiscal due to reduced average borrowing levels as well as lower interest rates 
the writedown of assets of million primarily reflected a million write off of goodwill pertaining to the environmental engineering and consulting services business  a  write off of obsolete inventory and a reserve of million for a note receivable obtained in the sale of a former business segment

fiscal compared to fiscal environmental services for the fiscal year ended may   revenues from the company s environmental services business totaled million  lower than revenues of million reported in the prior fiscal year 
weakness in demand for emissions monitoring and environmental consulting services resulted from reduced regulatory activity as many of the company s customers experienced decreased reporting requirements 
in addition  increased competition in leak repair and emissions monitoring led to lower prices for some of the company s services 
leak repair revenues also were adversely affected by the relatively mild weather experienced in the united states in the winter of colder weather often leads to higher demand for leak repair services due to the contractions of piping systems in process plants
