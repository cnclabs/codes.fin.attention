item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in thousands  except share and per share data introduction bea has become the world s leading supplier of commercial aircraft interior products through the strategic acquisitions of seating  inflight passenger entertainment and services systems pess and galley products businesses 
bea s products include an extensive line of first  business  tourist class and commuter seats  complete galley systems including coffee and beverage makers  ovens  liquid containers and refrigeration equipment  well as a line of inflight entertainment products including the recently introduced mdds 
bea markets and sells its products to its customers  the airlines  through an integrated worldwide approach  focused by airline and encompassing bea s entire product line 
bea s revenues are generally derived from two primary sources new aircraft deliveries and refurbishment or upgrade programs for the airlines existing worldwide fleets 
bea believes its large installed base of products  estimated to be approximately billion as of february  valued at replacement prices  gives it a significant advantage over competitors in obtaining orders for refurbishment programs  principally due to the tendency of the airlines to purchase equipment for such programs from the original supplier 
with the exception of spare parts sales  bea s revenues are generated from programs initiated by the airlines which may vary significantly from year to year in terms of size  mix of products and length of delivery 
as a result  bea s revenues and margins may fluctuate from period to period based upon the size and timing of the program and the type of products sold 
historically  bea experienced certain trends in its two revenue drivers as the airlines took deliveries of large numbers of new aircraft  refurbishment programs as a percentage of revenues declined and similarly  when new aircraft deliveries declined  refurbishment programs tended to increase in number and size 
changes in revenues by classes of product are the result of acquisitions and volume demand in the industry  as more fully described in the discussion and analysis that follows 
during the most recent airline industry recession  which ended in  the airlines significantly depleted their cash reserves and incurred record losses 
in an effort to improve their liquidity  the airlines conserved cash by reducing or deferring cabin interior refurbishment and upgrade programs and purchases of new aircraft 
as a result  in contrast with historical experience  bea experienced declines in the number of both new orders and refurbishments 
since early  the airlines have experienced a significant turnaround in operating results  with the domestic airline industry achieving record operating earnings during calendar the airline cabin interior products industry business cycle  however  generally lags that of the commercial airlines because of the airlines practice of gradually implementing refurbishment and replacement programs 
consequently  only in the past fiscal year has bea begun to experience growth in its backlog of seating and galley products  representing the first time in over two years bea has seen growth of new seating orders in excess of shipments 
management believes that the growth in backlog  which has historically preceded growth in bea s revenues  is an early reflection of the airlines need to begin refurbishing worn fleets and their ability to do so as a result of the strengthening of the airlines balance sheets 
the company expects the recent backlog growth to begin to be reflected in its operations beginning in its fiscal year commencing february  as the products are delivered 
notwithstanding the industry declines in recent years  bea has substantially expanded the size  scope and nature of its business as a result of a number of acquisitions 
during the fiscal year ended february   bea completed the following acquisitions on april   the company acquired  through a dutch holding company  all of the capital stock of inventum  a supplier of galley inserts including ovens  beverage makers and water boilers to airlines located primarily in europe and the pacific rim 
on august   the company acquired all of the capital stock of nordskog  an industry pioneer in galley structures and inserts 
on august   the company acquired all of the capital stock of acurex  the leading worldwide supplier of commercial aircraft refrigeration products 
on october   the company acquired substantially all of the assets and certain of the liabilities of airvision  a manufacturer of inflight entertainment equipment 
on january  the company acquired all of the stock of burns  an industry leader in commercial aircraft seating 
while the company will continue to be susceptible to industry wide conditions  management believes that the company s significantly more diversified product line and revenue base achieved through acquisitions has reduced its exposure to demand fluctuations in any one product area 
the burns acquisition will significantly impact bea s results of operations 
management believes the incremental cash flow arising from burns existing operations and further supplemented by the cost savings expected to be realized upon the business combination will be substantial 
bea believes there are significant opportunities and synergies in acquiring burns 
burns was one of the three leading north american suppliers of commercial aircraft passenger seats  with a base of airline customers that is largely complementary to that of bea 
prior to the acquisition  bea s and burns approximate share of the worldwide seating products market were and  respectively  based on fiscal unit sales 
seat manufacturing capacity utilization at the company s seating products division is approximately 
by consolidating engineering  marketing  administration and manufacturing operations of the two companies  bea will be able to reduce fixed costs  thereby enhancing its low cost position 
management believes that the combined company also will have among the most advanced manufacturing facilities in the commercial airline seating products industry 
following the acquisition  the company will have a substantial base of prestigious airline customers  including british air  cathay pacific  lufthansa  singapore  united  jal  southwest  klm  northwest  delta and others 
the company has specifically identified cost reductions resulting from the burns business integration plan which is being implemented 
the business integration plan contemplates i the elimination of duplicate executive  sales and marketing  research and engineering and administrative functions at burns  ii shifting burns seat assembly operations to bea s facilities and iii shifting certain of bea s seating fabrication operations to burns 
the cost reductions for cost of sales  selling  general and administrative expense and research and development expense are comprised of labor and overhead expenses that are expected to be eliminated in conjunction with the implementation of the burns business integration plan 
this business integration plan provides for the events generating the cost reductions to occur in phases  beginning in the initial year 
in conjunction with the implementation of the burns business integration plan  as of may  the company had implemented the following initiatives and actions i provided notice to employees and the applicable union of a plant closure ii met with employees in other affected locations to describe the pending reductions in force as a result of the shifting of certain processes between the two plants and iii eliminated certain redundant executive  sales marketing  research and engineering and administration personnel 
management believes that costs will be reduced substantially as a result of the burns integration plan

results of operations year ended february  compared with year ended february  sales for the year ended february  were  or greater than sales of  in the prior year 
this increase in sales is primarily related to the inclusion of results of operations of burns  which was acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal offsetting this increase in revenues was the negative impact of the ten week strike at boeing  which ended december  at february   the company s backlog stood at approximately million  up from million at february  the increase in backlog is attributable to the acquisition of burns  along with solid growth from orders placed by the airlines 
during the year ended february   and for the first time in over two years  the airlines placed orders for the company s seating and galley products in excess of its shipment levels  resulting in an increase in its seating and galley products backlog 
management estimates that approximately of its backlog is deliverable in fiscal gross profit was  or of sales for the year ended february  and was  less than gross profit for the prior year of  which represented of sales 
the decrease in gross profit during the year ended february  is primarily the result of the mix of products sold 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  of sales for the year ended february  this was  higher than the comparable period in the prior year of  of sales  principally due to costs associated with the burns acquisition and related organizational changes brought about by this acquisition  higher promotional and selling costs associated with bea s participation in annual industry trade shows  and higher medical benefits and legal costs during fiscal effective as of the beginning of fiscal the company changed its method of accounting for pre contract engineering expenditures associated with customer orders 
these expenditures  which previously were carried in inventory for amortization over future deliveries  are now expensed as incurred 
as a result of this change in accounting method  research  development and engineering for the year ended february  increased by  to  as compared to  in the prior year 
amortization expense for the year ended february  of  was  less than the amount recorded in the prior year and is due to the lower level of intangible assets being amortized during fiscal other expenses were  for the year ended february  and relate to costs associated with the integration and consolidation of the company s european seating business 
other expenses for the year ended february  were  and related primarily to a charge associated with bea s earlier generations of passenger entertainment systems 
interest expense  net was  for the year ended february  or  higher than the prior year 
this increase is the result of an increase in the amount of the company s long term debt outstanding  as well as higher interest rates 
no income tax benefit was provided for the year ended february  as compared to a tax benefit of  for the prior year 
the company recorded the cumulative effect of an accounting change of  during the year ended february  such amount represents the total amount of capitalized pre contract engineering costs which were included in inventories as of february  the net loss for fiscal was  or per share as compared to a net loss of  or 
per share in the prior year 
results of operations year ended february  fiscal compared with year ended february  fiscal sales for the year ended february  were  or higher than sales of  in the prior year 
the increase in sales was primarily related to the results of operations of businesses acquired at the end of the second quarter of fiscal the level of activity in the cabin interior products industry continued to reflect the depressed conditions within the airline industry 
at february   bea s backlog stood at million  up from million at february  substantially all of the growth in backlog was attributable to bea s inflight entertainment products  backlog for bea s seating and galley products continued to decline through fiscal as a result of the depressed conditions present in the airline industry 
gross profit was  or of sales  for the year ended february  and was  or  greater than the prior year s gross profit of  which represented of sales 
the increase in gross profit during the fiscal year ended february  was in large part the result of higher revenues associated with the businesses acquired at the end of the second quarter of fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were  or of sales  for the year ended february  this was  or  higher than the selling  general and administrative expenses for the comparable period in the prior year of  of sales  principally due to the acquisitions completed during fiscal research and development expenses were  or of sales  for the fiscal year ended february  for the prior year  research and development expenses were  or of sales 
the increase in research and development was attributable to bea s ongoing new product development programs 
amortization expense for the fiscal year ended february  of  was  or  higher than the amount recorded in the prior year  and was due to the acquisitions completed during fiscal other expenses consisted of a charge of  related primarily to intangible assets and inventories associated with bea s earlier generations of passenger entertainment systems 
the introduction of bea s mdds  which bea expects to become the industry s standard for inflight passenger and service entertainment  has captured the dominant market share with it receiving contract awards from major airlines totaling more than million during the fiscal year ended february  the mdds also caused major carriers to convert programs for earlier products of bea to the mdds and has resulted in two of bea s principal competitors offering to develop for the airlines systems similar to bea s mdds 
these events caused the inflight entertainment industry to re evaluate its product offerings and  in the process  have impaired the value of certain of its assets 
as a result  bea has written down certain of its assets principally related to its earlier systems 
principally due to the other expenses described above  bea recorded a net operating loss of  for the fiscal year ended february   as compared to operating earnings of  in the prior year 
operating earnings for the period before the special charge mentioned above were  net interest expense of  for the fiscal year ended february  was  or  higher than the prior year 
this increase was the result of an increase in the amount of bea s long term debt outstanding  as well as higher interest rates 
an income tax benefit of  of the loss before income taxes was recognized principally as the result of the charge described above 
income tax expense for the fiscal year ended february  was  or of earnings before income taxes 
the net loss for fiscal was  or 
per share as compared to net earnings of  or 
per share in the prior year  principally due to the charge 
results of operations year ended february  fiscal compared with year ended february  fiscal sales for the fiscal year ended february  were  or higher than sales of  for the prior year 
decreases in sales of seating and galley products were more than offset by revenues from the acquisitions completed during fiscal the sales performance during fiscal reflected the steep decline in new aircraft shipments to the airlines generally  the delays by the airlines in placing orders associated with bea s refurbishment  retrofit and spares programs and the timing of scheduled shipments within its backlog 
at february   bea s backlog stood at million  which was up from million at february   but reflects a decline of approximately million from the prior quarter 
this reversal in backlog growth and actual decrease versus the backlog level at november  reflected the airline environment in which programs were deferred by the airlines due to their financial status 
gross profit was  or of sales  for fiscal and was  or  higher than the prior year s gross profit of  which represented of sales 
the increase in gross profit during fiscal was due principally to revenue mix and lower manufacturing costs associated with certain products 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  or of sales  for fiscal this was  or  higher than selling  general and administrative expenses for the prior year of  of sales  principally due to the acquisitions completed during fiscal research and development expenses were  or of sales  for fiscal research and development expenses were  or of sales  for the prior year 
the change in spending between the years is reflective of the status of bea s various research and development programs 
amortization expense for fiscal of  was  or  higher than the amount recorded in fiscal the increase in amortization expense was due to higher levels of intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions completed during fiscal operating earnings for the fiscal year ended february  were  or  less than the prior year 
net interest expense of  for fiscal was  or  higher than net interest expense of  recorded for the prior year  and was due to the increase in bea s long term debt outstanding during fiscal  principally related to the issuance of the senior notes 
the proceeds from the sale of bea s senior notes that had not been deployed in its business were invested in interest bearing cash equivalents during fiscal at an average rate of approximately 
interest income related to these cash equivalents during fiscal was  income tax expense for fiscal was  or of earnings before income taxes  as compared to a tax rate of for fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate during increase was due principally to the nondeductible portion of amortization expense associated with the acquisitions completed by bea during fiscal net earnings were  or 
per share for fiscal as compared to  or 
per share in the prior year 
the decrease in earnings per share reflects the impact of lower net earnings  as well as a increase in the number of common and common equivalent shares from year to year 
liquidity and capital resources bea s primary requirements for working capital have been directly related to its accounts receivable and inventory levels  costs associated with the design and development of the mdds and other products and scheduled interest payments on its indebtedness 
bea s working capital was  as of february  compared to  as of february  in january the company amended its existing credit facilities by increasing the aggregate principal amount that may be borrowed thereunder to  the bank credit facility 
the bank credit facility consists of a  reducing revolver and a  revolving facility 
the amount of the reducing revolver will be reduced automatically by on april  and on each of the seven succeeding quarterly anniversaries of such date 
the reducing revolver is collateralized by all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of acurex and has a five year maturity  with the commitments of the lenders thereunder reducing during such five year period  and the revolving facility is collateralized by all of the company s accounts receivable  all of its inventory and substantially all of its other personal property and has a five year maturity 
the bank credit facility contains customary affirmative covenants  negative covenants and conditions of borrowing 
at february  indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount of approximately  plus letters of credit amounting to approximately  were outstanding under the bank credit facility 
the company s liquidity requirements consist primarily of working capital needs and scheduled payments of interest on its indebtedness and costs associated with integrating burns 
as a result of the burns acquisition  the company will have significantly increased cash requirements for the payment of interest on its outstanding borrowings 
based on interest rates in effect  assuming no changes in borrowings under the bank credit facility  cash requirements for debt service would be approximately million  million  million  million and million for fiscal years through  respectively 
no principal payments are required for any of the borrowings under the bank credit facility until february  at which time any unpaid principal under the bank credit facility will be due and payable 
at february   the company s cash and cash equivalents were  compared to  at february  cash used in operating activities in the year ended february  was  and cash provided by operating activities in was  compared to  in the primary source of cash during the year ended february  was non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of  and the cumulative effect of the accounting change of  which was offset by a use of cash for research  development and engineering of  and for inventory of  the primary sources of cash from operations in fiscal were non cash charges for depreciation and amortization and changes in intangible assets 
significant changes in operating assets during were the increase in inventories of  offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of  and an increase in accounts payable of  significant changes in operating assets during were the increase in inventories and accounts receivable of  and  respectively and the decrease in other liabilities of  offset by an increase in accounts payable of  the company s capital expenditures were    in   and respectively 
also  the company used cash in certain acquisitions amounting to  and  in and  respectively 
the company expects that its capital expenditures for will be approximately  these capital expenditures will relate principally to maintenance of operations and development of new product applications 
the company believes that cash flow from operations and availability under the bank credit facility provide adequate funds for its working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and debt service obligations through the term of the bank credit facility 
the company believes that it will be able to refinance the bank credit facility prior to its termination  although there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so 
the company s ability to fund its operations and make planned capital expenditures  to make scheduled payments and to refinance its indebtedness depends on its future operating performance and cash flow  which  in turn  are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond its control 
industry conditions the company s customers are the world s commercial airlines 
as a result  the company s business is directly dependent upon the conditions in the commercial airline industry 
in the late s and early s the world airline industry suffered a severe downturn which resulted in record losses and several air carriers seeking protection under bankruptcy laws 
as a consequence  during such period  airlines sought to conserve cash by reducing or deferring scheduled cabin interior refurbishment and upgrade programs and delaying purchases of new aircraft 
this led to a significant contraction in the commercial aircraft cabin interior products industry  and a decline in the company s business and profitability 
the airline industry is currently experiencing an economic turnaround  with significantly improved results  although the levels of airline spending on refurbishment and new aircraft purchases continue to be below the levels experienced in the mid s 
a number of world s airlines have placed significant orders for new aircraft over the past months  and some industry sources are now predicting that new aircraft deliveries will increase by per year over the next several years 
the company stands to benefit from this trend to the extent that it maintains its market shares and the airlines in fact continue to take deliveries of a greater number of new aircraft 
due to the volatility of the airline industry  there can be no assurance that the recent profitability of the airline industry will continue or that the airlines will maintain or increase expenditures on cabin interior products for refurbishments or new aircraft 
the foregoing statements include forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual experience may differ materially from that discussed above 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in risk factors in the company s registration statement on form s dated april  as well as future events that have the effect of reducing the company s available cash balances  such as unexpected operating losses or delays in the integration of the company s seating business or the delivery of the mdds interactive video system or capital expenditures or cash expenditures related to possible future acquisitions
