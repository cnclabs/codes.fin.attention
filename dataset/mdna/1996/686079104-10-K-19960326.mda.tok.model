see note to the consolidated financial statements 
excludes insurance proceeds of approximately million received in the second quarter of as reimbursement of lost profits resulting from lost production and start up delays at the pueblo mill caused by an explosion that occurred during the third quarter of the company s long range strategic plan emphasizes providing stability for its operations through expanding its product offerings to minimize the impact of individual product cycles on the company s overall performance and by entering into long term strategic alliances 
in pursuing these goals  the company has sought alternatives to its recent reliance in and on the domestic market for large diameter pipe  the demand for which has declined significantly from levels experienced in those years 
in an effort to decrease the company s reliance on the domestic large diameter pipe market and provide additional end use for its steel plate  the company acquired a percent interest in the camrose pipe mill in june from stelco  a large canadian steel producer  which owns the remaining interest in the camrose pipe mill 
the camrose pipe mill has two pipe manufacturing mills 
one is a large diameter pipe mill similar to that of the napa pipe mill and the other is an erw pipe mill which produces steel pipe used in the oil and gas industry for drilling and distribution 
the combined capacity of the two mills is approximately  tons per year depending on product mix 
in  and the camrose pipe mill shipped   and  tons  respectively  of steel pipe and generated revenues of million  million and million  respectively 
during those years stelco was a major supplier of steel plate and coil for the camrose pipe mill 
under the acquisition agreement for the mill  either the company or stelco may initiate a buy sell procedure pursuant to which the initiating party establishes a price for the camrose pipe mill and the other party must either sell its interest to the initiating party at that price or purchase the initiating party s interest at that price  at any time after march  the purchase price for the camrose pipe mill included the obligation to pay additional amounts over a five year period beginning in based on the financial performance of the mill

in connection with that sale  nissho iwai agreed to promote the international sale of certain steel products produced by the company 
in connection with those sales  the company and new cf i entered into a stockholder s agreement with nippon and nissho iwai pursuant to which nippon and nissho iwai were granted a right to sell all  but not less than all  of their equity interest back to new cf i at the then fair market value in certain circumstances 
those circumstances include  among other things  a change of control  as defined  certain changes involving the composition of the board of directors of new cf i  and the occurrence of certain other events which are within the control of the company involving cf i or its operations

the decrease in sales and shipments was primarily the result of reduced plate and welded pipe product shipments by the oregon steel division and reduced rod and bar shipments by the cf i steel division  offset in part by increased semi finished product sales by the oregon steel division 
plate shipments declined primarily due to the closure of the fontana plate mill in the first quarter of  which reduced the company s plate rolling capacity by approximately percent 
during the fontana plate mill shipped approximately  tons of plate versus  tons in  of which  tons were converted into pipe at the napa pipe mill 
shipments of welded pipe products declined due to the completion of a large international order that was produced in and adverse market conditions in canada

the company s working capital needs and completion of the capital improvement program and certain other projects will require the continued availability of funds from operations  borrowings under the credit agreement and other sources of financing 
to enhance its ability to implement the capital improvement program as scheduled and its flexibility in financing that program  the company is actively exploring additional and alternative sources of financing to supplement or replace the credit agreement 
in that regard  the company anticipates filing registration statements with the securities and exchange commission in the first quarter of to register for sale to the public approximately six million shares of its common stock and approximately million principal amount of first mortgage notes

futhermore  the continued availability of borrowings under the credit agreement will require improvement in the company s results of operations  including improved performance of the pueblo mill 
as a result  there is no assurance that borrowings will be available under the credit agreement or that sufficient funds otherwise will be available  whether from bank financing  public debt or equity securities offerings or otherwise  to complete the capital improvement program or meet the company s other cash needs 
failure to obtain required financing would  among other things  delay or prevent some portions of the capital improvement program and other capital expenditures from being initiated or completed  which would have a material adverse effect on the company 
impact of inflation 
inflation can be expected to have an effect on many of the company s operating costs and expenses 
due to worldwide competition in the steel industry  the company may not be able to pass through such increased costs to its customers
