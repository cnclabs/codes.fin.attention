installations for the us customs service on the southwest border with mexico 
these contracts  valued in excess of million  are significant milestones in the company s multi year program to develop commercially viable truck  vehicle  and cargo inspection systems 
management believes that the successful marketing and product development results produced during are evidence that the turnaround program begun in fiscal year is working 

square bullet 
compared to changes in financial condition cash and temporary investments declined from the prior year end by  although the quarterly rate of decline slowed during the first three quarters and cash increased in the fourth quarter of the decline compares to a  decline in cash and temporary investments during accounts receivable balances increased by  from the prior year  and unbilled costs and fees increased by  due to increased equipment sales and research contract activity 
in particular  the increase in unbilled receivables at year end is attributable to certain fixed price r e contracts which were largely complete but billable only upon final customer acceptance  and shipment of x ray systems to certain foreign customers for which final billing was contractually tied to system acceptance 
the growth in receivables  unbilled costs and fees and encumbered cash  together with the loss from operations  produced an acute cash shortage throughout fiscal year which is expected to continue into the second quarter of fiscal year management s plans to alleviate this cash shortage are discussed in management actions  below 
results of operations net sales and contract revenues increased by  or during fiscal year  compared to fiscal year in  security systems and field service revenues of  increased by  or  and contract research and engineering revenues of  decreased by  or 
cost of sales and contracts of  was higher than the previous year due primarily to increased sales and contract research activity 
cost of sales and contracts represented of revenues during fiscal year  compared to in selling  general  and administrative expenses of  were  lower than the previous year and represented of sales  compared to in included in sg a spending was approximately  in litigation related and facility move costs that are not expected to recur in the overall decline in sg a spending was expected as a result of cost reduction initiatives taken in the first quarter 
company funded research and development costs declined significantly in to  compared to  in this planned reduction in company funded r d spending resulted from completing the bodysearch 
trademark 
and model trademark 
new product programs during late and early and the reallocation of engineering resources to government funded research contracts 
no additional restructuring charges were provided in  and the  nonrecurring restructuring charge in was adequate to cover the one time costs of personnel reductions and professional services to implement the restructuring plan 
the net loss for the year of  was lower by  compared to the loss occurred primarily during the first and fourth fiscal quarters when sales and contract revenues were insufficient to cover the company s persistently high fixed cost structure caused  in part  by high facility lease and occupancy costs 
as discussed below  future occupancy costs will be substantially lower as a result of the company s relocation in late fiscal year liquidity and capital resources the company s net loss for the year  the resulting negative cash flow from operations  the growth in current asset accounts  and the lack of access to outside financing have combined to keep corporate liquidity and capital resources at marginal levels throughout the year 
net cash used for operating activities during was  compared to  net cash used in fiscal cash used for operations during each fiscal quarter in showed a generally improving trend  with  cash used in the first quarter   used in the second quarter   used in the third quarter  and  net cash generated in the fourth quarter 
cash and temporary investments at march  were  down by  from the prior year end 
the principal uses of cash were to cover operating losses  nonrecurring legal and facility move costs  growth in unbilled costs and fees  and cash disbursed for expenses accrued in previous periods 
trade accounts payable and accrued legal expense increased by  which provided a source of funds 
the company s current ratio remains reasonably strong at  compared to at the end of last fiscal year 
while customer accounts receivable have increased modestly since year end  the continuing need for standby letters of credit and facility related security deposits have placed severe pressure on the company s unrestricted cash resources 
management believes the company s unrestricted cash balances at the end of fiscal year are marginal relative to its needs 
year end backlog of equipment orders remained low  but anticipated revenues and cash flow from operations are expected to improve steadily during fiscal year the improved revenue outlook and reduced occupancy and legal costs during should reverse the negative cash flows experienced during nonetheless  management believes that outside capital will be required for the company to establish a sound financial footing and to take advantage of near term growth opportunities 
a more detailed discussion of management s current and future action plans follows

trademark 
facility at otay mesa  california was successfully commissioned and turned over to the us customs service as a fully functioning system 
cargosearch 
trademark 
continues to operate as designed and has led to numerous seizures of drugs and other contraband hidden in vehicles attempting to enter the us from mexico 
the us customs service and other international customs agencies have expressed interest in purchasing numerous cargosearch 
trademark 
systems over the next several years 
the company s prototype bodysearch 
trademark 
systems have undergone long term evaluations by several foreign customs and law enforcement agencies 
the model trademark 
mailsearch 
trademark

systems began to show commercial success during  with the first volume sales to law enforcement agencies as well as both government and corporate security services 
advanced technology development the company was awarded approximately million in major new research and engineering contracts during these programs will help maintain the company s leadership position in the practical application of advanced x ray inspection systems 
the contract awards included the development of a mobile work site housing the company s top of the line model zz 
registered trademark 
inspection system  a mobile version of cargosearch 
trademark  an advanced automatic explosives detection system for the faa  and a prototype of the next generation detection system using forward scatter technology 
addition of new customers the company undertook a significant effort during to broaden its domestic customer base  reestablish sales to former customers  and expand its foreign sales coverage 
new or reestablished domestic customers during included the us postal inspection service  the federal aviation administration  and several private companies or commercial security firms 
significantly expanded foreign customer relationships included hm customs and excise uk  the taiwan customs agency  the australian customs service  and the egyptian office of the president 
commitment to customer service starting in late fiscal year and continuing into  the company placed considerable emphasis on upgrading its field service function and improving the quality and responsiveness of service to the installed customer base 
programs offering extended warranty  preventative maintenance  and equipment upgrade packages have been well received by existing customers 
as a result of this new emphasis  field service revenues were  in  an increase of  compared to fiscal operations the rebuilding that took place during fiscal year occurred within the context of extremely tight cash resources and no access to outside financing 
management implemented aggressive cash management measures  including seeking advances from customers with large dollar and or long lead time contracts and cleaning up of unbilled costs and retainages on completed government contracts 
this latter effort produced  of cash receipts during and an additional  of estimated receipts during the first quarter of despite these and other cash conservation measures  the company s cash shortage is severe and will remain so until revenues rebound as anticipated during in response to the chronic cash shortage  on april   certain officers and a director agreed to loan the company  for a month period  during which it is anticipated the company will be able to arrange more permanent outside financing 
in this regard  some progress is being made 
on june   the company closed on a  line of credit from a regional bank and guaranteed by the us export import bank 
this loan will be used to finance the receivables and inventory associated with growth in export sales 
management believes additional outside financing will be required to overcome the company s chronic cash shortage until such time as adequate revenue levels are attained to achieve cash self sufficiency sometime during fiscal year sales growth and the solicitation of outside capital resources are management s primary short term imperatives
