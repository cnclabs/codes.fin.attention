item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s revenues are derived primarily from two sources software licenses and fees for services  including support contracts and training and consulting services 
the company has experienced a significant shift in the sources of its revenues as a result of its decision to concentrate its resources on the development and marketing of enterprise wide asset maintenance management systems operating in a client server environment 
prior to  the company s revenues were derived primarily from licenses of its project management software consisting of character based software designed to run on mainframe  minicomputers and personal computers  and  to a lesser extent  from sales of computer hardware 
the company acquired maintenance automation corporation mac on march  mac is a developer of maintenance management software for the single user  pc lan segment 
the company released maximo  its first client server product  in  and released p x  its second client server product  in in fiscal year ended september   revenues from client server software constituted of software revenues 
by the fiscal year ended september   revenues from client server software accounted for of software revenues  of which was attributable to the client server versions of maximo 
in fiscal  the company introduced a new suite of maximo products maximo enterprise  maximo workgroup and maximo advantage 
maximo enterprise  a new version of which was released in march  is a client server product  which runs on oracle and sybase platforms and is intended for the high function  high usage segment of the maintenance management market 
maximo workgroup  released in july  is also a client server product and runs on sqlbase and oracle workgroup and is intended for the mid range segment of the maintenance management market 
the product acquired as a result of the acquisition of mac on march   maximo advantage  is intended for the lower end maintenance market 
maximo advantage supports microsoft access for the single user  pc lan segment 
the company has incurred significant additional and unexpected costs in completing development of maximo advantage due to a delay in excess of six months in completing the release of this product 
the delay was necessary to meet the quality expectations and functionality demanded by the company 
the company has also restructured the tele sales operation employed by mac to improve the fluidity of the sales distribution channel 
further effecting maximo advantage sales was the delay in availability of a cd rom based multi media evaluation kit 
this evaluation kit became available in fiscal the company believes that most of the additional expenses that need to be incurred in connection with the completion of the new release of maximo advantage and the restructuring of the tele sales distribution channel should be incurred by the end of the first six months of fiscal these unexpected costs and a shortfall in expected revenues resulted in a net operating loss of  for mac for fiscal revenues from licenses of p x grew from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year and  in fiscal year however  p x has not achieved market acceptance  and revenues from p x software licenses declined to  in fiscal year and  in fiscal year this product is no longer actively marketed by the company as a stand alone solution 
the sources of the company s revenues from support and services have also shifted since the introduction of the company s new generation of client server products 
revenues from support and services relating to the company s client server products have increased  while those relating to the company s mainframe and other software have declined 
however  the decline in revenues from mainframe and other software support and services has been more gradual  due to customers continued needs for support of installed mainframe and other systems 
support and services as a percentage of total revenues were  and  for   and  respectively 
the decline from fiscal is attributable to the shift in revenues generated from the company s mainframe and other software to revenues generated from the company s maximo suite of products 
the company experienced an increase in the average selling price of its maximo client server software licenses during fiscal the company attributes this increase in part to licenses of a version of maximo for use with the oracle and sybase database management systems 
these client server versions of maximo have a higher entry price and are typically implemented in configurations involving a larger number of users  for whom additional license fees are paid 
larger software license contracts  if any  may have a significant impact on revenues for any quarter and could therefore result in significant fluctuations in quarterly revenues and operating results 
the company s revenues attributable to its operations outside the united states are a significant portion of revenues 
the company expects that international revenues will continue to be a significant percentage of total revenues 
as the percentage of the company s total revenues which are derived from international operations and are conducted in foreign currencies grows  changes in the values of these foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar will affect the company s results of operations  and may contribute to fluctuations in the company s results of operations 
the functional currencies of the company s international subsidiaries include the pound sterling  the french franc  the german deutschemark  the dutch guilder  the swedish krona  and the australian and canadian dollars  each of which has fluctuated significantly in relation to the united states dollar 
in addition  the company is exposed to potential losses as a result of transactions giving rise to accounts receivable in currencies other than the united states dollar or the functional currencies of its international subsidiaries 
when the value of a foreign currency in which the accounts receivable of the company are denominated changes between the date the account receivable is accrued and the date on which it is settled  the resulting gain or loss is recorded as a foreign currency transaction adjustment 
the company recorded foreign currency transaction losses of   and  for the fiscal years  and  respectively 
the company may in the future undertake currency hedging  although there can be no assurance that hedging transactions  if entered into  would materially reduce the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on the company s results of operations 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on the company s financial results 
there can be no assurance  however  that inflation may not adversely affect the company s financial results in the future

as a result  revenues from license fees in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
a delay in or loss of orders can cause significant variations in quarterly operating results

large software license contracts may have a significant impact on revenues for any quarter and could therefore result in significant fluctuations in quarterly revenues and operating results 
the company s revenues and income from operations typically grow at a lower rate or decline in the first quarter of each fiscal year 
in addition  revenues are typically higher in the fourth quarter than in other quarters of the year  reflecting the company s fiscal year end and a sales commission policy that bases rewards on achievement of annual quotas 
as a result of these factors  the company has experienced  and may in the future experience  significant period to period fluctuations in revenues and operating results 
factors of future performance further information on factors that could affect the company s business and financial results are included in the company s annual report on form k filed with the securities and exchange commission
