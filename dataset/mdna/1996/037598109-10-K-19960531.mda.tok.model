item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial goals prior to fiscal year  a significant portion of apogee s operating income was generated by units serving the nonresidential construction market 
specifically  when office building construction activity dropped precipitously in the early s  apogee s history of steadily growing sales and earnings came to an abrupt halt 
in an effort to return to historical earnings growth  we have reexamined the manner in which we direct assets and how we operate our businesses 
the results of these efforts have been to begin to reallocate our capital to our more profitable businesses  to set higher return requirements for capital investments  to reduce working capital levels and to raise productivity of our enterprises 
a year ago we stated that our primary goal was to exceed the record earnings achieved in fiscal we were able to fulfill that goal in fiscal going forward  assuming reasonably stable competitive and economic conditions  it is our goal to increase earnings per share at a compounded annual rate of or greater 
in support of the above goal  we have now divided our businesses into three segments that reflect how we view our company while providing a clearer picture of our operations 
our new segmentation is defined as building products services bps  glass technologies gt and auto glass ag 
our commitment to the efforts described above is further outlined in the following segment analysis 
performance fiscal compared to fiscal the following table illustrates the relationship between various components of operations  stated as a percent of net sales  for the three years ended march  percent of net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses provision for business restructuring and asset valuation operating income interest and other expense  net earnings before income taxes and other items income taxes equity in net earnings of affiliated companies minority interest net earnings before cumulative effect of change in accounting for income taxes cumulative effect of change in accounting for income taxes net earnings consolidated net sales grew to million in fiscal as all three segments reported double digit gains 
our gt segment benefitted from improved volume and firm pricing for its fabricated architectural glass products while our ag segment experienced higher unit volumes at a greater number of locations 
ag s sales improvement was somewhat dampened by the continuation of industry pricing pressure 
apogee s bps segment s sales grew mainly due to higher overseas building activity 
approximately of the consolidated net sales came from an additional week in the week fiscal compared to a week fiscal overall  cost of sales  as a percent of sales  grew slightly as productivity gains at gt were offset by narrowing margins at our ag segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a grew  reflecting increased information systems and marketing costs at our ag segment as it worked to expand market coverage and develop new services to meet customers needs 
however  sg a costs fell sharply as a percentage of sales  due to strong sales gains and cost cutting measures undertaken by all of our operating segments 
net interest expense rose due to a combination of higher interest rates and higher borrowing levels in the first half of the year necessitated by our working capital needs 
our effective tax rate dropped to from in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the tax benefits related to higher export sales levels and a decrease in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
equity in net earnings of affiliates dropped slightly as pricing for certain coated products became more competitive in the latter half of the year  and continuing development costs at viratec thin films offset solid earnings from its main product line 
minority interest rose due to a larger loss at harmon europe sa  our owned french unit 
consolidated net earnings advanced in fiscal to million or a share  from million  or a share  a year ago 
return on shareholders equity rose to from a year earlier 
segment analysis the following information provides a more detailed look at each of our three segments 
for a concise five year look at each segment  see index of financial statements and schedules note business segment information 
building products services bps made substantial progress in fiscal revenues grew  primarily due to progress on the kuala lumpur city centre project in malaysia and higher european revenues 
the segment s operating loss fell from prior year s million to million 
harmon contract  bps s domestic and international curtainwall construction unit reduced its loss approximately while the segment s wausau architectural products group reported modest operating income compared to a loss a year earlier  and revenue growth 
both units improvements were achieved through overhead and operating cost reductions and by newly implemented monitoring systems which allow money saving decisions to be made earlier in a project s completion cycle 
bps believes the new project management systems and cost saving efforts will allow it to make further improvements in profitability 
the segment s full service glazing group had another solid year generating strong revenues and healthy operating income 
bps s detention and security unit reported lower revenues  but produced a small profit  though notably less than a year ago 
however  the unit s year end backlog was up over a year ago 
in july  bps sold the nanik window coverings group for million 
a million gain on the sale was included under the caption  other expense  net in the consolidated results of operations 
in fiscal  the window coverings group contributed of segment sales and a small operating profit compared to of sales and a million operating profit in fiscal apogee ended the fiscal year with a million backlog  up from million at the end of fiscal bps s backlog is almost of the total 
based upon analysis of its backlog  bps anticipates nominal sales growth in fiscal due to the increased selectivity of projects taken over the past year 
however  better margins are expected as the segment completes its remaining older  lower margin projects and progresses further with healthier margin projects 
approximately million of the february backlog will not be reflected as revenue in fiscal glass technologies gt includes viracon  our architectural glass fabricator  and tru vue  our picture framing glass manufacturer  both previously part of bps 
marcon coatings marcon  which applies coatings to architectural and residential building glass  and viratec thin films viratec  which applies optical grade coatings to glass and other substrates  are also part of gt 
through fiscal  apogee s equity in marcon s and viratec s net earnings was included in the consolidated results of operations under the caption equity in net earnings of affiliated companies 
gt had outstanding results in fiscal  increasing revenues and operating income by and  respectively 
both operations experienced strong demand for products and benefitted from firmer pricing environments 
while the segment contributed just of consolidated revenues  it provided of consolidated operating income 
much of the segment s success was due to our viracon operation  which ran at near or full capacity for most of the year 
in fiscal  viracon grew revenues and operating income by and  respectively 
additional capacity is planned to be on line in summer viracon s cost structure  along with the expansion  will allow the unit to begin to penetrate the mid performance architectural glass market  a market which is approximately two times the size of the high performance architectural glass market  a market viracon traditionally serves 
tru vue had similar results  increasing revenue and earnings by and  respectively 
the unit was able to achieve the growth through efforts to streamline operations and integrate the two year old matboard acquisition 
both marcon and viratec increased revenues over the prior year 
marcon had a decline in operating income  as start up expenses related to a new coater negatively affected earnings 
viratec was able to grow operating income despite pricing pressures for its flat glass operations and developmental costs related to the cart line 
at march   viratec s backlog of million was down from the prior year end 
in november  apogee s joint venture partner jv partner in marcon viratec commenced litigation against us  alleging claims for damages and seeking to have the court order apogee to sell its interest to the jv partner 
apogee filed counterclaims seeking to have the jv partner s interest sold to apogee  and in march  the court ordered the jv partner to sell the shares of stock representing its interest in marcon viratec to apogee upon payment by apogee of fair value for those shares as determined by the court 
the jv partner s rights and status as shareholder and directors were terminated as of the effective date of the order and the fair value for the shares is to be determined by the court after further proceedings 
the court has not yet scheduled a trial or hearing to determine fair value 
at a hearing on april   the court ordered apogee to post a bond or letter of credit in the amount of million  or to pay the jv partner million and agree to set aside an additional million  as security for the ultimate payment of the purchase price for the jv partner s shares 
the amount of such a bond or other means is intended as security and is not intended to reflect the court s view on what is the fair value for the shares 
the jv partner s claims against apogee for damages are still pending and the court also is considering a motion brought by the jv partner to add a claim for punitive damages 
apogee anticipates gt will report sales and earnings gains in fiscal through expanded production capacity and streamlined operations for viracon and tru vue 
the company believes full control of marcon and viratec will allow apogee more strategic and operating flexibility 
auto glass ag had mixed results in fiscal the segment grew sales during the year despite pricing pressures and lower unit movement in the auto glass industry 
operating income declined due to lower margins and expenses related to investment in improved information systems and marketing programs 
ag  which operates retail stores under the harmon glass harmon name and distribution centers under the glass depot name  possesses the third largest share in the auto glass repair and replacement industry 
the segment increased market penetration in fiscal as harmon grew by retail locations while glass depot added distribution centers 
at march   ag had harmon retail glass stores  glass depot locations and midas muffler franchises in states 
insurance companies increasingly rely on auto glass vendors with information systems to expedite claims processing and other administrative efforts related to auto glass replacement and repair 
this outsourcing allowed insurance companies to improve customer satisfaction and lower costs 
the segment s significant investment in information systems provides harmon the means to offer comprehensive claims processing and management services to these customers on a nationwide basis 
harmon was able to use this competitive edge to gain market share in fiscal this market share gain is reflected in harmon s jump in retail same store sales as contrasted with a drop in overall industry unit movement 
curvlite  ag s auto glass fabricator  reported increased sales and unit volume in a declining sales price market 
however  weaker pricing and costs related to setting up its new product and delivery systems negatively affected operating income 
through the unit s national distribution center  a mega distribution center offering other manufacturers products as well as its own for both domestic and foreign vehicles  curvlite was able to offer a more complete product line to its customers 
another new program was autoglass express  a delivery system which allows curvlite to fill customer s orders on an individual basis more completely and faster than many of its competitors 
the unit believes the two new initiatives will give it a competitive edge and help to gain market share 
ag anticipates sales growth to continue as it starts to leverage its information and delivery systems in fiscal even with higher sales  it is difficult to project if operating earnings will improve as the full costs of the information systems begin to be realized in fiscal and industry pricing pressures continue 
fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales rose to million in fiscal  primarily due to strong replacement auto glass markets  robust demand for architectural glass products  and higher detention and security contracting revenues 
our gross margin increased nearly two percentage points as pricing improved slightly for replacement auto glass and architectural glass products 
productivity gains outpaced moderate increases in wages and benefits  including lower medical plan costs 
in addition  the margin gains reflected operating improvements by our nonresidential construction and architectural products operations  despite the continuation of depressed margins for those units markets 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses sg a crept slightly higher  but grew substantially in absolute dollars 
the majority of the increase resulted from expenditures by our auto glass retail and wholesale businesses for the development of improved information systems to better meet customer needs  as well as for expanded marketing programs related to windshield repair 
net interest expense rose  due to the combination of higher interest rates and increased borrowing levels required to meet working capital and capital investment needs 
our effective income tax rate fell substantially  from in fiscal  to in  as increased domestic earnings were taxed at essentially the statutory rate 
the fiscal rate was unusually high due to an increase in our deferred tax asset valuation 
equity in net earnings of affiliated companies dropped  to million  in fiscal new product and process development costs at viratec thin films substantially offset strong earnings of the unit s anti glare screen business 
minority interest differed from a year ago as harmon europe sa reported a loss in fiscal compared to net earnings in the prior year 
fiscal consolidated net earnings grew  to million  or 
per share  up from million or cents per share a year ago  which included the  or cents per share  cumulative effect of the change in accounting for income taxes reported in fiscal return on average shareholders equity grew to  up from a year earlier 
at february   our consolidated backlog was million  down from million twelve months earlier 
decreases in our domestic and asian construction backlogs exceeded the combined increases in other areas 
while our backlog declined  it was expected that recently recorded orders would provide margin improvement 
at february   approximately million of the february backlog was not expected to be reflected as revenue in fiscal building products services bps increased revenues in fiscal  to million  and reported a million operating loss  a million reduction from its loss a year earlier 
within the segment  revenue growth was achieved at the detention and security unit  largely due to fast track projects entered into early in the year 
harmon contract reported a decline in domestic revenues  but slashed its operating loss by 
with a lower cost structure and improved project management  harmon worked through much of its narrow margin backlog  obtained in the intensely competitive pricing environment of harmon contract s overseas operations recorded flat revenues compared to a year ago  with higher asian revenues offset by less activity in europe 
operating results suffered from low margin projects and overhead growth related to brisk bidding activity in both europe and asia 
the segment s architectural products group also rebounded sharply 
sales grew  with firmer pricing  beefed up engineering and better factory utilization  nearly eliminating the prior year s significant operating loss 
overall  bps made progress in controlling its costs  with a million reduction in sg a expenses  the result of restructuring measures taken in fiscal  as well as ongoing cost control measures 
glass technologies gt had a gain in revenues and a increase in operating income year over year 
high demand and firmer pricing for viracon s architectural glass products boosted its sales  which led to margin gains and strong profit growth for the unit 
viracon ran at near capacity for most of the year as demand for its products remained strong 
gt s picture framing products unit recorded steady sales gains and solid earnings  although behind historical levels 
marcon coatings reported healthy sales and earnings growth  as that unit benefitted from rapidly growing viracon sales 
viratec reported an gain in revenues  while pre tax earnings were down from last year 
demand for viratec s coated glass for anti glare computer screens remained strong  especially in overseas markets  as the european community adopted stricter safety regulations for limiting computer emissions 
viratec invested heavily in research and development costs during fiscal to begin limited direct coating of cathode ray tubes crts  accounting for the reduction in bottom line results 
at february   viratec s backlog stood at million  up from a year earlier 
auto glass ag segment achieved net sales of million  up over a year ago  while reporting operating income of million  modestly ahead of fiscal s strong performance 
high demand for replacement auto glass  along with share gains in selected markets  helped to boost revenues 
price increases early in the year were somewhat eroded by volume discounts to major customers 
despite the sales increase  operating income for the segment was flat with the prior year  as costs to expand marketing programs and develop state of the art information systems offset gross profit gains 
both harmon glass retail and glass depot wholesale advanced same location sales by  reflecting overall market growth 
the higher volume contributed to gross margin growth  but higher sg a costs limited the units operating income gain to 
viracon curvlite maintained high factory utilization throughout the year  producing record sales and strong earnings 
windshield unit shipments grew 
also  curvlite invested in equipment to expand capacity and lower production costs 
during the year  the ag segment acquired or started up retail stores and nine wholesale depots  including a chain of retail stores and one warehouse in the washington  dc area  acquired in january  this acquisition gave ag a significant position in that attractive east coast market 
the group closed seven retail and one distribution locations during the year  to end the year with retail stores  wholesale depots and midas muffler locations 
liquidity and capital resources financial condition major balance sheet items as a percentage of total assets at march  and february  are presented below percent of total assets current assets current liabilities long term debt other liabilities shareholders equity net receivables decreased due in part to strong efforts by all segments to keep accounts current and reduce working capital 
the sale of our window coverings group also reduced both receivables and inventories by almost million each 
inventories and costs in excess of billings grew by approximately million and million  respectively 
the increases occurred with rising production levels and changes in contract billing agreements  which extended billing cycles for the nonresidential construction units 
total long term and short term debt stood at million at march   down million from a year earlier 
the company made working capital reduction one of its priorities in fiscal as can be evidenced by the reduction in debt 
in may  apogee expanded its revolving credit facilities to million  as a result  million of short term borrowings at march  were classified as long term debt 
for fiscal  we believe our continued efforts to reduce working capital plus our credit facilities will enable us to maintain liquidity while achieving improved results 
capital investment new capital investment in fiscal totaled million  versus million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
expenditures for new property  plant and equipment totaled million  and consisted of information systems  facility additions and manufacturing equipment additions and upgrades 
we also invested million to fund ag s acquisition of retail stores and wholesale depots 
capital investment for fiscal is estimated at million 
further upgrading of information and communication systems and construction of a major distribution center are the primary components of ag s plan 
gt s plans primarily consist of expenditures for capacity expansion and productivity improvements and bps plans include information systems upgrades and productivity improvements 
shareholders equity apogee s book value rose in fiscal from to per share  with outstanding common shares increasing by one percent 
net earnings less dividends  along with common stock issued in connection with long term compensation plans  essentially accounted for the increase 
during fiscal  we increased our quarterly dividend by  to cents per share  our st consecutive year of increase 
impact of inflation apogee s financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis  which does not completely account for the effects of inflation 
however  since the cost of most of our inventories is determined using the last in  first out lifo method of accounting  cost of sales  except for depreciation expense included therein  generally reflects current costs 
although year end prices were essentially unchanged from a year ago  the cost of glass  one of apogee s primary raw materials  fluctuated during fiscal reflecting varying demand from the us construction and auto industries 
we expect the cost of glass to rise moderately in fiscal aluminum prices were volatile during the fiscal year and ended on a slight decline from fiscal year end pricing 
while our construction and supply contracts are at fixed prices  the material components are usually based on firm quotes obtained from suppliers 
labor cost increases  including taxes and fringe benefits  can be reasonably anticipated 
through new efficiencies and cost containment programs set up at most operating units  selling  general and administrative expenses were reduced or held relatively constant during fiscal outlook we believe that improving market conditions for nonresidential construction  flat demand for automotive replacement glass and continued strong demand for architectural glass and coated glass products will allow apogee to improve earnings in fiscal better project selection and management  continued cost containment programs and efficiencies  and competitive advantages from information management technology should contribute to earnings growth 
cautionary statement a number of factors should be considered in conjunction with any discussion of operations or results by the company or its representatives  including any forward looking discussion  as well as comments contained in press releases  presentations to securities analysts or investors  or other communications by the company 
these factors are set forth in exhibit to this form k
