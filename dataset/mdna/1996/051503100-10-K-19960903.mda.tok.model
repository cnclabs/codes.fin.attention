item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations net sales for fiscal were  up  from net sales of  in fiscal and from sales of  in fiscal the improvement is due principally to three factors first  the global telecommunications data communications market  including local and wide area networking has been strong  fueled by advances in technologies and strong domestic and growing foreign economies 
these conditions provided enhanced opportunities for sale of the company s products to oems manufacturing items such as telephones  modems  point of sale and industrial measuring equipment 
second  the company s emphasis on teams with strong engineering capabilities and design activities that are driven principally by oem product application needs resulted in the development of new products during fiscal in addition to increased sales to existing customers  this enabled the company to make sales to several new oem customers who are major participants in the market served by the company 
several new products  including new generation switching power supplies  with enhanced features that are important to oems are in various stages of development for fiscal and future market introduction 
lastly  subcontracting arrangements in china and other areas of south east asia  and greater utilization of the korean facility enabled the company to lower manufacturing costs and  therefore  to better compete for price sensitive orders and to fulfill the broader product needs of its oem customers 
compared to fiscal  the lower sales in fiscal were due to somewhat weaker market conditions 
the lower sales in fiscal were due to the company s inability to compete where pricing was a predominant issue  as well as to soft market conditions  then existing 
the company s order backlog at june   was  up from  at may   and  at may  gross profit for fiscal amounted to  or of net sales  compared to  which was of net sales for fiscal  and  equaling of net sales in fiscal increased freight cost to expedite material deliveries  and greater material cost  had an adverse impact on gross margin in fiscal fiscal margin was reduced by reserves that were established for excess inventories and because a smaller portion of the lower revenue had come from domestic manufacturing  the greater portion coming from foreign manufacturing sources 
products that are manufactured in the us by the company generally have had higher margins compared to those manufactured abroad when they have competitive advantages in shorter delivery times and value added features 
fiscal gross margin benefited from the greater revenue compared to the levels of fixed cost incurred by the company  although the proportion of revenue from us manufactured products had not increased 
the company anticipates continued modest improvements in gross margin from increased revenue  cost controls  and more products designed for us manufacturing 
although products that were manufactured by the korean subsidiary contributed a very significant portion of total sales  conversion of the won to us dollars has had no significant impact on gross profit because the conversion rates have been relatively stable 
operating expenses for fiscal totaled  or of net sales  compared to  and  which equaled and of net sales for each year  respectively 
the increased expenditures in fiscal were principally due to greater but proportionate commissions paid on higher sales  and increased engineering and administrative costs due respectively  to greater agency fees to certify new products and larger administrative costs associated with foreign business activities 
the company also paid performance bonuses equaling two weeks of payroll to all employees in fiscal  compared to one week in fiscal it is anticipated that all of these expenditures will continue in the future commensurate with levels of business 
in fiscal  anticipating declining sales  the company reduced the number of its indirect employees and had restructured its remaining workforce to reduce costs 
the company reported operating income of  in fiscal and  in fiscal  and an operating loss of  in fiscal in fiscal  and  the company incurred interest expense of   and  respectively  increasing each year principally because of greater borrowings to support growth in revenues 
non operating income of  in fiscal and  in fiscal came mainly from currency exchange rate gains related to importation of raw material by the korean subsidiary 
the company incurred us income taxes of  in fiscal  due to application of the alternative minimum income tax 
at year end  the company had  in tax credits available to reduce future income taxes payable  and  in net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future taxable income 
see note under notes to consolidated financial statements 
ault korea accrued no income taxes in fiscal because of loss carryforwards that are currently available and applicable through fiscal the company had net income of  or per share for fiscal  and net income of  in fiscal amounting to per share 
in fiscal  the company had net loss of  or per share loss of 
because of the strong order backlog  mentioned above  it is anticipated that revenue and net profit for the first quarter of fiscal will compare very favorably with performance achieved in the first quarter of fiscal the company reported revenue of  and net profit of  for that quarter 
revenue and net profit for all of fiscal are also anticipated to improve  compared to fiscal  if the company s strategies for continued new product introductions and competitive pricing through utilization of offshore manufacturing continue to succeed and if current favorable market conditions persist 
liquidity and capital resources the company s strategies for customer service and growth in sales and profits in fiscal were to utilize its cash resources to pursue the opportunities that would be available if the growing favorable market condition continued 
principal among these resources were its bank credit facilities and working capital derivable from operations cash flows 
expenditure for investing activities that were within affordability of these resources were also seen as a critical element 
at the end of fiscal  the company had cash of  up from  when the year began  mainly through borrowings under its financing activities to provide the cash used in its operating and investing activities 
operating activities used  of cash which was comprised principally of cash provided by net income and adjustments  trade payable and accrued expenses  and also cash used in inventories and trade receivables 
net income and adjustments provided  of cash  of which net income provided  adjustments to net income provided  of cash of which depreciation  the principal item  provided  growth in trade receivables mainly from the strong shipments in the fourth quarter used  of cash 
further use of cash by trade receivables is anticipated in fiscal because of expected growth in revenues 
increases in inventories used  of cash  principally to maintain certain levels of finished products close to the operations of major customers for quick response to flexible requirements 
provision of this support to customers is a competitive factor in securing certain large orders 
the company is looking at measures that will reduce the levels of products that must be stored to meet the needs of these customers 
trade payables and accrued expenses provided  of cash of which trade payable provided  in spite of the increased revenue in fiscal  trade payables grew only nominally because of actions to bring payables of the korean subsidiary to a more current basis 
accrued expenses including salaries and bonuses  income taxes and commissions to sales representatives provided  of cash 
investing activities  which were comprised of purchases of equipment and a us patent used  of cash 
expenditure on equipment used  of cash  a modest expenditure in view of the levels of revenue for the fiscal year 
greater levels of expenditures will be required to support anticipated growth in revenues in fiscal the balance of  is comprised principally of the cost of a us patent on power supply technology acquired by the company 
the patent enables the company to accelerate its plan to offer products with enhanced power features 
financing activities comprised of borrowings under the credit facilities  receipts from the exercise of stock options  and payments on long term obligations provided  of cash 
activities on long term obligations which were related to mortgage payments and capital leases used  of cash

receipts from the exercise of common stock options amounted to  at the end of fiscal  the company had a revolving credit facility at its us bank amounting to  during the second quarter of fiscal  the company negotiated a new agreement that increased the credit facility to  effective october  at june    of the credit facility was being utilized to provide a standby letter of credit to korea exchange bank in korea 
this letter of credit serves as additional collateral to the beneficiary for credits extended to the korean subsidiary 
no claims have been presented against it 
the balance of  provides working capital to the us operations at a rate of interest that is above the bank s base rate  down from on the old credit facility 
at june   utilization amounted to  up by  from  when the year began 
amounts available for borrowing totaled  negotiations currently in progress are expected to conclude during the first quarter of fiscal with adjustments requested by the company including reduction in the rate of interest 
in fiscal  ault korea corporation established a  line of credit with korea exchange bank for overdrafts and other purposes 
utilization at june  amounted to  the effect of currency exchange rate changes on the translation of the korean financial statements from korean won to us dollars resulted in net asset value increase of  for the fiscal year 
all of the company s sales contracts and foreign subcontracts are in us dollars  and therefore  the company assumes no currency exchange risks 
other foreign contracts are not significant in amounts at this time  therefore  exposure to currency exchange risks is minimal 
the company s working capital increased to  at june   from  at may  long term debt decreased from  to  during the same period 
the company believes that cash flows from anticipated profit and other operating activities together with its credit facilities will be adequate to support normal growth in revenues through fiscal current market conditions and successful strategies of the company  however  have presented the opportunities for enhanced service to customers and expansion in revenues and profits  for which current resources would be inadequate 
for these reasons  the feasibility of raising the necessary capital through sale of common shares is being evaluated 
factors affecting future performance from time to time  in reports filed with the securities and exchange commission  in press releases  and in other communications to shareholders or the investing public  the company may comment on anticipated future financial performance 
such forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to the overall level of activity in the telecommunications data communications market  buying patterns of the company s existing and prospective customers  the impact of new products introduced by competitors  higher than expected expense  related to sales and new marketing initiatives  availability of adequate supplies of raw materials and components  and other risks involving the telecommunications data communications industry generally
