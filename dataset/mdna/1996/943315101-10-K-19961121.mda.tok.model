fiscal was a year of extremes for wausau papers 
during the first part of the year  pulp prices continued their upward trend  which began in january market pressures prevented the company from recovering much of the increased pulp costs through higher paper prices  which negatively impacted first and second quarter earnings results 
while demand for the company s printing and writing grades remained strong  market weakness in the technical specialty grades continued from fiscal into early fiscal as a result  some limited downtime was taken at the rhinelander mill in the first quarter of fiscal worldwide demand in the pulp and paper markets softened in mid fiscal  which resulted in a series of rapid pulp price declines in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year 
this  coupled with improved demand for rhinelander s technical specialty grades  continued strong business conditions at the company s printing and writing division and less volatility in the company s paper prices  compared to pulp prices  resulted in record second half earnings in fiscal worldwide pulp market conditions have shown signs of stabilizing toward the latter part of fiscal and into pulp price increases were implemented near the end of the fiscal year and another pulp price increase had been announced for october  though current market conditions did not support this latest increase and it was delayed 
should the october pulp price increase eventually take effect  pulp prices  on average  will still be well below the average pulp prices experienced during fiscal and net sales net sales for fiscal were a record million  an increase of over fiscal net sales of million 
fiscal net sales were million 
shipments were a record  tons in fiscal  up compared to the  tons shipped in shipments were  tons in fiscal strong customer demand led to full operations at the printing and writing division throughout fiscal printing and writing division shipments increased in fiscal over the previous year 
mix enhancement efforts resulted in a solid increase in premium paper sales while reducing the division s participation in commodity grades 
the company expects to continue to grow its printing and writing products in fiscal demand for the company s technical specialty products showed improvement during the second half of fiscal  compared to the first half of the year 
limited downtime was taken on one paper machine at rhinelander during the first quarter of the year as a result of market weakness 
shipments of rhinelander s products improved in fiscal  compared to the prior year  while shipments of pressure sensitive products  its largest product segment  increased over results 
the slow rate of growth in the pressure sensitive industry during late fiscal and fiscal  compared to historical averages  has limited the company s ability to significantly increase its pressure sensitive volume since the rebuild of the no 
paper machine at rhinelander  although recent order activity for pressure sensitive products has been much improved 
continued mix improvement toward more pressure sensitive grades is expected in fiscal the order backlog at august  was million  compared to order backlogs of million and million at august  and  respectively 
on a tonnage basis  order backlog at the end of fiscal was higher than at the end of and better than the order backlog at the end of the improved backlog at august   compared to a year ago  is due to increased demand for the company s products 
backlog totals do not accurately indicate the full business strength of the company  however  as a significant and growing volume of orders are shipped out of inventory promptly upon order receipt 
gross profit gross profit margin increased to of net sales for fiscal  compared to for the previous year 
the gross profit margin was in fiscal the improvement in gross profit margin in fiscal  compared to the prior year  is due primarily to mix improvement  higher average selling prices for the company s products and lower pulp costs  on average 
during the first half of fiscal  market prices for pulp  the company s main raw material in manufacturing paper  continued their upward climb which began in january however  pulp prices started to decline in the second quarter of the fiscal year as worldwide pulp and paper markets weakened 
in fiscal  the average list price of northern bleached softwood kraft  a commonly used benchmark pulp grade  decreased  compared to a increase in fiscal and a decline in more recent declines in worldwide pulp producer inventories have led to pulp price increases on most species of pulp toward the end of fiscal additional pulp price increases were announced for october  however  sufficient weakness still exists in the pulp market and pulp producers were not successful implementing the october increase 
even if the october pulp price increases are eventually fully implemented  the then current market pulp prices will be significantly lower  on average  than those in effect in fiscal and fiscal production of the company s printing and writing grades increased in fiscal over the previous year as a result of productivity gains from capital improvements and operating both the brokaw and groveton mills at capacity  compared to operating them at and of capacity  respectively  in fiscal production at the printing and writing division in fiscal was higher than in when only one of two paper machines was in operation at the groveton mill
