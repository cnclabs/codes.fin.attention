item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company operates an exclusive leased department at all existing and future domestic and puerto rican sam s wholesale club sam s locations under an agreement which expires february  as of february   the company operated a leased department in sam s locations 
during fiscal  approximately of the company s net sales were generated through sam s 
prior to  the company operated principally as a jewelry  watch and fragrance wholesaler to the warehouse membership club industry 
following the company s transition to retailing as a leased department operator at sam s in the fourth quarter of  the company recognized the need for additional retail management expertise 
in fiscal  new board members were recruited from department and specialty store senior executives  who in turn hired a new ceo new management then began addressing the company s strategic directions 
in late as part of the fiscal planning process  management and the new board reviewed the fiscal results of all lines of business and their attendant cost structures 
this process resulted in the following decisions 
first  the company s domestic manufacturing operations engaged in the manufacturing of fixtures for the company s retail locations and various gem and gold products were closed 
second  staffing levels were reduced at the company s headquarters  other operational expenses were reduced and merchandising programs were designed to better manage retail sales  gross profit and the replenishment function 
third  management addressed the company s wholesale watch division  which had evolved into a low end watch business with sourcing in the parallel markets and which contributed disproportionately to expense 
with no perceived opportunity to improve the performance of this division  management closed the wholesale watch division  other than selected sales  and continued balancing of inventory 
results of operations for fiscal reflect the implementation of these decisions in expense savings at all levels 
the company also put in place merchandise strategies and selection that allowed the company to achieve higher gross margins in its leased departments 
in addition  emphasis on cash management and inventory control systems allowed the company to generate positive cash flows from operations and reduce its reliance on working capital support from third party lenders 
finally  the company s efforts to reduce and better balance its inventory levels resulted in improved inventory turns and reduced average inventory requirements 
on november   the company opened its first jewelry depot  a  square foot value oriented jewelry and luxury gift store in framingham  massachusetts 
subsequently  the company also opened two jewelry depot outlets  a  square foot facility in vero beach  florida and an square foot store in worcester  massachusetts 
the jewelry depot and jewelry depot outlets each were opened as prototypes for potential stand alone jewelry operations that the company will evaluate as possible long term sources of additional revenue 
until such time as this evaluation is complete  the company is currently unable to predict the impact of these potential stand alone jewelry operations on its future operating results or capital requirements 
the retail jewelry business is seasonal in nature with a higher proportion of sales and significant portion of earnings generated during the fourth quarter holiday selling season

the improvement in gross margin in both fiscal and fiscal can be primarily attributed to an increase in margins at the company s retail locations

in addition  the company achieved improvements as a percentage of sales in fiscal and fiscal in its inventory shrinkage adjustments and freight and handling costs

this decision was made a to liquidate the merchandise that was predominantly sold in the wholesale watch division which was being closed in order to focus management s attention on the company s retail operations  and b to liquidate certain other inventory on an expedited basis in order to raise cash for liquidity purposes as a result of the then uncertain status of credit availability due to the company s failure to comply with certain covenants in its debt agreements

the company s working capital requirements are directly related to the amount of inventory required to support its retail operations

the company is required to pay a fee of  annually to the lenders and an administration fee of  monthly 
substantially all of the company s assets are subject to a blanket lien in accordance with the agreements related to the amended notes and working capital facility 
an intercreditor agreement among the lenders provides that their respective security interests in such collateral are subject to certain relative priorities

the company and sam s have held discussions and negotiations regarding this matter  however  no resolution has been reached 
while the company believes that no further amounts are owed to sam s  the outcome remains uncertain 
the financial statements do not include a provision for any loss that may result from the resolution of this matter

effects of inflation gold prices are affected by political  industrial and economic factors and by changing perceptions of the value of gold relative to currencies 
investors commonly purchase gold and other precious metals perceived to be rising in value as a hedge against a perceived increase in inflation  thereby bidding up the price of such metals 
the company s sales volume and net income are potentially affected by the fluctuations in prices of gold  diamonds and other precious or semi precious gemstones as well as watches and other accessories 
in general  the company has historically sought to protect its gold inventory against gold price fluctuations through its hedging transactions 
hedging is not available with respect to possible fluctuations in the price of precious and semi precious gemstones  watches or other accessories 
the company s store and warehouse operating and selling expenses and general and administrative expenses are directly affected by inflation resulting in an increased cost of doing business 
although inflation has not had and the company does not expect it to have a material effect on operating results  there is no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future
