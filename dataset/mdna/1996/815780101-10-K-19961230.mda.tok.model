item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the company has three categories of revenue software products  maintenance and services 
software products revenue is comprised primarily of fees from licensing the company s proprietary software products and  to a much lesser extent  from product development contracts 
maintenance revenue is comprised of fees for maintaining  supporting and providing periodic upgrades of the company s software products 
services revenue is composed primarily of fees for consulting and training services 
consistent with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  software revenue recognition  the company allocates a portion of the software license fee to initial period maintenance when the maintenance period is greater than three months 
the remainder is recognized as license fee revenue upon delivery of the software product to  and acceptance by  the customer 
revenue from the initial period and subsequently priced maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
consulting and training services revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
the company s revenues vary from quarter to quarter  with the largest portion of revenue typically recognized in the last month of each fiscal quarter and the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year 
the company believes that these patterns are partly attributable to the company s sales commission policies  which compensate sales personnel for meeting or exceeding quarterly and annual quotas  and to the budgeting and purchasing cycles of customers 
furthermore  as the size of individual sales is large  a single account may have a significant impact on a quarter 
in addition  the substantial commitment of executive time and financial resources historically required of a potential customer to make a decision to purchase the company s products increases the risk of quarter to quarter fluctuations 
the company typically does not have a material backlog of unfilled software orders  and product revenue in any quarter is substantially dependent upon orders received in that quarter 
in addition  the company s services revenue may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to the completion or commencement of significant assignments  the number of working days in a quarter and the utilization rate of services personnel 
because the company s operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and are relatively fixed over the short term  variation in the timing of recognition of specific anticipated revenue can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
fluctuations in operating results may result in volatility in the price of the company s common stock 
in fiscal year  management intends to implement certain changes in the company s business practices 
the focus of these efforts is to better align products to customer needs and to establish long term partnerships between the company and its customers 
these changes are expected to lessen the impact on revenues of individual sales to a customer and reduce the variations in operating results from quarter to quarter

services revenue for the fiscal year increased as compared to the previous year

 accounting for income taxes 
income taxes decreased from an expense of million for fiscal year to a benefit of million for fiscal year the effective income tax rate decreased from for fiscal year to for fiscal year the decrease in the effective rate of is primarily attributed to lower foreign withholding taxes related to foreign software license agreements and utilization of foreign tax credits 
the company has net deferred tax assets of million as of september   of which million consists of foreign tax credits  research and development tax credits  and alternative minimum tax credits 
with respect to deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards  it is the opinion of management that is is more likely than not that the realization of these deferred tax assets will occur in the future based on current earnings forecasts  tax planning strategies  which include the potential sale of a line of business and or product assets  and reversals of future book tax timing differences 
with respect to foreign tax credits  research and development tax credits and alternative minimum tax credits  management believes  based on several factors  that the available objective evidence creates sufficient uncertainty regarding the potential realization of these deferred tax assets due to the fact that the net operating loss must be utilized before these credits 
as a result  valuation allowances have been recorded for foreign tax credits  research and development tax credits  and alternative minimum tax credits 
the factors which create sufficient uncertainty include the unpredictability of the geographic source of future software licenses  certain tax rules related to foreign source income and foreign tax credits  and the historical level of annual foreign withholding taxes 
management believes that  based on the available evidence  it is more likely than not that the company will not realize the deferred tax assets related to foreign tax credits  research and development tax credits  and the alternative minimum tax credits 
the company will continue to assess the potential realization of these deferred tax assets based on actual and projected operating results
