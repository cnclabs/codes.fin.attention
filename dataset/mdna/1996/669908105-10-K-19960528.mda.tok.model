page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued fiscal year versus continued liquidity and capital resources continued in a private placement completed on august   the company issued million principal amount of subordinated convertible notes  which are due in  increments on august   and the notes are subordinate in right of payment to all existing and future senior indebtedness of the company 
the notes bear interest at  payable quarterly on november  february  may and august the notes are convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the cost of issuing these notes was  and is being amortized over the life of the notes 
as of february    of the notes have been converted into  shares of common stock and  principal amount of subordinated convertible notes remained outstanding 
on april   subsequent to the balance sheet date  of the notes were converted into  shares of common stock and  principal amount of subordinated convertible notes remain outstanding as of may  the company has experienced an overall shortfall in operating cash flow over the last eight fiscal quarters primarily due to the approximate fifty six percent increase in sales for the current fiscal year and the approximately forty one percent increase in sales in fiscal as a result of this sales growth the company has been required to finance increased levels of accounts receivable and inventory which exceed the amounts that can be supported by operating cash flows 
the short fall in operating cash flow has been supplemented through the issuance of the subordinated convertible notes and the utilization of the unsecured bank credit line as described above 
while the company cannot predict that growth will continue at the same rate experienced over the last two fiscal years  management is planning for substantial growth over the ensuing twelve month period which more than likely will result in a continued shortfall in operating cash flow 
the company anticipates that its capital resources provided by its bank line of credit will be sufficient to meet its financing requirements during that period 
inflationary impact since the inception of operations  inflation has not significantly affected the operating results of the company 
however  inflation and changing interest rates have had a significant effect on the economy in general and therefore could affect the operating results of the company in the future
