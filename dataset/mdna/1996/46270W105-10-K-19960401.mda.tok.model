item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview in  iris began implementing a new strategy to expand its urinalysis business by adding a line of proprietary cost effective  outcome enhancing urinalysis products suitable for laboratories of all sizes 
as part of this strategy  iris acquired i the digital refractometer product line of biovation  inc in march  ii the complete business of statspin technologies in february and iii the urinalysis business of urohealth systems  inc in march iris may pursue additional acquisitions in the future consistent with this strategy 
see business narrative description of business recent acquisitions 
during march  iris acquired the digital refractometer product line from biovation  inc for  in cash and warrants to purchase  shares of iris common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the product line consists of manufacturing and marketing a patented device known as a digital refractometer and the related consumables used in its operation and maintenance 
revenues from this product line averaged approximately  over biovation s last three fiscal years 
during february  iris acquired norwood  massachusetts based norfolk scientific  inc for approximately  shares of iris common stock and the assumption of options and warrants to purchase an additional  shares of iris common stock 
norfolk scientific  which conducts business under the trade name statspin technologies  manufactures special purpose centrifuges and other small laboratory instruments and plastic consummable items used in their operation 
statspin had net sales of million for the twelve months ended december  the total consideration paid by iris including the immediately realizable value of the assumed options and warrants is estimated at  based on a negotiated price of per share of iris common stock in the transaction 
the acquisition was accomplished through the merger of a newly formed subsidiary of iris into statspin  with statspin being the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of iris 
the acquisition was accounted for using the pooling of interests method 
in response to the exercise of demand registration rights granted in connection with the acquisition  iris filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission on march  to register approximately  shares of iris common stock which may be offered for sale from time to time by the former securityholders of statspin 
during march  iris acquired the urinalysis business of urohealth systems  inc for  of which  was cash and  the assumption of liabilities 
urohealth systems generated revenues of approximately  from this business in the business consists primarily of manufacturing and marketing two proprietary product lines the cen slide registered trademark system for centrifugal urine sedimentation and manual microscopic examination and the flostar registered trademark urine specimen collection and dispensing container 
there were also several significant developments in related to iris core business of marketing major laboratory instruments and related consumables 
iris completed the acquisition of lda systems  inc lda in june for approximately  shares of iris common stock and thereby reacquired all rights to the white iris registered trademark leukocyte differential analyzer 
the white iris registered trademark is a major new product which iris was developing in a joint program with lda similar to the current program with psi described below 
iris is currently awaiting fda clearance to market the white iris registered trademark 
however  there can be no assurance that iris can secure fda clearance or that the white iris registered trademark will be a commercially feasible or successful product 
as a result of the lda acquisition  iris incurred a non recurring  non cash charge of million against earnings in the second quarter for the acquisition of in process research and development ie  work in process not yet cleared for interstate commerce by the fda 
see business future developments the white iris registered trademark and hematology 
late in the third quarter of  iris began marketing two new models the model and model of its flagship product line  the yellow iris registered trademark series of urinalysis workstations 
a new and faster workstation  the model introduces a series of technology upgrades that make it the most accurate  fastest and easiest to use urine profiling system ever built  replacing the long established model version of the yellow iris registered trademark 
a new and faster low cost model workstation also replaces the earlier model version of the yellow iris registered trademark 
the model was introduced in as a lower priced alternative to the yellow iris registered trademark model the model is the lower priced version of the model the lower priced version of the yellow iris registered trademark accounted for approximately and of all new systems placed during and  respectively 
the lower priced version is expected to remain a significant percentage of total system sales because of its appeal to more numerous community hospitals 
however  the introduction of the new models may change the ratio of sales of both units as the marketplace determines their relative appeal 
while the gross margin on the lower priced version is smaller  iris believes it contributes incrementally to the aggregate gross margin earned as it appeals to a market segment that ordinarily would not buy the more expensive model 
because its incremental margin exceeds the incremental operational expenses connected with its sale  it contributes positively to the profitability of iris 
in september  iris and poly u a systems  inc psi entered into a joint project to develop several new products based on iris technology the psi products to further enhance automation in the urinalysis field 
these products are expected to have dual potential as both stand alone products and enhancements to the iris flagship products  the yellow iris registered trademark series of urinalysis workstations 
under the terms of this project  psi will have the right to use the iris technology and any newly developed technology for developing  manufacturing and marketing the new products as stand alone devices  and iris will have the right to use the newly developed technology for any other purpose and to incorporate the new products into the yellow iris registered trademark 
psi has retained iris to conduct research  development  clinical evaluation and pre market testing of the proposed new products 
iris will fund the first  per month up to a maximum of  of the cost of the project  and psi will reimburse iris for the excess 
psi  a privately held company based in los angeles  california  was organized by iris in june to undertake the commercial development of the psi products 
in order to fund its share of the project  psi raised net proceeds of approximately million through the sale of units at a price of  per unit 
each unit consisted of  shares of psi s callable common stock and a warrant to purchase  shares of iris common stock 
the iris warrants are exercisable at per share during the last two years of their three year duration 
iris also issued warrants to the placement agent and the finder to purchase an aggregate of  shares of iris common stock at per share for a period of five years 
iris has an option until days after termination of the project with psi which terminates not later than july  to acquire all of the common stock of psi at prices rising over time from to per share of psi common stock or an aggregate of million to million for all the outstanding shares of psi common stock 
iris may pay the option exercise price in cash or with shares of iris common stock valued at the day average closing price just prior to exercise 
if  at the time of exercise  psi has completed product development and obtained fda clearance to market any new products  iris would likely capitalize that portion of the purchase price attributable to completed products and amortize it over the estimated useful life of the completed technology 
iris would likely allocate a substantial portion of the balance of the purchase price plus any psi liabilities outstanding at the time of acquisition to any products which have not been completed and approved for marketing by the fda and would record a nonrecurring  noncash if purchased with iris stock charge against earnings in that amount for the acquisition of in process research and development ie work in process not yet cleared by the fda 
in  iris developed a strategic alliance with boehringer mannheim corporation bmc  an indianapolis based manufacturer of diagnostic products  and boehringer mannheim gmbh bmg  bmc s german affiliate and a world leader in clinical chemistry 
bmc and bmg are wholly owned subsidiaries of corange limited corange  a diversified healthcare company with worldwide sales of more than billion 
all three companies underwent a significant management restructuring in as a result of the restructuring  together with certain events which followed the restructuring  iris initiated discussions with bmg to address several concerns 
based on the position of the bmg management to date  iris believes that these concerns can be adequately addressed 
nonetheless  iris cannot predict what changes  if any  in the iris bmg alliance will result from these discussions 
see business strategic alliance with boehringer mannheim 
the chemstrip iristrips tm became a significant source of revenues in  as more than sixty percent of existing iris customers have converted to the new test strips 
iris began marketing the new test strips during the fourth quarter of concurrently with the introduction of an improved version of the yellow iris registered trademark featuring the new chemstrip registered trademark urine test reader 
bmc designed and manufactures both the test strips and the readers especially for the yellow iris registered trademark 
see business strategic alliance with boehringer mannheim distribution of chemstrip iristrip tm urine test strips and custom reader 
in july  iris and bmg unveiled a prototype of the new iris bmc udx tm urine pathology system  a high capacity  automated urinalysis system for reference laboratories based on the proprietary technologies of both companies 
the udx tm  part of the yellow iris registered trademark series of urinalysis workstations  is being jointly developed by iris and bmg 
pending fda clearance  the udx tm will be manufactured by iris in its chatsworth  california facility and distributed by iris in north america and through bmg and its affiliates overseas 
however  there can be no assurance that iris can secure fda clearance or that udx tm will be a commercially feasible or successful product 
see business strategic alliance with boehringer mannheim joint development of reference laboratory system 
iris  like many other companies in the clinical laboratory instrumentation business  is feeling the impact of medicare reimbursement regulations and current economic conditions which have intensified the review of capital expenditures by hospitals 
one result has been slower than expected replacement sales as iris customers postpone capital expenditures and continue using the yellow iris registered trademark beyond its five year anticipated life 
on the other hand  iris believes a longer instrument life may benefit new customer sales by providing greater product justification 
iris also believes the impact of intensified capital expenditure reviews may be mitigated by the current widespread shortage of medical technologists since its products reduce the number of medical technologists needed in the laboratory and by the increased interest in better outcomes since its products can produce more accurate and faster results 
see business cost containment 
nonetheless  healthcare is an area of extensive and dynamic change  and iris cannot predict future changes in the healthcare field or their impact on its business 
in recent years  an increasing number of legislative proposals have been introduced or proposed in congress and in some state legislatures that would effect major changes in the healthcare system  either nationally or at the state level 
the costs of certain proposals would be funded in part by reductions in payments by governmental programs  including medicare and medicaid to healthcare providers 
at the present time  iris believes that the effectiveness of the yellow iris registered trademark should be even more beneficial to hospitals if their revenues are further controlled 
however  if iris is unable to convince potential customers of this fact  these changes could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
results of operations compared to iris had net income of million for  an increase of 
million or from net income of million in an increase of 
million in income from sales was offset by a comparable increase in net costs associated with research and development contracts 
the improvement in income from sales is primarily attributable to increased sales of workstations  service contracts and related supplies  including the first full year of sales of chemstrip iristrips tm and nine months of sales of the recently acquired biovation product line  and decreased field service costs 
the 
million increase in overall net income was the result of a million non cash deferred tax benefit due to the reduction of the company s deferred tax valuation allowance discussed below  after recognition of a million nonrecurring charge related to the acquisition of lda 
see overview above regarding the lda acquisition 
in  iris recognized a tax benefit of million through a reduction in the company s deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
this reduction in the valuation allowance resulted principally from the company s assessment of the realizability of its net operating loss carryforwards based on recent operating history as well as an assessment that operations will continue to generate taxable income 
realization of the deferred tax assets are dependent upon continued generation of sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the loss carryforwards 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized 
the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the future if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
these results also include interest income from investments of  for  compared to  in the  increase in interest income is due largely to the increased amounts of invested cash 
see liquidity and capital resources 
the above results also include other income consisting of royalties from toa of  for  compared to  for the royalty amount reflects an agreement with toa to temporarily increase the amount of the royalty from to and the scope of the royalty to apply to revenues on consumables and service contracts  as well as instruments 
these changes were made retroactive to october and expire in september  at which time the scope and amount of the royalty will revert to their original term unless toa exercises its right under the temporary agreement to negotiate a permanent change to the license 
net sales excluding revenues from research and development contracts increased to million for from million during the million increase was attributable primarily to an increase in sales of workstations and related supplies 
cost of goods sold excluding the cost of research and development contracts increased from approximately million in to approximately million in and decreased as a percentage of sales from to as a result of improved utilization of service parts and increased sales of consumables 
total research and development expenses  including the costs of development contracts  increased to million in from million in  as iris continued to invest in the development of new applications and further improvements in its technology 
research and development expenses related to the white iris registered trademark decreased to  for from  in  and were offset by related revenues of  in and  in from lda 
research and development expenses on this project decreased significantly following submission to the fda of an application for clearance to market the white iris registered trademark  and the offsetting revenues ceased when iris acquired lda 
research and development expenses related to the udx tm reference laboratory system were  for and were offset by revenues of  from bmg 
research and development expenses related to the psi products were  for research and development expenses unrelated to these three projects increased to  in from  in as research and development activity  in general  was intensified 
see overview  business future developments the white iris registered trademark and hematology  business strategic alliance with boehringer mannheim joint development of reference laboratory system 
marketing and selling expenses in increased by almost  to million  compared to the increase is due largely to a greater emphasis on direct marketing 
general and administrative expenses of million for increased by  from the increase in these expenses is due to a variety of factors including increases related to enlarged business and the installation of a new computer network 
compared to net income in increased to  from  in operating income increased  to  in from  in due to increased sales of service contracts and consumables 
net sales of workstations were relatively unchanged but contributed less to operating income in because of lower margins on replacement systems sold through an aggressive trade in program 
net income included interest income from investments of  in and  in the  increase in interest income is due to increased amounts of invested cash  generally higher interest rates and redirecting cash from interest bearing bank accounts to short and long term investments 
see liquidity and capital resources 
net income also included other income which consisted of royalties from toa of  in and  in net sales excluding revenues from research and development contracts increased to million in from million in this increase was attributable primarily to a  increase in revenues from service contracts 
improved sales of workstations and related supplies in the last three quarters of were offset by unusually slow sales of workstations during the first quarter of the year 
costs of goods sold excluding costs of research and development contracts increased to million in from million in and increased as a percent of sales  in compared to in  as the result of a higher cost of service parts 
total research and development expenses  including costs incurred on development contracts  increased to million in from million in as iris continued its work under the research and development agreement with lda 
research and development expenses related to the white iris registered trademark increased to  in from  in  but were offset by related revenues of  and  in and  respectively  from lda under the research and development agreement 
research and development expenses unrelated to the white iris registered trademark decreased slightly to  in from  in marketing and selling expenses in increased  in to million as iris continued to expand the coverage of its sales territories and increase its product promotion and participation at trade shows 
general and administrative expenses of million in remained consistent with amounts spent on general and administrative expenses in liquidity and capital resources working capital increased by million since december  to a total of million at december  iris generated cash of  from the sale of stock to employees and million from the exercise of warrants issued in connection with lda offerings 
see business future developments the white iris registered trademark and hematology 
total accounts receivable increased by approximately  in line with the increased sales level in inventory increased  to accommodate several new products  including the chemstrip iristrips tm 
total current liabilities were relatively unchanged during the period 
during  iris invested approximately  in new machinery and equipment   in the acquisition of the biovation product line and  in the construction of workstations for rental 
during the first quarter of  iris invested  in the acquisition of the urohealth urinalysis business 
iris currently is considering the purchase of equipment during for the manufacture of cen slide registered trademark and flostar registered trademark products  the principal products of this business 
future commitments for capital expenditures may also prove necessary to continue iris efforts in research and development and to manufacture and market its existing products 
iris has made numerous improvements in the yellow iris registered trademark over the years  and further improvements to the yellow iris registered trademark will require a substantial amount of research and development time and financial resources 
while iris believes that it has the technical ability and financial resources for such implementations  iris is currently funding the majority of this work through a collaborative arrangement with bmg and through a joint development program with psi 
see overview 
iris currently plans to use only modest amounts of its current working capital for further development of products other than those related to the yellow iris registered trademark and the white iris registered trademark 
more vigorous development of the purple iris registered trademark and other products depends on securing alternative sources of funding such as the joint development programs with psi and bmg 
however  there can be no assurance that iris will be successful in more of these kinds of efforts  or any others  to locate acceptable sources of funding desired for other products 
in an effort to increase interest income on its cash and cash equivalents  iris invests a significant portion of its funds in us treasury securities and federally insured certificates of deposit 
as a result  short and long term investments increased by approximately million since december  iris believes that its current cash on hand plus short term investments will be sufficient to meet its needs for at least the next year
