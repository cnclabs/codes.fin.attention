investment portfolio the company maintains a securities portfolio consisting of us treasury  us government agencies and corporations  state and political subdivisions  asset backed and other securities 
investment securities are held in safekeeping by an independent custodian 
in november  the financial accounting standards board issued a special report  a guide to implementation to statement no 
 on accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities questions and answers the special report 
the special report allowed companies to reassess the appropriateness of the classifications of all securities and account for any reclassification at fair value 
the company adopted the reclassification provision stated in the special report prior to december  and transferred million of securities held to maturity into available for sale 
the unrealized pretax gain upon transfer was million as of december  the objective of the investment securities held to maturity is to strengthen the portfolio yield  and to provide collateral to pledge for federal  state and local government deposits and other borrowing facilities 
the investments held to maturity had an average term to maturity of months at december  and  on the same date  those investments included million in fixed rate and million in adjustable rate securities 
investment securities available for sale are generally used to supplement the banks liquidity 
unrealized net gains and losses on these securities are recorded as an adjustment to equity net of taxes  and are not reflected in the current earnings of the company 
if a security is sold  any gain or loss is recorded as a charge to earnings and the equity adjustment is reversed 
at december   the banks held million classified as investments available for sale 
at december   a net unrealized gain of million  related to these securities was held in stockholders equity 
the company had no trading securities at december  for more information on investment securities  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements found on pages and the following table shows the amortized cost of the company s investment securities as of the dates indicated in thousands us treasury    us government agencies and corporations    states and political subdivisions    asset backed securities    other securities    total    the following table is a summary of the relative maturities and yields of the company s investment securities as of december  weighted average yields have been computed by dividing annual interest income  adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount  by the amortized cost of the related security

these types of loans are typically paid in monthly installments over a number of years 
incudes demand loans commitments and lines of credit it is not the policy of the company to issue formal commitments on lines of credit except to a limited number of well established and financially responsible local commercial enterprises 
such commitments can be either secured or unsecured and are typically in the form of revolving lines of credit for seasonal working capital needs 
occasionally  such commitments are in the form of letters of credit to facilitate the customer s particular business transaction 
commitment fees generally are not charged except where letters of credit are involved 
commitments and lines of credit typically mature within one year 
see also note of the consolidated notes to the financial statements found on page asset quality the company closely monitors the markets in which it conducts its lending operations 
the company continues its strategy to control its exposure to loans with higher credit risk and increase diversification of earning assets into less risky investments 
asset reviews are performed using grading standards and criteria similar to those employed by bank regulatory agencies 
assets receiving lesser grades fall under the classified assets category  which includes all non performing assets and potential problem loans  and receive an elevated level of attention to ensure collection 
the following is a summary of classified assets on the dates indicated in millions at december  classified loans other classified assets total classified assets classified loans at december  decreased million or percent to million from december   reflecting improvements in the borrowers financial condition and satisfaction of debt 
the improvement is primarily due to the repayment of classified loans with real estate collateral 
other classified assets  which decreased million from the prior year  were due to sales and write downs of properties classified as other real estate owned 
non performing assets non performing assets include non accrual loans  loans or more days past due and still accruing and other real estate owned 
loans are placed on non accrual status upon reaching days or more delinquent  unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
interest previously accrued on loans placed on non accrual status is charged against interest income 
generally  loans secured by real estate with temporarily impaired values and commercial loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties are placed on non accrual status even though the borrowers continue to repay the loans as scheduled 
such loans are classified by management as performing non accrual and are included in total non performing assets 
performing non accrual loans are reinstated to accrual status when improvements in credit quality eliminate the doubt as to the full collectibility of both interest and principal 
when the ability to fully collect non accrual loan principal is in doubt  cash payments received are applied against the principal balance of the loan until such time as full collection of the remaining recorded balance is expected 
any additional payments received after that point are recorded as interest income on a cash basis 
non performing assets in millions performing non accrual loans non performing non accrual loans total non accrual loans loans or more days past due and still accruing 

total non performing loans other real estate owned total non performing assets reserve for loan losses as a percentage of non performing loans performing non accrual loans increased  to million at december  while non performing non accrual loans decreased  to million at december   due to loan collections  write downs and payoffs 
the declining other real estate balance during and was due to asset write downs and liquidations 
the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio has improved  resulting in an increase in the ratio of loan loss reserve as a percentage of total non accrual loans and loans or more days past due and still accruing 
the performance of any individual loan can be impacted by external factors such as the interest rate environment or factors particular to the borrower 
the amount of gross interest income that would have been recorded for non accrual loans if all such loans had been current in accordance with their original terms was  million and million in  and  respectively 
the amount of interest income that was recognized on non accrual loans from cash payments made in  and was   and  respectively 
cash payments received which were applied against the book balance of performing and non performing non accrual loans were immaterial for all three years

these include credit loss experience  the amount of past due and non performing loans  recommendations of regulatory authorities and prevailing economic conditions 
the reserve is allocated to segments of the loan portfolio based in part on a quantitative analysis of historical credit loss experience 
criticized and classified loans balances are analyzed using a linear regression model or standard allocation percentages 
the results of this analysis are applied to current criticized and classified loan balances to allocate the reserve to the respective segments of the loan portfolio 
in addition  loans with similar characteristics not usually criticized using regulatory guidelines due to their small balances and homogeneous nature  are analyzed based on the historical rate of net losses and delinquency trends grouped by the number of days the payments on those loans are delinquent 
while these factors are essentially judgemental and may not be reduced to a mathematical formula  management considers the reserve for loan losses  for the periods presented  to be adequate as a reserve against inherent losses 
management continues to evaluate the loan portfolio and assess current economic conditions that will dictate future reserve levels

the reduced allocation to commercial loans during prior years is primarily due to fluctuations in the balance of criticized loans 
the increased allocation to construction loans in attributable to increases in criticized loans due to the recessionary environment and the level of credit loss recoveries 
the unallocated component includes management s judgemental determination of the amounts necessary for concentrations  economic uncertainties and other subjective factors 
effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan sfas  as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures sfas 
under sfas a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due principal and interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the measurement of impairment may be based on i the present value of the expected cash flows of the impaired loan discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate  ii the observable market price of the impaired loans or iii the fair value of the collateral of a collateral dependent loan 
sfas  as amended by sfas  does not apply to large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment 
the company generally identifies loans to be reported as impaired when such loans are in non accrual status or are considered troubled debt restructurings due to the granting of a below market rate of interest or a partial forgiveness of indebtedness on an existing loan 
in measuring impairment for the purpose of establishing specific loan loss reserves  the company reviews all impaired commercial and construction loans classified substandard and doubtful that meet materiality thresholds of  and  respectively 
the company considers classified loans below the established thresholds to represent immaterial loss risk 
all loss classified loans are fully reserved under the company s standard loan loss reserve methodology and subsequently charged off 
commercial and construction loans that are not classified  and large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans such as installment  personal revolving credit  residential real estate and student loans  are evaluated collectively for impairment under the company s standard loan loss reserve methodology and are  therefore  excluded from the specific evaluation using sfas the following summarizes the company s impaired loans at december  troubled total non accrual debt impaired specific in thousands loans restructurings other loans reserves the average balances of the company s impaired loans for the year ended december  were million 
asset and liability management the fundamental objective of the company s management of assets and liabilities is to maximize its economic value while maintaining adequate liquidity and a conservative level of interest rate risk 
in evaluating the exposure to interest rate risk  the company considers the effects of various factors in implementing interest rate risk management activities  including interest rate swaps  utilized to hedge the impact of interest rate fluctuations on interest bearing assets and liabilities in the current interest rate environment 
interest rate swaps are agreements to exchange interest payments computed on notional amounts  which are used as a basis for the calculations only and do not represent exposure to risk for the company 
the risk to the company is associated with fluctuations of interest rates and with the counterparty s ability to meet its interest payment obligations 
the company minimizes this credit risk by entering into contracts with well capitalized money center banks and by requiring settlement of only the net difference between the exchanged interest payments 
during  the company was a party in four interest rate swaps  with notional amounts totaling million 
in august  the last two of these contracts  with notional amounts totaling million  expired 
the company paid a variable rate based on three month libor and received an average fixed rate of percent 
the other two swaps  with notional amounts totaling million  expired in november and december the effect of entering into these contracts resulted in reductions of net interest income of  and  in and  respectively 
the primary analytical tool used by the company to gauge interest rate sensitivity is a simulation model used by many major banks and bank regulators 
this industry standard model is used to simulate  based on the current and projected portfolio mix  the effects on net interest income of changes in market interest rates 
under the company s policy and practice  the projected amount of net interest income over the ensuing twelve months is not allowed to fluctuate more than ten percent even under alternate assumed interest rate changes of plus or minus basis points 
the results of the model indicate that the mix of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at december  did not expose the company to an unacceptable level of interest rate risk

the interest rate sensitivity report shown above categorize interest bearing transaction deposits and savings deposits as repricing within days 
however  it is the experience of management that the historical interest rate volatility of these interest bearing transaction and savings deposits can be similar to liabilities with longer repricing dates  depending on market conditions 
moreover  the degree to which these interest bearing transaction and savings deposits respond to changes in money market rates usually is less than the response of interest rate sensitive loans 
these factors cause the cumulative net liability position shown above to indicate a much greater degree of liability sensitivity than management believes really exists based on the additional analysis previously discussed 
liquidity the principal sources of asset liquidity are marketable investment and money market securities available for sale 
at december   investment securities available for sale totaled million 
this represents an increase of million from december  the increase from prior year is  in large part  the result of a one time reclassification  at december   of million of securities held to maturity to available for sale  that will provide greater flexibility for managing the securities portfolio 
see note to the consolidated financial statements regarding this one time reclassification 
in addition  and as in previous years  growth in deposits and purchased funds exceeded loan growth  resulting in an increase in the overall size of the securities portfolio 
the company generates significant liquidity from its operating activities 
the company s profitability in  and generated substantial cash flows provided from operations of million  million and million  respectively 
additional cash flow may be provided by financing activities  primarily the acceptance of customer deposits and short term borrowings from banks 
deposit balances declined million  million and million during  and  respectively 
the decline in included the effect of the sale of sonoma valley bank 
during  the company paid off million of its high rate long term debt 
to compensate for decreases in deposits and long term debt  the company increased its short term borrowings  which grew million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in addition  in december  westamerica bank issued a ten year  million subordinated capital note that qualified as tier ii capital  to be used as a source of working capital 
the company uses cash flow from operating and financing activities to make investments in loans  money market assets and investment securities 
the company s strategy to reduce its exposure to high risk loans was partially offset by the risk level of loan portfolios acquired through the mergers in the combination resulted in loan volume increases of million and million in and  respectively 
it is the intention of the company to moderately increase loan volume without jeopardizing credit quality 
the investment securities portfolio increased by million and million  in and  respectively 
the company anticipates increasing its cash levels through the end of mainly due to increased profitability and retained earnings 
for the same period  it is anticipated that the investment securities portfolio and demand for loans will moderately increase 
the growth in deposit balances is expected to follow the anticipated growth in loan and investment balances through the end of capital resources the current and projected capital position of the company and the impact of capital plans and long term strategies is reviewed regularly by management 
the company s capital position represents the level of capital available to support continued operations and expansion 
the company s primary capital resource is shareholders equity  which increased million or percent from the previous year end and increased million or percent from december  the ratio of total risk based capital to risk adjusted assets increased to percent at december   from percent at december  tier i risk based capital to risk adjusted assets increased to percent at december   from percent at year end capital to risk adjusted assets minimum regulatory capital at december  requirements tier i capital total capital leverage ratio the risk based capital ratios improved in due to a more rapid growth in equity than total assets  in conjunction with an increase in investment securities and a decrease in loan balances  which reduced the level of risk adjusted assets 
capital ratios are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that capital exceeds the prescribed regulatory minimums and is adequate to meet the company s future needs 
all ratios are in excess of regulatory definitions of well capitalized 
during and  the board of directors of the company authorized the repurchase and retirement of up to  shares of common stock from time to time  subject to appropriate regulatory and other accounting requirements 
these purchases were made periodically in the open market and reduced the dilutive impact of issuing new shares to meet stock performance  option plans and other requirements 
the company also plans to issue a million senior note in the proceeds of this note will be used primarily for working capital and for the company s ongoing stock repurchase program

the combination of these effects is the main reason for the million decrease in personnel related expenses  million reduction in loan related expenses  and other reductions in most non interest expense categories 
in addition  a million reduction in fdic insurance expense resulting from reduced premiums  contributed to the overall year to year decreases in this category 
non interest expense in was million or percent lower than this expense reduction is the direct result of efficiencies  streamlining and consolidations of operations achieved after the merger with napa valley bancorp 
these were the major reasons for the million reduction in employee related expenses and decreases in almost all other non interest expense categories
