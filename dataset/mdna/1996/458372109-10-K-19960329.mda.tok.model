the company has developed a network of direct sales offices  dealers and value added resellers vars which sells the company s products  and in recent periods the company has focused on expanding its direct sales capabilities and its dealer and var network 
the company has effected a number of strategic acquisitions of resellers of telephony products and integrated these operations with its existing direct sales operations in the same geographic areas and in other strategic markets 
sales of systems through the company s dealers and vars typically generate lower gross margins than sales through the company s direct sales organization  although direct sales typically require higher levels of selling  general and administrative expenses 
in addition  the company s long distance and network services typically generate lower gross margins than sales of software and system products 
accordingly  the company s margins may vary from period to period depending upon distribution channel and product mix 
in the event that sales through dealers or sales of long distance services increase as a percentage of net sales  the company s overall gross margin could decline 
this is possible  because other high margins products  like software  could offset lower margin products 
the company s operating results depend upon a variety of factors  including the volume and timing of orders received during a period  the mix of products sold and mix of distribution channels  general economic conditions  patterns of capital spending by customers  the timing of new product announcements and releases by the company and its competitors  pricing pressures and the availability and cost of products and components from the company s suppliers

inflation currency fluctuation inflation and currency fluctuations have not previously had a material impact on inter tel s operations 
international procurement agreements have traditionally been denominated in us currency 
moreover  a significant amount of contract manufacturing has been or is expected to be moved to domestic sources 
the expansion of international operations in the united kingdom and europe and anticipated increased sales in japan and asia and elsewhere could result in higher international sales as a percentage of total revenues  but international revenues are currently not significant

resold totalease rentals totaling million and remain unbilled at december  and  respectively 
the company is obligated to repurchase such income streams in the event of defaults by lease customers and  accordingly  maintains reserves based on loss experience and past due accounts 
although the company to date has been able to resell the rental streams from leases under the totalease program profitably and on a substantially current basis  the timing and profitability of lease resales could impact the company s business and operating results  particularly in an environment of fluctuating interest rates 
if the company is required to repurchase rental streams and realizes losses thereon in amounts exceeding its reserves  its operating results will be adversely affected 
the company believes that its working capital and credit facilities  together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund purchases of capital equipment  finance any cash acquisitions which the company may consider and provide adequate working capital for the foreseeable future 
however  to the extent that additional funds may be required in the future to address working capital needs and to provide funding for capital expenditures  expansion of the business or additional acquisitions  the company will consider additional financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available when required or on acceptable terms

statement also addresses the accounting for long lived assets that are expected to be disposed of 
the company will adopt statement in the first quarter of and  based on current circumstances  does not believe the effect of the adoption will be material
