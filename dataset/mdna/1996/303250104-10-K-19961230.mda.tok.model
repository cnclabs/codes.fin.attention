its dynamark subsidiary provides data processing and database management services to businesses engaged in direct marketing 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes 
in addition to historical information  this report includes certain forward looking statements regarding events and trends which may affect the company s future results 
such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially 
such factors include  but are not limited to  those described in this discussion and analysis 
the company is organized into business units that correspond to its principal markets consumer credit  insurance and direct marketing dynamark 
sales to the consumer credit industry have traditionally accounted for the bulk of the company s revenues 
products developed specifically for a single user in this market are generally sold on a fixed price basis 
such products include application and behavior scoring algorithms also known as analytic products or scorecards  credit application processing systems asap tm and creditdesk r and custom credit account management systems  including those marketed under the name triad 
tm software systems usually also have a component of ongoing maintenance revenue  and creditdesk systems have also been sold under time or volume based price arrangements 
credit scoring and credit account management services sold through credit bureaus and third party credit card processors are generally priced based on usage 
products sold to the insurance industry are generally priced based on the number of policies in force  subject to contract minimums 
dynamark employs a combination of fixed fee and usage based pricing 
results of operations revenues the following table sets forth for the fiscal periods indicated a the percentage of revenues represented by fixed price and usage priced revenues from the credit business unit  and the percentage of revenues contributed by the dynamark and insurance business units  and b the percentage change in revenues within each category from the prior fiscal year 
fixed price revenues include all revenues from application processing software  custom scorecard development and consulting projects for credit 
virtually all usage revenues are generated through third party alliances such as those with credit bureaus and third party credit card processors 
percentage of period to period revenue percentage changes years ended september  to to credit fixed price usage priced dynamark insurance total revenues since its acquisition  dynamark has taken on an increasing share of the mainframe batch processing requirements of the company s other business units 
during fiscal  such inter company revenue has represented more than fifteen percent of dynamark s total revenues 
accordingly  dynamark s externally reported revenues tend to understate dynamark s growth and contribution to the company as a whole 
in addition  dynamark s revenue growth in the first six months of fiscal was slowed by disruptions caused by the merger of one of its largest customers 
on july   dynamark acquired the assets and business of printronic corporation of america  inc printronic and on november   it sold the assets and business of its personalized printing division to gage marketing group  llc 
revenues from the two operations in the twelve month periods prior to these transactions were similar  so the net effect on dynamark s revenue in future periods is not expected to be material 
on september   the company acquired credit risk management associates  inc crma 
crma s revenues in the year ended september   were approximately million 
revenue from credit application scoring products increased by percent in fiscal compared with fiscal  and by percent in fiscal compared with fiscal  due primarily to the company s introduction of new products  including tracking software and small business loan scoring products 
asap revenues increased by percent in compared with  and by another percent in fiscal  primarily due to increased sales of pc based asap products creditdesk  including sales to small business lenders  and sales of software components for mainframe asap systems 
revenues from sales of credit account management systems triad sold to end users increased percent from to and by percent from to the company s high degree of success in penetrating the us bankcard industry with these products has limited  and may continue to limit  the revenue growth in that market 
however  the company has added functionality for the existing base of triad users and is actively marketing triad for other types of credit products and in overseas markets  which accounted for most of the growth in and usage revenues are generated primarily by credit scoring services distributed through major credit bureaus and credit account management services distributed through third party bankcard processors 
revenues from credit bureau related services have increased by more than percent in each of the last three fiscal years and accounted for approximately percent of revenues in fiscal and revenues from services provided through bankcard processors also increased in each of these years  due primarily to increases in the number of accounts at each of the major processors 
revenues derived from alliances with credit bureaus and credit card processors have accounted for much of the company s revenue growth and improvement in operating margins over the last three years 
while the company has been very successful in extending or renewing such agreements in the past  and believes it will generally be able to do so in the future  the loss of one or more such alliances or an adverse change in terms could have a significant impact on revenues and operating margin 
revenues generated through the company s alliances with equifax  inc  experian information solutions  inc  formerly trw information systems services and trans union corporation each accounted for approximately nine to eleven percent of the company s total revenues in fiscal and on november   it was announced that experian was being acquired by ccn group ltd  a subsidiary of great universal stores  plc 
ccn is the company s largest competitor  worldwide  in the area of credit scoring 
trw experian has offered scoring products developed by ccn in competition with those of the company for several years 
the company is not presently able to determine what effect  if any  the acquisition of experian by ccn will have on its future revenues 
on september   amendments to the fair credit reporting act were enacted and signed into law 
the company believes these changes to the federal law regulating credit reporting will be favorable to the company and its clients 
among other things  the new law expressly permits the use of credit bureau data to prescreen consumers for offers of credit and insurance and allows affiliated companies to share consumer information with each other subject to certain conditions 
there is also a seven year moratorium on new state legislation on certain issues 
however  the states remain free to regulate the use of credit bureau data in connection with insurance underwriting 
the company believes such enacted or proposed state regulation has had a negative impact on its efforts to sell insurance risk scores through credit reporting agencies 
the company s revenues derived from customers outside the united states increased from million in fiscal to million in and to million in dynamark has not had significant non us revenues 
sales of software products  including triad and pc based asap  and an increase in the number of accounts using the company s account management services at credit card processors in europe and latin america accounted for most of the increases in international revenues in fiscal and revenues from software maintenance and consulting services each accounted for less than percent of revenues in each of the three years in the period ended september   and the company does not expect revenues from either of these sources to exceed percent of revenues in the foreseeable future 
during the period since  while the rate of account growth in the us bankcard industry has been slowing and many of the company s largest institutional clients have merged and consolidated  the company has generated above average growth in revenues even after correcting for the effect of the dynamark acquisition from its bankcard related scoring and account management business by deepening its penetration of large banks and other credit issuers 
the company believes much of its future growth prospects will rest on its ability to develop new  high value products and services for its present client base of major us consumer credit issuers  to increase its penetration of established or emerging credit markets outside the us and canada  and to expand either directly or through further acquisitions into relatively undeveloped or underdeveloped markets for its products and services  such as direct marketing  insurance  small business lending and healthcare information management 
over the long term  in addition to the factors discussed above  the company s rate of revenue growth excluding growth due to acquisitions is limited by the rate at which it can recruit and absorb additional professional staff 
while the increased percentage of usage revenues may loosen this constraint to some extent  management believes it will continue to exist indefinitely 
on the other hand  despite the high penetration the company has already achieved in certain markets  the opportunities for application of its core competencies are much greater than it can pursue 
thus  the company believes it can continue to grow revenues  within the personnel constraint  for the foreseeable future 
at times management may forego short term revenue growth in order to devote limited resources to opportunities which it believes have exceptional long term potential 
this occurred in the period from through when the company devoted significant resources to developing the usage priced services distributed through credit bureaus and third party processors 
cumulative revenue since  net of the dynamark acquisition  is slightly above the company s year historical average revenue growth of about percent 
expenses the following table sets forth for the fiscal periods indicated a the percentage of net revenues represented by certain line items in the company s consolidated statement of income  and b the percentage change in the amount of each such line item from the prior fiscal year 
percentage of period to period revenue percentage changes years ended september  to to total revenues costs and expenses cost of revenues sales and marketing research and development general and administrative amortization of intangibles total costs and expenses income from operations other income expense nm income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income not meaningful cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel  travel and related overhead costs  costs of computer service bureaus  and the amounts paid by the company to credit bureaus for scores and related information in connection with the scorenet r service 
cost of revenues  as a percentage of revenues  has remained essentially unchanged since fiscal sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist principally of personnel  travel  overhead  advertising and other promotional expenses 
as a percentage of revenues  sales and marketing expenses were essentially unchanged in fiscal compared with fiscal  but decreased in fiscal due primarily to a reduction in media advertising 
research and development research and development expenses include the personnel and related overhead costs incurred in product development  researching mathematical and statistical algorithms  and developing software tools that are aimed at improving productivity and management control 
research and development expenses  in absolute dollars  were essentially unchanged from fiscal to and increased sharply in fiscal after several years of concentrating on developing new markets either geographical or by industry for its existing technologies  the company has recently increased emphasis on developing new technologies  especially in the area of software development 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist mainly of compensation expenses for certain senior management  corporate facilities expenses  the costs of administering certain benefit plans  legal expenses  expenses associated with the exploration of new business opportunities and the costs of operating administrative functions such as finance and computer information systems 
as a percentage of revenues  these expenses increased in fiscal compared with fiscal  due to significant increases in office space  expenditures made to improve the company s information systems and technology infrastructure  and the costs of exploring new business opportunities  primarily in the healthcare information management area 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses were essentially unchanged in fiscal compared with fiscal amortization of intangibles the company is amortizing the intangible assets arising from various acquisitions over periods ranging from two to years 
the level of amortization expense in future years will depend  in part  on the amount of additional payments to the former shareholders of an acquired company 
see below  under capital resources and liquidity 
other income expense the table in note to the consolidated financial statements presents the detail of other income and expenses 
interest income is derived from the investment of funds surplus to the company s immediate operating requirements 
at september   the company had approximately million invested in us treasury securities and other interest bearing instruments 
interest income increased in fiscal and due to rising interest rates and the increasing balance in interest bearing accounts and instruments 
the company s share of operating losses in certain early stage development companies that are accounted for using the equity method is charged to other expense 
in addition  during the quarter ended september   the company wrote off an investment in a different early stage development company due to the deteriorating financial condition of that entity 
this write off and the company s share of losses in these early stage development companies were primarily responsible for the difference between the increase in operating income in fiscal percent and the increase in net income percent 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the company s investment in such companies 
provision for income taxes the company s effective tax rate increased to approximately percent in fiscal from an effective rate of approximately percent in fiscal  and decreased to percent in fiscal due primarily to a changing mix of applicable state and foreign tax rates 
the company expects its effective tax rate in fiscal to be approximately the same as in fiscal  barring any change in the tax laws 
capital resources and liquidity working capital increased from  at september   to  at september   and to  at september  the increase in fiscal was due primarily to increases in accounts receivable and short term investments and decreases in billings in excess of earned revenues and income taxes payable  which more than offset increases in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities  and in accrued compensation and employee benefits 
the company may be required to make additional payments to the former stockholders of crma based upon its financial results in fiscal  and those amounts  which will be paid percent in company stock and percent in cash  will not exceed million per year 
in fiscal  cash provided by operations was more than offset by cash used in investing activities and financing activities 
cash provided by operations resulted primarily from net income before depreciation and amortization  and increases in accrued compensation and employee benefits  partially offset by the increase in accounts receivable and unbilled work in progress 
cash was used in investing activities primarily for additions to property and equipment including major expansions at the company s headquarters in san rafael  california  and at dynamark s facility in st 
paul  minnesota  the earn out payment to the former owners of dynamark  the purchase of interest bearing investments and investments in a number of start up companies  partially offset by the maturities of interest bearing investments 
cash was used in financing activities primarily for the payment of dividends and reduction of capital lease obligations  partially offset by cash generated by the exercise of stock options 
in fiscal  cash provided by operations was offset by cash used in investing activities and financing activities 
cash provided by operations resulted primarily from net income before depreciation and amortization and increases in accrued compensation and benefits  partially offset by the increase in accounts receivable and the decrease in billings in excess of earned revenues 
cash was used in investing activities primarily for additions to property and equipment  purchases of interest bearing investments  the acquisitions of printronic and crma  and an earn out payment to the former shareholders of dynamark  partially offset by the maturities of interest bearing investments 
cash was used in financing activities primarily for the payment of dividends and reduction of capital lease obligations  partially offset by cash generated by the exercise of stock options 
future cash flows will continue to be affected by operating results  contractual billing terms and collections  investment decisions and dividend payments  if any 
at september   the company had no significant capital commitments other than those obligations described in notes  and to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that the cash and marketable securities on hand  along with cash expected to be generated by operations  will be adequate to meet its capital and liquidity needs for both the current year and the foreseeable future 
quarterly results the table in note to the consolidated financial statements presents unaudited quarterly operating results for the last eight fiscal quarters 
management believes that all the necessary adjustments have been included in the amounts stated to present fairly the selected quarterly information  when read in conjunction with the financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
this information includes all normal recurring adjustments that the company considers necessary for a fair presentation thereof  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
quarterly results may be affected by fluctuations in revenue associated with credit card solicitations  by the timing of orders for and deliveries of certain asap and triad systems  and by the seasonality of scorenet purchases 
with the exception of the cost of scorenet data purchased by the company  most of its operating expenses are not affected by short term fluctuations in revenues  thus short term fluctuations in revenue may have a significant impact on operating results 
however  in recent years these fluctuations were generally offset by the strong growth in revenues from services delivered through credit bureaus and third party bankcard processors 
management believes that neither the quarterly variations in net revenues and net income nor the results of operations for any particular quarter are necessarily indicative of results of operations for full fiscal years 
accordingly  management believes that the company s results should be evaluated on an annual basis
