the partnership receives quarterly cash distributions from the operating partnership and receives interest income from oppenheimer equities  inc see note b to the financial statements 
the partnership distributes its available cash flow to its partners  which equals cash distributions from the operating partnership plus interest income from the equities note less new york city ubt 
consequently  the partnership does not require any additional liquidity or capital resources 
oppenheimer capital  lp continued liquidity and capital resources continued the partnership makes quarterly distributions in an amount equal to of available cash flow to the limited partners the unitholders and to the general partner  oppenheimer financial corp

oppenheimer capital general the operating partnership s results of operations include those of its basic institutional investment management business and those of its subsidiary entities opcap advisors formerly quest for value advisors  occ distributors formerly quest for value distributors  oppenheimer capital limited  saratoga capital management saratoga  oppenheimer capital trust company opcap trust  ama investment advisers  lp and american medical investment company  lp collectively ama investment advisers 
for the periods presented  the operating partnership s operations have been characterized by substantial increases in assets under management 
this growth has been from three principal sources 
first  new clients have entered into investment management agreements and existing clients have added funds to their accounts under management 
second  rising securities price levels have increased the market values of investment portfolios 
third  mutual funds managed by opcap advisors have added to assets under management due to increased fund sales and market appreciation 
the growth in assets under management has been tempered by the operating partnership s withdrawal from the low fee rate option management business in order to concentrate on businesses offering higher returns 
for all periods presented  the option management business had no material effect on revenues or profitability 
revenues are generally derived from charging a fee based on the net assets of clients portfolios 
all periods presented show increased operating revenue 
revenues for all periods presented consist principally of investment management fees 
during the fiscal year  costs were reduced as a result of occ distributors withdrawal from the distribution of open end mutual funds and the elimination of retail operations at ama investment advisers 
these cost savings reflect a strategic decision to withdraw from selling directly to the retail market  and to instead market directly to institutions with strong retail distribution capabilities 
the value of assets under management increased to billion at april  from billion at april  the growth of assets under management was tempered by the loss of billion in option management accounts with a low effective fee rate and a reduction of million in fixed income mutual fund assets as a result of the quest sale see below 
institutional and private account assets under management increased to billion from billion and mutual fund assets under management increased to billion from billion for the same period 
the value of assets under management increased to billion at april  from billion at april  institutional and private account assets under management increased to billion from billion and mutual fund assets under management increased to billion from billion for the same period 
gain on quest sale on november   the operating partnership completed the sale of the investment advisory and other contracts and business relationships for its twelve quest for value mutual funds the quest sale to oppenheimerfunds  inc ofi  which is unrelated to the operating partnership  for a price of million 
an additional purchase price payment of up to million may be received by the operating partnership on the first anniversary of the closing if the assets of the six merged fixed income funds are then at stated levels 
the gain on the sale  before new york city unincorporated business tax ubt and minority interest  amounted to million 
total assets of the twelve funds were billion at november  the six equity funds involved  representing billion of those assets  continue to be managed by opcap advisors under a subadvisory contract with ofi  which allows the current portfolio management teams to remain in place 
the six equity funds have been renamed the oppenheimer quest value funds quest funds 
the six fixed income funds  representing approximately million of those assets  have been merged into comparable funds managed by ofi 
oppenheimer capital continued gain on quest sale continued annual sub advisory fees related to the quest funds are projected at million annually  based on assets under management as of june   down from the previous million of annual advisory fees for the twelve quest for value funds at november  this decrease is more than offset by cost reductions related to the operating partnership s withdrawal from the distribution of open end equity and fixed income mutual funds and by increased sales of quest funds 
assets in the six equity funds have increased to billion at june  from billion on november   reflecting record fund sales and market appreciation 
the operating partnership implemented a portion of the mutual fund distribution cost savings prior to the close of the quest sale  and results for the quarter ended april  reflected those savings 
in addition  as a result of the sale  significant expenditures that would have been made in systems  technology  sales and marketing capabilities  and new product development will not be necessary 
on january   as spelled out in its public offering nine years ago  the operating partnership s quest for value dual purpose fund will redeem all income shares and the capital shares are expected to convert to an open end fund  subject to shareholder approval 
it is anticipated that the shares of the open end fund will be distributed by  and that management control and shareholder services will be transferred to  ofi and that the operating partnership will become a subadvisor 
it is further anticipated that the operating partnership will be compensated in connection with the transfer of management control  distribution and shareholder servicing to ofi 
operating revenues total operating revenues increased for the year ended april  to  from  for the year ended april  and increased for the year ended april  from  for the year ended april  total operating revenues includes investment management fees  net distribution assistance and commission income  and interest and dividends 
investment management fees increased to  for the year ended april  from  for the year ended april  this increase is a result of average assets under management increasing to billion for the year ended april  from billion for the year ended april  in addition  investment management fees increased due to higher fee realizations as the result of a shift in the asset mix toward higher effective fee rate businesses  including mutual funds  variable annuities and wrap fee accounts and the withdrawal from the option management business  which had very low fee rates 
offsetting the above increase in part  the fee rate the operating partnership receives for subadvising the quest funds was reduced compared to the previous advisory fee rate 
performance fees earned in fiscal totaled million 
investment management fees increased for the year ended april  from  for the year ended april   primarily as a result of average assets under management increasing for the year ended april  from billion for the year ended april  this increase reflects higher fee realizations in the operating partnership s newer businesses and its institutional investment management business  increased performance fees earned in fiscal million in vs 

million in  and the loss of two option management accounts with significantly lower fee rates than the operating partnership s existing businesses with assets of approximately billion 
these accounts had fee rates significantly below the fee rates on the operating partnership s existing businesses 
net distribution assistance and commission income decreased to  for the year ended april  from  for the year ended april  this decrease reflects a million decline in certificate of deposit commission income as a result of lower demand for funds by banks 
in addition  net distribution assistance and commission declined due to lower unit investment trust commission income due to reduced demand for fixed income unit investment trusts  and reduced commission and distribution income as a result of the quest sale in november oppenheimer capital continued operating revenues continued net distribution assistance and commission income increased significantly for the year ended april  from  for the year ended april  primarily as a result of a million increase in certificate of deposit commission income as a result of increased demand for funds by banks and increased unit investment trust commission income 
interest and dividend income increased to  for the year ended april  from  for the year ended april  this increase can be primarily attributed to the interest earned on the proceeds received from the quest sale 
interest and dividend income for the year ended april  was  operating expenses total operating expenses increased for the year ended april  to  from  for the year ended april  and increased for the year ended april  from  for the year ended april  the operating partnership s most significant expense category is compensation and benefits  which includes salaries  bonuses  sales commissions  incentive compensation and other payroll related expenses 
compensation and benefits expense increased to  for the year ended april  from  for the year ended april  and increased for the year ended april  from  for the year ended april  for the year ended april   compensation and benefits increased due to staff salary increases  as well as higher incentive compensation costs due to increased new business  record operating profits and increased participation by key executives in incentive compensation plans as a result of industry competitive pressures and their individual contributions to firm profitability 
compensation and benefits expense also increased due to additions to staff to support the growth of products offered by opcap trust  saratoga  and the international and wrap fee divisions 
these increases were offset in part by significant staff reductions at occ distributors  ama investment advisers and in mutual fund accounting 
most staff reductions took place after the quest sale in november reflecting these reductions  staff size declined from at april  to at april  for the year ended april   compensation and benefits expense increased as a result of adding personnel to manage the increasing client and asset base and the expansion into new businesses 
occupancy expense increased for the year ended april  to  from  for the year ended april  and increased for the year ended april  from  for the year ended april  the increase for the year ending april  reflects increased amortization expense relating to leasehold improvements made during the past fiscal year and increased equipment rental costs 
for the year ended april   the increase was attributable to the acquisition of additional space to expand a growing institutional and mutual fund business  as well as the new businesses entered into during the year 
the operating partnership subleases a portion of its space at the oppenheimer tower  world financial center  from oppenheimer co  inc opco  an affiliated broker dealer  paying a pro rata share of opco s lease payments  based on the percentage of total space leased 
general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended april  to  from  for the year ended april  and increased for the year ended april  from  for the year ended april  the rate of growth of general and administrative expenses slowed in fiscal as the operating partnership realized cost savings from the quest sale and cost reductions at ama investment advisers 
general and administrative expenses increased in both fiscal and due to increased costs incurred in connection with the start up and development of new businesses  including ama investment advisers in only  opcap trust  saratoga and the expansion of the international division  and the increased activities in our traditional businesses 
the increase in general and administrative expenses reflects the significant investment made by the operating partnership in computer equipment and software to support professional and administrative staff  and higher professional services expenses due to the expansion of businesses and products  including higher custodial and processing charges for opcap trust 
oppenheimer capital continued operating expenses continued promotional expenses decreased for the year ended april  to  from  for the year ended april  and increased for the year ended april  from  for the year ended april  the decrease in promotional expenses for the current fiscal year was due primarily to a reduction in expenses incurred by occ distributors  as a result of the elimination of the open end mutual fund distribution effort  and the retail operations of ama investment advisers  and was offset in part by increased expenses in the operating partnership s new businesses due to increased travel and entertainment expenses as a result of increased staff size and increased new business activities 
for the year ended april  promotional expenses increased due to increased marketing activities and new product introductions in both the operating partnership s investment management business  mutual fund business and other new businesses 
operating income operating income increased for the year ended april  to  from  for the year ended april  and decreased for the year ended april  from  for the year ended april  for the year ended april   the operating profit margin expanded to from for the year ended april   and in the year ended april   the operating profit margin declined from for the year ended april  the increase in operating income and operating profit margin from to is principally due to rising securities price levels and the resultant revenue increase  as well as cost reductions as a result of the termination of retail activities at occ distributors and ama investment advisers 
in fiscal  losses from new businesses increased  while income from existing businesses increased million the decrease in fiscal operating income and operating profit margin is due to the increased costs associated with the operating partnership s expansion into new businesses 
during fiscal the operating partnership acquired ama investment advisers  opcap trust  and formed saratoga 
in addition  the operating partnership continued to significantly expand its international investment management division 
these new businesses incurred an operating loss of million in fiscal which was offset in part by a million increase in operating income from existing businesses 
income taxes although the operating partnership is not otherwise subject to federal  state  or local income taxes  it was subject to new york city ubt of  and  respectively  for the years ended april  and there are two reasons for the significant increase in new york city ubt 
first  due to a change in the tax law effective january   the new york city ubt is imposed on the total income of the operating partnership and the partnership is allowed to claim a credit for its pro rata share of any new york city ubt paid by the operating partnership 
previously  new york city ubt was assessed directly at the partnership level 
a second reason for the increase is the operating partnership s higher earnings  including the gain realized on the quest sale 
a corporate subsidiary of the operating partnership is subject to federal  state and local income taxes 
a foreign corporate subsidiary is subject to taxes in the foreign jurisdiction in which it is located 
liquidity and capital resources the gain on the quest sale totaled million 
the net proceeds from the sale were used to pay a special distribution to partners of million and the remaining funds were used to eliminate bank borrowings and to fund the working capital needs of the operating partnership 
at april  working capital totaled million as compared with million at april  and partners capital increased to million from million during this same period 
oppenheimer capital continued liquidity and capital resources continued the operating partnership has established a million credit facility with a commercial bank to meet operating and financing needs 
these funds have been used in the past to support increased management fees receivable  to expand facilities  to accommodate the growth of its business and to finance acquisitions 
the operating partnership intends to distribute on a quarterly basis substantially all its net income to the partnership and to opfin 
the operating partnership may distribute to the partnership and to opfin excess cash  taking into account the operating partnership s financial condition  results of operations  cash requirements and general economic conditions
