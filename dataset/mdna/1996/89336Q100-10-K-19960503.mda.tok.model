gross profit 
gross profit  as a percentage of sales  decreased from in to in approximately half of the decline was due to the increase in merchandise shrink

liquidity and capital resources the following table sets forth certain measures of the company s liquidity fiscal year ended in thousands net income loss plus depreciation  amortization and restructuring charge    net cash provided by operating activities    working capital    current ratio long term debt obligations to equity ratio liquidity and sources of capital 
cash flow from operations and funds available under revolving credit facilities have typically been the company s primary sources of liquidity 
during  cash provided by operations was million  compared to million for the increased cash flow was due primarily to a decrease in inventory in  attributed to improved inventory management and reductions in the number of stores 
at february   inventory had decreased to million from million at the end of as in the previous year  the company accumulated cash balances in december and january instead of repaying the balances under its revolving credit facilities the revolver 
a temporary waiver of a covenant requiring a day paydown of the revolver between december and january was received on december  accordingly  the company ended fiscal with cash balances of approximately million and million outstanding on its revolver 
during the period subsequent to february   the company used the accumulated cash balances primarily to repay accounts payable in accordance with normal payment terms 
on a pro forma basis  assuming cash balances were used to pay down the revolver  the company was more liquid in the first quarter of fiscal  and would have had lower balances outstanding under the revolver  than in the first quarter of fiscal effective february   the company was operating under temporary waivers from its lenders relating to non compliance with certain technical covenants  including the day paydown of the revolver  the tangible net worth requirement and the debt to tangible net worth requirement 
the aggregate amount of the senior debt  totaling a maximum available amount of million  including the revolver and million in outstanding long term notes the notes ranks pari passu 
the company was required to remain fully borrowed during the temporary waiver period on all senior debt instruments pending negotiation and restructuring of the modified credit agreements 
on may  the company entered into an agreement in principle with its nine lenders to extend the maturity of the company s senior debt 
the company continues to operate under temporary waivers from its lenders until the final loan documents are completed 
the company will be required to make principal repayments on the notes aggregating a total of million through may  the maximum borrowings available on the company s revolver will be reduced in the aggregate total of million by may  final maturity of the then remaining notes of million and the then available revolver million is july  effective may   the interest rates for the revolver and the notes were increased from to and  respectively 
the revised credit agreements contain restrictive provisions governing dividends  capital expenditures and acquisitions  and modified covenants as to working capital  cash flow  consolidated tangible net worth and debt to tangible net worth to reflect the million restructuring charge recorded in cash flow from operations  continued reductions in absolute inventory levels  and reduced capital expenditures should assure that the company has ample liquidity to meet its operating requirements 
capital expenditures 
the store closings in and will continue to reduce the overall store count and total retail square footage 
during the company added new stores  totaling million square feet 
combined with stores that were closed or relocated  total retail square footage decreased on a net basis by to million square feet 
in  the average store size was greater than in past years  a trend that is expected to continue in total capital expenditures were million in  including new stores  store remodels and reconfigurations and the automation of the company s distribution center 
in fiscal  the company plans to spend approximately million  net of construction allowances  in capital expenditures 
these funds will be provided by cash flow from operations 
the company s plans include the opening of approximately new stores and approximately million for operational improvements being made to the central distribution center for the implementation of automated sortation equipment 
provision for business restructuring 
during the fourth quarter of the company undertook a comprehensive examination of store profitability and adopted a second business restructuring plan which when combined with the restructuring included closing over stores out of over stores in operation during management concluded that select retail entertainment markets had begun to reflect overcapacity of retail outlets and large discount priced electronics stores and other superstores were having an adverse impact on certain of the company s retail stores 
this resulted in the company recording a million pretax restructuring charge in  thereby increasing the loss from per share to per share 
the components of the restructuring charge included approximately million in reserves for future cash outlays and approximately million in asset writedowns 
the cash outflows will be financed from operating cash flows and liquidation of merchandise inventory from the stores identified for closure 
the timing of store closures will depend on the company s ability to negotiate reasonable lease termination agreements 
a detailed discussion and analysis of the amounts included in and charged against the restructuring reserve is set forth in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the store closings are expected to be completed over a two year period 
see business business restructuring of this annual report on form k 
to illustrate the impact of the store closings  the table below sets forth the store openings and closings over the past three fiscal years  and a preliminary forecast for the fiscal year 
the store openings in the forecast do not necessarily represent commitments  which are subject to a number of factors  including restrictions under the company s credit agreements 
fiscal year forecast total company number of stores  beginning of period openings closings number of stores  end of period the restructuring includes closing additional stores in management will continually review the opportunity to accelerate the closing of underperforming stores 
sales associated with the stores identified for future closing totaled million in management currently anticipates that pretax losses at the store level  before corporate overhead and other indirect costs  during the period of store closures will approximate to million 
because store closures will take place throughout and  the company does not currently expect to receive most of the earnings or cash flow benefits from the restructuring until fiscal years and impact of inflation 
although the company cannot accurately determine the precise effect of inflation on its operations  management does not believe inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations in the last three fiscal years 
when the cost of merchandise items has increased  the company generally has been able to pass the increase on to customers 
seasonality 
the company s business is seasonal in nature  with the highest sales and earnings occurring in the fourth fiscal quarter 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for quarterly financial highlights 
dividend policy 
the company has never paid cash dividends and does not anticipate paying cash dividends in the company s credit agreements currently prohibit the payment of cash dividends

in october   the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no

the company will comply with the disclosure requirements of sfas no
