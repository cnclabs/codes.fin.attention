the discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto on pages through and the summary consolidated data included elsewhere in this report 
overview of results in  the company reported net income of million or per common share  as compared with million or per common share in and million or per common share in net income for was favorably impacted by an increase in non interest income of thousand  or  as compared to the increase was attributable to the sale of a portion of the subsidiary bank s loan servicing portfolio that generated a net gain of thousand 
net income also increased due to an increase in interest income of million resulting from an increase in average interest earning assets combined with an increase in average yields for those assets 
the positive effect on net income derived from interest earning assets was mostly offset by a million increase in interest expense in compared to an increase in interest bearing liabilities  specifically certificates of deposit  compounded by rising interest rates was primarily responsible for the increase in interest expense 
in  net income also benefited from the nominal growth in non interest expenses of thousand  or  as compared to the nominal increase was due to a thousand  or  increase in operating expenses offset by a thousand reduction to a previously established litigation reserve and a thousand decrease in the federal deposit insurance corporation assessment 
the assessment was reduced from cents per thousand to cents per thousand on qualified deposits as a result of the bank insurance fund becoming fully capitalized 
the reduction in the assessment became effective in the second quarter of net income in increased thousand over due largely to the million increase in net interest income 
net interest income increased due largely to the increase in average interest earning assets 
the growth in interest earning assets stemmed from two large loan acquisitions amounting to million during  coupled with a million growth in the average balance of taxable investment securities 
the loan acquisitions and purchases of investment securities were funded by the acquisition of the deposit liabilities of a failed institution from the resolution trust corporation  combined with borrowings from the federal home loan bank of new york 
the increase in net interest income was partly offset by a decrease in non interest income of million in  compared to this decrease was due to a gain of million from the sale of mortgage loans in that did not reoccur in table summary of operating results net income in thousands    earnings per share return on average total assets return on average total equity dividend payout ratio average total stockholders equity to average total assets cash dividends declared on common and preferred shares to net income net interest income net interest income is the difference between the interest a company earns on its assets  principally loans and investment securities  and interest it pays on its deposits and borrowings

in addition  net interest income was positively affected by an increase in average yield on interest earning assets from in to in  an increase of basis points 
the benefits derived from the positive changes in average volume and average rate on interest earning assets were largely offset by the negative impacts of increases in average volume and average rate on interest bearing liabilities 
average interest bearing liabilities increased million  or  from levels of million 
more significantly  as illustrated in table  the basis point increase in average rate  from in to in  had a more adverse impact on net interest income 
the growth in average interest earning assets stemmed largely from increased loans  particularly  commercial mortgages 
the average balance of commercial mortgages totaled million in  compared to in  an increase of million or 
on the liability side  growth in the average balance of certificates of deposits cds was largely responsible for the thousand increase in interest paid due to volume growth 
in  the average balance of cds increased million or and the average balance of savings accounts decreased million or 
the increase in cds was the result of higher interest rates in the second half of and the first half of  increasing the popularity of cds 
rising interest rates increased the costs of the company s deposit liabilities  particularly time deposits  and was responsible for million of the increase in interest expense 
overall  the improved yields on interest earning assets  combined with the growth in average loans and investments generated a rise in interest income of million in over conversely  the increased costs of interest bearing liabilities  along with the increase in average balances  increased interest expense by million  thereby  counteracting the positive benefits derived from interest earning assets 
net interest income  on a taxable equivalent basis  totaled million in  an increase of million or over the increase was driven mostly by a million increase in average interest earning assets 
the volume increase made up million of the million total change in interest income 
taxable investment securities comprised the largest increase 
the average balance increased million in from million in and accounted for million of the variance in interest income due to volume change 
in addition  loan acquisitions of million in june and million in october  contributed to the growth in interest income 
the increase in net interest income was partially offset by the increased volume of interest bearing liabilities 
this increase resulted in a million increase in interest expense 
in  the increase in interest bearing liabilities resulted from the acquisition of million of deposit liabilities from the resolution trust corporation in february and million of advances from the federal home loan bank of new york 
these funds were used to finance the growth in loans and investments 
loan losses the provision for loan losses represents management s determination of the amount necessary to bring the allowance for losses to the level it considers adequate to reflect the risk of future losses in the loan portfolio 
factors considered in the evaluation include past loss experience  changes in the composition of nonperforming loans  the condition of borrowers facing financial pressure  the relationship of the current level of the allowance to the portfolio and to nonperforming loans  and existing economic conditions 
loan loss provisions for amounted to million representing an increase of thousand from the previous year 
in  the loan loss provision amounted to thousand  a decrease of thousand from the provision for loan losses in  and include thousand  thousand and thousand  respectively  representing the aggregate decline in the market value of real estate collateral applicable to loans whose value is dependent solely upon the value of the underlying collateral 
the increase in the loan loss provision in over mirrors the increased loan activity  in particular  commercial and financial loans and commercial real estate loans 
such loans generally carry a higher risk than do smaller residential and consumer loans

increases in non interest expenses were minimal due to expenses being offset by the settlement of a lawsuit against the banking subsidiary which resulted in a thousand reduction of a previously established litigation reserve and to a thousand decrease in the federal deposit insurance corporation assessment 
the assessment was reduced from cents per thousand to cents per thousand on qualified deposits as a result of the bank insurance fund becoming fully capitalized 
the reduction in the assessment became effective in the second quarter of non interest expenses increased thousand in over due mainly to the acquisition of a failed bank and to the additional costs of operating a banking office opened in september for an entire year

effects of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
loan portfolio total loans as of december   amounted to million  up million or over the previous year 
a promotional campaign and competitive loan rates were instrumental to the million increase in the home equity loan portfolio 
during  the company continued to meet the demand of its business customers by growing the commercial and commercial mortgage portfolios by approximately and million  respectively 
in  total loans increased million from the level 
the increase stemmed from the acquisition of commercial mortgages amounting to million and the acquisition of million of home equity loans combined with a reduction in loans from the securitization and transfer to securities available for sale of million of residential mortgages

while approximately of all loans are collateralized by real estate located in northern new jersey  the company does not have any concentration of loans in any single industry classified under the standard industrial classification code which exceeds of its total loans 
loan quality the lending activities of the company are guided by the basic lending policy established by the company s board of directors 
loans must meet the tests of a prudent loan  which include criteria regarding the character  capacity and capital of the borrower  collateral provided for the loan and prevailing economic conditions 
an independent appraisal of real property is mandatory when it is considered the primary collateral for a loan 
the company employs a full time loan review officer who evaluates the credit risk for substantially all large commercial loans 
this review process is intended to identify adverse developments in individual credits  regardless of whether such credits are also included on the watchlist discussed below and whether or not the loans are delinquent 
the loan review officer reports directly to the president of the company 
management maintains a watchlist system under which credit officers are required to provide early warning of possible deteriorations in loans 
these loans may not be delinquent currently  but may present indications of financial weakness  such as deteriorating financial ratios of the borrowers  or other concerns at an early stage to allow early implementation of responsive credit strategies 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans  restructured loans and foreclosed real estate 
foreclosed real estate  representing real estate collateral acquired by legal foreclosure procedures  is valued using independent appraisals and the company s policy is to review such appraisals annually 
the company intends to dispose of each property at or near its current valuation 
however  there can be no assurance that disposals will be made as soon as anticipated or at expected values

core deposits  which include non interest bearing demand deposits  interest bearing demand accounts  savings deposits  money market accounts and time deposits in amounts under  represented of total deposits at december   and at december  in  the company experienced a decline in savings deposits and an increase in certificates of deposit 
the shift in these deposit categories is indicative of higher interest rates during the second half of and the first half of that resulted in the increased popularity of certificates of deposit

therefore  managing the company s interest rate sensitivity is a primary objective of the company s senior management 
the company s asset liability committee alco is responsible for managing the exposure to changes in market interest rates 
alco attempts to maintain stable net interest margins by periodically evaluating the relationship between interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities 
the evaluation attempts to determine the impact on net interest margin from current and prospective changes in market interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity is determined by analyzing the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same period of time 
this difference  or sensitivity gap  provides an indication of the extent to which the company s net interest income may be affected by future changes in market interest rates 
the cumulative gap position as a percentage of total assets provides one relative measure of the company s interest rate exposure 
the cumulative gap between the company s interest rate sensitive assets and its interest rate sensitive liabilities repricing within a one year period was at december  since the cumulative gap was negative  the company has a negative gap position which  theoretically will cause its assets to reprice more slowly than its deposit liabilities 
in a declining interest rate environment  interest costs may be expected to fall faster than the interest received on earning assets  thus increasing the net interest spread 
if interest rates increase  a negative gap means that the interest received on earning assets may be expected to increase more slowly than the interest paid on the company s liabilities therefore decreasing the net interest spread 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in table 
although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
the rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market rates  while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in market rates 
in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
the ability of borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
management considers these factors when reviewing its gap position and establishing its ongoing asset liability strategy

however  there is no assurance that these balances will actually remain insensitive to interest rate changes in the future 
liquidity a fundamental component of the company s business strategy is to manage liquidity to ensure the availability of sufficient resources to meet all financial obligations and finance prospective business opportunities 
liquidity management is critical to the stability of the company 
liquidity levels over any given period of time are a product of the company s operating  financing and investing activities 
the extent of such activities are often shaped by such external factors as competition for deposits and loan demand 
traditionally  funding for the company s loans and investments is derived primarily from deposits  along with interest and principal payments on loans and investments 
the company continued to place considerable emphasis on increasing core deposits  a stable and cost effective source of funds 
at december   core deposits which represent of total deposits amounted to million and increased million or over the prior comparable year 
during  total deposits increased by million 
in  the company continued to supplement the more traditional funding sources with borrowings from the federal home loan bank of new york fhlb 
at december   total advances from the fhlb amounted to million as compared to million at december  in  loan production continued to be the company s principal investing activity 
net loans at december  amounted to million  compared to million at the end of  an increase of million or 
the company s most liquid assets are cash and due from banks and federal funds sold 
at december   the total of such assets amounted to million or of total assets compared to million or of total assets  at year end another significant liquidity source is the company s available for sale afs securities 
during december  the company reclassified certain securities between held to maturity htm and afs see note to the consolidated financial statements 
this reclassification improved the company s liquidity and interest rate sensitivity 
at december   afs securities amounted to million or of total investment securities  compared to million or of total investment securities at year end in addition to the aforementioned sources of liquidity  the company derives liquidity from various other sources  including federal funds purchased from other banks  the federal reserve discount window and sales of securities under repurchase agreements 
the bank also has a million line of credit available through its membership in the federal home loan bank of new york 
management believes that the company s sources of funds are sufficient to meet its funding requirements 
capital adequacy stockholders equity totaled million and represents of total assets at december   compared to million and of total assets at december  the million increase was primarily attributable to a million rise in retained earnings net income of million less cash dividends of million 
stockholders equity was further increased by a million net increase to the market value adjustment for securities available for sale 
these components were partially offset by a reduction of million relating to the retirement of the company s preferred stock 
guidelines issued by the federal reserve board and the fdic establish capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies and state chartered non member banks 
the guidelines establish a risk based capital framework consisting of a definition of capital consisting of tier capital  which includes common shareholders equity less certain intangibles and a supplementary component called tier ii  which includes a portion of the allowance for loan losses  and a system for assigning assets and off balance sheet items to one of the four weighted risk categories  with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing the greater risks 
an institution s risk based capital ratio is determined by dividing its qualifying capital by its risk weighted assets 
the guidelines make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking institutions  take off balance sheet items into account in assessing capital adequacy  and minimize the disincentive to holding liquid  low risk assets 
banking organizations are generally expected to operate with capital positions well above the minimum rates 
institutions with higher levels of risk  or which experience or anticipate significant growth  are also expected to operate well above minimum capital standards 
these guidelines focus principally on broad categories of credit risk  although the framework for assigning assets and off balance sheet items to risk categories does incorporate elements of transfer risk 
the risk based capital ratio does not  however  incorporate other factors that may affect a company s financial condition  such as overall interest rate exposure  liquidity  funding and market risks  the quality and level of earnings  investment or loan concentrations  the quality of loans and investments  the effectiveness of loan and investment policies and management s ability to monitor and control financial and operating risks 
in addition to the risk based guidelines discussed above  the federal reserve board and the fdic require that a bank holding company and bank which meet the regulators highest performance and operation standards and which are not contemplating or experiencing significant growth maintain a minimum leverage ratio tier i capital as a percent of quarterly average adjusted assets of 
for those financial institutions with higher levels of risk or that are experiencing or anticipating significant growth  the minimum leverage ratio will be increased
