item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations due to the successful introduction of the company s nucotn varieties that contain monsanto s bollgard technology  the company reported record sales and earnings per share despite the fact that domestic unit sales of cottonseed declined while acreage planted in cotton in the us declined from levels 
international sales of cottonseed and domestic soybean unit sales increased and  respectively 
d pl completed the formation and staffing of the technical services department which now has over full time employees compared to just a year ago 
d pl also completed the acquisition of hartz cotton  inc from monsanto in february   and completed a merger on may  in a stock exchange valued at million for the three companies that own sure grow seed  inc  known collectively as sure grow 
in the hartz transaction accounted for as a purchase  d pl issued  shares of convertible after seven years unless certain events occur series m preferred stock 
d pl issued million shares of common stock to the shareholders of the three companies that owned sure grow seed  inc  in a pooling of interests transaction 
in october   the epa completed its initial registration of the bollgard technology which is subject to expire on january   pending the epa s reevaluation of the insect resistance management plan 
both monsanto and d pl are working with additional genes as part of the resistance management strategy 
the company is also bulking up other transgenic varieties that are insect resistant and herbicide tolerant 
in addition  the company began the reorganization of its business among its key operating units including deltapine  paymaster which includes the stripper varieties acquired in and the hartz varieties acquired in  sure grow and international 
effective september   each unit will be responsible for its own sales  marketing  research and field agronomy while operations  quality assurance  administration and finance  technical services and transgenic product development will provide services to all operating units 
in december  in response to shareholder interest and to increase the company s visibility and attractiveness to a more diverse population of investors  d pl moved from nasdaq and listed its shares on the new york stock exchange 
d pl continued the implementation of its long term international strategic plans as well 
in  d pl completed the construction of two smaller  yet cost efficient delinting plants  one each in south africa and argentina which initially will be used to provide winter nursery services to northern hemisphere operations in order to accelerate the bulk up and ultimately the introduction of new products by taking advantage of the southern hemisphere growing season 
in addition  these branches will evaluate and develop the cottonseed business in their respective areas 
in  d pl terminated its agreement with its former distributor in australia and assembled its own fully staffed sales and marketing and technical services teams 
d pl employees  for the first time  sold deltapine varieties in australia for the growing season  rather than relying on its distributor 
subsequent to year end  the company sold limited quantities of seed containing monsanto s bt gene marketed as ingard tm in australia 
operating results in australia remain at unacceptable levels  and the organizational changes will add further costs to that operation in the near term 
deltapine australia cotton varieties currently under development  along with two new varieties recently introduced  must perform well to capture market share to improve operating results 
d m international  llc  is a venture formed in through which d pl and monsanto plan to introduce in combination d pl s acid delinting technology and monsanto s bollgard gene technology 
d pl is the managing member of d m international 
in november  d m international s subsidiary  d pl china pte ltd 
concluded negotiations for a joint venture with parties in hebei province  one of the major cotton producing regions in the people s republic of china 
the joint venture will be controlled by d pl china pte ltd 
the company is currently negotiating with potential venture partners in zimbabwe  brazil and columbia and is in exploratory discussions with potential partners in india  uzbekistan and argentina 
prior joint venture negotiations in turkey and egypt reached an impasse and have ceased 
export sales to mexico and greece increased significantly again in over prior year levels 
the company is working closely with monsanto developing plans to export seed containing the bollgard gene to several countries 
the international division has strengthened by adding international brand managers and technical service personnel to effectively develop the international markets that have potential for both transgenic and non transgenic seed 
over a year ago the company started a major capital improvement program to more efficiently and effectively process and handle the company s products 
that program is nearing completion and additional projects expected to cost to million in are underway 
the major projects that will be completed in fiscal include a new international and administrative office building at the company headquarters in scott  mississippi  the purchase and implementation of a fully integrated process manufacturing system that will process data for all functional areas of the company  a major computer hardware upgrade  automated packaging equipment at one location  as well as precision electronic treating equipment at three of the delinting plants 
in  spending is expected to return to about to million per year  exclusive of offshore investments which will be financed in part by d pl s technology and joint venture partners where feasible 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected income statement data of the company and restated for the sure grow merger  expressed as a percentage of net sales  for the indicated periods as restated year ended august  consolidated statement of income data net sales and licensing fees cost of sales gross margin operating expenses research and development selling general and administrative unusual charges related to acquisitions operating income interest  net other income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income dividends on preferred stock net income applicable to common shares the decline in gross margin results primarily from the method used to account for bollgard licensing fees licensed for the first time in net sales and licensing fees in  d pl s consolidated net sales and licensing fees increased to million  from sales of million 
this increase is primarily the result of bollgard licensing fees received from the first year of commercial sales of nucotn 
there was also an increase in soybean sales of and an increase in commercialization fees of million in over the million received in the effects of these positive developments were partially offset by a decrease in domestic cottonseed unit sales resulting from a reduction in the number of cotton acres planted to million from million 
in  the dynamics of the freedom to farm bill coupled with higher corn prices contributed to the decline in cotton acreage 
international sales increased to million in from million in sales in mexico  in  increased million as a result of the mexican government s favorable agricultural policy toward cotton  and the growth of its textile industry as a result of the north american free trade agreement 
in  sales in greece increased million due to the continued success of d pl s cotton varieties in the northern growing areas of that country 
sales in turkey were essentially unchanged from levels 
d pl s consolidated net sales and licensing fees increased to million in  from net sales of million 
the increase is the result of higher demand for cottonseed  the effect of which was partially offset by the decrease in corn and sorghum sales due to a shift in acreage to cotton 
the increase in cottonseed units sold was due primarily to the usda decrease in cotton acreage set aside to from the previous year  and to strong market prices for cotton fiber  both of which resulted in an increase in planted acreage to million from million 
cotton revenues also increased in due to higher commercialization fees related to herbicide tolerant cotton and licensing fees earned from contract growers who produced seed of the nucotn varieties 
soybean sales declined million due to lower average selling prices while the number of units sold was unchanged 
international sales increased to million in from million in sales in mexico and greece increased in  while sales in australia and turkey were essentially unchanged from levels 
d pl consolidated net sales and licensing fees increased to million in from million in the increase in sales is primarily the result of increased cottonseed sales and royalties 
although the usda increased the cotton acreage set aside to from the previous year  due to strong market prices for cotton  the usda statistics indicated an increase in total cotton acres planted 
gross profit d pl s consolidated gross profit increased in to million from million in this increase is primarily attributable to nucotn sales and the related bollgard licensing fees 
gross margin decreased to in from in the decline in gross margin expressed as a percentage of sales results from recording the bollgard licensing fees charged to the grower as a component of sales  net of estimated distributor and dealer commissions  coupled with recording the due to d pl s technology partner as a component of cost of sales with the residual included as gross profit 
d pl s consolidated gross profit increased in to million from million in gross margin increased to in from in the higher gross margin resulted from higher levels of cottonseed sales and fewer sales of other crops which resulted from the shift in acreage to cotton 
in addition  due to higher volumes processed  the cost of goods manufactured in decreased by from d pl s consolidated gross profit remained flat at million in from million in gross margin decreased to in from in  as a result of higher bulk seed and seed treatment costs  the effect of which was partially offset by a selling price increase 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase in research and development costs was primarily the result of the addition of the hartz research program  added technical service department costs and additional transgenic costs with the balance attributable primarily to international activities 
in  research and development expenses increased to million from million in the initial expansion of the technical services department  the addition of cotton research programs for paymaster and pima varieties  and the increased emphasis on international research activities in paraguay and australia all contributed to the overall increase in research expense 
these increased research costs were partially offset by the savings recognized through the termination of the hybrid cotton research and sorghum research programs and the closure of the san joaquin cotton research facility 
research and development expenses increased in to million from million in in  the company formed a transgenic product development team which became responsible for all transgenic planting seed development  including nucotn varieties and herbicide tolerant products 
further  the company strengthened its technical service department which gathers research data on all of its crops to be used to provide farmers agronomic data 
selling expenses selling expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to the addition of a telemarketing department and development and maintenance of a farmer database  the formation and or expansion of sales and marketing departments in australia and at paymaster and in the international division 
in  selling expenses increased to million as compared to million in this increase was primarily due to the implementation of a new sales incentive program

the increased costs are primarily related to the costs of being a publicly traded company  travel and professional fees incurred to develop international and domestic markets and additional administrative costs related to australia  mexico and turkey 
unusual charges related to acquisitions in connection with the merger with the sure grow companies and the acquisition of hartz cotton  inc  the company recorded one time charges of approximately million during fiscal for transaction costs 
these costs primarily include expenses for professional fees related to the acquisitions as well as legal costs incurred in connection with the u 
s 
department of justice s review of the sure grow transaction and are presented as unusual charges related to acquisitions on the accompanying consolidated statements of income

in addition  the company received an insurance settlement of approximately million associated with an ice storm in net income and earnings per share net income applicable to common shares increased by in to million from million in  and increased by from net income of million 
primary earnings per share were   and in  and  respectively 
the number of shares deemed outstanding for those periods increased because of additional shares issued as a result of stock options exercised pursuant to the stock option plan and additional options granted pursuant to the long term incentive plan 
liquidity and capital resources the seasonal nature of the company s business significantly impacts cash flow and working capital requirements 
the company maintains credit facilities  uses early payments by customers and uses cash from operations to fund working capital needs 
for more than years d pl has borrowed on a short term basis to meet seasonal working capital needs 
d pl purchases seed from contract growers in its first and second fiscal quarters 
seed conditioning  treating and packaging commence late in the first fiscal quarter and continue through the third fiscal quarter 
seasonal borrowings normally commence in the first fiscal quarter and peak in the third fiscal quarter 
loan repayments normally begin in the middle of the third fiscal quarter and are typically completed early in the fourth fiscal quarter 
d pl also offers distributors  dealers and farmers financial incentives to make early payments 
in fiscal  d pl received approximately million in early payments 
to the extent d pl attracts early payments from customers  bank borrowings under the credit facility are reduced 
in november  the company and a financial institution entered into a new loan agreement that replaced the existing facility 
the new agreement as did the agreement it replaced provided a base commitment of million and a seasonal commitment of million 
in march  the bank approved an additional seasonal facility of million 
in june  the base commitment was increased to million and the seasonal commitment was reduced to million to accommodate the anticipated changes in borrowings related to the acquisition of sure grow 
no changes were made to the additional seasonal facility 
the base commitment is a long term loan that may be borrowed upon at any time and is due january  both the seasonal commitment and the additional seasonal commitment are working capital loans that may be drawn upon from september through june of each fiscal year and expire january  commencing in january and in each january thereafter  the facilities are renewable for another three year term 
each commitment offers variable and fixed interest rate options and requires the company to pay facility and or commitment fees and to comply with certain financial covenants 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the and expenditures exclude acquisitions which aggregated million and million  respectively 
the increases were the result of the company continuing to facilitate growth in its traditional and transgenic seed products 
this investment strategy included the commencement in of a special million upgrade of d pl s bulk seed stabilization  storage  handling and processing facilities at three of its cottonseed plants 
in addition  a cottonseed processing plant acquired in the paymaster acquisition has been technologically upgraded 
further projects are planned for including a new fully integrated computer system  a new international and administrative office building and further expansion of facilities in australia and south africa 
management believes that capital expenditures will approximate to million in  excluding expected capital expenditures for foreign joint ventures which will be funded by cash from operations  borrowings or investments from joint venture partners  as necessary 
cash provided from operations  early payments from customers and borrowings under the loan agreement should be sufficient to meet the company s working capital needs 
risks and uncertainties from time to time  the company may publish forward looking statements relating to such matters as anticipated financial performance  business products  technical developments  new products  research and development activities and similar matters 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
in order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor  the company notes that a variety of factors could cause the company s actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the company s forward looking statements 
the risks and uncertainties that may affect the operations  performance  development and results of the company s business include the following domestic demand for d pl s seed will continue to be affected by programs of various governments  by us government export enhancement programs and  most importantly  by weather 
demand for seed is also influenced by commodity prices and the demand for a crop s end uses such as textiles  animal feed  food and raw materials for industrial use 
these factors  along with weather  influence the cost and availability of seed for subsequent seasons 
weather impacts crop yields  commodity prices and the planting decisions that farmers make regarding both original planting commitments and  when necessary  replanting levels 
further growth in profitability will depend on weather conditions  government policies in all countries where the company sells products  commodity prices  the company s ability to successfully open new international markets  the company s ability to successfully develop the texas high plains market  d pl s technology partners ability to obtain timely government approval for additional biotechnology products on which they and the company are working and the company s ability to produce sufficient commercial quantities of high quality planting seed of these products 
any delay in or inability to capitalize on these projects may affect future profitability 
due to the varying levels of agricultural and social development of the international markets in which d pl operates and because of factors within the particular international markets targeted by the company  international profitability and growth may take longer and be less stable than domestic profitability has been in the past
