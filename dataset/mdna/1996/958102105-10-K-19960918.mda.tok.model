item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview western digital operates in an extremely competitive industry which has experienced a great deal of consolidation and change over the past several years 
the industry is characterized by short product life cycles  dependence upon a limited number of suppliers for certain component parts  dependence upon highly skilled engineering and other personnel  significant expenditures for product development and recurring periods of severe price competition 
the company s product strategy for the pc market is to be the first to market in volume with the highest capacity per platter inch eide hard drives at competitive prices 
the successful implementation of this strategy during the last three fiscal years has resulted in significant increases in unit shipments of hard drives  with attendant improvements in factory utilization and manufacturing efficiencies  lower component costs and overall reductions in per unit manufacturing costs 
during the first quarter of  the company sold its multimedia business to philips semiconductors  inc later in  western digital sold its high speed fiber optic communication links and input output products businesses to vixel corporation and adaptec  inc adaptec  respectively 
these businesses represented the final elements of the company s mcp group 
concurrent with the sale of these final two businesses  the company restructured its business to focus on its primary objectives and strengths the design  manufacture and sale of hard drives 
beginning with the fourth quarter of  the company s operations were related entirely to hard drive products 
the company invested a significant amount during the year in the development of two new hard drive product lines  enterprise storage products and mobile pc products 
the company expects to begin shipping these new products in and anticipates that these products will positively impact its consolidated gross margin and operating income in unless otherwise indicated  references herein to specific years and quarters are to the company s fiscal years and fiscal quarters 
results of operations comparison of  and in  the company reported net income of million  including a one time  pre tax gain of million on the sale of its multimedia products business  compared with net income of million for and million for the decrease in net income from to occurred because of a decline in gross profit margin percentage of approximately five percentage points and an increase in operating expenses as the company invested in new storage related product lines 
the increase in net income in over resulted from a increase in revenues and higher net interest and other income 
a two percentage point decline in gross profit margin partially offset these improvements 
sales of hard drive products were  and billion in  and  respectively 
during  unit shipments increased which  combined with a modest decline in average selling prices asps  resulted in hard drive revenues increasing from although increased sales to oems during accounted for the majority of the increase in unit shipments  a year over year increase in reseller units was also a considerable factor 
during  unit shipments increased from  but declining asps reduced the to hard drive revenue growth rate to 
the revenue increase in primarily resulted from increased business with oems 
gross profit margins were as follows hard drive products microcomputer products overall the decrease in gross profit margin from to was primarily due to three factors 
first  higher capacity products were introduced at lower average selling prices as a result of competitive pricing pressures 
second  the company shipped a broader mix of hard drives during fiscal year this resulted in higher shipments of lower capacity products at lower price points  which generally have smaller gross margins 
finally  fewer microcomputer products which have higher average gross margin percentages were sold due to the sale of the mcp businesses during during  the company increased its shipments of hard drive products to oems  which typically require lower prices and a broader product mix including lower capacity hard drives in exchange for high volumes 
overall hard drive industry conditions also became more competitive during as the industry s manufacturing capacity more closely matched demand and competitors continued to shorten product development cycles 
these were the primary factors which contributed to the decline in hard drive product gross margins during the decline in microcomputer product gross margin was generally attributable to the relationship between fixed costs and the lower revenue base experienced as the non drive related products lines were divested in research and development expense r d in was approximately million  or of revenues  as compared to approximately million  or of revenues  and million  or of revenues  during and  respectively 
higher expenditures to support the development of enterprise storage and mobile products  partially offset by lower expenditures for microcomputer products  were the primary factors contributing to the million  or  increase in total r d expenses in r d expenses declined as a percentage of revenues primarily as a result of the higher revenue base in as compared to and selling  general and administrative expenses sg a were million  or of revenues  in versus million  or of revenues  and million  or of revenues  in and  respectively 
the increases in total sg a expenses were primarily the result of higher selling  marketing and other related expenses in support of higher revenue levels and higher royalty expenses 
the higher revenue base was the primary factor contributing to the decline in sg a expenses as a percentage of revenues in as compared to and interest and other income was million in interest and other income was million in versus an expense of million in the improvement from to was the result of the elimination of the company s outstanding debt in june  partially offset by lower average cash and short term investment balances 
the improvement from to was the result of significantly lower levels of outstanding debt and higher average cash and short term investment balances 
the provision for income taxes in and consists primarily of taxes associated with certain of the company s foreign subsidiaries which had taxable income 
the company s effective tax rate of recorded in and in and results primarily from the earnings of certain subsidiaries which are taxed at substantially lower tax rates as compared with united states statutory rates see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in october  the financial accounting standards board released statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
sfas provides an alternative to apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees apbo and requires additional disclosures 
sfas is effective for the company s fiscal year beginning june  the company plans to continue to account for its employee stock plans in accordance with the provisions of apbo and provide the additional disclosures required by sfas in accordingly  sfas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources at june   the company had million in cash and short term investments as compared with million at july  during  the company generated million in cash flow from operations 
cash flow from earnings net of the gain on sale of the multimedia business  depreciation and amortization  and an increase in current liabilities were partially offset by cash used to fund increased accounts receivable  inventories  prepaid expenses and other assets 
other significant uses of cash during were million for capital expenditures  which were incurred primarily to support increased production of hard drives and related components  and the acquisition of million shares of the company s common stock in the open market for million 
partially offsetting these uses of cash was million received in connection with the sale of the multimedia  high speed fiber optics communication links and input output products businesses 
the company anticipates that capital expenditures in will total approximately million and will relate to increased hard drive and media capacity and normal replacement of existing assets 
in addition  the company may purchase up to an additional million shares of its common stock under the current board of directors authorization  which expires in july the company has an million revolving credit agreement with certain financial institutions extending through april this facility is intended to meet short term working capital requirements which may arise from time to time 
the company believes that its current cash and short term investments combined with cash flow from operations and its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet its working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
however  the company s ability to sustain its favorable working capital position is dependent upon a number of factors that are discussed below under the heading certain factors affecting future operating results 
certain factors affecting future operating results the hard drive industry in which the company competes is subject to a number of risks which have affected the company s operating results in the past and could affect its future operating results 
demand for the company s hard drive products depends on the demand for the computer systems manufactured by its customers and storage upgrades to computer systems  which in turn are affected by computer system product cycles  end user demand for increased storage capacity  and prevailing economic conditions 
growth in demand for computer systems  especially in the desktop segment where the company derives a significant amount of its revenue  has historically been subject to significant fluctuations 
such fluctuations have in the past and may in the future result in deferral or cancellation of orders for the company s products 
even during periods of consistent demand  the hard drive industry has been characterized by intense competition and ongoing price erosion over the life of a given drive product  and the company expects that price erosion in the data storage industry will continue for the foreseeable future 
this competition and continuing price erosion could adversely affect the company s result of operations in any given quarter  and such adverse effect often cannot be anticipated until late in any given quarter 
the demand of hard drive customers for greater storage capacity and higher performance has led to short product life cycles that require the company to constantly develop and introduce new drive products on a cost effective and timely basis 
failure of the company to execute its strategy of achieving time to market in volume leadership with these new products  or any delay in introduction of more advanced and more cost effective products  could result in significantly lower gross margins 
the company s future is therefore dependent upon its ability to develop new products  to qualify these new products with its customers  to successfully introduce these products to the market on a timely basis  and to commence volume production to meet customer demands 
in this regard  the company s new enterprise storage products  currently under development  are expected to achieve volume production and contribute to sales beginning in the second quarter of the company s inability to successfully achieve its sales goals for its enterprise storage products would significantly impact the company s future operating results 
the company s future operating results may also be adversely affected if it is unsuccessful in marketing the inch form factor hard drive to the mobile pc market 
all of the company s hard drive products currently utilize conventional thin film inductive head technology 
the company believes that mr heads  which enable higher capacity per disk than conventional thin film inductive heads  will eventually replace thin film inductive heads as the leading recording head technology 
several of the company s major competitors incorporate mr head technology into some of their current products 
failure of the company to successfully manufacture and market products incorporating mr head technology in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company s operating results have been and may in the future be subject to significant quarterly fluctuations as a result of a number of other factors 
these factors have included the timing of orders from and shipments of products to major customers  product mix  pricing  delays in product development  introduction in production  competing technologies  variations in product cost  component availability due to single or limited sources of supply  foreign exchange fluctuations  increased competition and general economic and industry fluctuations 
the company s future operating results may also be adversely affected by an adverse judgment or settlement in the legal proceedings in which the company is currently involved see part i  item legal proceedings
