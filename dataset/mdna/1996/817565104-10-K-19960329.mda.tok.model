item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition dollars in thousands  except average sales prices and per share data the majority of the company s funeral service locations and cemeteries are managed in groups called clusters 
clusters are established primarily in metropolitan areas to take advantage of operational efficiencies  particularly the sharing of operating expenses such as service personnel  vehicles  preparation services  clerical staff and certain building facility costs 
personnel costs  the largest operating expense for the company  is the cost component most beneficially affected by clustering 
the sharing of employees  as well as the other costs mentioned  allow the company to more efficiently utilize its operating facilities due to the traditional fluctuation in the number of funeral services and cemetery interments performed in a given period 
the company s acquisitions are primarily located within existing cluster areas or create new cluster area opportunities 
the company has successfully implemented the cluster strategy in its north american  united kingdom and australian operations and is proceeding with implementation in its recently acquired french operations 
the company acquired a french funeral service company in august see note three to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has approximately clusters in north america  the united kingdom and australia  which range in size from two operations to operations

it is anticipated that the company s near term revenue growth will continue to be primarily generated from acquired operations added to existing clusters and the creation of new clusters as well as from potentially higher average sales prices from improved merchandising of funeral services and products and periodic price increases

acquisitions since the beginning of  included in existing clusters  accounted for  of the existing gross profit increase and were the primary reason for the existing cluster gross profit margin decline 
typically  acquisitions will temporarily exhibit slightly lower gross profit margins than those experienced by the company s existing locations at least until such time as these locations are assimilated into the company s cluster management strategy 
this was especially noticeable given the large number of acquired operations incorporated into existing clusters in and the gross profit margin for those funeral operations in existing clusters that were acquired before increased to in from last year due to the increased revenues discussed above without a corresponding percentage increase in personnel and other operating costs

the provision for income taxes reflected a effective tax rate for as compared to a effective tax rate in financial condition and liquidity at december  general historically  the company has funded its working capital needs and capital expenditures primarily through cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under bank revolving credit agreements and commercial paper 
funding required for the company s acquisition program has been generated through public and private offerings of debt and the issuance of equity securities supplemented by the company s revolving credit agreements and additional securities registered with the sec 
the company believes cash from operations  additional funds available under its revolving credit agreements  proceeds from offerings of securities and the other registered securities will be sufficient to continue its current acquisition program and operating policies 
at december   the company had net working capital of  and a current ratio of  compared to working capital of  and a current ratio of at december  the cash balance at december  included net proceeds from the company s december public offerings which were used in the first quarter of to repay bank debt associated with the united kingdom acquisitions 
october public offerings in october  the company issued  shares of common stock at a net offering price of per share through an underwritten public offering 
also  in october  the company issued  of notes which were also sold through an underwritten public offering 
these notes were issued in two tranches of  each with maturities in and and interest rates of and  respectively 
all of these offerings were issued pursuant to a  shelf registration from september the net proceeds of approximately  from the october offerings were used primarily to repay amounts borrowed under the company s french revolving credit agreement such borrowings had been used to purchase the french funeral service operations and the company s other existing revolving credit agreements 
revolving credit agreements the company s primary revolving credit agreement allows for borrowings of up to  one portion is a day facility that allows for borrowings of up to  which is used to primarily support commercial paper 
this facility expires june   but has provisions to be extended for day terms 
at the end of any term  the outstanding balance may be converted into a two year term loan at the company s option 
at december  there was  of commercial paper outstanding backed by this agreement 
the second portion represents a multi currency revolving credit agreement that allows borrowings of up to  including up to  each in pound sterling  canadian dollar and australian dollar 
this facility expires june   but has provisions to extend the termination date each year for day periods 
at december    was outstanding under the multi currency agreement 
in august  the company entered into a french revolving credit agreement with a day term which currently allows for borrowings up to  at december    was outstanding under this agreement 
derivatives the company enters into derivatives in the form of interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps in order to manage its mix of fixed and floating rate debt and to substantially hedge the company s net investment in foreign assets 
accordingly  movements in currency rates that impact the swaps are generally offset by a corresponding movement in the value of the underlying assets being hedged and movements in interest rates that impact the fair value of the interest rate swaps are generally offset by a corresponding movement in the value of the underlying debt being hedged 
similarly  currency movements that impact foreign interest expense due under the cross currency interest rate swaps are generally offset by a corresponding movement in the earnings of the foreign operation 
in general  interest rates are managed such that up to of the total debt excluding debt which offsets the provident loan receivable portfolio is floating rate and thus is sensitive to interest rate fluctuations 
after giving effect to the interest rate and cross currency interest rate swaps discussed more fully in notes two and seven to the company s consolidated financial statements  the company s total debt has been converted into approximately  of fixed interest rate debt at a weighted average rate of and approximately  of floating interest rate debt at a weighted average rate of 
based on short term rates at december  and the related debt or swaps outstanding subject thereto  a two percent increase in the various floating rate indices referenced in the debt and swaps would cause a  net increase in interest expense 
this impact is mitigated by the provident loan receivable portfolio which generally carries floating rates 
thus  the company s overall sensitivity to floating interest rate fluctuations on amounts owed is offset by a corresponding higher interest rate on the receivables issued by provident approximately  in receivables at december  
foreign operations the death care industries in countries where the company has foreign operations are generally stable and have had predictable cash flows 
in addition  those countries have not had highly inflationary economies 
the company believes  due to foreign currency hedges described above  that the effects of foreign currency translations have been mitigated 
sources and uses of cash cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the same period in  a decrease of  this decrease was due partially to an increase in net receivables resulting from increased sales of funeral services and cemetery products and merchandise 
additionally  cash flows relating to prearranged funeral activities decreased due to the timing of cash payments and withdrawals to and from trusts and increased cash outlays on marketing efforts 
these decreases were offset by improved operating results in cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the same period in this increase reflects the company s aggressive acquisition of funeral service locations and cemeteries 
during the year ended december    of cash was used for acquisitions 
the effect of acquisitions is detailed in note three to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition to acquisitions  capital expenditures including new construction of facilities and major improvements to existing properties  continue to require significant amounts of cash 
cash used for capital expenditures was  during the year ended december  cash flows from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the same period in during  cash inflows included  of proceeds from issuances of long term debt issued in public and private offerings and  of proceeds from issuances of company common stock compared to  of public offerings last year 
in  cash outflows included  of scheduled long term debt payments and cash dividend payments compared to  last year 
other cash outflows during included a  net decrease in borrowings under the company s revolving credit agreements 
in  the company had a net increase of  from revolving credit agreements 
see notes six and eleven to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that debt service has no adverse effect on its operations or financing activities at the current levels of debt outstanding 
as of december   the company s debt to capitalization ratio was compared to at december  the interest rate coverage ratio for the year ended december  was  compared to for the same period in this interest rate coverage level has been relatively consistent  despite higher levels of debt outstanding  for several years 
the company believes that the acquisition of funeral and cemetery operations funded with debt or company common stock is a prudent business strategy given the stable cash flow generated and the low failure rate exhibited by these types of businesses 
the company believes these acquired firms are capable of servicing the additional debt and providing a sufficient return on the company s investment 
the company expects adequate sources of funds to be available to finance its future operations and acquisitions through internally generated funds  borrowings under credit facilities and the issuance of securities 
at december   the company had approximately  and  of available borrowings under its primary and multi currency credit facilities  respectively 
in addition  as of december   the company had the ability to issue  in securities under the september shelf registration as well as  shares of common stock and a total of  of guaranteed promissory notes and convertible debentures registered with the sec under a separate shelf registration to be used exclusively for future acquisitions 
prearranged funeral services the company has a marketing program to sell prearranged funeral contracts and the funds collected are generally held in trust or are used to purchase a life insurance or annuity contract 
the principal amount of these prearranged funeral contracts will be received in cash by a company funeral service location at the time the funeral is performed 
earnings on trust funds and increasing benefits under insurance funded contracts also increase the amount of cash to be received upon performance of the funeral and are intended to cover future increases in the cost of providing a price guaranteed funeral service 
marketing costs incurred with the sale of prearranged funeral contracts are a current use of cash which is partially offset with cash retained  pursuant to state laws  from amounts trusted and certain commissions earned by the company for sales of insurance products issued by third party insurers 
the company sells prearranged funerals in most of its service markets including its foreign markets 
auxia  the company s french life insurance subsidiary  primarily sells insurance products used to fund prearranged funerals to be performed at the company s french funeral service locations 
the company believes prearrangements add stability to the funeral service industry and will stimulate future revenue growth 
prearranged funeral services fulfilled as a percent of the total north american funerals performed annually approximates and is expected to grow  thereby making the total number of funerals performed more predictable 
cremations in recent years there has been steady  gradual growth in the number of cremations that have been chosen as an alternative to traditional methods of disposal of human remains 
according to industry studies  cremations currently account for approximately of all dispositions in the united states 
the company s north american operations perform substantially more cremations than the national average 
in  slightly over of all families served by the company s north american funeral service locations selected the cremation alternative 
the company has a significant number of operating locations in florida and the west coast of north america where the cremation alternative continues to gain acceptance 
based on industry studies  the company believes that cremations account for approximately of all dispositions of human remains in australia and the united kingdom 
it is estimated that cremations account for approximately of all dispositions of human remains in france 
though a cremation typically results in less sales dollars than a traditional funeral service  the company believes that funeral operations which are predominantly cremation businesses typically have higher gross profit margin percentages than those exhibited at traditional funeral operations 
the company believes that the memorialization of cremated remains represents a source of revenue growth 
since the number of cremations is increasing  the company is emphasizing the marketing of memorialization alternatives
